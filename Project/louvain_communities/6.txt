## What to Know

* **AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF)** 
   * AFMF can be enabled for **any** DirectX® 11 and 12 title using HYPR-RX.  		
      * AFMF may introduce additional latency to games and may not  offer the optimal experience for fast-paced competitive titles. AFMF is  recommended to be combined with AMD Radeon™ Anti-Lag to reduce in-game  latency while maintaining a minimum in-game fps of 60.
      * Due to the potential latency impact of AFMF, it must be manually  enabled in the per-game settings for certain fast-paced competitive  titles, even if AFMF was already enabled globally. Gamers are free to  enable AFMF in these titles based on their preference and gameplay  style, however, they may not experience optimal performance –  specifically at lower frame rates.
      * AFMF may be enabled or disabled on the fly using the default hotkey of Alt-Shift-G.
   * AFMF currently requires the game to be played in fullscreen mode with VSYNC disabled. 		
      * For better compatibility with borderless-fullscreen titles, Windows 11 users can enable ["Optimizations for windowed games"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/optimizations-for-windowed-games-in-windows-11-3f006843-2c7e-4ed0-9a5e-f9389e535952).
      * For a better visual experience, AFMF is recommended to be used with variable refresh rate enabled.
   * Users can check AFMF’s frame generation status using AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™’s in-game overlay.
   * AFMF adds frame generation technology to boost FPS outside the  game’s engine. Users can use AMD Software Performance Metrics Overlay to  see the resulting FPS. 		
      * Support for third-party performance monitoring tools is not available at this moment.
   * For systems setup using Hybrid Graphics (such as laptops featuring  an integrated and discrete GPU), AFMF must be supported on the  displaying GPU to be activated.
   * Stay tuned for future enhancements and innovations coming to  HYPR-RX with AFMF, focusing on elevating image quality, smoothness, and  latency. Enjoy gaming with HYPR-RX.
   * **AMD Video Upscaling** 
   * AMD Video Upscaling can be enabled for most DirectX 11  applications to improve image quality. However, certain applications  such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge may require an additional step  to activate AMD Video Upscaling. 		
      * For Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, 'Media Foundation for  Clear' must be enabled. This setting can be configured in the browser  settings accessed through chrome://flags/ or edge://flags/.
   * Users have the flexibility to adjust the level of sharpness added  by AMD Video Upscaling using the slider located within the Graphics tab.
* **AMD Technical Preview Driver** 
   * Users had the opportunity to get an early look of AFMF through  the AMD Technical Preview Drivers and provide their feedback to build  and refine the feature. The feedback received through our online  communities and [AMD Bug Report Tool](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/amdbrt) helped create a more stable experience for AFMF in AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1. 
   * Users looking for updates of future AMD Technical Preview Drivers can subscribe to our newsletter [HERE](https://www.amd.com/en/forms/sign-up/gaming-software-news.html).

## Fixed Issues

* Performance drop may be observed in some DirectML workloads.
* Intermittent grey screen after driver upgrade with certain monitors (such as Nixeus NX-EDG274K) on Radeon™ RX 7000 series GPUs.
* Graphics API metric may show as N/A in certain UWP applications.
* Heavy stuttering may be experienced while playing Warframe and loading into a new area or starting a mission.
* Black artifacts may be observed in smoke effects while playing Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III.
* Black texture flickering may be observed while playing Starfield on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 5600 XT.
* Intermittent install failure may be observed when using the factory reset setting.

## Known Issues

* Deathloop may experience extended loading times on some AMD  Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 6900 XT. \[Resolution targeted  for 24.2.1\]
* Dead Space may experience an application crash after enabling RTAO on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 6800.
* Excessive stuttering may be experienced when first playing a match in Overwatch 2. \[Resolution targeted for 24.2.1\]
* Audio may intermittently become out of sync with the video when  recording from AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition using AV1 codec.  \[Resolution targeted for Q2\]
* Oculus Rift S may display with a green tint on AMD Radeon™ RX 7000 series GPUs.
* After a system reboot, Parsec host application may experience a  crash on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX.  \[Resolution targeted for 24.2.1\]
* During Microsoft Teams meetings, the camera may intermittently  display looped footage on some AMD Products, such as the AMD Ryzen™ 7  7840U Processor.

## Important Notes

* For users that game remotely with AMD Link, one important  announcement is that AMD is ending support for the AMD Link software. We  originally launched AMD Link at a time when there were few alternative  remote gaming solutions for Radeon graphics users. Today, there are many  options available for users to stream their PC content to other  devices. AMD’s role is to enable and support developers, not compete  with them. As such, we are ending support for AMD Link and focusing our  resources on other core capabilities and features that benefit users. We  will also continue to support developers with our SDKs such as the [AMD Advanced Media Framework](https://gpuopen.com/advanced-media-framework/) that allow them to enable streaming functionality within their solutions.
* For users who previously installed an AMD Software preview driver,  running AMD Cleanup Utility is recommended before installing this  driver.
* AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1 will now automatically clear  previously installed drivers located in the C:\\AMD folder to save  space.

I like the new approach, telling us when to expect for fixes.

It makes the impression that they took the software development much more seriously.
> During Microsoft Teams meetings, the camera may intermittently display looped footage on some AMD Products, such as the AMD Ryzen™ 7 7840U Processor.

Can this be a feature? I want a loop of me pretending to listen.
it's happening.
I guess someone forgot to push the publish button on this link: https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/amd-software-24-1-1-amd-fluid-motion-frames-an-updated-ui-and/ba-p/656213
Can we have HDR support please already for AMD relive -\_-
IT'S FINALLY HERE!!
Cries in RX 5700XT

Won't be able to use it
Jesus, doubled my fps on cyberpunk 7900xtx
why is AMD smartaccess video unsupported on rdna2?? seems like something that should be easy to have on a 6950xt no?
Polaris and Vega also updated to a similar build

The metrics are still broken. The adrenaline metrics sometimes report 100% gpu usage while nothing is running and task manager reports 0-3% gpu usage. This happened with the preview drivers and was fixable by going back to 23.12.1:

https://i.redd.it/b6npsaqms9ec1.gif

At first I though I had malware on my PC, but since rolling back to the December drivers fixed it, it's an adrenaline/driver problem.

It seems to happen often after exiting Cyberpunk for a few seconds.
 

I've updated to driver version 24.1.1 and I definitely have more stuttering than before, or even stuttering in games that didn't have this problem.

At first I thought it was a shader cache problem, but I realized that those stutters were much more frequent than before, I downgraded to the 23.11.1 drivers and the experience was totally smooth. Again I went back to the current ones with AFMF and the stuttering came back.

The main affected is Alan Wake 2, but also to a lesser extent Lies of P. I don't know if there will be more cases, but Alan Wake 2 is definitely affected.

I have done the tests with two different PCs and the result is identical. (6700xt and 7800xt). If you are not playing recent games, I recommend rolling back to driver 23.11.1 if you are playing Alan Wake 2.
Counter-Strike: 2 constantly has it's shader cache reset and recording the game with Instant Replay 9/10 times records the mouse cursor. Please fix.
Dang, did they remove AFMF support for Vulkan?
When I try to enable ''Video Upscaling'', nothing happens when I click on it.
Anyone with RDNA 3 who enabled Video upscale can you get me the regsitry key so I can see if force enabling video upscale on old hardware works?

I don't know what MediaFoundation for Clear is or why it's needed but it makes twitter reproduce random sounds by themselves without even being in my timeline.

Went nuts trying to find where the sound was coming from. There's also a weird "bip" sound upon loading youtube.

I understand this is browser related, probably, just sharing my experience.
I've tested **AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF)**, and it works quite well on the AMD RX 6700XT while playing Alan Wake 2 at 1440p native resolution.
So after testing AFMF in a few games today it seems like the latency/frame gen lag is much better than it was in the Beta a few months ago. I barely notice any additional latency now.
I want to see the video codec improvements benchmarked. The closer they are to Nvenc, the better.
I guess Antilag+ is never coming back? Not a single word about it from AMD yet....
Is anyone's "video upscale" not turning on for you guys? On Windows 11, 7900 XTX
There's something seriously wrong with smart access memory in this release. Another commentor said toggling it off and on fixed the stutter and I can also confirm this. Another glitched driver as per usual. C'mon amd
AFMF and codec improvements, spectacular job!
So video upscaling does not work at all in Firefox? Useless if that’s the case..
Video upscaling won't turn on for me...

7900XT
With the 23.40.01.10 preview driver I started getting some stuttering and audio crackling when switching between a 3D workload and video playback, hoping that this is fixed now. Did anyone else experience this or was it just me?

EDIT: Still getting it with the 24.1.1 release.
Seems drivers have got worse for 6000 series cards since 7000 cards have released.
Back to 23.11.1 for me 
Had to roll back, it had a near imperceptible rhythmic stutter within Tarkov, very slight but it was definitely there with 24.1.1 and not 23.12.1 - did the factory reset option upon installing 24.1.1 too.  


6900XT & 5800X3D
Installed today on my 6900 XT. Got some stutters, random hangup like audio glitches, worse performance overall, ReBar stopped working and even some videos lagged with HW acceleration on YouTube. Had to roll back to the previous drivers.
>AMD Video Upscaling – Advanced video upscale algorithm to improve video playback image quality for AMD Radeon™ RX 7000 desktop series GPUs.

So not for 6000 series? Me sad
5XXX owners left in the dust? We are supposed to still be supported, the cards are not even in legacy channel yet.

Come on AMD... you can do better than this, you was supposed to be the champion of the good ol wine GPUs.
Anyone know if this fixes the vegetation bug in Alan Wake 2?
Can't wait to try it out, compared to the Lossless Scaling Frame Gen, I wonder how it stacks up.
So far, best use cases seem to be controller games that are hard locked to 60 fps.
Too bad AFMF needs at least 60 in game FPS to look right. The only plan I had for it was to play emulated PS2/PS1 games that were locked to 30 FPS at 60 FPS. I would have had to switch away from the OpenGL renderer anyway, which for some games isn't an option for me.
Downloading. Hopefully won't need the buggy FSR3 mods anymore after this
Does AFMF work on the 6000 series mobile chips? The driver release notes say the driver works on 6000 mobile GPUs, and it definitely says it works on 6000 desktop GPUs.
I wonder if this [AMD Assistant](https://i.imgur.com/IzvylGp.png) will be a good feature. It claims that it'lll automatically turn on Hypr-RX when a game on average has less than 60 FPS, wondering if it'll be jarring or not.
Doubled FPS in Baldur's Gate 3 with AFMF, latency is actually somehow lower than with AFMF off. Using an RX 6700 XT. Went from 60 FPS to 120+FPS in the most demanding city area of the game.
So I just updated the drivers on my 6800XT, rebooted and now my PC won't turn on. Red VGA light is lit on the motherboard telling me that there's some problem with the graphics card. Can't even enter bios, goes straight into the black screen

Upd: I was able to fix it. I tried using qflash from a USB stick, got into another problem with CPU led this time, reseated my CPU, got DRAM led, reseated my ram and it finally booted. 

Don't update stuff on a perfectly working system - noted!
Factory reset is back!  🥳
So the AFMF and metrics overlay side of things are pretty badly borked. When I enable AFMF for instance in Witcher 3 the overlay gets shanked badly. The FPS metric stalls and stay in the last shown number. Frame gen lag doesn't give anything.

Then disabling of the overlay and FMF and enabling the overlay shows all the FPS metrics as N/A.

Preview drivers worked better.
Anyone else no longer able to see their CPU metrics in Adrenalin besides utilization?
 

TLDR: Try toggling SmartAccess Memory off and then back on to fix stutter.

I  have been running 23.11.1 as 23.12.1 introduced massive, unplayable  stutter to all of my games. These were not game design issues like Dead  Space or Fallen Order. These were stutters in the menus, stutters in  loading screens, and ugly, terrible stutters during gameplay.

I  tried 24.1.1 and it caused the same thing. I tested it in Lies of P,  Alan Wake 2, and Street Fighter 6. All had consistent stutter (in  gameplay and menus) that would make the games unplayable. Lies of P  actually worked great twice (randomly) but as soon as I switched to  another game, the stutters started back up. I tried going back to Lies  of P and the stutters were back.

I  tried troubleshooting by toggling Hyper RX on, toggling features off,  playing with in game settings, checking windows settings. Nothing  worked.

I then tried toggling SAM  in Adrenalin and suddenly all three games worked perfectly. NO MORE  STUTTER! The menus stopped stuttering, the game stopped stutter, the  loading screens stopped stuttering. I rebooted and the problems were  back. So I toggled SAM again, and the problems were completely gone. I  could even change settings on the fly. Clicked Hyper RX on and off while the games  were running and it wasn't freaking out. Worked like a champ, as it  should be.

I feel like I have  minimal software on here, but maybe by toggling SAM it killed an app  running in the background that was creating the stutter issue or maybe  it woke something up in the card. I tried disabling all startup apps and  the stutter issue persisted. Toggling SAM fixed it. Maybe this method  toggled something in AMD's software or my card, IDK but at least I can  have stutter free game play now... didn't have to do this with 23.11.1  though...

7900XTX.
downgraded from 24.1.1 to 23.12.1. My problems are not only the stuttering in the game, but in the whole windows. I was browsing in chrome and listening to spotify, the stutter is also happened to them. When it happened my mouse cursor is stuttering and the audio from spotify is choppy. I tried DDU but nothing happened. Hopefully the next update will fix this problem
Worst driver I have ever used on my rx6800 
I cannot play for more than  minute late of MW3 without getting a driver timeout.
Everything continues to crash. Whether it be games, discord, or OBS. At least my 7900 XTX keeps the room warm 💀
Since i update to these drivers, my Beamng Game is useless, fps locked and lags ..... i downgrade to lastest drivers....
I cannot for the life of me get AFMF to work with the preview drivers, wonder if this’ll be any better.. (7900XTX)
Anyone tested the AVC encoder? Noticeably better?
Why is frame generation being compared to actual  performance improvements? It's just generated frames.
I was hoping we woukd see something regarding the world of warcraft dx12 issues under the known issues section, but seems there's still no acknowledgement of this from AMD or blizzard
Please please can someone tell me if this driver fixed the stutter issue? I have a 6900xt. Like for games like Alan Wake 2 or most unreal engine titles?
Is AMD going to *truly* fix VRAM down-clocking at idle? My 7800XT idles with VRAM at 909 Mhz at 46W with only Adrenalin open at the Tuning page.

I only use a single 3440x1440p 165 Hz monitor over DP 1.3. I was briefly able to get VRAM to idle from adjusting some values with CRU, but installing this driver and rebooting did something to revert idle down clocking since the CRU changes are still there. Reducing my monitor's refresh rate doesn't change anything. Never had any issues with my V56...
Impossible, I reinstalled the drivers and everything and I can't activate upscale video on an rx7900xtx
I literally can't tell the difference between the upscaled and non upscaled videos on youtube.
Had a bug that caused my gpu util to go to 100% after closing a game, it fixed itself after 30s or so
Updated to the new driver and started messing around with amd fluid motion frames in cyberpunk 2077 on my 7900xtx and goddamn you can play pathtraced with everything cranked. 

Doesn't feel or look as good as nvidias frame gen but man I'm happy to be able to play cyberpunk in all its glory 🙌 

I played once with a friend's pc with a 4090, only reason I know the feel and look of nvidias Frame gen.
Enabling Fluid Motion Frames increases my GPU hotspot by an instant 10° ...WoW on lvl 7 graphics 73°, enable AMD FMF ...boom minimum 83°....is that weird ?
Adrenalin doesn't open after the update. WTF AMD? What i am supposed to do? Roll back to earlier ver.
Should I stay on 23.12.1 if I primarily play Overwatch?
Wonder what happened to antilag+

The driver turns to a white background is that normal? Things work. But it doesn't read the fps when FG is on
I've a 6900 XT and I now have a lot of issue. Fps drops, a lot of micro stutter, even with AFMF enabled... This version is a big mess for 6900 XT.
I will rollback to the last 23.x.x and wait the 24.2.1
Anyone else having issues with metrics?  
As soon as I turn on AFMF Metrics for FPS and Latency N/A and don't come back even after turning it off

These drivers artifact in dying light 2 during cutscenes with heavy smoke and light effects giving you a laser show .

GPU liquid devil 7900 XTX thermals are normal vulkan memtest gives no errors only seems to happen during smoke effects usually during cutscenes

edit: friend of mine with 7900 XTX nitro+ managed reproduce same issues i am having including issues with Radeon boost that are visible at night with big rainbow lightning in red green and blue all over the place.

Does anyone else’s driver keep crashing randomly?? It’s happened to me 4 different times. The first was when I loaded up the finals, the second was when I was playing chess, and the third was when I was running a antivirus scan. Every time the GPU has continued to run but when I turn my pc off and on again I have to play with the wires in order to get it to run. The VGA light doesn’t turn on and when I switch to integrated graphics and check device manager my GPU just doesn’t show up. This has never ever happened to me before. This is the 4th time it’s happened and tbh I kinda don’t wanna keep downloading the driver every time I start up my pc. I download it, restart the pc, and then everything is fine. Anyone else having this?
This new driver update has caused me minimal problems while playing youtube videos. I get some stuttering here and there with hardware acceleration with a unit of rx 6600.
I have tried multiple times to run this update but i lose recording and while gaming  with 24.1.1 it locks up/freezes .  I have to roll back to 23..... i use the amd software romoval tool and download the previous version.  I have done it atleast 4 times and every time the result is the same. All AMD Alienware M18 7945HX 7900M smart is turned off in the bios
I have RX6600, after the update, I heard this buzzing sound when I have video playing at the background every time I open new tab or click any links

I use the device manager rollback to revert to the previous driver, Is this save? I can't open the Adrenaline app anymore.
No more afmf for vulkan :(
First with the previous preview driver (23.40…) then with this, terrible stuttering in Dead Space Remake with 6900XT. It’s like loading shaders but much more noticeable compared to 23.30… preview driver. Every time I go to a new area, it lags for 2 seconds then FPS returns back to normal but when I move the mouse it lags again for 2 seconds. This cycle is repeated 5-6 times until it becomes playable again. Any RDNA2 and Dead Space players having the same behavior?
GIVE 5000 series the AFMF!!!
Does anyone know of any way to cap framerate when using AFMF?

like,capping the fps to 144hz.
Is it out? I thought it was coming out tomorrow.
[deleted]
im having audio hiccups in chrome ( youtube ) with this driver in my 6600xt, maybe MPO problem is back?
Welp, nice to see that after several preview drivers, AFMF still does not work on my rig even now that it's officially available.
[deleted]
Pretty getting a huge stutter that dips fps briefly anytime I turn FMF on in any game I've tested on a 7900xt and 7950x3d. It is unplayable. Happens every 5-10 seconds ish


Vsync is off and fps cap on these games is uncapped. So not sure what the deal is. Runs fine again when FMF is turned off.
Test Result on GPD Win 4 (7840u)

Mass Effect 1 (Mass Effect Legendary Edition)

-1080p All max settings

**Without AFMF**

Between 30 and 70 fps depending on scene

**With AFMF**  
Between 50 and 140 depending on scene.

This basically double framerates for me in this particular game (on the high end, and in the worst cases increased fps by about 1.6x on the low end). Framerates read with AMD Overlay. Now if only my GPD Win 4 had a 120hz screen instead of just 60hz. Oh well, still generally a better experience.

Overall experience was very smooth and no more stuttering than with AFMF off.

I also tried Starfield but no matter what I do, because Starfield does not have an exclusive fullscreen mode, I can't get AFMF to activate with that game. On average I only get 20fps in that game at 1080p with everything set to low anyways, so I wouldn't expect to see fps much above 30fps as it is. But still annoyed that Starfield is being so difficult.
[deleted]
Still no support for 5000 series?
Still no Vulkan support?
Time spy is ~8% slower with AFMF on, compared to 23.12.1, on my PC.
It's the same score with AFMF off.
Known issues mentions the possibility of green tint on Rift S for 7000 series. I can confirm it may also happen on 6000 series. 6800xt had a green and pink tint in VR display. Worked fine before the update. Moved my VR headset to PC with 3060Ti and the colors were normal. So just a driver issue it seems.
My frames in Witcher 3 Next Gen doubled with frame generation. I have RT on with FSR2 on balanced pulling 100fps with a 7800xt
well maybe with fluid motion frames i have instead 50fps like 80 in starfield but it feels even worse than without fluid motion frames enabled (6650xt)

also in cyberpunk maybe i get double fps(in amd overlay) but game has like 7fps less in benchmark and doesn't feel anything better, i thought amd improved something in fmf cuz i tried it like 3 months ago but no, still same lol
Any way to know if AFMF is working on a minimal install? 

I have both AFMF and Anti-Lag turned on in Adrenalin, however I'm unable to verify if AFMF is actually working since minimal installation has no overlay option.
Really annoying that I can't turn on video upscale because I have a second monitor hooked up. What a weird limitation.
i dont know if its just me but i have a 7900xtx and after the update i am unable to UV my GPU without my PC locking up and i have to reset it by the tower, is this a known issue?
Went from perfectly stable, to intermittent system wide crashes, to literally no video output on a Liquid Devil 7900 XTX despite hearing my monitor trying to renegotiate a signal. Can't even hit BIOS or Safe Mode. 

Give literally zero fucks about dogshit frame interpolation tech when the driver update breaks my PC.

Anyone else seeing this issue? Trying to avoid having to obliterate every other system setting on my rig to resolve this.
I have more stutters(cache rebuilding?) in games and fluid motion does not work, despite saying its been enabled and active.
Win 11, 5900x and RX 6800
FPS meter stays at N/A when fullscreen, I change it back to borderless and the fps count returns...

Tried a DDU and reinstall - lost the ryzen master integration, so I don't get to see cpu stat's anymore :'(
Anyone having this issue with the Adrenalin 24.1.1 update

I'm having this problem in Adrenalin's performance tuning.

Importing a saved custom overclock or undervolt tuning pre-set  makes the GPU unresponsive and crashes the PC. However if I apply the same pre-set by manually moving the sliders and then clicking apply it works with no issues.

I get no color in VR headset after update no matter what i try, anyone got the same?
I am using Asus Strix Advantage Edition ( RX 6800m ). According to the recommended system specs I can play the EA FC24  in 2k with Ultra settings, but I can't play the game in 1080 with medium graphics without frame drops. Can anyone help me find a solution?
The overlay doesn't show FPS anymore after this update.
Why is there no explanation what  **AMD Assistant**  does?
Anyone else having issues with adrenaline not being able to open? I right click, click to open adrenaline, it shows up in the task bar where it normally should but doesn't open. When you hover over the icon in the taskbar, it disappears and there's no trace of it in task manager.

Using ddu and reinstalling still causes the issue. But going back to 23.12.1 works perfectly fine.

Wondering if there's a fix before I report the bug.

-Windows 10

-5600xt


Update: Okay, seems to have figured it out. I didn't have the driver downloaded on my computer. So when I DDU I installed the previous driver, then updated normally and it would have issues.

Well, I decided to stop being dumb and downloaded the new driver, used DDU and then directly installed the new driver. Now adrenaline opens fine. Need to test further to make sure everything is fine.
I am finding that when I use AVC encoding in OBS, my FPS tanks to 20-30fps and my entire computer lags. Doesn't happen with x264 encoding or the previous driver.
Driver breaks nvidia remix
Hours of playtime no crashing in palworld no driver timeouts no issues.

Dying light 2 doing first blood questline RGB laser show on dx11 and dx12 with and without raytracing perhaps more with RT on.

But if i put the game on dx11 and use dxvk as if i am playing on linux, the RGB laser show is gone.

AMD please investigate and get this fixed, it happens in 2 spots of the game the fight against waltz last mission right before defeating the game, and after arena fight questline first blood during this specific cutscene when smoke spawns in.

There is a report of multiple users having this as well on steam forums.
I have a 5700 xt and the latest official bios for my msi 450 tomahawk (non-max) and in this drive release the smart access memory is no longer supported, I had it enabled on the December driver release but with this driver release it says it isn't supported....

Anyone else with RDNA 1 GPUs seeing this?
Anyone else getting frame tearing with  **AFMF** on? Pretty annoying.
Will this fix my GPU from crashing 😭
Still no Navi1 (RX 5000 Series) support for AFMF? i am really disappointed.
OK so I did an all nighter and tested these new drivers, So I got the typical shader cache stutters but the frametimes in most games has got worse and the frame pacing is all over the place. Subnautica a game that never stuttered for me started to have these frequent huge dips where the FPS would be cut by 40FPS for a brief second as the frametime spiked up to 190ms. This happened even after running around for an hour in game, if it was shader cache stutter it would have resolved itself by now. Another game I tested was Deep Rock Galactic and of course it was having these very odd huge frame dips along with a frametime spike up to 200ms with a huge momentary freeze on screen, it was very jarring and extremely noticeable even without looking at the frametime graph. 

The stuttering problems has been driving me mad making me think there was something wrong with my system, I will be going team green soon and I cant believe I tried to give red team another try
No AFMF for RX5700XT, BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Antilag plus would've been real nice for afmf
Video upscale only for 7000 series is a bummer. Hopefully they consider implementing on 6000 at least like they did AFMF
Holy shit they fixed the artifacting issue in MW3! I’m sure I’ll get shit on for it but that’s the most played game for me and that was my only issue going from a 3060ti to a 7800xt.

Frame gen looks awesome as well!
Have they explained why AFMF can't be used when duplicating your screens output?

I really hope that will be addressed.

*edit* Okay, what clown is downvoting? It's an issue that doesn't explicitly say why you _can't_ use screen duplication.
Am I the only one who feels like AFMF makes the game run and feel worse? Screen tearing and framedrops are unbearable with it enabled.
Just tried playing bf2042 and it’s unplayable with this junk driver 
I don't know ....everything seems worse, everything is lagging
Happy to see a timeline for the AV1 sync issue - currently, it's a coin toss whether my OBS AV1 recordings are usable or not. Lots of great stuff in this release, hoping for a solid 2024 software-wise.
I wanted to test the framegenerstion but now my game Mass Effect Andromeda has over 1000 FPS and my GPU is running at 100% sucking 400W.  
Ingame vsync or driver FRTC are getting ignored.  
My screen only has 144hz.  
How can I limit my fps to it?
"AFMF currently requires the game to be played in fullscreen mode with VSYNC disabled."

Game's VSYNC options? or in Adrenalin options?
Just installed 24.3.1 .  I wish the update wouldn't scramble my desktop icons !
I updated thru adrenalin check for updates on my rx 570, and after installing driver says 24.1.1. Still on website i don't see 24.1.1 for polaris yet, also no 120fps video function in the driver as well.
wait ... so does this mean I can enable FSR3 for literally any game from the adrenalin menu? or does the game have to have fsr3 as a feature in the game settings?
Resizable Bar (SAM) is not available now?
hmm trying AMFM in GW2, DX11, 6900xt

Adrenaline says to try DX11,DX12 API. Wtf.

Also weird video and audio hiccups when i have video playing in the background, some stuttering here and there.....this feels like a miss. Sorry AMD going back to the previous one, don't care to be a beta tester, especially after such a long beta test.

Problems with Opera, video and audio stutters, previous driver version worked flawlessly for me, this feels like everything is unstable.
Yet another driver release, no fixes for WoW crashing (driver timeout) in DX12. The game is literally unplayable unless you switch to DX11, which is utter garbage.
Best driver release in a while. AMD has been cookin'
Bought a 7900 XT MERC 310 with overnight delivery today after seeing the 4070 TI super benchmarks, should be here by 8:00 a.m. and I should be finishing my new AM5 build tonight. I'm coming from a i7 2600k GTX 1070 1080p 75hz build that I've had for over a decade. Also ordered myself a nice new 32-in 1440p IPS 165 hz from Dell to really feel the leap 🥴 My console friends already don't like playing Halo with me ☺️ I've been trying to convert them. I've gotten three out of five gamer friends converted so far. Sadly, my bestest friend is one of the two left.
I don't know about anyone else, but testing AFMF in TLOU1 gives me less FPS, and in Cyberpunk it just doesn't change my FPS at all. I guess it's bugged huh? **Edit:** **Found some interesting things!**

AFMF doesn't work, AT ALL, if you have MSI afterburner / RTSS running. I used it for the overlay mostly and secondly setting my max fps to 150, but even setting it to 0 (unlimited) in RTSS didn't let AFMF work until I completely closed those two programs.

Cyberpunk was weird, I don't think it was a better experience.

TLOU1 is weird too. Game only runs "okay" (for me) if I hard lock it to 60FPS, anything above that has hard judders like the characters are shaking, yes it's that weird. It did seem better though in this case, but the game even on 60fps still judders a little for me (significantly less than >60fps natively though) so that's still present a little. I would say it's an improvement and probably how I will play the game now.

You can't use AMD Chill with AFMF, I was curious to see if I could cap the maximum FPS this way so it's under my refresh range but nope. So I tried their old school method in the custom profiles FRTC and setting it to 60fps but it didn't work... until I enabled Enhanced sync? Weird! But this FIXED the game for me, kind of!

I noticed with AFMF off, the game set to uncapped FPS but being limited by FRTC to 60fps.. literally ALL the problems I had with the game were gone. MSI/RTSS at 60 couldn't eliminate them, the game set to 60 couldn't, only AMD's FRTC at 60 actually did.

...unfortunately, when I enable AFMF all those same problems come back again. Enhanced sync says it's still on and maybe it is or it isn't, but I guess AFMF also disables FRTC and that's the real problem that reintroduces these problems.

So in short, if anyone from AMD reads this. Please let AFMF respect FRTC / Enhanced Sync (Whichever is the problem, my guess is FRTC) so it can fix edge cases like this with games that refuse to get fixed properly.

**EDIT 2: It got even weirder!**

I noticed some weird ghosting in TLOU1 which led to me turning off FSR to try it, and that ghosting was still their so IDK but that judder from using a combination of FRTC, Enhanced sync & AFMF that was there before... was suddenly gone? It was being caused by FSR being turned on in the game? Now this is making me wonder about Cyberpunk...

It's harder to tell with Cyberpunk because the game already ran well, I think it might be slightly better without FSR?
Updated to this on from 23.8.2. I know when you install a new driver the shader cache gets deleted and have to be built again.

The thing is: Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which is the game I'm currently playing, took a loooong time to start, I'm talking minutes here. The first screen with the logos and stuff, before the main menu, sat there for around a minute, then the first loading screen before the actual game took another minute or so. 


─


When I was playing, basically running around Paititi, I had severe drops in framerate. I have a 6700XT and a 5800X, playing on 1080p@120hz. I was playing the game at a constant 120fps and with this driver, I had drops to the low 60s. I returned to the 23.8.2 and not only the loading time was dramatically reduced, the lowest frame drop I saw was in the low 80s when playing the game for the first time, running around in the same area



■*Heavy stuttering may be experienced while playing Warframe and loading into a new area or starting a mission.*


■*Excessive stuttering may be experienced when first playing a match in Overwatch 2.*



These bullet points makes me believe AMD is messing with the shader cache code. Whatever you guys are doing, it is getting worse from my experience.
Like always, AMD leaves out "AMD Advantage" laptops from support unless its a muxed laptop. 4000/5000 series with the iGPU enabled wont get HyerRX enabled features. Way to go AMD, Way to go!

Also 24.1.1 broke Smartshift, again. Not only does it not work (validated with HWinfo pooling the GPU TGP sensor) the new Smartshift Eco/Max do not work (shows unsupported). 

AMD, you really need to fully support your products.
 In the game, you need to use settings to achieve at least 60 fps. Once you have it, you then turn on AFMF and everything is smooth at 120 fps. But for that you need a 120 Hz monitor or bigger. It works very well for me now on Tlou. Go AMD!
WAIT, Tekken gets released for PC? holy sh
Relive clips at 120fps are niiiice.
5000 series users abandoned... =(
this is it 🤩
Very good driver the only issue im having is excessive stuttering not only on overwatch but on read dead 2 valorant etc, i will downgrade until 24.1.2 but im happy they made afmf leave the test drivers
RIP AMD link you were a good app. Mostly.
Is anyone else sick of (seemingly) all development going towards frame generation technology? I feel like I'm being sold a bill of goods. I don't like the way it looks, and I don't like the idea of adding lag in the pipeline.
Cool, another feature I'll never ever use due to increased latency. How about a feature to decrease latency, AMD? You know, anti-lag+ something something?
i wish they actually focused on polishing their drivers, especially with older games or workloads other than games than new ideas to fool your eyes into thinking you have high FPS
WORST.DRIVER.EVER
I won't forgive them locking video upscaling to rDNA 3. That's just nviding the users.  I chosed AMD with rDNA 2 since it's was more opened for users with every tech, now they locking this after anti-lag+ only for rdna3.... I guess my next GPU will be Intel ;)  


As for afmf, I didn't tried it yet, but folks on PPC (polish pc portal) say it works best with Radeon boost, which activate upon mouse movements - so in the end you won't feel that much FPS spikes. I will test that tomorrow, but man... I feel cheated with AMD now because of video upscaling.
I DDU'ed and installed this driver. Getting insane stutters in BF2042
Somebody tested the Instant Replay Cursor Bug on CS2? IS the Cursor still stucked by the Crosshair and shows up in the Replay?
Frame generation on any game running Direct X?! Excuse me?!
Still no support for AFMF on my G14 6700S 😭
driver needed more cooking in the oven. its extremely unstable compared to 23.12.1 version. overwatch is crashing with "render device lost error".

this version also effectively breaks "amd enhanced sync" in many games including overwatch, effectively locking the framerate at the monitor refresh rate once enabled.

this versions ui is also again extremely laggy compared to 23.12.1 version. rolled back to 23.12.1 version myself. i mainly recommend not installing this version until they release a 24.1.2 version of it.
For me it's frustrating that fps cap can't be used, not very tempted to install some third-party software just to cap fps. Game usually looks smoother when fps in freesync range, also save some energy...
Anyone turned on their game in particular MW3 and it was dark AF? Like saturation and contrast was fucked ? 

I was only able to fix it in global display settings, in display color enhancement and dynamic contrast on 0
Anyone know why SAM got disabled? It was working before the update... RX6750XT
Is this only if u had AMD gpu? Or if u have just the CPU too
with this new driver i can see the smoothess on my game rdr2 .cp2077 using rx6600xt afmf
Integrating AFMF to SteamVR would be nice
Anyone else get fricking stutters in games like Valorant whenever you get a kill? The instant replay keeps popping up on my screen whenever I get a kill despite having it turned off. It says “instant replay off”. It’s getting very annoying now as I’m playing in comp games… Wish I went for Nvidia
Is there any possibility to run afmf on 5700xt?
Team Red always working hard for their customers. AMD K6 2 with 8MB of Ram was first build circa 1998.  26 years later I get these Monster combinations from Advanced Micro Devices.  My pals at Intel please forgive me for staying on team Red. My wife is 💯 Intel and Nvidia so love you too.
Meanwhile at nvidia: Fixed a discord color bug
I upgraded my drivers last night to 24.1.1.  I'm very impressed with AFMF.  I'm keeping it on in Starfield.  It isn't perfect, but much better than I expected.  Bravo to the team at AMD!  Can't wait for earnings!
Currently rocking a Lenovo Legion 7 Gen 7 AMD Advantage Edition - RX 6700M version.  I am loving this laptop.
System: 7900XT/5800X3D/Alienware 34” OLED

So far testing just the 24.1.1 Driver on Avatar FoP. Alan Wake 2, RDR2 this is INSANE.

AFoP: I now gained the same FPS that I would lose switching from Quality to Ultra Quality Scaling so impressed by this new driver. Absolute WIN/WIN
Wow does not start, Diablo 2 ressurected fps drop 50% :D Good job!
Was fsr 2 just implemented for fidelityfx in this update? Or has it been there for a while?
Haven read about it yet, Just a software update right?
Ah yes, Firefox is EOL now.
Are there plans to open source AMD Link?
Lmfao NICE TRY AMD!

my fuggin 6600 is on 22.11.1 why? Because this system is heavily tuned and variables like GPU drivers are hilarious.

ok..ok. ok 

Listen, if any of u fucks can confirm the shit is stable in windows/chrome/YouTube then I'll DDU and install clean.
Can someone explain this in English please
Waiting for reviews on this. Bought a 7900xtx for under 900 new and return window closes Jan 31st. If this turns out decent I might keep it instead of returning it right now for tue 4080super.
Curious as to why no afmf support for amd 6000 gpus
I've been noticing weird performance in Warzone 3/Modern Warfare 3 - hopefully this patch does something about it. It's also been highlighted by Hardware Unboxed's most recent benchmarks with the new Nvidia super releases.

I also haven't been able to overclock my GPU in Adrenalin since the last update.

edit: just tested it and it allowed me to overclock so yay.
Is there a known number on the input lag AFMF introduces? Like how bad are we speaking?
What about Vega graphics igpu on laptops?
So I'll have to pull DDU back from the drawer then, haven't done that since the first preview driver as the updates were a literal 50/50 of breaking your very soul
Just updated and Warthunder says its an outdated driver and as such defaults to low textures with my 7900XTX. Tried with and without HyperX on and its still the same. Sigh. Unable to change to anything else.
Anyone test this with RX 580?
It's one day early. Just in case I uninstalled rivatuner statistics server RTSS, in my experience i had laggy experience with it in a previous version.
Sadly can't framegen i use eyefinity 
[deleted]
AFMF = smooth and fast af mf ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|laughing)
Why can’t I enable hardware acceleration in MS Edge with a 7900 XTX? YouTube refuses to work.
This must be dreaming, AFMF is on 700m integrated graphics!
[deleted]
ReLive broken for me in 24.1.1. no screenshots. No videos. The hotkeys do nothing and also tried the record button inside the driver gui. Also tried resetting the relive settings. Anyone else?

Update: this is fixed in 24.2.1 beta
I've used the fluid things fame on the Ally when I installed the beta driver. Shit is witchcraft I tell you.
For some reason I can’t get adrenaline to load. Seems to work in games but I need to up my mv a bit on my undervolt as I’m
Still having drops on occasion. 1100mv seems a bit too low for Warzone.
This driver and the previous one still gives me insane frame bouncing on DarkTide :(
Streaming to Youtube from the driver has been broken since May 2023, lmao. It's still broken.
War Thunder tells me I have to update my driver after installing 24.1.1.

Is this a war thunder sides problem?
Honestly I felt a boost in my performance !!!!!!  I love it new update is very smooth for me I got a RX 6800 xt by the way
Will it work on the Asus ROG ally?
I think afmf makes games look worse. I tried cyberpunk, starfield, and division 2 with graphics running 30,60,100fps without afmf. Sure turning it on increases a number, but it doesn't look any better, I think it's worse honestly. 30fps native + afmf seemed to help the most when it boosted it up to around 55-60fps but it seemed blurry with motion and studdery.

Also, did they change how chill behaves? It doesn't seem to have as good of frame pacing on the higher end now. I'm not seeing anything in the patch notes about it. 

6800xt.
I just installed, and I can't get into the driver config panel (Either on the desktop, or the in game menu.) any ideas?

&#x200B;

P.S. Gigabyte 7800 XT
They did this last year to nothing new, they been bussy driver team probably returned now working hard as always.  
They still ignoring typical driver issues tho such as the RGB laser show in dying light 2 during the first blood quest line after arena fight with RT off especially more of a RGB flicker lightshow with RT on, issue exist on many 7900 XTX gpu's
There is software for this yes.
AMD Motivational AI Technology.
Where do I find this in the settings? Asking for a friend.
Yeah, the death of amd link /s
nice flair btw
Works now.
It mentions that video upscaling only works on single display configurations which probably should've been mentioned in release notes.
I've been asking for that for years
What do you mean no hdr support? For what exactly? I'm genuinely asking. I use hdr on my montior and it seems fine with my 7900xtx
You can already either A) use the FSR3 Frame Gen mod in games that support DLSS2/FSR2 and B) you can use the equivalent to AFMF from Lossless Scaling, LSFG.
Same ;_; then again it should technically work for the 5000 series if we are vocal about it and they implement it
5600 XT here.  I don’t really play new releases and the next game that’s demanding that I’m looking forward to is the Max Payne 1/2 remake.  

Halo Infinite is getting a good amount of play in 1440p but keeps up just fine.  I’d be curious to see how much better it could be if it supported the frame gen stuff.
yeah wtf we are left in the dust already? 

We are not in legacy yet but we don't get the new features?
fs3 mods, fsr3 better than afmf anyway
If it makes you feel any better, it's honestly not that good. I'd pick fsr3+fg over afmf.
Wow first he turned water into wine, and now this???
I tried the beta driver on cyberpunk with my 7900xtx and it didn’t look very good, a lot of visual artifacts, looking forward to trying it out myself on this final version later tonight but I’m curious about your impressions on quality and what kind of settings you are running? I still had some RT effects on, 4K resolution but with FSR balanced, and it was a stuttery chunky mess with the beta driver for me
same on my 6900xt.  i can feel the input lag when i crank up the visuals and turn off fsr2, but it still looks awesome.

this is the best motion blur ever.
Yeah it's insane, with the HUB recommended settings (mostly high and most RT on) I'm getting 80-100 fps now and it's ridiculously smooth
i like the sounds of this, ill have to give it a go on my 7700xt. im just BARELY getting 60 with rt medium. And AFMF was really laggy on the beta. Heres hopin.
Is path tracing somewhat playable now? 😂
 AMD smart access video is unsupported also on my 7900xtx using Edge  Version 120.0.2210.144 (Official build) (64-bit)
They will do as NVIDIA does; first, they make it exclusive for RTX 4000 and RTX 3000. After some time, they release it for RTX 2000 as well.
It is a Notebook/Mobil Feature
It is?
Business is business.
can't be true. so many educated redditors insisted on telling me that polaris and vega support was over in december...

^^/s
as a RX 580 haver I'm glad for a new update, but I'm not really sure what did they change/add for us? 😅
I had this issue as well on my 7900xtx. I did not check with Windows Task Manager, but the GPU would go to 100%, and the frequency would stay at 3000mhz. I was testing AFMF with cyberpunk when this was happening. I reverted to 23.12.1 and it no longer occurs as you said.
Same problem with my 7900 XT, it happens to me even without starting any game, only video videos on YouTube
What GPU do you have? I am with 7900XTX, and I don't experience it.
thank god its not just me, I legit thought maybe I had a hardware issue or something. Alan Wake 2 still stutters pretty bad even on older drivers but it somehow got worse in 24.1.1. Let me know what other games that caused you to have stutter so i can test it myself and see if I get the same results.
This ones is non usable to me, any game becomes a stutter fiesta. (ps: i even tried a clean install 3 or 4 times with ddu n the cuu(amds), stutters still 100% there).  
games i tested with were MHW and ER
This needs to be higher up I thought there was something wrong with my system when battlefield stuttered like crazy even when I waited for shader caching.

AMD needs more testing before releasing these drivers ffs.
I have the gigabyte oc 7800xt, I am not having this issue. If it is a driver problem I should be having the same issue. Maybe try resetting shader cache in adrenaline, and restarting your computer. Try turning Sam off or on. Try turning Hags off or on. Do a clean  uninstall/ reinstall of AMD.
Are you disabling vsynch?
I have the oposite with a 6800XT and Fortnite. Gameplay is more fluid than previous drivers. For me, the best driver released so far.
Oh okay it is also still not fixed........OMG thats fucked up hahaha
Despite not being listed in the driver notes, AFMF is still working fine with Vulkan on 24.1.1.  Tested with Ryujinx and Yuzu, and AFMF enables just fine with the vulkan backend in both programs.
If I remember right, they had it in some preview drivers and not others. I bet they add it back in later.
Same here, 7800XT and can not enable it.

First time I click it get enabled for split second and automatically disable itself.

Than when I click nothing happen...
how to use it? is it avalible on 5600xt?
So does that work?
Same on brave
I also tried in Alan Wake 2 and I'm using the same GPU at 1440P and in game FSR at quality setting. AFMF says on, FPS number is increased but it does not feel that way. am I doing something wrong ?
Impossible, this subreddit taught me that 'fake frames' are totally unplayable and even with reflex latency is unbearable /s
I was really hoping it would be back too it had serious potential
Yep real shame. I tried in in CS2 and it made a *very* noticable difference to how the game felt. Great feature.

Unfortunately due to the potential for anti-cheat bans the driver-side solution probably isn't possible. Even though I actually believe it's a superior option to Nvidia's solution as it doesn't require any work from the game devs and means you can add support for games receiving little to no dev support, or even single player games.

A likely option is they will ask developers to intoduce it on the game side. But this will get little adoption and most will say why bother when AMD only has at most 20% market share, and even lower for actually compatible GPUs.

The other option is AMD asks the anti-cheat devs to whitelist their anti-lag+ "tampering" using some secure method. They'll probably say no as it's a potential backdoor, and even this would have little adoption due to poor market share.
Mine turns on but after testing I cannot notice a difference
Same here, won't enable no matter what I do.
7800XT and can not turn it on.
I can't turn on "video upscale" either. Win11, 7900XT
Yeah, same here. Did the thing in Chrome, it's on in the drier but I can only see very blurry video. 7800XT here. Something's not quite right.
I had to rollback to 23 v of the drivers, this one works horrible on my 6700XT, games I've played before are just a stuttering mess
So the driver improvements are only for ... using the driver to stream AVC to Twitch.

If you want to use HEVC/AV1 to stream to Youtube, these improvements are not available in OBS yet for example. So eh-meh.

EDIT: I stand corrected. I don't know enough info on the matter.
> Firefox

I cannot get it to work on firefox either
It only works on Ryzen 6000 or newer CPUs with an iGPU. So it wouldn't matter much for you anyways judging by your flair.

And yes currently it only works in Windows Media Player and Chromium.
>For Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, 'Media Foundation for  Clear' must be enabled. This setting can be configured in the browser  settings accessed through chrome://flags/ or edge://flags/.

Did you do this?
Only got upscaling working after restarting after installing the driver. The option was in the Adrenalin menu but was unresponsive until restarting.

For Chrome YouTube you go to chrome://flags/ and change Media Foundation for Clear from Default to Enabled. 

In Adrenalin go to Graphics Options and find the new Video Upscale option. If you don't know if its working crank up the sharpness and it will be apparent.

All my attempts to get video upscaling working on Firefox YouTube have been unsuccessful.
I've had audio/video playback issues (random audio/video stuttering as well as fps drops when clicking on a 2nd application maximized on a secondary monitor that isn't the primary display or when a notification pops up and goes away on the same display as the video) with 2 7900xt's since version 23.9.2. (I got one then returned it then got another)
These drivers have been a mess with my audio and video playback as well, RX 6600.
Almost like it's intentional.
yeah 6900xt shader stutters a lot in dx12/dx11 stuff with these drivers.
I was also getting those stutters in Tarkov, these drivers are really bad for me. The worst game was Battlefield 2042, what an insane stuttery mess that was. I’m also back on 23.12.1 and things are back to normal 

7900XTX/14700K
I assume AMD didn't bother to do any sort of QA for this drivers, they the worst I been served for my RX 6950 XT.

I don't remember having so many issues with my RX 500 Series, ever since I got a RX 6000 Series it has been a wild ride, with barely any support.
they can only support older GPU's for so long before it becomes outdated and too much hassle, I've been a PC gamer since 2010 this isnt anything new for AMD or Nvidia, Its time to move on to a 6000 or 7000 series already. Heck I got a 6900XT Red devil for $430 on Ebay last week in pristine condition.
It should, the latest AFMF preview driver already had a silent fix in place.
Yes, it’s fixed 👍
Not really, 60 FPS is a recommendation, not an absolute. At 50 FPS it works well. Also 60fps is easily achievable with upscaling. If someone is struggling to get 60fps even with upscalers, then upgrade to a better GPU, or drop to a resolution that your GPU can handle.
AFMF isn't an FSR3+FG replacement. It doesn't improve FPS when in high motion
It's working on my RX 6700XT. I believe it should work on the 6000 Laptop as well. After all, it's the same chip.
Think this will work for a 2k gamer with an ultrawidesceen and a 7900 XT Sapphire Pulse? Ive been capping the came at 141/142 fps, cause I heard it helps prevent small stutters and lag spikes. Not that I experienced any to begin with.  Game ran awesomely for all of act 1 and 2 on 3440 x 1440 resolution, But just like everyone else Act 3 messed that right up. But maybe if this If AFMF can fix all the act 3 optimization stuff, I'm all ears. So far Opening Task Manager, going to Details, and setting its priority to - 'high' still seems to be the the best sollution to make act 3 playable. But I've never seen this AFMF option in Adrenaline or the game video options. Is the option only available to laptop cards/users, or another certain type of card, or is it just because ive been playing in Vulkan?? Should I switch over to DX11???
Isn't it supposed to restart the PC like DDU? I checked Factory Reset and Keep Settings and the driver just updated itself with no restart at all.
Can also confirm this fixes the stutters. I'm debating if I really Wana deal with this until the next driver or just revert back. Seems super annoying to have to toggle this upon each reboot
What do you mean by toggling ? Did you turn off SAM, restart your PC and turn it on again ?
It works for me on Starfield on a Ryzen 5 5600 and RX 6700 XT, got almost double the frame rate, when i start the game it says its disabled even tho i enabled it in the AMD Software. When you are in game enable upscaling and press Alt + Shift + G, it enables it then, enable the overlay to see if its enabled (CTRL + Shift + O), there is an option called Frame Gen Lag. Frame Gen works if it says a number, my avg. number was 30 ms.
You’re probably experiencing an issue known as “user error”. Fix targeted for Q4 of 2025.
Worked for me in some games, but not all.
Dying light 2 and cyberpunk ran fine, control would crash every couple minutes tho, ghost recon Wildlands wouldn't do anything at all.... But I'm not sure what directX version it uses

Was with the preview driver and an 7900xtx
Well, no surprise. Still ain't working, the overlay will read N/A for just about everything as well even if Adrenalin is reporting that AFMF is active. Same as the preview drivers.

Tried DX11 and DX12 games ensuring they were set to full screen with V-Sync disabled.

Thanks AMD!
I play games that don't require insane fast input. Third person games where I get 120fps with afmf look smoother and feel arguably the same.
Because people don't care about *actual* performance or input latency, they just get a dopamine hit when the FPS counter at the top of the screen is a bigger number than before.
Nvidia started it.
Was crossing my fingers for some news on that also :/
RX 6950 XT here, this drivers worsened performance across the board, even outside games, avoid!
Same here but with a 7900XTX, even if I go down to a single monitor, it still won't downclock, sits at 909mhz. No difference between 144hz and 60hz. 

What's strange is before I upgraded my PC (mobo and cpu etc, same PSU/GPU), I had it idling at 15w with two monitors at 144hz. So confused.
This.
Mine at 4k/120 Is around 14w, fine. But if win HDR is on it jumps to 50w. Screensaver Is 60w, makes no sense.
I have this issue too on my 6700xt. I found 2 fixes, either lower your screen refresh rate by 1 notch or turn on freesync. Both not ideal but brings the idle down instantly to almost 0.
Not alone. But windows reports the proper values. So probably a false report by adrenaline software in specific scenarios.
Not weird. AFMF uses a shader program that is supposed to run in the normal idle time between frames resulting in higher and more consistent usage.
WoW as in World of Warcraft? How do you enable fluid frames for that? The game cant run exclusive fullscreen so my adrenaline says the feature is unsupported for that title(WoW)
What? Nooo. I was waiting the update to try it with Yuzu
Can confirm, 6800 XT here. It becomes completely unresponsive for 3-5 seconds, 4-5 times in a row, and then seems to smooth out somewhat. Well, I've waited this long for AFMF to keep playing it to smooth it out, guess I'll keep waiting lol.
I am having the same issue with a 7800 XT. I was playing on the previous WHQL version and had very little noticeable stutter at all. Now I do not know what to do... roll back? Hope it gets better?

Edit: Yeah the game is basically unplayable, I'm rolling back to 2023 driver.
Yeah something is screwed up with the shader compiling on this driver. RE Engine games are taking forever to compile shaders on 6900XT+5800X3D. DMC5 is  stuttering for 3-5 minutes and very high CPU usage during gameplay and then eventually it settles down. On older driver the shader compile shouldn't take no more than 30s. Once the shaders are compiled though everything is smooth.
some stutters can be attributed to shader compilation due to new driver but the game is known for traversal stutter. in other words, the game is really a stutter mess regardless of the GPU
Yep! If you can’t set a fos cap in game, use riva tuner. Set the cap to half of the actual frame rate you want. I.e if you set the cap to 60fps, with afmf enabled, you’ll get 120fps
It's under the smart technology tab now. But if you can't enable it at all, probably need to uninstall, reinstall. Hope you figure it out, homie!
Had the same issue. A restart fixed it for me if you haven't gotten it back yet.
That happened to me when I had any other software that wasn't AMDs own monitoring cpu, GPU temps fps. I disabled Lian lis Lconnect 3 (was monitoring GPU temps to control my case fans), disabled icue (was displaying temps on my aio LCD) and all those kinds of stutters are gone. Try taht, if you have any software overlays or monitoring stuff, close them completely.
??
There's no reason you should run AFMF in any GPU benchmark.
Same problem here, only way I can get it to work is to make the changes manually then hit apply without importing my preset.
24.2.1, spotify still stuttering, weird that it's only happened when i tried to minimize/maximize apps or dragging from apps to another apps. Downgrade to 23.12.1 solved the problem for me
Can't keep supporting their older GPUs forever.
They said rx5000 support would come after 7000 and 6000.
Turn on vsync.
Rtss (Rivatuner statistic server) is what I've been using whenever I turn afmf on, i just cap to half my wanted refresh rate
Nothing is good or bad forever for both AMD and Nvidia or even Intel.
It is, but in a new tab at the top "smart technology"
Not even mentioned once and we are almost a year with it.
Than you for rtss tip! My suspect too!
Same experience, was doing monster hunter world hunts on 23.10.2, and perfectly smooth not a hitch.

Updated to this, I went back to playing MHW, and it kept...hitching...all the time.

DDU'd back to 23.10.2, perfectly smooth again.

It's the "22.5.2" era all over again with them messing with the shader cache code. To be fair, I asked for this. But it's stinks that these broken versions are getting pushed live.
7900xt here. I didn't do excessive testing but 2042 seemed very unplayable due to stutters and the fans were spinning faster than the usual. Reverted back to the previous driver and everything is fixed.
Yeah I say above that this happened to me in Dead Space Remake as well. It is unplayable, I had to revert driver versions. They've clearly screwed something up in 24.1.1. People saying "oh it's just compilation stutter, it will go away" are 100% wrong. This never happened in 23.12.1, or if it did it was nearly imperceptible on my rig. We're talking stutters that last literally seconds in this new driver.

Correct, but there is no way to cap it in case the generated frames are above your monitor's refresh rate
Just in case you mixed things up.

For **AMD SmartAccess Video,** you probably need a CPU with iGPU for upscaling.

I am with 7900XTX + 5800X3D and I can't enable it.

For **AMD Video Upscaling** you need to go to "Graphics" tab and scroll down a bit and see if you have it.
Shader cache building
Same thing happened to me in Dead Space Remake, but it is not consistent with the previous driver version. Stutter was minor at best on fresh install, and imperceptible 99.9% of the time.

However under 24.1.1 I get massive seconds-long stutter every time I enter a room or hallway, which is almost constantly. It is unplayable. Some stutters even occur if I leave an area and return. I have DDU'd 24.1.1 and went back to 23.12.1.
You must have been living under a rock for the last few months.
Can confirm, I have a RX 6950 XT, and even just navigating on Edge I'm getting micro-stutters, reverting to previous drivers is all back to normal.

This are the worst AMD drivers I had the pleasure to use this last few years.

One more question is if they even bother to do any QA, cause I doubt this unstable mess would ever pass any form of internal testing.
We get it you having issues, but bringing NVidia into the discussion is ridiculous, I suggest you head over to the topic on NVidia reddit for the new drivers, as they facing exactly the same issues and worse (their drivers actually crashing).

So I assume is a WDDM API bug, cause both brands are facing stability issues with the new drivers.
I'm also still on 22.11.1 namely because it's the only driver that doesn't cause games to stutter.
I can confirm this are the worst drivers that have graced my RX 6950 XT, I getting micro-stutter just browsing on Edge, and all the games I been playing with December drivers, are running much worse.
4080 super is a better buy overall regardless. unless u want to not give nvidia ur money. than the situation changes.
There is AFMF support for AMD 6000 series.
Radeon Product Compatibility

AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1 is compatible with the following AMD Radeon products.

Radeon™ RX 7900/7800/7700/7600 Series Graphics
Radeon™ RX 6900/6800/6700/6600/6500/6400 Series Graphics
Radeon™ RX 5700/5600/5500/5300 Series Graphics
They better be bustin their bussy for us.
I see, I didn't even notice it back then.
Examples?
I honestly liked that feature. I liked connecting a controller to my phone and just gaming on it. Latency wasnt bad too.
Surely this means other features like AMD Noise Suppression will get focus in return, right? Right?
 thank you!
I thought that mod didn't work on AMD cards?
\+1.... i really like AMD but that got me really disappointed. didn't they say it would work all the way down to the rx590? i could be wrong but y..
only got my pc 2 years ago seems it's already ancient.
We did it Reddit!
*finewine
Anti-Lag + Fluid Motion Frames on (via driver). FSR Quality (in-game), RT Lighting & shadows (but not reflections, no path tracing). I turned down SSR. Getting 100+fps on my 6800XT with low frame times. Screen is 3440x1440. Frame times are the key thing to watch. I turned on the radeon overlay to help tune as it shows frame times.

I further turn on RT reflections, and such, and my *frame rate* is still pretty decent on paper, but the *frame times* make the game sluggish and unplayable.

The graphical issues I have are:

* Some things (ex: bushes) look bad when moving. This is due to TAA, which is hard-coded on, and it looks like crap regardless of settings. This is just how it is. No settings I've adjusted resolve this. I disabled TAA (via ini file, because there's no UI toggle), but other things tended to look worse in exchange, and paradoxically, I didn't get as much of a performance improvement with AFMF as I do with TAA on.
* Rear bumper of car ghosting with FSR 2.1. Doesn't happen with XESS instead, but I don't seem to get the same performance improvement with XESS.

On the whole, I'll likely leave all this on. If I'm nit-picking, there's lots of pros and cons, but after I was playing for a few minutes, I was able to forget I was even testing frame generation.
I noticed there was a little less fine detail in faces with it, I’m running 1440p though. Only got to fiddle with it a little before heading to work. I was just surprised to see it immediately jump from 85-90 to 160
I see a lot of people talking about it, so I benchmarked it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVJCHzLKdWE

(5800x3d 6800xt ultrawide 1440p)
Try the FSR FG mod, did wonders for me in Alan Wake 2, CP2077, and Miles Morales
Tbh the fsr 3 mod is noticeably better in my opinion. I know it has access to motion vectors, but still being able to use vsync and not have FG turn off when moving fast is very important.
what resolution and fsr?
Whats the input lag feel like!
Best of luck! Let us know
Use the FSR 3 FG mod. Much better than AFMF
7900xt at 1440p it is not
Smart access video is an encoding feature that uses a 6000+ with an igpu to speed up encoding.   

The video up scaling feature is different and works in edge when the flag is enabled and the check is enabled under graphics tab under advanced
A guy mentioned that it needs a CPU with iGPU. In case you have 5800X3d for example, then you can't enable it.
its unsupported on my RDNA 3 Card as well 7900xtx
It's fine if they actually release it for rdna 2 after, but yeah this ain't groundbreaking tech  should be doable. Is it acceptable nope is it dirty yes. The reasons they can do this stuff is because we don't lash out and give them backlash for stuff like this as customers.
[deleted]
It says Ryzen 6000 series and above. Not a word about GPU. What the heck is this.
[deleted]
A 7800xt. It even happens in games sometimes. On Cyberpunk with the fps cap I get 80% GPU usage and it jumps to 100% for a few seconds, before going back to 80% ish, without anything crazy happening in game to justify the extra GPU usage.

The same is reported in afterburner, but task manager has the correct GPU usage which is quite weird.
>thank god its not just me, I legit thought maybe I had a hardware issue or something. Alan Wake 2 still stutters pretty bad even on older drivers but it somehow got worse in 24.1.1. Let me know what other games that caused you to have stutter so i can test it myself and see if I get the same results.

I haven't tried many games, but these are:

&#x200B;

Lies of P: Similar performance, but stuttering appears with some frequency. It seems to be something related to shader cache, but before when I updated drivers it was not so intrusive. Fortunately, as you play the stutter disappears.

&#x200B;

Red Dead Redemption 2: Works the same as before.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

RE4R: Very severe stuttering in the first run, but it eventually goes away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Alan Wake 2 at the moment is the only one where the stuttering problem is more severe, in the second run it definitely improves, but it is not as stable as with the 23.11.1 drivers. There are often "spikes" in frame times resulting in a choppy experience. It also reduces as you play longer, but with previous drivers it was a much more solid experience even on the first run.
Battlefield 2042 is basically unplayable for me, I also thought maybe it was shaders, and reset the cache, but the stuttering happened the entire match, rolled back to 23.12.1 and it was smooth again. I also had small stutters in Escape from Tarkov and Fortnite, but not nearly as bad at BF2042.
>This needs to be higher up I thought there was something wrong with my system when battlefield stuttered like crazy even when I waited for shader caching.  
>  
>AMD needs more testing before releasing these drivers ffs.

Yes, there are a few games that from what I'm reading have been severely affected by stuttering.

&#x200B;

In my experience: Alan Wake 2, Assassin Creed Mirage and to a lesser extent, Lies of P.

&#x200B;

What I'm reading here: Battlefield and Dead Space are the most recurring games.
so that was a fucking lie... thanks...
Thanks man
No.
The first time, I experienced some stuttering, but after quitting the game, turning off AFMF, restarting the game, and then enabling AFMF, the game became smooth.
You have to use the amd overlay fps counter to be able to see the generated frames. Other fps overlays wont detect them.
They are for anything you do with the new codec: record, stream, replays via AVC, HEVC and AV1. OBS will likely get it a bit later, but it will be there, as said in the notes.
video upscaling has nothing to do with the CPU.  It is based on the GPU.  I have a 7900 XTX with a 5800x3D and it works in Edge for me.  It does not work in Firefox yet.
It's only on Chromium based browsers. Firefox isn't use enough anymore.
Video upscaling doesn't require an iGPU, thats Smart Access Video. A totally different feature.
Aaah, shit. Thought it was GPU. Oh well!
video upscaling has nothing to do with the CPU.  It is based on the GPU.  I have a 7900 XTX with a 5800x3D and it works in Edge for me.  It does not work in Firefox yet.
Ah didn't realise I had to do that first, thanks :)
I restarted multiple times to no avail. Still greyed out, clicking on it does nothing...
Is there any noticeable difference in quality and how is power consumption with the feature on?
 It's officially fixed on this KB release;   
[AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 23.40.02.03 for Enshrouded Release Notes | AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-23-40-02-03-enshrouded)  


That will be probably splitted on futur 24.2.1 
I simple don't have the money, there is a reason why I got just the 5500XT to begin with.

That being said sure both makers are moving forward but so far AMD have provided support before any GPU get legacy status for at least 5 years.

5XXX released in 2019, so yeah I would expect it to get new features for at least this year and bug fix support for at least 2025.
My GPU is more than capable of outputting 60+ FPS. And the emulated games I'm talking about can't even reach 50 FPS, no matter the resolution. This is because they are PlayStation 1 and 2 games locked to 30 FPS in the game engine due to technical limitations of the hardware they were developed for.

GameShark codes can sometimes be used to unlock the framerate in these games, but certain logic of the games is tied to the framerate, so it can completely change the way the game behaves (e.g. double movement speed)

Maybe AFMF can look okay with 50 FPS in-game, but I seriously doubt that using it to go from 30 FPS in-game to 60 FPS display is going to give desirable results.
I know, I just hope it's a better alternative for games that don't have a proper FSR3 implementation, since most mods I tried caused a lot of crashes
You don't need to restart, just turn it off, wait for the driver to restart and then turn it back on again.
Yeah, it never reports a number for me despite having been enabled so it's most certainly not worked with any of the preview drivers.
lol, no.
You need to disable vsync
This happened to me with my 7800xt on the preview drivers as well. The adrenaline stats always showed N/A with AFMF enabled.
Yeah I just tried this out in Robocop, and it works, but it also adds 20ms input lag.  Rather play without it.
But 50 fps ish is also notably worse than 90ish fps(duh). Its more like choosing the worse btwn low frames and high latency
It’s the same when there is a pissing contest between RTX performance vs rasterization, AMD normally has great performance per dollar but loses in raytracing, I’ve paid top dollar to use RTX and I found it underwhelming if all I care about is pushing my actual refresh as high as possible during intense scenarios, like PvP in an mmo or raid, or fps. 

Hence why I’m back to AMD the extra cost is not worth it yet, when most games don’t have RTX or fps matters more, it’s not worth the extra cash.
Tell that to people with integrated graphics or low end cards who struggle to hit 20 to 30 FPS. Sure frame generation doubles your FPS but the input lag will be atrocious.
Turning on Freesync (Premium) only adds a ton of flicker. No change in power draw.
I know. The point was, that this is a measure of the overhead, that goes into AFMF.
I must've haha. Seen some mention pre release drivers, which I most definitely don't use
Yup yup but but but

Some intial stutter is normal in certain games. Like BF1? No preload shader compilation. They do it on the fly. Bunch of ball deacons.
Oh right I meant the 680m igpus.
What's a bussy?
OBS lets you add a virtual camera of any video you want
Doubtful, and don't call me Shirley.
Why wouldn't it work
i'm almost certain AFMF relies on async compute, which rdna1 lacks. *edit- this is wrong.  rdna1 has async.*

fsr2 works on polaris.  that's what you're thinking of.
>didn't they say it would work all the way down to the rx590? 

they said that about FSR3 with FSR3 Frame Gen maybe working on it, but not recommended. FSR3 has to be implemeted in the game by the developers.

AFMF is the driver level frame gen which should work on all DX11/12 games. Originally it only worked on RX7000 and later they added support for RX6000 and 700M
but you edited in a comma so now I look dumb :(
Thanks for your in depth rely, and the frame time overlay tip
Cool! Thanks for sharing, I’m very excited to check it out 😀
I tried doing that but just got crashes, I think because it replaces a file used by some Nexus mods. Not surprised it’s better since it’s upscaling better per-frame instead of interpolating.
1440 ultrawide, fsr 2.1 balanced
Not really noticeable, forced anti-lag probably helps a bit with that. Driving and shooting feels pretty much the same as with it off.
welp thats stupid.
It is supported on my xtx, but only with Google Chrome and Windows Media Player
You need CPU that supports it as well not just GPU
Damn, you've got the powerful AMD card right now. I don't understand why it's not supported. They mentioned in the release notes that there is support for RX 7000. To be honest, based on my experience using it with my old RTX 2060 12GB, it's really not worth it. You barely see the difference.
I have a 7900XTX and 5800x3d and unsupported for me.
[deleted]
thats what he meant by "business is business".
That's just what they do. When RSR (FSR1) was added they didn't support more than 2 generations of cards, and when SAM was added they also restricted it but modded drivers enabled it & saw a performance gain.

Its just how it is
>that's dirty and filthy by amd.

No, that's business. Are you some Nvidia shill?  


Ofc it's important to return invest on RDNA3. Stop being silly.
Yes, I experience it after closing Lies of P. Weird.
I tested it again. It seems like it takes like 30 sec or little bit more, to go down to 0%. Even though windows reports 0%.
I tried again and yes game became smooth. I tried it at Cauldron Lake area that I can see 40-45 FPS. After enabling AFMF, AMD metrics says 100+ FPS however it does not feel like real 100 FPS, it feels like \~60. And I know I can not compare this with real 100 FPS but game is much smoother without any issues so far. I feel like AFMF is advanced motion blur technology and I've got no problem with that. If remedy add FSR 3 frame generation into the game everything probably going to be better.
Recording doesn't matter, that's not tweaked. This is for encoding. And nobody encodes with the driver anything except for AVC.
Also only works on single display configurations
Yikes, I will live without video upscaling then.
Right, I got that Ryzen 6000 part mixed up.

Still its only Chromium and WMP for now.
Does it work now? How does it look?
Same here. Won't enable. 7900XTX.
Yep, same here.
Same over here as well, guess they forgot to enable the thing in the UI? hopefully a quick fix is coming soon

EDIT'
Restarting adrenaline solved it for me
I tested this out with some emulators upscaling 30fps to 60fps in Wind Waker and Persona 3, while it doesn't feel like an exact clean 60fps it is much smoother than just letting the game stay at 30fps without frame generation.

AFMF generally works better at lower FPS when I'm using a controller I assume because of the smoother camera movement. I'm going to keep it on in the emulators I can use it on, upscaling games that natively hit 60fps to 120fps actually is amazing to see. I had issues with frame drops playing Red Dead Redemption on Xenia but using AFMF it smooths out the drops so well I don't even notice the fps dipping below 60 in towns.

I do hope AMD reenables Vulkan support for AFMF as now most of the emulators I was using it on just do not support DX11/12 which is odd to me considering Vulkan is an AMD thing? lol
The latest LukeFZ mod works perfectly fine on some games like Cyberpunk f.e. You can even use XeSS as upscaling with FG activated.
Seriously though, you sure you’re doing it right?

V sync needs to be disable in game, most games also need to be in full screen but not all. Free sync is also highly recommended and iirc is required. You also need to be using the AMD overlay framerate monitor.

What game(s) are you trying it on?
It was disabled, typo on my part but yeah doesn't work.. overlay completely f\*cks up and refuses to display any stats.
Wondering if it has anything to do with SAM, it seems AFMF and SAM are mutually exclusive?  


The overlay works with AFMF ON and SAM disabled but if SAM is enabled the overlay doesn't work.  


In both cases AFMF is reported to be enabled according to Adrenalin.
[deleted]
Damn right I finished God of War while just bearing 20 fps average most of the time
Nothin' much. What's a bussy with you?
boy pussy, aka a guys asshole
You're better off not knowing.
I had heard because it was just replacing the algorithm that Nvidia cards use for DLSS 3, and so you still needed an Nvidia card to recognize and run it
Async Compute has been a feature since GCN. In fact it was one of the advantages of early GCN vs Maxwell, which didn't support it natively but rather through a driver shim.
There's also a number of acceleration instructions added in RDNA3 - e.g. on small datatypes. It may be that the performance isn't as good on older architectures, or at least can't share much of the specific optimization work.

No point in releasing something that "doubles frame rate" by halving the frame rate, or not release what they have while still working on other architectures.
So its not realistic to hope for AFMF coming to the 5000s?
Sorry, someone’s gotta take the fall. Still hilarious, it’ll be our inside joke
I still got the joke so don't feel bad
When I get back home I’ll add to this thread. Lemme know what you think too. To be blunt I’m not super savvy and don’t really know what I’m doing outside of changing things and looking 😂
Woah now I’m considering making the switch to AMD
Yeah I doubt that
I hope that you don't mix **Video Upscaling** and **SmartAccess Video.**

**Video Upscaling** requires RDNA3 at the moment.

**SmartAccess Video** requires RDNA2/3 and a CPU with iGPU also.
SAV is a technology to let your iGPU and dGPU work in tandem, when encoding video. It takes two to tango.
I mean, it can't use your iGPU to transcode if you don't even have an iGPU.
Its not stupid, its just a way to utilize available hardware to the fullest. Without this feature you could either use the dGPU or the iGPU. But for this feature to make any sense you need an CPU with an iGPU. AMD only has the 7000 CPUs with iGPUs.

It´s an hardware limit, not an "AMD locks old older hardware"-issue.
7800X3D and still can't use it
So I guess Ryzen 5xxx series CPUs are not supported :/
[deleted]
It requires Ryzen 6000 and higher, for its iGPU with media encode block.
I meant the info on radeon sofware. It says '' Avaliable on AMD Advantage systems with Ryzen 6000 series and above.'' Check it out, maybe its a typo i dont know.
Well, at least I'm not crazy :D.

The weirdest part is it pushes the GPU a ton. Mine says it hits 2900+ on the core, which is my max clock limit, while in games it rarely even touches 2750mhz.
Yeah, the time it persists is about that much. I haven't seen it happen while idle yet, but I may catch it happening with more testing. On the preview driver it also happened when switching monitor setup with the win + p shortcut. Once the new setup set in, the adrenaline metrics would read 100% gpu usage for a few seconds.
Recording and streaming are both encoding, they are encoded (compressed) on a certain bitrate and are affected by this. The second sentence is simply false, people use all those formats to stream, record and replay buffer.
Is recording video not a form of encoding video?
the setting itself turns the slider instantly back off
Works now yeah after enabling it in Edge. Looks alright I guess, nothing too special in my opinion but a subtle upgrade nonetheless!
Yeah I tried it on cyberpunk, the issues I found are:
Driver timeout if you don't disable and then enable upscaling again after launching the game.
Frame gen sometimes Is enabled twice (I think), it makes a weird pop in/ghosting glitch.
Sometimes you can't disable frame gen at all.
Blue screen when closing the game with Alt+f4.
Though I'm not sure if afmf Is working properly either, cp2077 Is the only game that I tried that doesn't show a difference on afterburner, and the amd metrics just stop working on any game after enabling afmf
According to Adrenalin I am doing it right. 

Games I’ve tried: 
- Starfield 
- Horizon Zero Dawn
- LEGO Fortnite 
- Palworld 
- Baldur’s Gate 3 (DX11 mode)

In all of these games I’ve had the game set to full screen or exclusive full screen with v-sync disabled. 

My “monitor” is a LG OLED 48” (CX) which has Freesync enabled as well. (I’ve also tried turning it off) 

SAM is also enabled and in all instances but Palworld the Adrenalin software claims that framegen is enabled but there’s no framegen lag data. 

In fact, with framegen enabled all of the metrics on the overlay related to performance ie fps, frametime, 99th percentile etc. do not update and are displayed as N/A. 

If I open the Adrenalin software on a second monitor and head to the performance tab rather than relying on the overlay the same thing happens, there’s no data. 

So far I’ve found that disabling SAM will fix the overlay and will show stats for framegen suggesting that this fixes whatever issue I’m experiencing. 

Unfortunately I’m not going to disable SAM and I’ll be rolling back to the previous drivers.
It's still happening on the new driver unfortunately. N/A on FPS and FRAME GEN LAG with AFMF enabled in Cyberpunk. I can tell AFMF is working from the smoothness but the metrics can't handle it.

I do have SAM enabled.
AFMF is much more geared towards getting the most out of a high refresh rate monitor. Being able to interpolate up from 60fps is usually the sweet spot from what I’ve found. I’d also agree on the higher resolutions being better as the possible visual problems aren’t as apparent
Like….how? Can’t even play at 30fps locked anymore.
What? Is this some new young person talk?
No, you don't need an Nvidia card to mod in and use FSR3 Frame Gen. I'm currently playing Dead Space 2023 with Frame Gen on a 5700 XT.
durr.  you're right.
AFMF needs games to run over 60 fps for it to work properly, because it adds input lag. If you try to use it when running sub 60, the experience isn't great.  

It could maybe run on something like 5700 XT, but I don't know, there might be some hardware features missing. Anyway, it's probably unlikely
Now, kith
You won't regret it. The interface alone is worth the switch. Imo the 7800xt is the way to go, I say this as a 7900xt owner.
I did back when the r9 280x launched. Never looked back tbh. No issues so far if you just do a clean driver install.
Good luck with that. Did so and my very premium 6900 XT gave me nothing but black screens lmao. Never again.
ok
This really bums me out as a 6750xt user, the version of up scaling that edge uses is not that great, I'm eagerly waiting for this to arrive for Firefox and vlc.
The whole point of smart access video is to share video encoding work between a discrete and integrated GPU.

The 5800x3d doesn't have an integrated GPU. What are you expecting it to do?
ahhh.. needs an IGPU.. okay makes sense. The Video Upscaling works just fine.. just thought that was the encoding improvement they did .
Ah... That is why my 6900XT on 5800X3D can't enable it, but my 6600 on Intel 10400 can.  Why does it need an iGPU so the CPU can direct access GPU memory?

But then, on my 6900XT system, it says that it only works with "AMD APU or CPU paired with an AMD GPU". I have an AMD CPU and GPU, so per the driver hoovering over the brain looking symbol, it should work.
I think that it is just a false report in specific scenarios.
I am not sure if it is related to that, but try opening and closing metric overlay  CTRL + SHIFT + O, and see if it "fixes" it faster than just waiting.  
Either way, you can start a game with metric overlay On, then closing the game and then closing the overlay.
No, encoding is streaming. Recording is recording.

EDIT: I stand corrected. I don't know enough info on the matter.
Afterburner wont work whilst afmf is enabled, you have to use AMD overlay. Whilst in the cyberpunk game, press alt+r to bring up the AMD overlay settings, go to the cyberpunk game and switch afmf on, make sure vsync is turned off, you should see a green tick under afmf to show that it is on. But Same, in most of your cases regarding the Mod. I'm using 7800xt. The game also crashes when switching tabs. There is also ghosting with the mod. It's tolerable though.  I know it is the mod because when I disable it, the ghosting is gone. Even with afmf by itself I don't get ghosting. Also I have to disable upscaling in the settings, then restart the game to make sure the mod is turned off. I mainly use it just to give me an idea of how fsr3 will feel as opposed to visuals, because I know this will not be an issue with the proper optimised release of fsr3. Feeling wise, it feels good, ray tracing is no longer an issue for AMD imo , mainly speaking on the 7000 series. I was considering buying the 4070 ti super or even the 4080 super just for another option if I wanted to play with ray tracing on, but I don't see a reason anymore. Fsr3 frame generation is literally a game changer for AMD. Using the unoptimized mod gets me 80-100 FPS consistently at 1440p ultra settings, psycho ray tracing, so I'll just wait for fsr3 to be implemented in these games. Hopefully, AMD also brings back anti lag+, as that would make path tracing experience a little more easier. I think AMD could literally steal the show with just driver updates until the release of their next gen GPUs. The supers are a big L, so far.
Try to disable SAM and you'll see the metrics start to work.
It is young person talk that you're probably better off knowing, but the person you're replying to is just attempting an unrelated joke.
The only mod I can find says on the Nexus page that it's only for RTX cards
AFMF doesn't use any hardware that RDNA1 doesn't have, RDNA3 only has special AI cores which AMD never claimed to use and AFMF works on RDNA2 which doesn't have those cores, it obviously doesn't use RT cores either.




The 5700XT is still a strong 1440 card, 5600XT is decent for 1080p high, while 5500XT is capable of hitting 60 FPS in most titles before 2020 so it should still benefit.
If it wasn't possible on the hardware, people couldn't run a hacked driver mod to enable it.

Based on that logic the 5000 series should have no issues running it.

They wanted to roll the new feature out to the new cards, then backported them to recent cards. Eventually, it might come to 5000 series, but, there is no incentive here to double FPS on out of production hardware for them.
user error
Wondering what could've caused it. Only had AMD cards since 2015 with the r9 280x. No issues at all apart from some very minor ones.
You’re probably mixing up Smart Access Memory and Video. SAV is using the Radeon iGPU to accelerate video encoding woth your Radeon dGPU.
Yeah I don't think it's an actual problem, just a very bizarre bug. I went to try and test closing the overlay, but it didn't happen this time when I closed Cyberpunk. I'll test it more tomorrow.
I don't think that helps because it's reported the same in the actual adrenaline UI, not just the overlay, as well as Afterburner. At least it did say the same in Afterburner with the preview drivers.
I don’t think you understand what video encoding is. 

Video encoding is anything to do with turning *something* into a video - in this case, compressing frames into a video. Real-time streaming can fall into this category. So can recording video in real-time for offline viewing and/or editing. Offline video rendering also falls into this category. 

Video *de*coding is anything to do with playing back said video, real-time or not, in some cases.
You have no idea what you are talking about
Young person talk you're better off knowing? Nothing young people today say or do is worth knowing. When they find a singular cell of grey matter and learn basic English then maybe they'll begin to have something of importance to say.
It's on LukeFZ's Patreon for now
I meant that the utilization returns to normal or 0% if you open and close the metrics overlay after closing a game. Or just close the overlay if you played with overlay On.
Understood.
Possibly.
That was the fastest reply I got in 3 years lol
xd
Well… We’re well into October 
After posting this image in May… I felt obligated to post in October too!
https://www.reddit.com/r/brooklynninenine/s/C04b8Bob6X
Which opens up a scary question 

What has he been writing on his reports
this one thinks October 16th is mid-October
Can someone get this LUNATIC some rye?
When you posted it originally on May 18, was it 4pm? (Or close?) (In your time zone?)
Moments like this are a bit over the top. Like how can Jake be soo good in his job but he has no idea which month he is in? He has to sign a form or some paperwork with date every day.
you couldn't have waited a day or two?
I'm literally watching this scene as I scrolled this post :O
Somehow everyone assumes that Jake is the lunatic in this scene, while Gina is the one always casually remodeling her world as she sees fit. Don't remember anything else about the episode, but I'm fully convinced it's May outside and not October.
may 18th is my birthday :)
He should have known it was october for the halloween heist hes been planning for a year
Sarge or Amy are probably either fully writing his report for him or just fixing all the typos and not questioning it.
r/flairchecksout
Didn’t terry did his paper work quite often (like with the broken window thing
Sometimes the mind just slips. I got an email this week asking for something from May 11, but they meant October 11. This scene was all I could think of lmao.

Tbh, the only reason I remember the date is because I can look at the calendar on my computer. Back in school, I could barely remember the year, let alone the month or day. There’s too many other things to remember to have space for that info too!
The one holt had been planning for 18 months

That he would of won without Amy getting involved
True
I think terry corrected his paper work

But for the broken window thing it was probably Terry's job to sort out given he's the Sargent so any damage like that is his responsibility as Jake is his responsibility
Would have or would've.
Told the wife it's for work
Just rebuilt my 2022 zen 4 build with upgraded airflow and cooling. I use it mainly for CAD and BIM, and spreading managed democracy in the evenings. 

7700x / Red Devil 7900xtx / Aorus B650m / Gskill 6000mt 4 dimms / Seasonic Focus 1000w / Lian Li 216.
Looks like it's for work to me 👍🏼

Great looking build 🔥👌🏽
216 is goated, absolutely amazing airflow case
It’ll send an email or two 👍🏼.
Lian Li 216 is amazing. Mine runs very cool with an i5-13600KF and RX 7900 XT. Bottom intake fans really help with GPU temperature.
bros got the best work rig ever, gonna be getting mad fps on ms word
redditors without mentioning hobby without their wife = impossible
This is the type of rig I'd use for some online college classes.

![gif](giphy|wrBURfbZmqqXu)
Ah classic, told my accountant the same.
Thank god it's not another O11 build. Looks great
Any stability issues with the 4/dimms running at 6000?

Looks beautiful.
Ah yes, the "work interface device" laying on the table in pic #1 was a dead give away...
What a beauty of a build
👌👌👌
The build looks awesome. Hopefully my CAD and 3D modeling rig looks as good some day. 

But the biggest take away is that Arctic updated their liquid cooler. Might need to try it when my Cryorig A40 ultimate dies.
That's a fantastic looking machine.

I have a 7900xtx I have never ran a game on. It's purely used for work (machine learning). So work is right heh.
You really did not need the LFIII 360 💀
Great setup. But please dont lie to your wife. It will break her trust towards you if she finds out. Just be honest and tell her its for your hobby.
Looks great. But I have a question. I've only built 2 computers so I have limited experience. But the bottom fans seem to be blowing air in to the case. Wouldn't you want them to be blowing out?  I would thing you would get excessive dust built up inside this way.
Putting in work in the WarZone
it looks so clean, i love it!

how's the dust management in that case?
Blue is for work, red is for more fps, obviously.
Do you need that controller for excel and PowerPoint? 


Clean build, have fun sir!
What is the blue rgb color code? I’ve been trying to get that color but i can’t seem to recreate it.
[removed]
Looks great!

How does AMD do with BIM? Do you run Navisworks/Revit okay?
Considering this case for my build, how's the noise levels of it? Gonna have a 360mm AIO from Arctic as well, but with a 7900x and a 7900xt
How do i change the RGB colors of the arctic radiator
Think the gamepad may give the game away
Ah man, I have the same case and have been thinking about filling it with fans and now I see how it looks and how could I not follow your lead! Are you using any fan splitters for your set up? I got the older 216 that didn't come with the fan/rgb hub.
How many gb's of ram is that? Also why not 7800x3d and cheaper mobo?
I recently upgraded to a 7900XT Red Devil for work. Excel is really taxing on my GPU.
Xbox controller sat next to it does a great job convincing her I bet 😂

Nice looking build.
Love the build it's looking good! Just recently sprung for a 7900 xtx as well. I have a question for you, have you had any weird FPS issues with your build?
Nice case! I have the same one, and it's amazing for cooling. Best I've had so far.
Holy shit your pc is gorgeous
Nice build it looks very well thought out and I also like the use of that cooler
I have the red devil 7800xt love it so far
Don’t work hard, work smart :)
Are those stock case fans? Love that colour dude! Any tips?
I just forced my husband (I am said wife) to build a better PC. He needs it.
Well played, OP, and yes, it's absolutely for work (wink).
Try running Minecraft on it. You'll also be convinced it's just for work.
Good.
The case i need. Not too many cases have usbs on that part or side. TT is a close second for my next build
It is work hard play harder
Workin on slaying noobs
The lian li 216 has no right looking that good
I mean you can use it for work
Very professional
Looks professional. Clearly made for work 😁
I mean, me too if i don’t game daily, i’m not going to work anymore! Yours is not a lie.
I got the same GPU/CPU combo :). How's your experience with the 7900xtx so far?
-For Work-

-Xbox Controller in the first photo-

Me too 😭
[deleted]
Definitly is, there is no cd-drive for games!
Wow ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
Yo this arctic cooler looks SICK
Hey, sometimes you just need to play games a bit, right? Maybe your wife will get it! At least it's good for multitasking - like playing Solitaire while you're also opening Notepad!

Nice setup!
What fans are those they look nice.
I like the kind of smooth surfaces of everything no real reflections
Nice Workstation! This things' a beast in Excel! Also good you thought about the GPU for accelerated math operations!
Man thats the case i wanted but it was always out of stock back then. Went with the more expensive lancool3 but its certainly a little too much for me tbh.
Hey man when you’re spreading democracy the means justify the ends.
That old trick!!! lol Nice case...BTW and tidy looking build... The PC master race approves...
Well, I don't get why somebody would have to 'explain' their hobby expenses to the wife?
Damn i love that case, terrific build.
Can confirm, have the same employer /s
🤣🤣🤣
Sexy
Wife here. You SOB. No sex for a month now.
haha women amirite fellas?
wow so beautiful
Looks work worthy to me. The more RGB the more productivity you can accomplish.
Ah yes, I never forget my Xbox controller in the meetings...
Wife is not gonna suspect anything fr if it's for work.
Yeah it is work, i too do not disclose the costs of the parts, my most recent 4070TI Super was only 650 Euro or so, but that is more than 2 monthly salaries locally and the thought of spending that much money for just 1 computer part is impossible to explain.

So i have to make up some numbers and make it seem acceptable.
zamn, hell of a workstation
that blue is beautiful
Then you see the xbox controller
Yeah, working on that master rank.
I call that work every day! ;)
Same thing tell my wife. 60% of the time, it works every time ;D
Is it OK for them aio hoses to lay on the gpu like that ?
it's so sad seeing grown men either joke or actually lie to their wife to do the things they want


nice pc tho I have the same case
It is for work.
I can do Excel...

...but harder.
I'm sure glad I don't have to lie to my wife about anything.
For the democracy!
Yeah, "work".

I'm working to be a better player :D
Ha!
Totally for work. If you work in the lighting industry. 😝
Spreading Democracy is Hard work, and very important!
4k 360fps Microsoft word. Oh yeah
Whats everyone's obsession with lian li? I dont get it... please explain.
Essential for all those large models.
THEY'LL NEVER THREATEN OUR VALUES
how well this GPU helps to spread Managed democracy?
Pretty solid workstation! My wife is also surprised every time I find a brand new €50 graphics card and the processor my friend gave me because he doesn't need it :)
sure. work. and games. also games
anything that engages you is a job
That's a beauty
No that’s very nice well done.

LiLi’s are nice to work with
Apparently thr G in your Gskill ram stands for Gaslighting Skills
idk man, you might be able to barely get through those Excel sheets
And if she ask why there are so many lights inside it then tell her so that you can work in dark 😂
![gif](giphy|MqxZxTlvcY5BS)

"Work"
Arasaka pc
Looks like it is working so you’re not lying to her 🤷🏼‍♂️
Great build, man. I hope your wife believed you, mine did. :D

BTW, for this color palette you missed a great chance to use the Hellhound Version. It would've look great!

Anyway, enjoy the 4K gaming! <3
Amazing build! Congrats! Hope you enjoy it!
Yep can verify, needed for excel sheets👍
Had the same case. It’s one the best. 
Good looking build
Can I work with you?
This is definitely what's needed to run excel.
Some great working
I'm sure that there's no work task it can't do.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
I'm getting that case, ASAP.
Lol
That looks so damn clean and stealthy.
Set wallpaper 
Nobody wants to work
Yeah Lian-Li do a good job on that build!
You getting your rated speeds with 4 dimms?
Ah.. I envy your "work"..
Men are born to lie. As a kid it would be for homework, as an adult it’s for work, as an elderly I dunno, perhaps to keep in touch with your kids.
Definitely for work. Can't get shiz done while waiting for frames.
Love the color combo of red and blue
Actually gaming PCs are AMAZING for normal work tasks
h0ws the 4 dimm kit working?
With those RGB lights, i would have gone with a sleeper build or atleast with something that doesn't have RGB lights to make sure wifey doesn't suspect anything at all
nice
I would say the same
very cool colors
Office work is very demanding these days even Microsoft office requires a 4090
Your telling the tax man that also right
for work ..... yeah..... 

and there it is, laughing - Xbox gaming controller

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
I just got a Strix B650E-F , 7700X and a PowerColor HellHound 7900xt and have been looking for a case to call home for it. I've always liked how this case looks. Will it fit a IceGiant ProSiphon cooler if not I have a Corsair H150i Elite aio I can use. Is it worth it?
I have no idea what that is but I want one!
As long as the company colors are blue you may get away with it
I can crush spreadsheets with this rig
It sure means business....you can definitely work excel spreadsheets in this.
Just waiting on my 7 7700 but i’m building my first rig in the 216 got a 7800xt hellhound white edition
https://i.redd.it/4kvh62k7upuc1.gif
That’s awesome bro haha
Ms Excel gonna excel on this 😜
This fire
What was her reaction?
What's that gpu cable you're using? It's super clean.
[removed]
Great job Helldiver!
Looks nice! Very clean. I also run a 7700x but with a Red Dragon 6800xt. 
Would you recommend and upgrade to the 7900xtx or would it be to much for the 7700x?
She’s a beaut
Sir, your work requires LED lights to illuminate the solutions to critical problems. I don't understand what's wrong with telling this truth.
Better computer = faster load times = more efficient work. You can see every frame of your excel spreadsheet in 165hz
Is she European?😂
I’d tell that to the tax office as well 👌🏼
What are the fanes that you use for the exhaust and aio?
It sure is hard work spreading democracy!!! Nice build
You won't get anywhere near consuming 1000 W.
Made my pecker hard
,🤜🤛
Happy Cake day!
Not gonna lie, I'm a sucker for thicc front panel fans.
Totally agree. I switched from a case with a closed front panel and my 5800x3D CPU temps went from 85 C down to 65 C. And that's just with the fans that came with the case. I expected an improvement of maybe 5-10 C. 

I just wish it looked a tad bit cleaner, but that's a compromise I'm willing to make.
At least. That AIO really sends it
I opted to blast my GPU with 2 140mm fans on the bottom. Did the trick.
Yo I have the exact same build as you 13600kf and 7900 xt
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yeah it’s kinda pathetic
I'm gonna try to write this off with Uncle Sam. Wish me luck.
This man businesses.
Cheers!
011 case is amazing. Easy to work in.
OMG yes. I had to drop the timing to 38. I might be able to drop it further, need to experiment some more.
😳
What?   You don’t use a controller to do cad?   😉
Thanks bud!
I'm curious why both of you went to AMD for work and ML?. For gaming, I understand, but Nvidia crushes and is for professional applications
I used to think that by going with AK620, but I consistently saw 200~ 300 mhz thermal throttle during heavy work loads. 

The LF III was bought on Amazon for $107, it's actually more cost effective than a premium air cooler that won't perform nearly as good.
Thanks bud, don't worry it's a lighthearted jest. I do actually work on 3D modeling on my workstation. She also knows I'm a big gamer lol
Reasonable question. The power hungry GPU needs all the fresh air can get. Also, by adding multiple intakes I'm creating a positive pressure inside the case which will help keep the dust out.
More airflow will always equate to more dust. But it will also equate to lower temperatures. 2 intake fans and 6 exhaust fans wouldn't make much sense. 4 intake and 4 exhaust creates a nice flow of cool air across both the GPU and CPU heatsinks. Just dust every few weeks if you're paranoid about it. But PCs go YEARS without dusting in offices, registers, ATMs, etc. And rarely have serious issues because of it. It's not an issue if you're maintaining it.
No buddy, hot air rises and the cold air helps with temps and keep the air flow moving towards the top and rear of the case.
Putting in my 9~5 🎧🎮🕹️
The perforated panels do their job, but expect slow accumulation over time. It's worth it for the airflow performance imo.
Not OP, but I built my [first PC](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/92wJRK) in the same case 6 months ago and it's been wonderful and rock solid ever since. Other than the many perks that Lian Li engineered into the 216, the dust management on this case is fairly excellent from my experience.  


The ultrafine mesh on the front panel does the filtering fairly well while not compromising airflow. There's an add-on dust filter that you can buy on AliExpress for this case but I don't think you'll need it unless you live in a dust-heavy place. On top of that, the case looks phenomenal too!  


https://i.redd.it/2ad8hp2gp3tc1.gif
It's pretty good. Mine's on a carpeted floor with 2x140 bottom intake alongside the stock front fans and the extra dust filter.

Only downside: Unfortunately, because of the bottom intake, that's where most of the dust comes in. If I had a way to make the side panel strip's mesh finer (or have some kind of stretchy fabric cover for it), it'd be perfect.

YMMV
Dunkng 500kg bombs on bugs is cozy AF
It runs nicely. I can navigate complex multi-linked models that would cripple the office workstation, and the 64gb memory helps as well. One of the reasons I chose the 7700x is because I wanted those higher clocks for Autodesk and Adobe programs.
It's quiet, because I can game at 40% case fan speed and still keep the 7900xtx at bay. The Arctic LF iii is excellent, especially at current sale prices.
The AIO LED wire can be daisy chained with the other RGB cables in your system, or connect it by itself to a separate LED header on motherboard / LED controller. You control the color via motherboard RGB software or by hardware control if you connect it to a LED controller.
I totally need that brick-sized video adapter for work
The Arctic fans come wired with splitter cables. I'm also taking advantage of the LED / fan hub. One note on the bottom mount for the P14 fans, because the Arctic are a bit thicker than typical fans, I had to use radiator screws to mount them.
It's 64gb. I've had the 7700x since 2022, before the 3d chips. I'm gonna hold off on upgrading until the next generation of chips.
Nothing out of the ordinary. What sort of FPS issue do you have?
The front 160mm fans are stock, the rest are Arctic P14argb and P12 argb(from the AIO). I try to avoid mixing and matching fans from different manufacturers for aesthetics (especially RGB color, you can tell my front fans are slightly different in color from the rest).
I can see why he married you!
Hopefully she doesn't ask too many questions about the red thing in the middle.
Especially with minimal tube swivel and atrocious amd mounting system. I had to loosen the bracket to get the damn thing threaded, "equal" pressure be damned
Arctic P14 ARGB
Lancool 3's definitely the premium case with QoL upgrades over the 216. Don't think you did wrong there.

Before 7800x3d the 7700x was one of the fastest gaming CPUs out there because of the high clocks and single CCD design. 

The 7700x is more than adequate for xtx. That said id look into the performance uplift compared to 6800xt and see if it's worth it for you. Otherwise waiting for next Gen will yield bigger upgrades if you're happy with the performance right now.
Arctic P14 argb and P12 argb that came with the AIO.
I plan for future upgrades and safeguard against transient spikes, especially when OC @ 415w.
Working those frames my dude
Can i ask you, how is the lian li 216? As in air flow and noise? Is it worth it 100$?thanks
Insert meme where wife walks in while you are playing H light novels on your massive system.
Thank you!
I upgraded some time ago, my temps from this case and a better cpu cooler dropped a ton
Wish noctua made 160s
Kinky
Same. I have 2 140mm Noctua fans down there.
"It's for democracy"
"Think of all the oil this can find"
I havent researched the issue. Does it stem from the cpu or mb current stability issues?
> but Nvidia crushes and is for professional applications

For the stuff I'm doing AMD is a much better option. I run .gguf LLM (models). And two most important things for this usecase is memory bandwidth and memory capacity.

And 4090 which also has 24GB is twice as expensive.

3090 is actually a much better deal for it than 4090 is, but I have had terrible luck with used GPUs.

So really, for what I'm doing, 7900xtx is unbeatable. You get 100% of memory and about 80% of performance for 50% of the price of a 4090.
It's like running into someone framing a house with black & decker tools.
Ahh ok ok. ^^
Thank you kindly
How does the gpu do? My IT department tends to only buy Nvidia due to "Compatibility" not quite sure what they mean i never heard of any issues in the wild though.
Ooh, setting the case fans to slower does make sense since the cooling is already good. I saw the $90 sale price and was instantly sold on the LF III. Hope ya enjoy the build!
ohh thats a good call out for the P14s. I have some rubber Noctua "screws" I planned to use for mounting so hopefully they work.
The most odd thing, 5900x with the 7900 xtx and I have issues getting consistently above 300 FPS in Valorant and get weird frame lag issues, but it's not heat related and as far as I can tell not power related either. System just doesn't like me I guess
he deserves nice things, I'm sick of hearing stories of the nasty wife (not saying you did that) but like lord, couples should be loving and kind and want one another to enjoy life!
Say it's a "wi-fi boosting beacon" or something else totally made up that sounds half plausible...lol.
The tubing has the right amount of slack for my case, but I do agree that the mounting experience was very frustrating. I knew that going in so I did a dry run prior to thermal paste.
Thanks dude
Yeah but it’s just so big and very heavy with those two glass side panels.
Thanks for your input! :) 
I’m thinking the 7700x should be able to run the next gen gpu from amd. So I will wait for a while.
Thanks 🙏
You still won't get close to using 1000 W.
Never skip frame day
I love the case! Those 160mm fans in the front drive tons of air into the case, and you can dial down the RPM to keep things quiet. 

The case itself is well made, comes with built in LED+Fan hub, supports really long GPUs, and easy to work with. 

For $100 it's really good value IMO.
This case is definitely worth the $100. Solid all around design. Keeps my 6950XT nice and cool.
Yes! The Arctic LF III arrived just in time as well for a really good cooling combo.
For my smaller fans I used the be quiet pure wings and a thermalright peerless assassin
Hold my liber-tea.
It's usually the integrated memory controller (IMC) in CPUs that's the bottleneck. The motherboard can be a limiting factor, but to a lesser degree. Even with DDR4, it simply becomes harder for the IMC to handle more stick of RAM, so that's why it's sometimes necessary to loosen timings, drop DRAM clockspeed, and/or increase DRAM voltage to keep things stable.

BIOS improvements tend to improve this compatibility as time goes on, so DDR5 compatibility will improve as AMD releases more AGESA updates. Newer gen CPUs tend to have better IMCs, so that also helps.
No..not really. 

4 dimms was always harder to get stable. I can only imagine moreso now with the massively increased frequency.
It's stable and runs Revit reliably. I don't recall GPU related crash while running Revit.The massive VRAM won't hurt either.
I'm not sure. I know that for most high FPS competitive shooters, the CPU is a common bottle neck, especially at lower resolutions.  For dual CCD chips like 5900x you might have additional latency penalty as well. I would check out some YouTube videos for performance comparisons on zen 3 chips.
🥹
It's better wifi and better feng shui lol
It fits yours perfectly, and top mounting in general. But I suppose that's the best place to mount it anyway. Maybe I'll try front exhaust since something bothers me about using hot GPU air for the radiator

And that's smart. Did you do the bracket trick or is there a way to actually do it like the video?
Fuck that should be the motto here
thank you
Yeah but still no 160 from them. I would have gotten this case already if i was able to swap out the 160mm
O wow, I appreciate detailed explanation! This is more of the thought process I was thinking initially.
Gotcha
Hahahaha
Why do some people downvote an innocent answer?
I made a post asking about an interesting fact about Bahrain. I got an answer, and then I said "That's interesting, thanks” and now I am down voted why?  I am on desktop if it really matters
There's no reason. The people here like to downvote just for fun. Don't worry about this.
You have to remember 90% of social media users are weirdo losers, who are completely disconnected from the outside world. This is literally their life.
Reddit Hivemind
Some mods and groups are especially petty with their actions and replies so I'm learning pick my chosen communities carefully. It seems this is a reddit thing
[removed]
If you state something obvious, not contributing, maybe just agreeing and not contributing it usually attracts downvotes.

Being right or wrong doesn't matter if you share a somewhat unpopular opinion in a community you have a high chance of being downvoted. 
Some of my posts have been bashed with downvotes when the post is newer just to turn to positive votes as time goes cause more people have read and felt it was constructive/agreed and/or it contributed to the subject. 

Sometimes downvotes attracts downvotes from ppl reading 1 or 2 words, see it is downvoted, and smash that button

Misspelling in posts attracts downvotes or having bad grammar. 

Sometimes it is just trolls on the other side baiting you to continue to answer just to downvote 

Asking obvious questions attract downvotes. I have searched for help about different pc or boardgames. I always try to Google first. But if I unknowingly miss the correct key words and not getting any hits, go in on reddit and ask instead, the posts gets downvoted and lie at 0 or negative cause it was a too obvious question in the community eyes 

Being rude also attracts downvotes. 

Needless to say there are a lot of reasons people downvotes. 
Write what you think and feel and as people say, try to ignore it. What you can do is to check so you don't misspell or have incorrect grammar and over time it should be fine
Welcome to Reddit!
Sheep.  Whatever people see they follow.  If they see downvotes they automatically click on that.  If they see upvotes they automatically click on that.  They want to be with the majority.
I am not commenting on any specific situation, just addressing the question broadly.

If the answer isn't factual, relevant, insightful, or useful, a downvote is warranted.

Generally I would encourage users to act like the vote system doesn't exist. Don't let upvotes inflate your ego, and don't let downvotes feel like personal attacks. In fact Reddit specifically says being downvoted is not a form of harassment.
Some people suck and they want to watch the world burn.
Cuz Reddit.
I do my part by upvoting negatives.
The reddit vote system is miserable and doesn't fulfil its purpose. In principle, it should provide guidance on the best answer. This is not the case most of the time, several times even the most downvoted answer was the most meaningful of all. Trolls are destroying this website and this voting system only supports them. It should be abolished.
Because it's reddit. People here are often hateful for no good reason.
I remember getting downvoted for suggesting the moon pool in Australia after someone made a post asking which locations they should go to there were filmed in this one tv show which confused me since it was a legit location and a tourist spot as well. I'm assuming people just do it for no reason 😭
People are the way they are. You are not going to change them. Accept them and move on. Try to get more positive karma. It helps you a lot.
Because they want to. When you get a good amount of Karma you will stop caring
Because people just mindlessly downvote. If there's a comment with downvotes, more people will downvote. Not always the case, but that's often what's going on. Reddit is an infamous hivemind
Don't give upvotes and downvotes importance... Reddit is filled with no life dudes.

Even if you post sarcasm people here don't understand it, you can even put \[sarcasm\] and the braindeads will downvote it anyway lol
I think this all the time. People are so downvote trigger happy and it’s so unnecessary.

I will see someone saying “wow I didn’t know that, cool” with like -2 votes. Why? Even if you felt that they should know whatever it was, why is it worth essentially indicating that they’ve made a negative contribution to a community?

People need to chill on it
I have to confess I sometimes miss the scroll to the next comment button and hit downvote, wich im then too lazy to take away
People see something that someone else doesn't know or doesn't align with their views 100%?

Downvote. 

People are petty and stupid and generally annoying.
because there is no reason to give that reply, it just wastes peoples time reading it

if you think something is interesting just upvote and dont tryto be important by posting such a useless comment
People downvote anything 😭, I’m a bit new too so at first I was hurt but I’m used to it fr!
The real answer that you are looking for is B0ts. Reddit is 40%+ compose of these so most upvotes comments and everything and downvoting comments to hide them are made by them. Most companies do that, some people have team set ups with 100 phones too, etc...
People can be unpredictable online. Don’t let it get to you. Focus on the positive interactions and keep contributing.
Because Reddit is an echo chamber of morons who will vehemently oppose anything that’s counter to their beliefs. Regardless of sub
Someone has banned by haters reports? 👁️👄👁️
Because they are miserable
downvote inertia.

once something goes negative, blind redditors and bots alike pile on without even reading the post or comment.

and it can go negative accidentally. the number of times on reddit's official mobile app I have had to scroll back to undo an upvote or downvote that got applied unintentionally is probably why a lot of people use third party apps.
95% of reddit is bots and sock puppet accounts.

 Post something that goes against the narrative, and one dood in mommy's basement will log into 60 accounts to downvote you to trick you into thinking it was an unpopular opinion.

Welcome to reddit, brother.
I highly suggest you to check this subreddit posts r/downvotedtooblivion
"Haters gonna hate" sums up most of the internet
Because Most down voters are .....
its basically just for fun or whatever. One time i got -6 downvotes just for saying, “why does he have -9 likes?” i wasn’t really used to reddit tbh.
Some question don't have straightforward answers!
I have accidentally hit the down vote. Just did it about an hour ago. I caught it but it made me wonder if there were others I didn’t catch. 
The way I hold my phone and scroll it’s possible there’s more.
Because when you give people the ability to dislike something they turn into child
haters
I'm new here and I'm getting used it. Some people didn't understand my post well and started talking about untrue things regarding a relative of mine and going off topic. I politely corrected them and received some downvotes for that lol. I'm the first one to admit if I don't understand something. They are too petty. I will cherish only the interactions with kind/intelligent people. 
Because they're losers. This is the only power they have.
Because they're losers. This is the only power they have.
I got downvoted on a thread discussing lab vs natural diamonds (fake AITA post by guy that claimed his GF rejected a ring because it was a lab diamond). Someone posted their personal preference. I simply said that my taste was similar and that ethically sourced diamonds are available— WELL apparently that did it. 27 downvotes for simply stating a preference that others didn’t prefer (the person I replied to got like 40 downvotes). 

My offensive post wasn’t a post disagreeing with anyone. I was actually agreeing with someone. My point about the ethics in that particular industry was not an argument against other replies on the thread— it was a clarification on the context of my own personal preference. 

BUT while Reddit has plenty of interesting, intelligent people, it is ALSO full of people in general and there is certainly a population of those with very concrete beliefs on how the world does and doesn’t work— and at times those beliefs are based off of incomplete information. But that subset seems to congregate and lurk together. 

I’ve also found (and somehow can’t seem to learn) that the AITA subreddit seems to be a beacon to that particular population. They seem spoiled for a fight and waiting to be triggered.
Downvoting as a form of dislike/disagreement is described at https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette
 
"Please don't...
In regard to voting:
• Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion..."

Reddit's original intent for the downvote has gone astray.
Somebody who did not like you for some reason or another in another sub could be stalking all your comments and downvoting them.  

Another weaponized misuse of the reddit downvote.
Don't forget that some people don't want to be right, they want to scream about how others are wrong.

Sometimes a small mistake in a comment will provoke a horde of screaming barbarians spamming downvotes and posting mocking replies, because God forbid someone ever makes a mistake.
To little minds, downvoting is the Reddit version of pulling the wings off of flies. Maybe they were picked on as a child and this is their way of getting back at the world? Maybe they are deprived of genuine humour and they find this funny? Maybe they're wannabe bullies who are too puny irl to actually be intimidating and Reddit gives even cowards a chance to be bullies? Who knows.
these types of people are probably some trolls that want to lower your karma
I honestly don’t know, it is probably just how Reddit is 🤷🏽‍♀️
I got downvoted for giving advice. An actual advice on PSU wattage for certain GPU and the possible power spike that can damage components.

I got downvoted for using 750w power supply on a 650w recommended GPU that only uses 370w. The higher the quality/capacity, the better.

Reddit is a weird place.
I was on a sub where people were hating on men pretty hard - I suggested “maybe not all men” and was accused of derailing the conversation and permanently banned from the sub. I tell you, it’s a fierce world when you least expect it. You could also have pissed someone off and they stalk you around and downvote you wherever they find you.
It can be very off-putting when new to Reddit, and then this happens. You'll find it varies between the subs, especially depending on how the people act within that sub as well. If a sub is super active, there will be a lot more eyes on it, so expect your posts to go up and down.
Welcome to Reddit.
dont stress to much some people will just down vote anything and everything
It's hard to get the tone of text. The curt answer could be taken as sarcasm, snarky or something like that. I could be wrong but that's my opinion
You have just been down voted 😂
never mind it😅
Sometimes people just misread the tone, it happens to the best of us :>
why do you care? Honestly, if internet downvotes are keeping you up at night maybe it's time to go offline for a while and experience new things.
The point of downvoting is that it would show after the Upvote ones. So the more the downvote the bottom it gets. Point is, irrelevant and useless opinions gets down voted or the ones with which people are not agreeing/favouring.
Some people are asshats. Also because if your post didn't contribute or further the discussion, it can get downvotes (legitimately).
If your opinion doesn't fit their very narrow world view you get down-voted.
Because they can. As stupid as that sounds.
Just hold ur phone upside down then all the downvotes turn into upvotes ⬆️⬇️
Just low effort, which seems like karma farming to people. If all you have to contribute is “wow, cool!” You might as well not comment at all. You’re not adding anything to the thread and people are gonna downvote.
Same, once I said I had a neutral stance on Lgbt+ I clearly said I didn’t hate anyone for their stance. I simply wouldn’t care.. I said it in the nicest way possible and people saw it. Like I had killed somebody or something. 

(This is why I don’t like left leaning subreddits)
Dont give two thoughts about fake internet points.
were you the 4th comment in a chain by any chance?
Maybe stop caring about what random people think about your responses?
Fi4st day on reddit?
Short answer : Typical reddit behaviour 

Detailed answer :For fun , when ideas don't match , when they hate you and your reply , When they are really in bad mood , When they are trying to cause  harrasment to you , When they want your post to don't get recommended to anyone , When they want only certain types of posts to be on top of community , When they have a habit of downvoting others , When they are jealous of you etc etc ....
I used to get so sad about downvotes but then I figured yeah, it's Reddit.
Any sane person who downvotes a post that isn’t either factually incorrect, rude or offensive in someway has some serious issues going on imo. I honestly don’t understand what they’re trying to accomplish. I would be interested in knowing what the mentality is if anyone’s happy to admit to being a regular downvoter?
Because most people are petty assholes who love abusing their ability to downvote. They just like to spit on other's opinion
Just checked your comment history, and none of your Bahrain posts are in the negative. One has 0, the rest have 1 or 3 upvotes.
Hey I only have like 42,000 karma to spare. Have your way with this comment.
I'm trying to find that comment so I can upvote it to spite the person that downvoted it.
i once got downvoted for asking why someone else’s comment got downvoted
Well a person or group of people may not like your answer, cause people are different and have different opinions at times
[removed]
Why not?
I think it's confusing because humans are confusing as well, you did nothing essentially wrong. I'm grateful that we don't have karma votes following us in real life! The best way to enjoy Reddit is to not care about the downvotes - I know, it's hard at the beginning but you will get used to it.
They are meaningless & worthless internet points. You shouldn’t worry about it.
Because they do not like the answer, or, they disagree with the answer.

It is within their rights to do that.
People can misvote as they are scrolling too. Not everyone uses Internet with precise intention. You contributing something is all that matters.
Reddit users are very bored. If you post boring, dry facts without humor or some back story, you might get downvoted, even, if the facts are true. Same have happened to me.
Reddit users will downvote things for absolutely no reason as far as I can tell.

Or they are incredibly sensitive to anything that doesn’t automatically affirm what they already believe.

Source: check my username.
lol i gave my opinion/advice on a post(obv someone has asked for our opinion) i got lots of upvotes first then all of a sudden some people got triggered and downvoted😭and i was like is it that difficult to digest reality!!!!!!!!!
Reddit is just a more socially accepted 4chan. Its users are every bit as deranged and pathetic. So don't pay their reactions too much heed.
Its funny
I got dowvoted for saying "congratulations" to someone who just got a partner and when I mentioned it in a comment about ridiculous downvotes in a different subreddit, I got downvoted.
It's the mysterious nature of Reddit
Hivemind + a lot of people just genuinely hate positivity
don't worry about it, you said or did nothing wrong. you can check my comment history and see a recent comment on some post where I made a joke about "letletle" because in the post teacher's handwriting was resembling those letters instead of 6+6+6 and it's downvoted too even though other comments made that joke too lol  ppl are unreasonable sometimes
Welcome to free social media. Some folks will down-vote your answer because they disagree with it, or don't like it; others will do it just to antagonize you. Why? That's just how people fly on free social media. But be thankful that's all they did, and not troll you.

For example, I asked \[what I thought was\] a harmless "How To" question here in the "help" subreddit. Of the dozen or so responses, I got attacked, got called names, yet only one person answered the question, who I personally thanked. Where were the Mods? Just like prison guards that were paid off, they were looking the other way.

So be thankful that a down-vote was all you got. Just be aware that wherever you go, free social media is a nesting ground for trolls and other disrespectful people - and Reddit is no exception to that rule.
Realistic response-it's the internet. 
Redditor version-blah blah blah, if it was me blah blah intj that I am blah blah, think better kido
Me- tehe I like pressin the buttons 
    Hope it helps
how many downvotes is this That's interesting, thanks
it does not have a .
People do it just for fun. Don’t worry about it too much. I’ve been downvoted before for being empathetic with a user who has serious health issues. Some people just crave attention, in anyway they can
The bigger question is why do you care?
Lol, a one guy once gets downvoted for saying his favorite pizza topping
Because some people on this website will never admit they're wrong or when someone else has an answer that they don't. So they take it out on the person who actually accepts what other people say by downvoting them. It seems to be worryingly common to see someone get down voted for thanking people for an answer for rewards or for admitting they were wrong, with or without an apology too. I'm convinced the people who downvote these are just having their ego hurt by someone who is actually able to be nicer than them and accept accountability.
I think people misunderstand what the up and downvote means. I think the true use of an upvote is to say “I think this needs to be near the top of the thread”. A comment that just says “thanks”, while nice, isn’t going to be interesting or useful to other readers. I wouldn’t downvote this personally (just not upvote) but others might.
this is just the average reddit moment.

reddit users that blindly downvote aren’t that smart

as you see, my point is proven
Idk. I get downvoted in LSM (lolsuperman) just because i said „hey this video is something i‘ve seen before! (NOT LSM) I don‘t really know it‘s origins but it definetley is longer“
And someone replied with their 6day old aaah account. „You deserve all the downvites just for your name“
Reddit is a adventure
Welcome to reddit 😅 you can have honest kind discussions with some people and others will call it hate. Its a strange place to be
I agree. I got downvoted for an unoffensive innocent  joke just minutes ago. Reddit should limit how many dislikes a person can give in a day so people would be more likely to use for posts they ACTUALLY dislike instead of trolling & downvoting  “just cuz”.
This is the proper way of using the downvote function. It’s a comment that doesn’t ad anything to a discussion so it’s not interesting. People generally use it as a way of saying they disagree with a comment and this is the wrong way of using it.
I made a post asking if anyone knew when a new store was opening in the area. That got downvoted for some reason lol.
I never understood the downvoting thing, specially like you said, on an innocent thing, i think some communities are pretty weird
People are bored

Probably also have similar mentalities to middle school bullies lmao
People here downvote usually because they are ignorant and bigoted. Many of the moderators are just as bad. They'll just ban you due to their bigotry, though.
For a while on reddit, every time there was a 69 in any way shape or form, there would be a chain of upvoted comments saying "nice". For some reason, about 5-8 identical "nice" comments down the chain, one would be MASSIVELY downvoted for no reason
I think sometimes people bump the downvote buttons accidentally and then others follow to be cool. People like to be like others
You should be thankful they downvoted you ...

A moderator banned me from a subreddit because she didn't like what I replayed back at her in ANOTHER subreddit.
Because those people are assholes.

If getting downvoted by malicious strangers distresses you, I could introduce you to this [Chrome desktop extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/reddit-karma-blocker/koemhlpkecdananamphegofnfjkcapja) that hides all post karma if you're interested. 

You can still upvote and downvote people, but you won't see their scores either. (Though their posts will still collapse and be hidden from view if the score goes below a certain threshold, set by you in the settings)

I find myself being more relaxed ever since having that extension, no longer needing to worry if my post is pissing off the ever fickle hivemind.
Bro's post was seen by the Grinch
Some people just like to watch the world burn
People online are arseholes. That's all there is to it.
Liberals
It's gives people like me something to do, 

  
Resurrect!
Fame
Because of misanthropic:-(
It's a fairly low effort reply which depending on the subreddit might be frowned on too. 

There's subreddits where that would be autodeleted for being too short, can't be sure if that's the reason but we have an upvote button if you like a comment. 

Lot's of "this" and "thanks" comments just clutter a thread and make it more difficult to browse.
Thank you
Its a combination of anonymity and feeling like you made a difference when you vote.

This person disagrees/agrees with me, I must express my opinion! 

The votes just depend on the community and how strongly they feel about an opinion. It has nothing to do with the contribution of the comments anymore.
Hopefully  it's because a simple word thanks isn't really adding something  to the conversation.
reminds me how Asylum memes discord users like to send death threats for fun, learnt that the hard way by getting instant banned after reporting a spammer one time.
Ahh thank you, this made feel better🫶🏼
I dont get it either. Sometimes I rub people off on the wrong way. But if what I say is technically right, im not about to delete it either
Downvoted because your response is 100% accurate. Long live Reddit!
It's not really fun though, more likely infuriating. But thanks
For example I just downvoted this guy
Reddit mods too lol. There this one Reddit mod I know that doesn't take a single break from Reddit for more than 4-5 hours at a time and is on their almost every single minute of the day 
Mom?
Yeah absolutely. 

Oh Man I'm so glad I'm in that 10% of people are totally awesome and normal and ahh... Goes out and parties. I go to parties. With friends. I have friends and we party. 
I go to parties with my friends!
Are not
Reddit Hivemind goes way too far @ times
B0ts is the answer. Reddit is 40% +++ b0ts
Hivemind silly
I just gave the Reddit Hivemind™ offerings. Oh, just simple honey buns 🛐
Absolutely correct on this.
I got perma banned and suspended for spreading 'misinformation' on a mobile game subreddit because I said one character is stronger than another . How I have to use VPN and private browser literally just to use Reddit normally without getting auto banned 
You’re right about choosing communities carefully some of them have the same insane mindset 😂😂
Another curious effect is when someone is getting downvoted into oblivion, and then someone else comes along and comments, "I don't know why you're getting downvoted. You're right," and then suddenly people start upvoting the original comment.
Herd behavior.

Edit: I just downvoted your comment to set me apart from the herd who upvoted you.
I've done it. I saw a comment that had -10 likes and I wanted to participate so I gave it -11. The person responded by saying, "Why am I getting down voted", and we down-voted their response. Interestingly, it felt good to down vote their comment. I wonder if other people had a similar experience?
Talking about misspelling... I almost downvoted you because, in the last paragraph, you said "Needles too" when I think you meant to say "Needless to" 😆️ But not to worry, I knew where you were coming from, so I gave you an uppy. Well done.
Literally lol...
Maybe they don't know about the 3rd option: don't do anything. There's no law that says we have to vote on everything we see, we can just leave it alone.
 They want to be with the majority.

That's Reddit. Each subreddit has it's agenda, if you disagree with it, you often get downvoted, even if you are making a valid point.
Ehhh. My only rule is that I don’t upvote any post calling other people sheep for doing normal human consensus-building.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Well it makes sense that people upvote if they agree with a comment, so is it wrong to downvote if you disagree? Is my thought process on it
oh that makes sense
[deleted]
Sounds like r/askwomen. They remove more comments than they let stay. Always for derailing a conversation.

You too. Now give me back my damn downvote.
votes on comments/posts affect visibility, and karma affects ability to post, it does matter.

Sadly downvoting is completely abused, and the best thing reddit admins can do is take the ability to downvote away from people, leave the moderating to the moderators.
Why does that matter?
To be fair, this is reddit, and some subreddits have karma restrictions. I don't think this is a matter of "what people think," and it may be a matter of "I don't want to be blocked from participation."
See? Downvoted. 😔
Having zero points means it went negative 
And I downvoted this reply for being condescendingly unhelpful to OP's genuine question.
according to the official reddiquette that is deemed abuse of the feature.

if you dont like a comment, either reply saying why, be engaged, dont hide behind a anonymous downvote, or just ignore it and move on.
Now why is this downvoted? Lol
even what you said I dont agree with, whether something is interesting is a matter of opinion.

the only valid use of downvotes is if a post is a rule breaker, breaks reddiquette.
DAMN, I'm new I didn't know that moderators are that bad
Wow you’re delusional
You’re foolish LOL
"This" is my pet peeve. But I really appreciate seeing thanks for an effortful post. 


If you are providing asked for advice, particularly to someone in a vulnerable situation, it is a relief to know they received it.
It's so weird to me that saying thank you to someone is considered low effort.
I agree with you, but reddit made this downvote button for people who don't agree, but sometimes they do it for no reason.
THIS!!!!!
Yeah but thats Reddits fault. Stupid rules that force you to have specific karma to be able to post just encourage people to spam 
In the early days of Reddit it was encouraged not to use upvotes and downvotes as an agree/disagree button but they were supposed to be used to downvote low quality comments or those that didn’t contribute to the discussion or topic and upvote those that were the opposite
I'll be honest, when I see "thanks for sharing" it's an immediate downvote response
fr
I never delete comments in which i am right lol
Yeah, I should hold fast on this one a bit more
But nobody cares because he is way over +1. You on the other hand, you're in trouble my friend
For example I just downvoted this guy
For example nobody cares lol
Ratio
For example I just downvoted this guy
yeah, this is a second i will take to just say that the moderators will freely delete one post or comment that goes "against rules for being off topic" and if you look at 90% of the other comments or posts they are all off topic but with more likes or something :// it's like everyone cares about popularity or who got where first and it makes me irritated for more reasons but i digress and hope that people don't downvote others for innocent answers on a thread which is literally about that lol
Once I reminded myself that the votes don't actually mean anything in reality, reddit became much more enjoyable.
🤦🏼‍♀️ oh my days
Sounds like someone didn't like your opinion very much haha
I have gotten downvoted and have seen people get upvoted for saying the same thing in a thread before. I have seen a lot of incorrect things get upvoted and correct things get downvoted. People shouldn't solely rely on Reddit for information and ignore the downvotes and upvotes. I wish they would get rid of them.
[removed]
I’ve also done it. I saw your comment that had -2 likes and I wanted to participate so I gave it -3. it felt good to down vote your comment. I wonder if other people had a similar experience?
Hehe xD 
English is not my native language 😅 and my phone didn't correct me 😅

I will take this to heart and try to remember 😅
True. Sometimes I don’t agree or disagree with the statement so do as you suggest.
100% -- this is the worst of reddit.  Not in the groupthink of the group?  Downvote to hell.
👍
Yikes

LOL, if you didn’t say anything I would’ve never known 😭
Not that one oddly! I just joined that one yesterday. Hoping they are a little less radical than the other 
I’ve learned that if someone takes issue with me, block em, stat 
😂 you get a freebie on me 😎
4th comment gets atomised. I didn't make the rules, I just follow them.
Ah yes the 1-50 karma restrictions. I'm pretty sure it's functionally impossible to get negative karma in the long run unless you're actively trolling. And like if you know you're responses aren't unreasonable. Why do you care if a couple dozen people across the world wide web click a downdoot button? Op is thinking about the down votes probably for longer than it collectively took for those dozen people to click the down vote button on reflex in the first place.
Not with a comment, which is what the OP is asking about. In fact none of those are even at zero now; they’re all 1 and some are in the double digits.

Karma on comments and posts can wax and wane. Some subs are famous for early downvoting (often interpreted by newbies as somebody having a beef just with them when it’s sub wide), but it often evens out as a post simmers. That’s what seems to have happened to the OP.
To answer the question, it's the reddit hivemind.
What is “reddiquette”? Following a post modern philosophy and giving only positive feedback? And also having a left leaning ideology I guess. This is the norm I most Reddit communities. And if you don’t agree the moderators will sensor or ban you. What is “reddiquette” will depend on the specific sub you are in. It’s all a matter of opinion. The point isn’t if a post is “interesting”, but if it drives a discussion forward. The quality of the answer in regard to the topic being discussed. And yeah I agree that for certain subs you also need to stay on topic and follow the guidelines for that specific sub so comments that don’t should be downvoted. Guess it’s a system thats never going to work tho as people have their own idea how to use it.
there is deffo some dodgy moderation on reddit, but of course not all moderators are power trippy so dont want to label them all the same way.
well I think its just her because I haven't had any issues with anyone else ..

“Your words have blessed me with newfound knowledge and joy, thank you kind redditor. Good regards to you”
No, the upvote and downvote buttons aren't intended to be used to indicate agreement or disagreement, like or dislike. The upvote button is for comments that add something of value to the discussion and the downvote button is for comments that don't. If you have nothing to add but a smile, a nod, or an echo of someone else's words, you'll get downvotes to move your content to the bottom, out of the way of people looking for something worth reading. Comments you disagree with should be upvoted if they add anything, good or bad, to the conversation.
I didn't suggest you should vote based on your agreement with the commenter. 

I said "if you like a comment there's an upvote button" not "if you agree with a comment".
Why?  Seems innocent and sincere enough?
OK, I at least got some people to agree with me
You're definitely getting upvoted on this comment

My two best comments were about a college food pantry and a bad dad joke

Haha the Apple the rich kid gave the teacher was a MacBook
and i downvoted this guy
 Lmao you get downvoted just for saying you downvoted the downvoter
You're right
I wanted to be different. I saw 0 upvotes and decided to be a trend-setter by giving this comment -1. It felt good to start a down vote snowball. I wonder if other people had a different experience?
Not to worry, you did great - better than some folks that have been speaking English all there lives. So, give yourself a pat on the back for me 👍️ And again, you did good.
this
It's at zero now. I don't know which way to vote o\_o
Read their rules. It’s a loooooong list.
If you block someone can they still see your comments and downvote you or are you hidden from them?
you are a true gentleman
Lol okay... got to follow the rules, now I am going to be noticing the 4th comment all the time. I had no idea.
Cause redditors need social validation on the internet, cause they don’t get out enough. It makes them feel good, popular. 

That is the answer don’t let the cope fool you.
There is a reddiquette page, its about treating others with respect, not judging posts based on the poster but instead the content, using downvotes only as a means of downvoting posts that go against subreddit rules and reddiquette, it was never meant to be used as a I disagree or I dont like button.  This link is online, I checked it yesterday before I made the comment.  The page also mentions moderators, so you shouldnt be making moderation decisions based on the poster, but instead the content.

Yep granting downvoting powers to every member of the community it is inevitable it ended up being used for other reasons.

Ironically if we talking about echo chambers, which is the point I think you mentioned, if there was no mass downvotes of unpopular posts, then there would probably be a better balance in communities.  As downvotes are a censor tool.
lmfao I made a good example on why ppl downvote anything XD
Came here to say this
\^
I’mma use your comment to copy/paste it wherever it’s needed
When Reddit first came around did people use votes the right way more than they do now?
What you say makes sense, but on this post somebody replies "thank you" and gets 19 upvotes. How do you explain that?
Just yes dude. This is exactly what I’m talking about. It’s pretty abused.
Pfshaw nonsense. People upvote what they like. 
r/karmaroulette
If my up/down votes are even I will downvote this guy, if they are odd I will upvote
You got downvoted for saying I got downvoted for downvoting the downvoter
I saw this comment and went back and upvoted the comment you replied to. I saw 2 upvotes and decided to also upvote it. It felt good to help make your efforts fall flat on their face. I wonder if people had a different experience?
Same.
Really?? It’s -1 for me 😭, and it says I’m liking, when I unlike it’s -2…Guess it’s broken for me…UPVOTE!! 😪🙏
Aw man. 
You’re hidden from one another. I remember reading once that “blocking a terrible person is good self care” and I totally agree
Best me to it
I giggled. Take my unimportant upvote.
That
I would actually love to see this in some random post 😂
Same!
That was a different time with a different culture. Reddit today is a morass of bots and marketers and lobbyists. Votes only give an indication of the mood of the subreddit.
I wasn't here at the beginning but I know in the several years I've been here, that it seems like some people use it as intended, some refuse and use it as a like button and some only use it to agree until they find out that's not what it's for. It really is helpful to everyone to use it as it was meant to be used because it makes Reddit more thought provoking and less of an echo chamber.
That's people who are being kind and also either don't know, don't care or don't agree that comments like that are supposed to be downvoted. It's okay that some people think it's worth reading their fellow humans being kind and using manners with each other though. To each their own. People will do as they like regardless of the site creators intentions.

ETA: Whether comments like "thank you" are more likely to be upvoted than downvoted also depends on the established culture of the individual sub it's being posted to. If the sub creator likes that and promotes it, people are more likely to do that. Subs full of pictures of puppies and kittens for instance, are usually more appreciative of trivial pleasantries because pleasantness is the overall purpose of the sub to begin with.
Sounds like ppl used the upvotebincorrectly as a like button.
The upvotes aren't usually the issue..
I still follow it and read and vote. But I stopped trying to comment. I have not realizing what sub it was and a couple comments stayed. But I’ve had a lot of them removed so I don’t even try anymore.
This response doesn’t meet my arbitrary standard for today
These
An AI Bot summarizing the discussion would do a better and more neutral job than number of up/down votes, IMO.
Thank you for your answer. I agree. I did use it at first for disagreements but it wasn’t long before I read what it’s actually for so I use it that way now.
Perfect explanation. What percentage of people do you think vote because they like somebody saying thank you?
And yikes! I think I've been using the arrows incorrectly  again  like when I first joined. Self recap: up votes are for posts I think add something  to the conversation and down votes for posts I think don't  but be careful when using either and remember it's about contributing to the conversation! Because it's whatever here to do -have a conversation  about various items.

Successful 9700x Deild
Will post results later.
The Creator of the "Delid-Die-Mate" aka der8auer made a video and explained that the person who did the delid and broke it, did it wrong. And ofc all the news articles jumped on the train and spread all the misinformation.

The Video: [https://youtu.be/jJzSlXe\_aDA](https://youtu.be/jJzSlXe_aDA) | TLDR: There is barely no difference delidding the 9000 Series compared to the 7000 Series. It was just User Error from the Tech Youtuber who went viral with his broken delid.
Successful delid so far. Until it is running inside a PC it is like Schrodinger's cat, neither alive nor dead.
**** UPDATE ****
Sorry to disappoint, but I cracked the IO die when removing from the delidder. I improperly used the delidder to hold the CPU while cleaning, and must have really lodged it in. Took about 5 mins of pressing on it, heard a snap, and then the [crack](https://imgur.com/a/enLBF5I) is here. Lame.
![gif](giphy|s239QJIh56sRW|downsized)
very cool. I saw pictures and the videos of a broken die, because the person was not willing to invest time to work properly.
How small the compute die actually is ha
Wait, isn't the IHS soldered on?
Delidding is stupid af
*I dont think so tim.*
I'm sorry but even with a delid, this cpu is still disappointing.
Can you make it perform "slightly better" than 7800X3D in games by doing this?

Joking, but AMD claimed that, couldn't be further from true...
How come versions without the IHS of desktop CPUs aren't being sold for enthusiasts who want this? Laptop CPUs don't have a lid.
Tidy 😁
Idle hands make one poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.
Anyone else think they should just sell the CPU delided? would save us a ton of time and effort them a little money and idc if they dont want to offer a warranty on it.
Only for no benefit!
i am confused about seeing a delid on a energy efficiency cpu

gratz tho
Mad lad.
What were you planning to use for a contact plate? The TG ones wouldn’t work with that amount of coating over the SMDs
Sweet baby Jeebus, people bringing out knives over a delid?
Take That Ancient Asian Chi-Knees Man........ #Der8auer #Read #WatchVideo

https://i.redd.it/oohvrdes25id1.gif
Single chiplet is rare they need all the dies they can get this time.
Man is more easy using dental floss for the corners and a  flat iron than the der8uer kit. Done over 10 cpus 0 issues.
Dang that looks scary to do
Onwards and upwards to the 9950X? Or are you waiting for the X3D variant?
Click bait at its finest, because the title is "SUCCESFUL DELID," and OP's update comment is "actually I broke it and it doesn't work anymore."
WHY?  This CPU is now scrap you can't sell on when it comes to upgrade.  

Is this Nice new trend designed to crash the second-hand market for CPUs?

What's next under the guise of mods?

Mods are suppse extend the useful life of tech, not contract it.
So...you're gonna use a direct-die cooling solution?
why???, **This is the coldest processor in history.**
delidded or not, still disapointed by Ryzen 9000 performance figures.
Gotta farm those clicks
I understand der8auer has to show that it can be done in order to defend his product. But nobody in their right mind should be delidding a 9700x.
User error from a guy that works for Asus LoL.
Basically his answer was RTFM
I'm glad they made it obvious about delidding being a dangerous procedure omg now whenever I hear that word I literally shit myself
My 13900k agrees with your comment! I had done 3 delid in the last few years i never had an issue except this time. 😅 After a thorough inspection a transistor was knocked off when replacing the new copper IHS. We replaced it and it was not easy and requires hardware and steady hands.
Aaaaand OP has already posted an update that the ~~cat~~ chip is dead.
So, you used the housing as a means to steady it while cleaning? 

I guess the downward force/pressure must’ve lodged it in there a bit too tight.
sounds like you succeeded in getting your cpu to be cooler.
![gif](giphy|ht4yvN9Yx4dmIJJ9GB|downsized)
Thank you for your sacrifice. It's people like you that help propel science forward
![gif](giphy|94EQmVHkveNck|downsized)
sorry to hear :(
RIP
delidding the 9700 is cursed!
[removed]
Direct die cooling performs better, but it's a fragile process.  Also delidding will void warranty (in general) and most people don't even need to do it.
We gonna OC baby ! Liquid metal , Water cooling that sort of stuff ! Lets push that MF to the moon !
You can get better cooling if you have direct contact with the cpu. It's dangerous if you don't know what you're doing but it can easily lead to lowering temps by over 10c.
[deleted]
Considering the update... ouch.
Yes thats what the tool is for.
You can still delid a soldered IHS, it's just harder.
That’s the whole point of the delid die mate so the solder is broken at its weakest direction.
Yeah all for little performance gain and also risk damaging the cpu..
So is modding a car.  But some of us who are more technically inclined love doing this shit for fun or at least enjoy seeing just what tech is capable of.  

Also, so is spending 2000$ on a rig when 1000$ can last just as long.
no you
Probably because they don't want to offer a warranty on something so fragile.
People who delid soldered CPUs are extremely small minority.

There is no point in making a CPU that targets just thousand enthusiasts.

There are not that many people who want, or can afford to risk brand new HW to get barely-noticeable performance increase that will be probably visible only in benchmarks.
Probably because that would be a warranty nightmare for any company that tried it. It's still pretty easy to crack the die when mounting/demounting coolers.
They probably just don't want to deal with the warranty and extra SKUs. Back in the day there were lots of CPUs without IHSs, and it wasn't uncommon to shatter the die when attaching the heatsink wrong.
unfortunately, the american federal government as well as the english government and probably many more DO care about electronics sold with warranties
Someone should delid a pentium just because for this crowd.
haahahahaha
Obviously?
We can dig deeper is why. Need that room temp cpu
Im sorry, next time i wont provide a source! /s
I don't know, man, people who want to delid CPUs in general, not just the 9700X, are not in the "right" mind anyway.
I mean, the IHS on AM5 is not great...I really do love Thermal Grizzly's replacement heat spreader product idea that they had...It really needs to come back to market. And then, delidding to use that could end up being something we see done slightly more frequently.
Eh, direct die cooling is becoming more and more mainstream.

And a reduced delta between core and water temp means you don't have to run your fans as hard to get the same heat out of the CPU and loop.
I agree, its risky to delid a new CPU like 9700x. Maybe wait 2-3 years when its out of warranty, then delid it but i think just buy a top of range AIO.
>right mind should be delidding a 9700x.

Why not?

OC voids warranty anyways
A transistor on the CPU PCB? Seems odd... Do you know what it was for?
I use the same technique to solve world hunger.
if you have nothing constructive to say, stop saying it altogether
I know what delidding is for. I just don't know why you would want to do it on a 65W chip that can be cooled by blowing on it.
[it's a direct-died solution now :(](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1epheya/successful_9700x_deild/lhl2uqh/)
You can't push it any further than it will go with normal water cooling and liquid metal. De-lidded or not. You will never get it below ambient room temperature, so it's not going to magically be able to handle more voltage and dissipate more heat. 
You can only achieve that with liquid nitrogen.
shouldn't it be "they treat it like sex"?
>solder

>it's just harder

I like how this is correct in multiple ways compared to normal thermal paste.
Neat
Yeah this thread aged like cheese already, OP cracked the IO die.
Most people do it for the love of the game
I have a 7950X3D in a Fractal Ridge cooled by an L12S and Liquid Metal that begs to differ.
maybe just don't offer warranty at all? sell it cheaper and without warranty. I am sure there are people who will still buy it
Nope, I thought he's gonna make a custom lid made out of pure copper then use either a tower air cooler or an AIO. Or maybe repaste the die from the inside.
Blud is turning the cpu into AC 😂😂😂
I meant for those tech news articles spreading the news without better context
Can confirm. Delidded my 11900K to run it at 5.4GHz 380W just to lose to a 65W 9700X.
Why?

It's just modding and if I'm not mistaken people have made huge cooling and performance improvements from doing so.

Not something I'm likely to do, but totally get why enthusiasts would.
Delidded and replaced the TIM on the IHS  with Liquid Metal on my i7-7700K years ago.  

Dropped temperatures 22c.  Allowed me to go to 5.1GHz.  And the person that had it now is still using it.

That was a good delid.

My son did it on his 6700K and got to 4.8GHz at lower temps as well.
I've been mad to delid my 5900x since I got it, thing is constantly held back by heat, despite being under a custom water loop with 2 x 420mm rads.

I've even repasted it thinking I did something wrong.

I just couldn't afford it going wrong.
Sure, but the 9700x is a 65w product. If you're going to delid, at least do it on a cpu that is being held back by thermals.
But then using 6000mhz memory and Void the warranty this way 🫠 
Most people void there warranty without knowing it. For me it's like "I void it anyways and I want a quieter and faster pc so I delid it anyway." Did 3 delids and all of those 3 chips run great to this day. 
Possibly power switching?
https://imgur.com/gallery/Ln6Vb23

I think it was for power regulation, a highly skilled friend did it for me. I went to his lab to perform the "surgery" took him 5-10 min. Cleaned the CPU, removed the previous solder, replaced the new component that was salvaged from another dead CPU. Replaced the copper IHS without knocking it off 😅 tested the continuity and it was working. We were very lucky.

I'm capable with tech in software and hardware but when it comes to small electronics I don't have the necessary equipment (small heat station, CPU bench, high def camera, nor the very steady hands) to resolder such small components. My friend reballs CPU and repair electronics for a living just like NorthridgeFX on YouTube so I chose the safe way to fix my mistake.

Edit: top 2 resistors and bottom is capacitor, someone corrected me on imgur.
It's a 65W chip at default. Unlocked PBO2 limits allow it to pull about 175W and it runs significantly faster, and hotter. The IHS this AMD Gen is significantly thicker so impedes heat transfer a lot.
Overclocking? For fun or out of interest.
It's only 65w if you leave it at that. A small change in the BIOS and that chip can pull 170w.
Why do you do things other people would call pointless? Because it's fun? You enjoy it?

Probably the same reason OP did it?
maybe you want to use it at much more than 65w.
Obviously some people want to find out what the Zen5 architecture is capable of when you remove the artificially low power limit. Btw, don't get me wrong, I for one believe it is good marketing to spread out your product portfolio with power and clock limits. It is beyond me why some people use the 9700X power limit to bad-mouth the architecture, particularly when the chip is unlocked
so you can pump 250W into it without grtting over 60C
You get better temps, which means a) less degradation of the silicon and b) less noise from your fans.
You can get more thermal headroom which translate into more power without going into thermal throttling
Lower temps can improve a lot for stability in over clocks
but you can get it closer to ambient.

the thermal couplings betheew the chip and IHS and between the IHS and cooler are the biggest bottlenecks in cooling. going straight from chip to cooler eliminates one of these slowdowns.
Who know baby.. Who knows 😁
Cracked it after successful de-lid though.

So the title is still technically correct.
Yeah if you want better performance just buy a more powerful  with better cooling but I don’t see how this will improve at 65w cpu but each their own lol
That's cool. How would you compare the performance to before you delidded?
I don't think it's legal to sell a new product without a warranty hence the problem.
Illegal in large parts of the world.
The original IHS is essentially pure copper; the nickel plate it has is trivially thin.
… which would be directly cooling the delidded die.
oh mb then lol
The way of the warrior
I just got rid of my 11900k, it ran so hot just to match my 5800x on a good day. Lmao
you still gangsta for trying and succeeding in the delid
Fuck. When you put it that way it really show far we have improved in efficiency
If you've got enough money to be able to afford a replacement CPU in case you fuck up a delid, then just get a better CPU. Any other decision is just foolish.

Delid might make sense if you've got an old CPU that can be had for cheap and were planning on just getting a new one, anyway. It makes zero sense if its a brand new expensive CPU.

Modding doesn't always make sense and some people simply have an irrational compulsion to do it.
how "huge performance improvements" are we talking here?
There are much safer ways to improve temps that don't void warranty.
Yes and no. With CPU's being more and more soldered to the ihs, you can get similar results without 90% of the risk of wasting a whole cpu, by just sanding the IHS down. 

For CPU's like the Intel 7000th series where there is only thermal paste between the die and the ihs, you can remove them easier and get more benefits from it as well. 

But unless you want to do more extreme stuff, it's really not worth it. You can overclock without delidding and your 95watt cpu won't burn your house down without it as well. 

It has it's place, but it is extremly nieche. And people who do this are doing things that aren't really something a normal person would do. Aka, cooling with liquid nitrogen or trying to beat some scores on an OC leaderboard.
I mean, it's a 65W part until you get rid of that artificial power limit in PBO...then it is more like a 105-120W part... 🤷‍♂️
Thicker than what? 7000 series or AM4?
A) Unless AMD is lying, the chip is already designed to run at 95c without degradation. 

B) I agree with less fan noise.
Nope. If you're cooled to max efficiency, you can't produce any more thermal headroom without going below ambient temperature. If it's not going to thermal throttle, it's not going to thermal throttle, simple.
No. Temps have got nothing to do with stability.
AMD solders their heat spreader on their chips its better than any liquid metal or paste.
You still risk damaging the die even after successful de-lid like what happened to OP, Silicon is very fragile.
Removing power limits from the 9000 series does improve performance a bit in some tasks, but I imagine most people who delid are just enjoying the hobby.
My PC is silent and requires significantly less noise to cool the chip.
Oh, I see.
yes.
which is how we normally did it 20 years ago
No, the CPU, not the MB, shouldn't delid the MB
I mean it’s also me running the 11900K way over the efficiency point lol. 5.2ghz to 5.4ghz is a good 120W extra.
Sometimes it's not about the performance gains, rather it's about modding.

Why would anyone do a full custom loop when they can just get better parts and an AIO? Because the custom loop is fucking cool.

Why delid a 9700x instead of getting a 9900x? Because overclocking a part, regardless of it's stack designation is fun and the mod is risky and fun to do. Sure, the better part would likely be faster, but modding mid tier parts is fun too.

If OP bought a 9900x, they'd likely delid that instead, because it's about the mod, not just the performance.
>Irrational compulsion


No fun allowed on your watch.
I agree, delidding my 8700k about 2 years ago made sense, but mostly because the thermal compound was drying out, and it was only worth $100 anyway.
Same reason you mod an old shitbucket instead of buying a faster stock car.

It's about the process and the pride in the result, not about saving money.
As long as all your hobbies make sense to you and all my hobbies make sense to me.....
That is your opinion.  That’s all.
It's a hobby. 

Most of them look silly to outsiders & many build really nice communities. Lowriders, sneakers, hell cars in general... 

all silly, but people are better off for having hobbies
Subjective, but for me the lower ambient temperature and less fan noise (and as a bonus less wasted electricity) are well worth it.

I delided my 7700X about a month ago, and with a PPT ceiling of 105W (stock was 142W) I get the same multi core performance and slightly better single core performance. Temperature tops at 75 degrees C instead of 95 using the same air cooler. The temperature in my home office is lower (very nice during summer months), the fans spin slower/less often, and the annoying temp/fan spikes are no more.

I think that -37W (26% reduction) and -20C is quite significant.
I don't think anyone is pretending this is something normal should do, I thin it's pretty clear it's niche, just the same as sanding/lapping an IHS. I specifically said that this is something enthusiasts would do.
Still not the 400-500W (sh)Intel has to offer.

I don't think you need to delid the CPU to correctly cool 120W.
thicker than the AM4 lineup. Its part of the reason why at the 7000 series launch so many processors were thermally limited instead of power limited, and lapping or deliding would lower temperature enough to push the chip another 200mhz or so.
Compared to AM4, they kept the Z height of the IHS the same for cooler compatibility but the dies are further down on the substrate. So the IHS is thicker. Direct die cooling drops temps by around 25C if done properly which is absolutely insane. And delidding isn't that hard, just be smart about it. Harder than the delid is cleaning off the die's old solder and polishing it to make sure it gets good contact.
all AM5 IHSs are thick and many aren't flat. My 7700x is bulged.
A is an extreme simplification of silicon reliability. All CPUs degrade, so it's more of a question of how fast. AMD finds 95'C to have an acceptable degradation rate for their lifetime/reliability goals. A more generalised concept is that absolutely nothing in the world stands against the test of time.

There is also C, performance. Temperature has an exponential reactive play on performance; colder chips overclock better.

edit: typo
If I remember correctly then 10K hotter translates into a halfed half live time.

So if it would fail at 95C after 5 years, it fails at 85C after 10 years and at 75C after 20 years.

Of course, I pulled the exact numbers out of my head - but you get the concept.
The thing is you are never cooled to max efficiency. The cooler you keep the die, the more power you can pump into it.


That power maybe doesn't make a noticeable difference in performance, but that's a different issue.
Truly wrong please go study how temps affect a variety  of transition errors
heat going through solder is still getting slowed down.

and then you're also slowing it down with a liquid metal or something going to the cooler.

it still is better to go cooler onto a bare chip than through the IHS.
Dude, this is really easy. The less material there is between the hot bits and the cold bits, the easier it is for the hot to move to the cold side. Doesn’t matter what that material is. Less is better.
That’s doesn’t invalidate the title or the reason op made the post.
Man idk why waste your money buying it then but i don’t know , it’s more risk than reward when doing this idk that’s just me
Interesting.
Instructions unclear. Thermal paste is EVERYWHERE
Modding for the sake of modding is perfectly fine, but still a little unhinged.
>If OP bought a 9900x, they'd likely delid that instead, because it's about the mod, not just the performance.

Like I said, some people just have an irrational compulsion. There's not *actually* a reason to do it unless you just want to.
I never said irrational compulsions aren't fun. I play video games dude
This is the perfect scenario for it.
>Same reason you mod an old shitbucket instead of buying a faster stock car.

The 9700X is not an old shitbucket. If you read what I said carefully, you'll notice I did suggest delidding an old cheap CPU might make sense.
Fair enough
That's what public forums are for, yeah.
Delidding is not a hobby lol. It might be part of a hobby. But the action itself is not.
The 9700x already runs lower tempature than a 7700x on stock. The 9700x must be an Ice Cube with good cooling and a delid.
Congratulation on those results, but I wonder how much of that could be also achieved by having a better cooler and lower PPT.

For example my (AMD) GPU had problems with cooling and I've found that I can't tell a difference between default settings and settings with 40% lower power limit - it doesn't scale linearly, so its likely only small performance hit for significantly quieter PC and the few-FPS difference is not noticeable to me.

To me the benefit of delid itself seems too low for the risk involved.
I mean, you really don't ever NEED to delid. And, sure, it helps more with higher wattage components, but it isn't like it would do nothing to help with a 120W part. 🤷‍♂️
And 9000 has identical thickness to 7000?
people who care about overclocking and deliding aren't going to run those CPUs for 10 years anyway.
I mean realistically it only needs to not fail for as long as you plan on keeping it.

Using your numbers if you keep it under 75C that's more than enough and realistically unless your computer is on 24/7 running with all cores/threads maxed out (which is pretty rare) it's not going to be anywhere near 75C most of the time.
Correct, you are never technically at max efficiency, it's actually impossible. 

However, if you have a cooling solution that will never allow thermal throttling at ambient temperatures, then it makes no difference to performance if your CPU is running at a maximum of say 40'c under full load, or a maximum of 60'c under full load... If your thermal throttling limit is 95'c, for example.

It's not until you're running subzero that you can actually apply so much extra voltage to get massive overclocks... which are always inherently unstable, and are only good for limited benchmark runs.
Nope. So long as you're not thermal throttling, it makes zero difference. Your overclock is stable or not. 
Ludicrous notion to believe an overclock can be stable at 45'c, but unstable at 65'c.

This is exactly why 100% of extreme liquid nitrogen overclocks are completely unstable for any use case past a single benchmark run. The only reason sub zero temps make a difference is so you can massively overvolt... and then they aren't stable.
Degenerate thrill seekers
You got it on my eye!
I'm calling the car people
Unhinged? Are you serious?

Damn. You must have a sheltered life
I wouldn't call it an irrational compulsion. There's literally the rationale for cooling performance and tinkering.

The cooling performance is very noticeable between a delided CPU and one with its heat spreader.

Even if the intention is about the mod itself, that wouldn't be irrational either. Specifically because the performance incentive still exists regardless of rationalization, and doing something for fun IS rational.

If there were no benefits, sure, maybe rationality is lacking, but deliding is mostly benefits, with a pretty small risk involved.
It shouldn't have to be comparable to an old car for you to understand the concept.

People do it for other reasons than saving money.
Bruh what are you the delid police? People wanna lower a few 'C so they delid. Risks are obviously involved but there's a risk with anything related to overclocking. Voltages, temperatures, delidding, custom watercooling - they all have risks as overclockers are always pushing the boundaries. But if they're having fun doing it, all power to them I suppose
You keep proving why people better off for having hobbies.
Yes, if I had that CPU it would hardly be worth it for me personally (different story for overclockers). I know the thread became a bit long, but the comment thread starts with someone saying "people who want to delid CPUs in general", just to add context to my comment.
I have used eco mode, but the high temperatures (and fan rpm) were usually caused by single thread tasks that did not reach the eco limits - this still happened. The multi thread clocks went down about 10% fwiw. The real issue seems to have been getting the heat from the die through the thick IHS, since temperature is now a lot better and nothing else changed in the setup. If I did curve optimization and other things, I could probably improve it even more. Regarding cooler I use a Dark Rock 4 pro, and I do not think that there are many ways of improving in that regard without introducing more noise. Temperature and noise improvements (without lower performance) was what I was aiming for after all.

Each to their own if the benefits are worth the risks, and I am sure that for some people no benefits could ever justify it, and that's fine. The risk factor also greatly depends on user skill and discipline, as OP demonstrated :D The improvements are real though.
I mean, why do all your comments start with “I mean”?
Yes. They made a stupid IHS to keep cooler compatability (didn't even really work anyways)
*Minor threat plays in the background*
They are in the same league.
Not like insane, just like outside the normal. I'd even consider lapping to be a little crazy.
>If there were no benefits, sure, maybe rationality is lacking, but deliding is mostly benefits, with a pretty small risk involved.

The risk is you turn a $300 CPU into a flimsy paper weight. If that's a "small" risk for you, then I wish I had that kind of income!
I understand the concept perfectly. What's the issue?
>Bruh what are you the delid police?

No

>People wanna lower a few 'C so they delid. 

I have a couple people arguing with me this isn't why they wanna do it lol

All I said was that delidding is not in and of itself a hobby. No reason to take offense to that.
Look, man. I'm just criticizing the risk/reward factor for delidding. I don't care if you actually do it. If you end up with a broken CPU that's on you. But not every part of every hobby necessitates risking a $300+ component. It's not that hard to tell yourself "Haha yeah the risk is destroying a really expensive part."
Does it actually bother you that I had two posts that started that way...?
MINOR threat? Straight to jail "Fbi open up" \*sirens wailing, weeping even\*
You're right that it's out of the ordinary, but not unhinged or crazy. 

Just don't do it if you don't want to.
What are the odds though? Realistically, with the proper tools, the odds of the chip breaking are very little, almost as negligible as overclocking.

But more to your point, is your idea of rational vs irrational based on risk and reward? There are plenty of decisions that have very little risk that are irrational and many high risk decisions that are very rational. 

I'm guessing you are also risk adverse to the idea of overclocking? Because I'm sure you don't want to turn your cpu into a 300 dollar paperweight along with your motherboard?
That I'm saying it makes sense to do it on any chip whether new or old, because it requires a special motivation and not an economic motivation.
I've seen the conversation from the beginning & you left out the part where it was argued risk/reward ratio doesn't really apply to hobbies because the point of the hobby is the joy & enrichment of participation.

Then you disputed that premise by arguing that.... the individual acts a person engages in as part of a hobby do not each qualify as a hobby by themselves.... which demonstrates *why* you need a more pleasurable or more productive way to spend your time.

In case this has all escaped you again.

People aren't delidding for financial gain, but because they think it's neat, they like it & they appreciate the results. 

>But not every part of every hobby

No one thinks all hobbies have equal risks. Honestly though I'd bet that losing $300 when you do something wrong is on the lower end when looking at all hobbies. People even break *themselves* when practicing their hobbies.
Three comments btw. Never said it bothered me. Just asking why?
I created a free After Effects alternative
Working daily on a Linux machine, I often found myself in need of an After Effects alternative on Linux, with layers, keyframes, video effects... so I ended up creating Pikimov, a motion design & video editor.

It runs directly in your web browser and is compatible with all systems: Windows, macOS, Linux.  
Pikimov is **free**, **without registration**, it **does not upload files** to a cloud server, and **does not** **use your projects to train AI models**.

Even if you already have an Adobe subscription, Pikimov can still save your day when you are on the go, far away from your work computer

Here's the link to the editor: [https://pikimov.com](https://pikimov.com)
It's neat.

It's also (IMHO) not useful here in this community.

And it's not because you're not magnificent. You are.

*This has potential* \- but it's primary appeal is going to be around free tools.  

After Effects has nailed a lot of key basics needs. 

* Text animation is one of them. I totally tried hitting SHIFT-T (which brings up the parameters in the timeline *where I will be animating*.
* I wanted motion blur.  
* User request: I want *to scrub* on any parameter *in the timeline area.* 

At a deeper level, there are tons of existing After Effects projects.  Meaning Many people can't create motion graphics from scratch but can tweak existing motion graphic templates.

It'd be too difficult to read existing Adobe After Effects projects. 

The last reason it'll run into problems is that very few motion graphic artists I know use After Effects in its stock state. They heavily rely on third-party tools

Now, for our sister community /r/videoediting, it's totally functional. I could see someone using this over something in Resolve. But for professional editors, I don't see it gaining any real traction. 

Your exports are MP4 and PNG sequences—you need one video format that contains an Alpha. ffmpeg will do DNXHD/HR, and every flavor of it supports an Alpha channel.
Seems nice and thank you for it. How do you manage to host it freely?
This looks awesome…going thru it now!
How many developers worked on this?
This is amazing! Thank you so much!!!

Awesome, does it have a wire removal tool?
Can this work to generate an HD and larger sized alpha title or roll/crawl animations in sequential .png format?
I know it's minor, but the very first snag that caught me when playing with it was the inability to scrub values. Coming from an Adobe ecosystem (and most other animation programs function similarly) I don't want to just type in numbers, I want to be able to click on the property and drag my mouse to increase and decrease the value. It seems like a silly little thing, but not being able to do  a very common interaction that is intuitive and built into your muscle memory can be a major annoyance.
it would be perfect for motion graphics if there is a way to adjust the anchor point on a image or video file to animate it like for scale and rotation.  
some ideas I think would be amazing  
like a way to add ruler, title safe those sorta things in addition to grids. snapping to it.  
The possibility to parent layers to each other would be game changer.
Can i create maps and show navigation on them from A to B?
Or you can simply use DaVinci Resolve. 
[deleted]
Pikimov does not hold/save/upload video files from the users, that's how I am able to keep the hosting cost very low, by keeping files transfers to the bare minimum.
Just me, it's a side project I worked on in parallel to my full time job, but I hope to make it my main activity
Try Netscape Navigator???
[deleted]
People use opera? Firefox I get but Opera?
Not yet, do you have a video to share showing exactly what you expect as tool to remove unwanted elements ?
You can make crawl text animations with Pikimov, and export as a png sequence. Support for alpha channel in exported .png sequences will come very soon
I tried to implement it few months ago, but failed. I've just spent some more time on it, and I believe this time I got it right ! It will be implemented in the next update.   
Do you know the official name of this feature, or does everyone call it 'scrubbing' like you do ?

some kind of file management system after importing files. to arrange and search for that file.
As in Indiana Jones movies? You could achieve it with Pikimov, but there is no specific tool to do so
Thank you for your insights,

By posting about my editor on this subreddit I was hoping for genuine pro feedback like yours, this will help me understand better the target audience of Pikimov: for who is it really useful.
Thanks for the clarification.
The ability to develop something that advanced entirely on your own is SUPER impressive. You're a beast.
You mock me, Boy? I have a very cool 8mm film camera with 4 tapes here 🤣
The UX is really nice, you should try. But if you are a real nerd, try "Vivaldi" (is by the original team who made opera, they made it after opera had been bought by a Chinese team)

Looking forward to it. Best of luck on your Pik project!.
Yeah, live scrubbing is pretty much a standard terminology, like how you can "scrub" back and forth through a video on the timeline. Originally applied to playback, but also for being able to see results changing live in your viewport as you adjust the parameters in real time. You'll see people talk about scrubbing the playhead, scrubbing through the timeline, etc. I think the term goes back to the old analog days of reel-to-reel tape decks.

Just want to add, you're doing amazing work. Especially the 3D integration being such an intuitive, integral part of the workflow. Keep it up!

It would be great to build a template format. It will lower the threshold for entry level editors and entice ‘pros’ to make templates. I make MOGRTs for our editors to ensure a fast workflow and keep branding consistent. 
Thank you, I did not knew there were specific effects just for this use case
Scrubbing is now possible on all inputs, thank you for your support !
Does apple care cover this???
I accidentally spilled water on my Mac and the screen fell off, is this covered by apple care?
>I accidentally spilled water on my Mac and the screen fell off

I have questions 🤣
You can do the coolest thing ever connecting that to a monitor and use a keyboard-pc
I miss working IT being handed a laptop with a smashed in keyboard being told it “dropped.”
What sort of water was it? Asking for Putin
just make sure you have a really good excuse
AFAIK apple care (the paid one, right?) should take care of basically everything including you throwing your mac out of the window, am i wrong? I might  be
I would bring the other half, pull it out of your bag like that and pretend it happened out of nowhere. If you’re lucky, no one is gonna wanna take the additional 15 minutes to unpack just how that happened and chalk it up to an already weakened hinge on an already damaged unit scheduled for repair. 

Despite Apple as a company doing their best to make cashing in care coverage harder, the employees themselves tend to be super understanding. When I was MUCH younger I didn’t know that the touch pad wasn’t a real button when the haptics stopped working. I made an appointment, but being an idiot I tried to fix it myself by sticking a knife in the corners and trying to “unjam” what I thought was an actual button. I tore it up bad. Still being a stupid kid, when i arrive, I straight up tell them, “I think the button is depressed.” The genius putting 2 and 2 together after seeing that monstrosity, stops me right there and says never say it again, because he didn’t hear it. 

He told me to expect it back in 2 weeks and gave it one look that told me I introduced him to a whole new type of stupid. He then said he’d make sure it’s covered. He explained the actual mechanics that made it “click.” Probably to make sure I never had a reason to make a second attempt. He light heartedly mentioned if I hadn’t messed with it I could’ve walked out with it that day.

TL;DR Apple Store employees understand those things costs an arm and leg. If you don’t make a stink they usually do what they can to keep costs down.

Edit: grammar
I sense some [trolling](https://youtu.be/3m5qxZm_JqM)
Did you accidentally drag your Display icon into the Bin? That’s been known to happen.
I had to look at the picture a few times to understand that the screen was not there
Well, the front fell off in this case by all means, but it’s very unusual
It depends on what you mean by AppleCare.

Limited Warranty
If you mean the limited warranty? No, it is not covered. That is not a manufacturing defect. That would be considered Other Damage and would be an out of warranty repair.

AppleCare+ for Mac
If you mean AppleCare+ for Mac, then. this would be considered Other Damage and there would be a service fee.
„I accidentally spilled water on my mac and the screen fell off.“ 

W h a t ?
So you spilled water and the screen jumped off or what?
At first I thought the screen was out of frame, and then I wondered how your entire keyboard got installed upside down.
One question: HOW???
Nope, Laptop Screen covers it. Obviously!
AppleCare+ is an insurance and should cover this for a fee. AppleCare the warranty probably won't cover this.
Wow, is that the Vision Pro 2?
Yeah it’s covered just go to the Apple Store and swap it for one of the display models they’ll understand.
That screen was clearly hydrophobic.
You now have a lap not a laptop 🤣
Screen just doesn’t fall off from a water spill.
Top quality shitpost!!
omg 😳 i didn’t know this was possible
Mac Mini Air looking good
Is this the new Mac Mini?
Did you try turning it off and on again
I think you half covered
Do you still have the screen?
Is this a troll post?
Oh yes. That’s a feature of the new operating system. The screen eject happens when water is introduced to areas not supposed to be wet and will flash assuming you’re stranded, based on location of course. The keyboard base will expand the batteries and when you find enough wood, you pop the batteries and start a fire.
Yesn’t
I'm not sure you understand what the definition of water is. It is clearly being used incorrectly in your question.
The laptop can't even cover itself lol
Did you spill Niagara Falls on your MacBook?
Ah yes the new ~~Retina display~~
If you ask really *really* nicely
Technically yes as they cover accidental damage so they might
They'll cover it in a trash bag for you.
What the actual fuck did I just read how did the screen fell off over water damage?
Just use it with a external monitor…
Wow!!! The screen "fell" off?!?!   


Light googling suggests you need AppleCare+ for accidental damage protection. Both cases in regards to your Mac appear to be certainly accidental...
Uhhhh... Probably not.... I'll take it though, the people with the slabtops are smart
OP was definitely using a SportsDirect mug for their water
AppleCare+ covers any accidental damage so it should yes
AC+ covers catastrophic damage, but generally there is a minimum number of pieces of the device required. I.e you can’t show up with just a SIM tray and say your phone needs to be replaced. So, to give a serious response, you’ll want to call and see if theyll still service the device. 

Since this is a joke post, slabbook all the way
So, you spilled water on your laptop and the screen fell off? 
You need to concoct another story! 🙄Just saying!
OP is trolling. The display is attached securely by two hinges, how can it fall off just by getting wet? Doesn't make sense.
I hope they will🥲
screen fell off?
Connect it to external monitor.
Well, if you bring the screen yes.
Like this I don’t think so.
Ahhh, I think it is, actually.
Spilled water and screen fell off? Must be satirical.
sorry but this is so funny. its so related unrelated. :rofl:
You can actually tell us the truth about what happened.
What kind of water do you have 💀
That's just the newest Magic keyboard
A Mac beheading!
this dude
It took a few seconds to recognise what I see on the picture lol
I don’t think so. The fading color is not considered a defect.
Well it covers if the device remains unchanged (this one’s obvious 😂), didn’t you read the warranty document? 😅
Or is this a prototype of Apple’s first screenless device?
I accidentally split my MacBook Air into two pieces.
Loool! The real full-screen replacement! The same happened to me when I used a soft cloth to wipe the screen!
it's anti-tablet
You should be covered so long as you take all the broken bits with you to Genius Bar. If you rock up without a display, they won’t cover it because AppleCare on a Mac doesn’t cover loss.
No worries, take it to your closest Apple store and they will get it fix under AppleCare, of course paying the fee
If you have the screen you could try. That’s considered catastrophic failure and is not always covered under the AppleCare+

If you don’t have the display then NO they will not do anything for you. 

Also the screen does not fall off from liquid damage.
Water spilled and screen fell off. Can we go back to that please
Yeah sure!! They will cover you up with a sheet before beating the shit outta you for even trying.
I think apple care covers peripheral devices.
Now how the f did some water destroy hinges
What was the speed of the water when spilled on the Mac?
I have so many questions 🤯
Ehhh…
Lol what sort of water was it buddy?
Have you tried putting it in rice?
I- I can't tell if this is real or not hahaha. OP, I'm sure there's a very interesting story behind this.
Yes they usually cover the keyboard with a screen
Apple Care should take care of it. You might even get half off the cost!
You'll have to buy another.
Had client run over his new Macbook Pro by accident.

However, we had success taking to an authorized Apple repair dealer (Apple dealer who isn't an Apple store, lots of them are also authorized warranty repair shops) They sent in the parts one by one to Apple to basically get a new laptop.
It's covered.
Idk why you need to use Apple care. Just put in a bag of rice 🫨
Can someone tell how to do this, i have a old mac with flex gate, I don’t want to pay 400$ to fix it. But closing the screen needs 24-7 power for external display
A decapitated Mac? Well... you can forget Apple Care and take Care of it yourself by plugging the machine into a monitor you don't use.
Ah yes, the good old effervescent screens
What did you do, try to clean your MacBook using a pressure washer?
Don’t think so but a mounted replacement display unit should cover it just fine. 😂

The screen fell off.. interesting. 🤔😅

(Edit: typo)
Why is this beheaded?
USE IT AS A HEADLESS SETUP
Damn they make Mac Minis with a keyboard?! 😂
Spilled water from what? Blastoise's hydro cannons?
Have you tried restarting it?
if it was holy water they will cover it
Nice iPad keyboard
[It is a bit of a trend to have screenless laptops  There are people that have only under parts of laptops and they connect them to external screen.](https://youtu.be/3tSMc81w3SQ?si=QxRR0KTPulZsYOwr)
My god that hand scared me
Had to double take on flair to be sure!
If you have Apple Care+, they'd consider that liquid damage and charge you the chassis+screen replacement fee and probably replace the whole thing... Hopefully.
By "spilled water" do you mean at the bottom of the Hoover Dam?
You should bring it to the Genius Bar and ask them, LOL
Didn’t know there is button in front as well.
Sure. Why not? You pay the monthly apple care fee. Just arrange an appointment through Apple support app on another iOS device. Pretty sure there will be an incident fee (repair charge) but if you have Apple care it’s much cheaper.
Did it get hit with a pressure washer ?
Just say the newest update made it a 2 in 1 and that you want to go back to the old update.
I was just cleaning my MacBook screen with this high powered water cannon and the screen broke, no idea why
It's just a Mac now the book is gone 😂
Is this a shitpost or a genuine question
As long as your board and keyboard works.. .Just get a secondary display unless u dont have HDMI lol

but I dont think AppleCare will take care of that
Headless MacBook incoming
Mr… Banner? As you know Apple has a policy that AppleCare maxes out after ten smashed laptops. We’re really sorry, but we cannot replace this one.
Just glue the hinge back together and take it in for water damage

If the worker opens it and the screen falls back off just blame them!
...really
Screen less laptops are great but apple makes it super hard
I have seen PPL use this as perfect desktop setup
Damn, I hate when that happens.
$299
sorry bud, you spilled magic water on it, now it's a slabtop
wow, that's one thin screen. apple is sure the leader in innovation.
there are a subculture of people that prefer this, with an external display
I've been around Apple products for a very long time and I've never heard of water making a screen fall off, this will be the very first, if true.  I feel like something more happened however. You should be OK though and just have to pay the AppleCare deductible as long as you have the screen that fell off.
That's a reverse iPad
the computer still there, just a screen repair
Remember kids this isn’t your schools Chromebook!
For context some/most Chromebooks that schools give can fold into a tablet
Oh look, a Mac Mini with Keyboard, Battery and Trackpad, you've actually increased it's value
Clearly not this time because the front fell off but I want to make it clear that it’s not typical
I assume the water came from a open floodgate on a rainy day then?
bruh...
I am in physical and mental pain, I am going to go look for a therapist for the first time.
What?
😭😭😭😭
Took it surfing in Nazare
If you have apple care and they can identify the serial numbers they should be able to help you out.
AppleCare will cover it… large deductible but they will.
Ermmmm
Probably not, but a blanket surely can
The story just doesn’t add up lol you spilled water on it and the top half of the laptop was like “THATS IT.  IM OUT OF HERE”
How can your screen fall off… if you spill water on it….
Did you spill water on it and then snap it in half in rage?  Because that’s what this looks like
Looks like you spilled a tsunami. But AppleCare+ insurance should cover it, possibly with some extra fees because that is wild.
Yes it does actually, but they required you to pay a little fee of 1500£ and they will replace your laptop totally free... is for this that i love apple and always recommend to my friends to have an apple care for each of your products ✌️😁
Am I the only one who thought they put the keyboard on backwards?
Tis but a flesh wound
you may be able to get it replaced with a Magic Keyboard, at store managers discretion probably
I’m borderline sure that the MacBook has to be in one piece to be eligible for coverage under AppleCare plus
What am i missing here?
Your uncovering is definitely covered.
How does your screen just fall off? 
If you have AppleCare plus, it can be possible to have it covered with a deductible, however, it is not a guarantee that they will cover it.
oops.
“AppleCare+ for Mac extends your coverage from your AppleCare+ purchase date and includes unlimited incidents of accidental damage protection, each subject to a service fee of $99 for screen damage or external enclosure damage, or $299 for other accidental damage, plus applicable tax.”

https://www.apple.com/support/products/mac/
AppleCare doesn’t cover catastrophic damage or anything in multiple pieces
I want to ask how that happened?
Are you sure it was just spill damage? Looks like you sprayed a fire hose at your screen🤣
Maybe he was trying to FaceTime too close to the Niagara Falls?
On a serious note, it would only cover it if you have both parts 👍🏽
I'm not sure I wanna know how that happened, but I also wanna know how that happened.

No, the lid covers that.

No. Water damage revokes the warranty.
Yes, you need to bring the screen in as well. Worked for an AASP
Wtf kind of water is that???? Did you powerwash it or sum???
You may have just removed the computer's cover, you know...
u already loss this macbook cover 🤣
MF drinking acid?
Fuck no
If the bottom part is still working, you can connect it to a monitor.
💀😭
pull a mac address and turn that into a vision pro “prototype”
I don’t really know because it is accidental damage and AppleCare+ doesn’t cover that and if Apple still says they can’t cover it, make a claim because you have a right to do so under the Consumer Law Act, and also call the police
sure! just make sure you have apple care unless you want to pay a very cheap price i think it’s like 5 dollars for a screen replacement :-)
the plus side is now you have a free headless macbook and don’t have to meticulously take the screen out yourself, unfortunately, it’s a butterfly keyboard air, so it’s practically worthless
It's it will. You will be charged for the incident fee
I surely have questions.

What on gods holy earth do you mean by "spilt water" because how
It might cover it.
Of course
Where’s the top, Flopsey!?  What did you do with the top?!!!
Is this AirPlay?
Yep
That’s… that’s not what happens when you spill water on a MacBook..
If you have AppleCare+ For Mac:

Apple Care+ covers two incidents of accidental damage every 12 months for a reduced fee.  Wether the damage is for Water or some other source does not matter. 

As explained in the document you were reading when watching that video:

Link-> AppleCare Products - Mac - Apple

Up to two incidents of accidental damage protection every 12 months, each subject to a service fee of $99 for screen damage or external enclosure damage, or $299 for other accidental damage, plus applicable tax.

If no AppleCare+ for Mac, prepare to pay a hell of a lot more
Halfway covers.
Yea theyll cover it…. With a blanket
water as in acid?
👀😂
It’s a common issue, so what you need is a small stand, some salt and cotton buds. Then what you need to do is fairly simple. You just need to
I just went to the Apple Store yesterday with my MacBook and they told me that they would want to repair everything that’s wrong with it on a modular level. So basically they will take it in check out what’s wrong and bill you the deductible for everything that they deem necessary. They told me I would get billed for the edge of the bottom half being dented whether or not it was sent in with that being a requested repair. I wanted to get my display fixed because there’s a crack under the display (white pixels) and they replied with the aforementioned. I also bought the insurance with the computer so who knows. I’m going to call to see what’s up because I think that’s pretty fucked. I payed like 300$ for the insurance.
Looks like the front fell off.. I don’t hardly think it’s supposed to do that.
Not a MacBook anymore now it’s just a book
Headless Mac
I have so many questions I really don't know if I want answered
Yeah they’ll cover it and hit you on the face with it
LOL
Yes. Just tell them you have AppleCare——🤣
How does spilling water on your Mac make the screen detach? Did you do it a very long time ago and cause the hinges to rust? Other than that, I see absolutely no way that this could be the outcome.
Cleaning a Mac with a pressure washer has a whole new meaning!
Did you try putting it in rice
[The front fell off](https://youtu.be/3m5qxZm_JqM?si=NDgheu7k59n5eNog)
Did you spill water with a power washer 1 inch from the screen?!
Your thumb still attached? Your insurance wouldn’t cover THAT falling off
Yes they'll cover it with a garbage bag
MacBook without screen
What xD
Apple Don't **** Care.
Apple Care doesn’t cover water damage
This is covered by Apple Careless.
That’ll buff out. 😏
put it in rice
LOL!
Convert to mini.
That’ll definitely buff out
Never had apple care. But im guessing they should cover absolutely anything
They have to turn in the old part so probs not.
Damn your water most like those in anime that can even slice off a mountain 😂.
Was the water still in the 5-gallon container when it spilled on your Mac?
For the part that you still have, yes 😂
how tf did you behead your mac with water?
I'm sure apple care covers it. 4 easy payments of 499 should do the trick
with how many kidneys you had to sell to buy it, they better cover "water" damage
Do you know how hard it is to completely and cleanly remove the screen like that? Water damage you say?
I see an apple pie in perfect condition
The answer is in your title:

DOES APPLE CARE?
Bro went skydiving with it 😂
Oh! Sinclair has come out with a new model? 40 years later? Just plug it into your TV. Oh, and you'll need a cassette recorder.
This is “catastrophic damage” which AppleCare does not cover.
Apple Care Plus? Yes. Apple Care? No.
I don’t think so💀. Maybe use it as a "Headless MacBook" if it even turns on xD
it fell off?? looks like that was torn off💀
Sir that’s not a Microsoft surface.
Yes they do cover this with a ton of money😂
Maybe OP left it under a waterfall. lmao
« Accidentally spilled water in my Mac » when it was in the washing machine

Me too. About his mental health. This dude must have serious issues. lol

You don’t use your MacBook in the hot tub? Only think I can imagine heating the glue enough.

How MUCH water?  D A Y U M
If you purchased Apple Care, then yes, you should be covered.
Seems pretty straightforward. The front fell off.
so, so many
Ah yes, the Apple IIz.
OP took clamshell mode literally
ah the Mac sans book
This guy had enough water damage that his *screen fell off.* Something tells me an external monitor won’t solve this.
Does it work? I mean iPhones lock themselves if the display is third party, let alone loosing the screen on Mac, won't it lock itself even if it manages to boot?
Welcome to [halftop!](https://www.reddit.com/r/halftop/s/KEjY49RijZ)
I have done this
Not really the coolest thing ever but sandly more like the most common thing ever for Apple product users, as in most cases it is the only solution other than buying a new one, or paying the price of a new one to get it repaired.
Didn’t realize that was the coolest thing ever
Other than the water damage 🤷‍♀️
Yep same.  Several times over my 20 years in IT have I been handed something that looks like it’s been sent through a wood chipper and the user says “oopsies I dwopped it” or “yeah I spilled a coke on the keyboard” and it smells like Jack Daniel’s
sounds like the equivalent of hospital ED staff hearing someone that comes in for removal of an object up their rectum: 'I slipped and fell on it'
Heavy water.
water fall?
*putin
Niagara falls
Hard water
Yeah like spilling water accidentally
Yeah that I spilt water on it excuse I ain’t buying tbh
Nope, there is something they call catastrophic damage they don't cover. Basically they just cover liquid spill, broken screen, that type stuff.

Had client run over his new Macbook Pro by accident.

However, we had success taking to an authorized Apple repair dealer (Apple dealer who isn't an Apple store, lots of them are also authorized warranty repair shops) They sent in the parts one by one to Apple to basically get a new laptop.
You're right. You just need to be able to bring the matching device in store and to pay for the damage fee (approx. 100 € here in Europe)!
[deleted]
Intentional damage is not covered. Fell out a window? Fine. Threw it out the window? Denied service.
[removed]
Only accidental damage. Their examination can determine whether it appears intentional or not
It doesn’t include intentional damage and you might need both halves of the computer.
$299 if they need to fix/repair or replace components with AppleCare+
To be fair, I think to this day a lot of people have absolutely no idea the touchpad's click isn't a mechanical switch under it like virtually anyone else does it including recently released other brand machines.
> Despite Apple as a company doing their best to make cashing in care coverage harder, the employees themselves tend to be super understanding.

My wife dropped a slice of toast on her MacBook keyboard, jam side down. Tried cleaning it, managed to get it mostly clean but unfortunately broke the spacebar and couldn't clip it back on. 

Took it to a local Apple Store and told the employee everything. It was a butterfly keyboard and he said he'd put down that we bought it in for sticky keys and they'd just replace it under the keyboard replacement program. He put on the form that they broke the spacebar trying to fix it in store.

So yeah, if you're polite and they're feeling generous, the employees might look after you.
Did the motor stop working? Are they using a cheap motor of something? I'd expect those haptic things to last forever basically.
This is the most funny and relatable and accurate thing I’ve ever witnessed about any company
Hah.
The screen has waterfobia or sum
Ahh you crack me up mate xD , are you a dad by any chance?
*Display sold separately
So much for a lap without a top, this thing will turn into a desktop (will sit on top of a desk) 😅

yes it works. You can find examples by searching displayless macbook on youtube. 

https://youtu.be/uOigVjqW7hc?si=dS37h4mejTtoBOJK
They don’t lock themselves. Modern iPhones lose True Tone and warn you that the display isn’t original if you do a third party display repair.
Connecting to a third party display is a supported feature regardless. The Mac doesn’t stop working if the screen is missing. But it’ll obviously stop working if there’s water damage in the logic board.
It works, it’s a very popular mod in some tech offices, though it’s being supplanted after the Mac Mini started getting MacBook Pro performance.
I got one setup and use as daily drivet
> iPhones lock themselves if the display is third party

No they don’t. They lock themselves if the biometrics are third party (and the face recognition sensors are glued to the screen glass).

Also, the “lock” just disables face recognition. You can still use the phone with a PIN code to unlock it.
I just meant how it looks
I would treat them like kids. “Tell me the truth I won’t get mad.” If they did, they got a good loaner, if not…well enjoy the T400
I mean people usually mix Jack Daniel’s with coke, so it wasn’t *technically* a lie
They just didn't tell you that they dropped it into the wood chipper.
Oooohhhh nooooo
MacBook of Thesius
noting this for the future, thanks for sharing
Well, OP claims this is a liquid spill issue.
When I worked at the Genius Bar many years ago I only ever denied one device for catastrophic damage, and escalated to Apple Engineering to confirm. I’m not sure about now, but back then it took a lot to fall under catastrophic damage. You’d basically need to bring in only a minor portion of the device.

In my one case it was a customer who claimed their phone randomly combusted. It had very clearly been cut in half. They weren’t under warranty/AppleCare anyway, and were demanding a free replacement, and then lastly were asked to leave and were referred to Apple Legal when they threatened legal action.
So OP needs to go in, smash a macbook till the screen falls off, and then he can have that?

got it
oh i didn't know about the damage fee, good to know it before lol
This would be a full swap of $300 us translated to euros
But will they replace? I mean they can’t repair something that is not there anymore. Don’t they at least want the screen even if it’s detached?
Define “major components” 😆
Damn. But the only thing that remained of my MacBook after the explosion... I mean when I spilled juice on it was the spacebar. Shouldn't bringing just the spacebar be enough evidence for a new computer. It's all because of the dooj button... I mean juice that I spilled.
This is the correct answer.
Taken as is - will NOT be covered.  Find the display
ofc but when you can't tell intentional from unintentional basically it applies too , right?
yes right, I was assuming a unintentional looking damage
that both halves thing is quite worrying. For example i beheaded a MacPro with a kick by mistake and i had both of the pieces but my first reaction was like throwing the screen away.
I mean I don’t think anyone but Apple has the touchpads with this design. Feel free to tell me if you know of someone else whose touchpad is haptic rather than mechanic.
Nobody, not even apple store employees, are naturally unpleasant people. In my time in (pc) retail we would do stuff like this all the time, if we were able to sell it upstream. Since the butterfly keyboard debacle was a no-questions-asked-upstream kind of repair, it was a good umbrella to cover these things. It doesn't cost the employee anything and it will give him the reward of being very helpfull.

However, AppleCare is an insurance, and lying about these kinds of things can be considered insurance fraud. So the story has to be believable.

OP could for example (if he still has the other half) sell this as a "part 3 of the encyclopedia fell from a shelf above" since as far as I know MacBook hinges don't do any hinging above about 110 degrees. Bring the encyclopedia for believable effect.

Or dropped it on it's face whilst openened and stepped/stumbled on it whilst trying to catch it.
It was the 2009 MPB 13’, which I believe was the last model to ship with an internal optical drive. I wasn’t as technical at the time so I don’t know for sure, but I was under the impression trackpad failure was more common for that model than later iterations.
Haha! You thought someone around their 50s typed this? Not yet mate Not yet!
For just $2999!

Bullet 3. The distinguisher is what caused the damage. One of the bullet states fire, flood, earthquake aren’t covered (my store did it anyway), but otherwise the disqualifying factors are the ability to identify the device and generally whether the damage was intentional or is a biohazard. Outside of that, we processed just about everything.
Good to know!

Yes, I’m simply cautioning consumers to ensure that they use the proper language when seeking help under AppleCare. The T&Cs state that intentional damage disqualifies the product from service.
The Dell XPS 13+, IIRC
What does haptic mean?
I had a trackpad stop working on a Mac because the battery budged. Which in turn bulged because of poor heat management by macOS.
Now I'm disappointed, what's a dad joke without a dad telling it :( but thanks for the laugh mate !
Because you can only have kids after you’re 50.

3. What is not Covered?

3.1 Hardware Service and ADH Service

(b) to protect against excessive or catastrophic physical damage to Covered Equipment (e.g., products that have been crushed or bent) or excessive or catastrophic damage to Covered Equipment caused by liquid contact (e.g., products that have been partially or wholly submerged in liquid);

r/SubsIFellFor
For half the price
Yep I've used a Mac without a display assembly in the past.
did you "smash" the macbook the other way?
Oh really? That’s interesting. I wonder what chip is the controller for the haptics (on T2 MacBooks I know it’s the T2 chip itself, on M1 likely the CPU proper)
I have a Dell Precision 16 that has this too.
It refers to the fact that instead of being something that actually moves down or up it instead just vibrates when you press on it to tell you that it detected the press (but otherwise the actual surface of the trackpad remains at the exact same level).

That thing provides a few things, like the ability to detect two separate pressure levels (Force Touch) and the ability to click from all corners without it getting stuck.
I know what you’re talking about. It could be, but I don’t remember the battery being switched with that. I’m more familiar with that issue on MacBook Air models. Specifically the 2011 one
Hahahaha! 😂
Bro…age limit is only for females.
Yeesh I left my reading comprehension skills at home this morning 

What’s wild is we still covered that stuff. Just sent it to depot and quoted customers the highest tier rate. Unless it was a biohazard it would get fixed
Well English *is* a Germanic language.
r/foundthetoyotacorolla
Ah damn. I was wondering why I got charged for sexual assult and indecent exposure
Non T2 Macs with haptic trackpads had haptic trackpads.
Yes, it took Apple until 2020s to finally introduce Low power mode and to limit battery charging to 80%, which is a joke — these features have been available in ThinkPad and other laptops for decades. Apple was once again late to the party.

Honestly, there should be a class action lawsuit about the bulged batteries that made the trackpad unusable all because Apple thought its users are too dumb to want to control the heat or stop topping up the battery to 100% all the time.
Your joke was about dads. Tell me how I misinterpreted it.

that's harsh dude, next time you smash one be sure to do it in your bedroom, just like me!
Yeah, I wonder who controlled the trackpad haptics there.

I actively remember some issues on my old T2 Mac where the T2 would freeze up and haptics would be even 10 seconds delayed, and sometimes the freeze is so bad a watchdog is triggered.
Yeah yeah it’s a dad joke. What about I’m having kids after 50? I didn’t get that.
Really? I was there from 2018 until 2022 and can’t remember a single time that occurred. I had devices run over by vehicles, damaged in a flood, even one that got snapped backwards ~somehow~ and the user snapped it back the other way at the GB so it could ship. Tier 4 took care of it.
Awe man, I give up.
That being said in this case I wouldn’t service a slab book since half the device is missing - but for all else it was basically “if it fits it ships,” so long as we could verify the serial number.

Sold my M1 iMac for $500, I kind of regret it now
I bought my iMac about year ago $950 before tax! Today I sold it for $500 because I am preparing money for upcoming 16inch MacBook Pro 32gb ram! But the iMac screen is so pretty and over design is pretty too! But the mouse is unpleasant to use! I sold it $500, kind regret now! Please tell me if $500 is low or high? Thanks 
Honestly far too low!
https://preview.redd.it/4dw14bkme0ud1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c89a0c08825856da901b358b94eda39723acea47

I saw a post earlier where someone was over the moon that they bought a M1 for 500. Is that yours? They are already celebrating it.
You sold it because the mouse is unpleasant to use? Y'know you can just buy one of a million external mice online, right?
You lowballed yourself. I wouldn’t have sold it at all, tbh.
Is it just me, or does the yellow kind of look like gold?

I swear, the current iteration of the iMac is absolutely gorgeous…
I also sell my computers for cheap because I don't like the mouse
That buyer got a great deal. Should’ve asked here first or at least any research before selling
A few months ago I got an iMac M3 8/256 10GPU/4USBC/ethernet/touchkeyboard for $870-ish at Microcenter, open box, with warranty.  IMHO, that's the sort of deal that represents the upper end of the market.

Given that, you might get $500-$700 range for a used, out of warranty M1 iMac, if you can find the right buyer, so I think what you got is on the low side, but if you got rid of it easily and didn't need to meet in any dark streetcorners, for example, there's some value in that.

Apple gives $300-ish for these, so it's better than their pricing.

eBay suggests pricing is around $500 (https://www.ebay.com/itm/335460775639), but I see $115 shipping (WHEW!), so take that into consideration and shop around for other comps.  I suspect $600-$700 is about what a mature market (like ebay) would give, but note you (the seller) pays lots of fees, plus the inherent risk in a remote transaction.

So, you didn't do bad.
yall trippin saying $500 is too low. It’s an m1, it’s several years old from release date, doesn’t matter how long OP used it for. No one’s gonna buy it at $800. Maybe op could’ve sold at $600 but $500 is fair price.
I may have uncovered the mystery of who bought it:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/s/OyeqKgJuiA
I saw the other post back to back, hilarious 😂
That was a steal for whomever snagged it! I paid $400 for a 2017 27" iMac (for the display, basically).
You used it, and it is 3 years old from initial release date. I would say $500 is a reasonable amount.
Way too low
Well. Isn't it too late to write this post? Answers will make you regret about it, just let it go.
Love that color
I have the same one with 16GB ram + 10 core GPU. I also bought the matching extended keyboard, "magic" mouse and trackpad. Ended up switching to a mechanical keyboard, and only use the trackpad or third party mouse. The gold keyboard and Magic Mouse are collecting dust now. Looks like we both wasted some money! lol 😅

Seriously though, how has this mouse been around for so long? Ergonomic nightmare!!
Someone got the deal of a lifetime.

And yeah, that mouse sucks ass. Get something from Logitech.
I think a fairer price to you and potential buyers would’ve been 650 as M1 is still stronger than the iMacs of old. And M series don’t depreciate as exponentially as Intel series
[Mouse issue was fixed...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3lNrRydr4g)
look at OP post history. I don’t feel bad at all and OP should be happy to make someone else happy
I would’ve given you $350. So don’t feel bad.
I don't think you could have gotten much more for it, given it is second hand, has an older chip and while I like the yellow I am sure it lowered the number of potential buyers, still the guy you sold it to, struck a very sweet deal. Now how good the deal was for them depends how much storage it has, if it had the base 256 GB I think the price is very fair and I would have given you less, but if it had 512 GB or up, I think this is acceptable. Though I must say selling such a machine because you dislike a very easily exchangeable accessory is wired. Well what's done, look forward to your new machine (though personally I would have waited until after the release).
There’s a bunch of them for $730 on Amazon right now refurbished, so I’d presume it may have sold at $600, but $500 isn’t terrible!
Just bought a purple of the same computer a week ago. They listed it for $850. I offered $650 cash next day and they accepted. I’m sure some people can hold out longer for more cash, just wanted to give some perspective on an actual sale I just participated in.
I would just get a Logitech mouse if it came down to not liking a mouse.
I bought one for $600 cad about 5 months ago
That the buyers post XD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1g0tn9s/sucker\_sold\_me\_an\_m1\_imac\_for\_500/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1g0tn9s/sucker_sold_me_an_m1_imac_for_500/)
High for something 4 years/gens old IMO.
Definitely lowballed the price. What a steal.
Is this a troll? You could just have bought a decent mouse....
You could have sold it for $350
I always look at what the going rate is for whatever I’m selling before picking a price. eBay has some terrific tools for researching how much people have actually paid for a product. That way can you see what is realistic and set your price accordingly.
Damn bruh, at least research the resale value prices, before selling these off, especially Apple computers/hardware, Honestly even if you would have sold it at around 750-850$ it would have pretty much been quite a good deal for both you and the buyer too..... 500$ is just way way too low....
No way I just saw the post from the guy who just bought it hahahaha.
The monitor display itself would be worth $500!
I just recently caught a steal got me a m3 MacBook Pro for $500
Considering that low RAM is putting unnecessary wear on the SSD in the long term, I may say it's better you go after the upgrade even after losing some $100-200 short term. In life you lose some and gain some. It's a zero sum game.
Who on Apple's design team decided that piss yellow was a good color, let alone good enough to put it on a product and sell it to the general public? It's not even a healthy piss yellow, it's like they haven't drank any water for an entire day and that's their pee color the morning after. That's not even mentioning the useless ginormous chin on the thing. At least other all-in-ones use it for forward facing speakers. 

Probably one of the ugliest computers I've ever seen by far.
I’ll never forgive Apple for what they did to the iMac.
At least you probably made someone very happy when they bought it
the display alone is worth that much.
You also could have bought a track pad and a much cheaper and better 3rd party mouse elsewhere.
Wel… you should compensate your feelings knowing that made somebody very happy on getting that bargain
Doesn't matter....you already sold it.
You're the kind of person I look for on Facebook marketplace lol
Someone loves your generosity 🙏🏻
Basically, I never sold any of my computers. Just keep it.
There’s a bunch of reports about those displays breaking. You might have done alright.
You sold the computer because you didnt like the mouse? Lol

Also 500 is extremely low
Why
One way to amend the regret: Buy a new M3 iMac!
I’ll buy it for $550.
Have you heard of display issues on these?
Slightly off topic. 

That color looks amazing. While I still wouldn’t buy one in that color just because I prefer white and that fits in better in most places, the slight goldish shine to it looks absolutely amazing.
wtf? Why?
You did the right thing. Best to have somebody continue to use it.
Low!
I regret that you didn't sell the iMac to me for $500
Eh sold my mini M1 a while back and I’m regretting it too
Friend, do you hate money??
That's a beautiful color too!
Shoulda donated it to a school or a non-profit. You’d probably get more value that way.
Yeah, the price is too low but you’ll appreciate having a better computer, hooked up to a larger screen and using a real mouse
Dream home server right there. Just need some storage
Did you buy another computer for $500  ?
Sounds like it is time to get an M3 iMac.
I am selling a Mac mini m2 512gb in this price if you are interested!
wow, that’s a beautiful machine
Yeah, you definitely sold that a bit too low


I absolutely prefer having a desktop computer to do things like photo editing and playing games and then a laptop for doing stuff on the go 

(I only have a mid 2010 iMac though which is painfully slow although hopefully I will upgrade at some point)



Personally, I don’t have much of an issue with the Magic Mouse (except the stupid charging port) but I’m 16 so I don’t have particularly big hands so 🤷‍♂️
If the M1 had 8gb of RAM, I wouldn't worry about it. Probably gave someone a deal but your experience will be so much better with 32gb of RAM.
They’re too small for me, why won’t they come out with a 27” or 30”?
That's a beautiful imac, though! Never seen the yellow one. I wish they had these colours for the laptops!!
if you check facebook marketplace for that same model, what's the price? once you know what the second-hand marketplace is, you can price your product.
wtf no
But, your post got 400+ karma and wasted time of other Redditors got to be worth more than another  $500, right :)
my costco had them discounted for 450$ so its pretty fair
well. what is done. done.

next, M4 iMac?
it's a beauty just a slab of metal mmm
Pretty!
[mouse fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sb3jjenvoA)
You made someone very happy and lucky
I have MBP Intel  i7, 16GB RAM ( battery service required ), how much should I sold it for???
Mouse issue: the magic trackpad is fantastic and tons better.
Sounds a little low. I have a 2019 MacBook Air similar color to that iMac and I actually connected a monitor to it (27inch) and use a mouse and keyboard like it’s a desktop because I wanted a bigger screen. But I always wanted more ram. Isn’t that one you’re talking about like $2400? I know my MacBook m1 is about $500-$600 because I checked eBay. And that is not as good as your iMac m1 I don’t think. Not sure though I guess it would be worth it. Even Apple offered me about $350 to trade mine in. But if I get a new air m3 it’s only about $1000 on sale with 16gb ram.
Sold a 2018 15' Macbook Pro yesterday for $480 :P
M1 iMacs are like 1000 dollars and here where I am a 1000 euros
That’s a great deal since also includes screen . Great deal .

m1 mini is already  $300 used
Such a gorgeous machine and in such great condition. You got ripped OP
To be frank you did fine.  People buy iPhones for 1400 each year.  Then they see the new one and trade you only to get half their initial cost back.  If you enjoyed using the computer while you essentially leased it. 
Now you’ll have a better piece of equipment.
You definitely priced it too low.
Love that machine. Unfortunately, it is too limited in terms of size and power for me.
Wth 500 dollars?
Why sold it? Can use as spare for like stream radio or watch video on it besides using main computer.
That’s a beautiful piece of art!
So you are prepping money for a disposable mac, why not get a ryzen 4nm laptop with linux right now for a fraction of the price? 32 or 64gb ram is gonna be around $100, a removable fast ssd, better engineered cooling. Can always be upgraded to a better screen (you can even go for an oled panel btw).
I can't bring myself to buy a 24' iMac coming from the 27" one.
I still miss my i7 iMac.  I have no use for it and nowhere to put it, but it was a beast and looked great on my desk.
I'll take it for $501 right now
You got anything else you’re trying to sell??
Next time you want to sell such stuff DM me first
Any buyers for M2 pro mac mini 2023?
The lowest I’ve seen someone sell it was for around 500, so your good
Too low, and not liking a mouse is no reason to sell a Mac, they can use any mouse ever made even for a PC. I've never sold a Mac. I have a stack of them that I pull out for specific uses now and then.
I’ve sold mine around half a year ago for 900€ (although it wasn’t the base model), and I got to keep my peripherals!
$500???! 😭
eBay says ~650 before shipping and fees so 500 isn't that bad since fees are like 14% and shipping it would cost you anywhere from 50 to 100.
If it has already been sold, not sure it really matters, right?
Why worry about something you can’t change.
Lol, there was another post saying that bought a iMac for 500usd from a sucker.
500 is low I would sell it for 650-750
[https://www.ebay.com/itm/146037137754?\_skw=imac+m1&itmmeta=01J9YEFFE5HANQ08WQMSR5K7R8&hash=item22007de15a:g:i6EAAOSwKWhm3qtz&itmprp=enc%3AAQAJAAAAwHoV3kP08IDx%2BKZ9MfhVJKlR%2FsWLeMSfxa9sE3Hu%2FX2BuPaF7KsaBR8dlQH33skBl7%2BM7XYQ4TyaMM9Qhca%2Bi4WA61aqopx3yrTEoWuD%2BX2JkfEOhiPqZuPAg7LHSlCZ4gDqegZQ6eoJuq9G1tl5XKIGl1DC9U9sxXuSPZybkatSE6xlaLeJzKX8iiuy9Q0q8WCT%2BW6%2BWxDH5Q%2BDutH%2BTTiBVKRgh11rWbxhZa0%2FvMQcfA7OHGkbYThMEBGH6ninSA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR5j3vc7PZA](https://www.ebay.com/itm/146037137754?_skw=imac+m1&itmmeta=01J9YEFFE5HANQ08WQMSR5K7R8&hash=item22007de15a:g:i6EAAOSwKWhm3qtz&itmprp=enc%3AAQAJAAAAwHoV3kP08IDx%2BKZ9MfhVJKlR%2FsWLeMSfxa9sE3Hu%2FX2BuPaF7KsaBR8dlQH33skBl7%2BM7XYQ4TyaMM9Qhca%2Bi4WA61aqopx3yrTEoWuD%2BX2JkfEOhiPqZuPAg7LHSlCZ4gDqegZQ6eoJuq9G1tl5XKIGl1DC9U9sxXuSPZybkatSE6xlaLeJzKX8iiuy9Q0q8WCT%2BW6%2BWxDH5Q%2BDutH%2BTTiBVKRgh11rWbxhZa0%2FvMQcfA7OHGkbYThMEBGH6ninSA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR5j3vc7PZA)

  
Check ebay sold listings. I'd say your price was a little low for the condtion but not a steal. All people in Europe need to understand that the prices very a pretty good bit between there and the USA. The one I linked above has some blemishes and missing peripherals but still I've seen them around 400-600 USD depending on condtions and via auctions on Ebay.
Id regret it too at that price point lmao.
You know that mice are swappable right?
Man, I sold my M1 Mac Mini, just the box, for $480 a few weeks ago. 

I didn’t need a desktop since I work from home and it used all that space. Got a certified refurbished MacBook Air M2 to replace it.
Just decided not to buy an iMac M1 second hand because of the display issues at the moment.
Honestly you did the right thing, priced to sell, buyers less fussy, not taking up space in your place, made someones day, everyone wins
It’s ok keep those 500 wait a year they won’t even be worth that much.  every year something new you’ll be alright.
Oh man. I’m sorry. I feel your pain. I regret just selling my M1 Air. I have several problems with my M3 Air. Well, I hope we leaned from our mistakes! Hopefully you have better luck with your next purchase and that all will work well for you!
500$ is a great price. Let me explain… As a young guy who barely got anything expensive and an iMac is a dream, if I was the buyer to buy it from you for that price I would pray to god every day that you are healthy and happy, because you made me infinitely happy. Some money you lost today, double or triple will faith give back to you in the perfect time for you. Be happy and never regret for money. Money are instrument, they come and go.
Easily could’ve done $750-800 but the m4 iMacs should be coming out soon
I sold mine for $500, too. I liked it a lot, got a special keyboard and mouse for it. I only sold it low so it would sell fast. Spent the $500 toward a MacBook (so much better for me since I work full time and I’m a student and there are days I can’t get home until 8:30pm). Honestly, I thought I might regret it, but I got a nice monitor for docking and I have a steam deck I can switch to for gaming. 

Whatever makes you happy!
$500 sounds cheap. But also $950 sounds cheap to begin with. Did you buy it used? My MacBook M1 Pro was like $1400 and I bought the base model.
Nope. That’s $500 toward an M4 anything.
Definitely too low. I personally would've started at around $750-800. The mouse definitely isn't for everyone but I personally don't mind it. I just hate how they've kept the charging part on the underside of it for all these years smh
are you insane
oops. If it's any consolation, I sold a Nippon Kogaku 5cm 1.1 rangefinder lens for 350,000 yen just before Covid only for collectors items to spike a few months later and they now sell for over 700,000....

We all do stupid sht from time to time.
I’d kill to have that m1 in yellow. Unfortunately most eBay listings uk are silver. Using my 2015 4K retina till the screen craps out. I only use it for video watching and general internet browsing but works like a 3 year old computer
Where I am from (North Macedonia) a 2012 iMac is about 350 400 ish dollars
. You have sold it for way to low
You can always get another Mac mini later.
wow! It is so beautiful in person!
As a guy with a blue iMac and a fairly muted colour tone sense of style that yellow iMac is beautiful in person
Yup even with 16 GB RAM and 500GB Mac2sell has this machine at $900. So probably about $200 low.

Yan not crazy about the Magic Mouse myself but love the Magic Trackpad1
My M2 Ultra Mac Studio I paid 4000 for is apparently now worth like 400 in trade in
That’s not bad. There’s a lot of those for sale go around $400-500
You sold it at an honest price, in my opinion. Every computer tends to depreciate in purchase value the very moment you bought it. And especially if new models have come out.

Consider that your very same model, refurbished by Apple, is on sale at their site at $1,229 before taxes, but that means that the computer has been checked, revised, parts have been replaced, etc. If you take the profit out of the price (generally 30%) you go down to $850 that you should divide by two if you consider wear and tear. 425 dollars is the actual used value.

When it comes to Macs, please do not listen to all those who say you sold it at a lower price than you should have. Selling used Macs is far more difficult than selling used PCs, because after all, the Mac is still a machine used by a market niche. I can tell by personal experience: I have used, owned, changed and sometimes snubbed Macs since 1991.  So, if you need to make a fast sale, it will have to be a bargain for the buyer.

Also, like every iMac with the new design, unified RAM cannot be upgraded. That is one of the reasons why I still keep my old iMac 27" as a backup computer -- it is still good but the resale value is zero, because the Intel processors have been deprecated, the design has become stale, you name it.

I have spent a hefty amount of money for a Mac Studio and I am quite glad, for now. But I also have to be certain that it has already decreased in market value. Not an issue for me, as long as it works reliably for an average lifespan of 5 years, possibly 10. That's what really matters in the Mac world.
Yikes
Not to state the obvious, but did you explore a trade-in with Apple? Personally, I got tired of using Ebay and Facebook Marketplace and the dishonesty that goes on there. I've been stung more than once.

I realize I'm leaving money on the table, but I now trade in Apple devices when I'm ready to upgrade. You would have received about the same amount of money and had it directly applied to your new MacBook Pro.
Honestly trade ins will only give you like $300 so I think you got a good deal. I also hate the damn Magic Mouse, the trackpad makes things better but I end up using my MacBook the most anyways.
I love my M1 iMac, it’s slow as hell for anything other than basic tasks but it’s so beautiful haha
I don't know where are people like you when I am looking to buy something...
It's a lousy 8GB/256GB base model.  You're lucky you sold it at all.
Sunk cost/opportunity/whatever. Move on...
How much did it cost you? Lets guess 3x500 at least. 

You did not like the mouse???? Trackpad exists, other mices exist, heck, get both a new mouse and trackpad. 

I am really trying hard not to use the word “stupid” to describe what you did….but hey, take it as a life lesson. The fact you cant tell if its was a bad deal tells me you are well financially, so I guess next time you will check resell price and ask here or a friend when unsure.
That’s cheap.
I’ll buy one when they ditch the chin.
Ok
Damn 🤧 where I live 500$ will barely get you a 2015 27” imac
I think you were lucking to sell it… that colour is definitely an acquired taste.
How much is the fair price
I agree
To be honest, people are cheap when they buy used stuff. In my experience, it’s hard to sell at a reasonable higher price. I was unable to get a good price for my old Apple Watch cause the majority of buyers felt it was like the Fitbit and shouldn’t be worth more than a hundred bucks used even if it’s a higher end model. The premium bands they don’t care at all. But I agree the price he got is way too low.
500 is great price.. dude I would of bought it lol
I posted that as a joke.
Lmfao that’s hilarious if they are connected
I saw that earlier too. Interesting to see both sides of this deal.
He said the mouse is unpleasant to use - not that he is selling it because of the mouse. He is selling it because he is preparing to buy the 16inch MacBook Pro
"Today I sold it for $500 because I am preparing money for upcoming 16inch MacBook Pro 32gb ram!"


i didn't like the mouse ≠ i sold it because of the mouse
Troll post
Average Apple user.
I know! But my main goal is for the upcoming M4 MacBook Pro
How much is the fair price
Damn right, the golden color is gorgeous that’s why I regret
> Today I sold it for $500 *because I am preparing money for upcoming 16inch MacBook Pro 32gb ram!*


they didnt sell it because of the mouse dude
Apple users when their shit isn't expensive anymore.
Same, I don’t like to use it when hands is wet and have to left the mouse often
Damn you are right! The buyer is giggling 🤭 now! Probably
Bro, you got good deal, in nutshell, if I want sell fast, I need make good deal for buyer! Vice versa
Ok, fair enough, but it’s gorgeous, still the same design today
Nah, I sold an 8 year old Intel iMac for the same amount last week. Buyer got a deal.
Whaaaaatttt!🤣🤣🤣🤣
yep, people 

    gloat
This makes me feel regret even more! The buyer must be giggling 🤭 now! Damn it! I hope she can return it to me
Okay
How much is the fair price
Sadly truth
Yes  golden is gorgeous
Yes! I like i9 like speed, apps jump in suddenly after clicking not iMac like bounce and open it! The mouse is bad, the display is gorgeous
I bet the buyer she’s giggling 🤭 now! And she asked me if I have any other things to sale
$350, I will reply you this emoji 🤣
It’s 8GB 256GB! It’s gorgeous that’s why I regret! The design still new and performance is great! Still best all in one pc in the market for just $500! It’s second hand, but still like new no any outside damage at all
Okay, thanks for the comfort
Okay, I fell better now
I asked buyer to return back to me
No he’s dead serious 🤣 I’m dying of laughter reading through OPs comments
If anyone is wondering, decent peripherals to replace this garbage:

- Keychron M1 Mouse

- Keychron K3V2 (but NOT the red optical switches, they misfire all the time, I had to return these and get mechanical brown instead)

Both use USB-C detachable to charge, or to even use wired. They can be used whilst charging (I'm looking at you, Apple).

The keyboard can pair to three Bluetooth devices.

The mouse to two bluetooth devices and one included USB receiver (USB-A and USB-C receivers included).
Magic Trackpad to the rescue!

After using a MacBook for years, and switching to an iMac, I didn’t wasted money on a Magic Mouse, but ordered the iMac with a Magic Trackpad from the start.
😂😂😂
Damn it
how much is your budget?
Oh ok cool
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I manage hundreds of these for a living. No display issues after 3 years.
I have one. Pre-ordered when they were announced. No screen issues at all
😆, first comment makes me smile
TBH, iMac mouse can’t do much productive work! How much is the fair price?
He said the mouse is unpleasant to use - not that he was selling it because of the mouse. He is selling it because he is preparing to buy the 16inch MacBook Pro
Because the golden iMac is gorgeous
iMac with the Magic Mouse isn’t productive! I am waiting for m4 MacBook Pro!
Ok
No, I have used for years, no issues
Indeed, gold is gorgeous! That’s why I am regretting now
Too low?
Okay
Ok
lol, where are you 🤣
Same boat
Indeed
Already sold!
Anything people surf online is basically waste of time
Where? $450 Canadian?
16 M4 pro MacBook Pro,
MacBook Pro built in trackpad is quick as hell
indeed
https://preview.redd.it/wkvz5zgwa2ud1.png?width=358&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2683149bbc55267a7e0b3a14ecbfe53de0e1542

This exists... in matching colours.
Bulky, fan noise, trackpad not good, speaker not good, screen not good, all plastic, I hate Win PC sometimes suddenly wake up, login need password, keyboard not good as Mac. Also heavy machine! And so on
😂😭😂😭😂😭
Yes, but don’t want invest more money into it anymore
What display issues next to it's size are you talking about?
lots of good points
What issues did you have with the m3 air?
Indeed
True, $500 is stupid low! I bought around $1000 total! I was rising money for M4 MacBook Pro
Okay
Golden is gorgeous
oh my Lord! only $500!! the 2015 imac retina are still going for £600 at least in england so around $750 dollars
A year old...M1, I'd start $100 below original price not including taxes and take $25 increments down from there
Where did you sell it? I sold my purple M1 for about $950 just a few months ago.
Sold mine for $800 with a mouse! That’s ummm…. unfortunate but it is what it is!
I got one on the market currently for 800 and getting lots of interest FYI.
I would say around 650 or 700 just because of how convenient it is to have the screen built-in- Compare it to an M1 Mac mini, and a similar display, the iMac display is so good that nothing really compares to it on any one machine
Wait. Was this on eBay a week ago?
Bro, regrets selling it though
Pretty cool of OP to let the buyer use his picture too.
Don’t get the same mouse for the MacBook then
An Apple TrackPad is about $140.
Okay..? Then get a trackpad for the computer?
Your price is so fair that we are now waiting for someone to post a happy "I have just purchased an M1 iMac for $500 ... what do you guys think?". His happiness will offset any unhappiness you might have. So, on balance, everything is fine.
M1 Base model is going for $600-$700 on Facebook Marketplace. You can get an M3 Open Box on eBay for $800. You probably could have gotten around $700 max. M1 does not hold $ value well TBH.
maybe around 1k because it's pretty new
Geez I know dude
…why are you here
You know you dont *have* to use the supplied mouse yeah? You can use any mouse
You fool.
I agree.  I think you did good, within about $100 of what you could've gotten if you'd held onto it for longer and haggled more.
nah whoever bought it off u got scammed 😭. Even the i9 iMacs have horrible performance compared to the m1s
Maybe that person really needed it, look at it from that angle. You'll win some, and lose some. I sold a MBP on eBay "as is" because it wasn't powering on, and then after selling it for like $150 the thing powers on again. The person who bought it was so happy and thankful they got a working 2018 MBP for $150.
If it's it good condition 850$ is good price
Don't be sad; history knows of far worse deals
Well they were dumb enough to buy an iMac over a Macbook or Mac Mini so I guess why would they imagine to replace the mouse that they don't like?
Ehhhh
I set him up, you push him down 😅
the magic mouse is like the most inconvenient mouse ever
Yeah it looks beautiful
You could replace the mouse with a Magic Trackpad when you buy the iMac!
You know you don't have to use the included mouse, right?
They seem to be manifesting somewhat recently. Not sure which M series is affected or if it’s a limited manufacturing bug but reports are out there. 

And yes, 500 is a little low.
Yes, like you’re looking to buy drugs with the money too low
Oregon USA! Can you get it back? I'll pay you $501
usd, costco
envy envy. i still have the Intel based imac & MBP. they'll be celebrating their 10th birthday soon. just need a battery change. 

my needs: editing photos as a hobby. then it's surfing the web, emails & background music. hence the machine are still usable except that with each update of my DXO photolab, it take longer to process & export a RAW to jpg photo with Noise Reduction.
• Many notebooks nowadays are lighter and have better screen to body ratio

• fan can be always adjusted in bios (its "noisy" by default, to keep the temperatures in check unlike M2/M3 that constantly cross 100C mark)

• glass trackpad is fine plus you can have a trackpoint as well which is superior in ergonomics

• yea speakers are not that good (compared to macbook pros), but why waste space for a subwoofer when battery is of higher priority? Also a laptop is not really a portable sound system, a dedicated bose speaker would always come on top

• regarding screen i highly disagree. Macbook screens are only good at colours. The response time is atrocious and you cant upgrade the panel, as its proprietary and glued shut (so only replace when broken, for a hefty price). As i said, for an average laptop you can always get an oled panel as upgrade, since the wast majority adhere to edp standard interface. And oled is 
king.

• i am talking linux, not windows. But win 10 ltsc is pretty decent too when tweaked correctly. This may be a downside for some users, since going hackintosh on amd is kinda problematic 

• many laptops have both iris scanner and fingerprint sensors.
This was your ticket into heaven bro frfr
Here your are! [https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m1-imac-display-issue/](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m1-imac-display-issue/)
Always pretty warm whether off or on. While battery is charging it’s pretty warm. While charging and turned on it’s warm. The ONLY time it isn’t warm is when the laptop is off and the battery is done charging. Even turned on and just sitting with no load applied to the CPU, CPU temp is around 190-210. Does seem right. My M1 was never like this.
take it as a lesson learned kid, next time wait more and you will defo be able to get better price with good sell tactics. If it makes it easier think that you helped someone who was in need but could not afford more (even if unlikely, it will help you rationalise).
Ok, so net loss for me $250🤣🤣🤣
Wait what fr?
It doesn’t work like that. Prices in EU are much higher than US.
That will sell slow, but it’s good idea
you're delusional m8
It is actually worth more than the going price if you are available to contact in the to reassure that the machine is not going to be locked out by a corporation. I know that are ways to check, but that is not in the scope of the average user. Just being available to answer questions about it makes it more valuable than being sold on embay or Facebook.
hahahaha
I lost $450 from your comment
Damn it!
Yeah think b4 u do things
Yup. Now they’re repeat-posting. Strange things are afoot at the Circle K…
I’m selling my iPhone 16 Pro, the printer is too noisy
I tried, connected with trackpad with iMac doesn’t feel smooth also!

he already did OP is asking for a return 😂😂😂
Fine
Full Circle.
If OP originally bought it for $950, he would not have succeeded in selling it for 1K. You can’t make a profit off a used device.

Maybe 750-850 would’ve made more sense.
Third party mouse sometimes break iMac beauty!
Lmao 🤣🤣💀
Okay, if the buyer is a good person and do need the machine! Then that’s good
It’s fair price, but will sell slow
$100?😭🤣
?
Unfortunately yes
I tried! External trackpad isn’t as smooth as build in trackpad like MacBook

https://preview.redd.it/vq5q3df5nztd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9baacae3551efd483c65a5e368cc5be85060f633
Absolutely! Tried external trackpad, not smooth also
How much is fair
Unfortunately shipping 🚢 cost more than $1
I am atheist
Thanks, I do not have this issue and my mac is more then 2 years old now. Reading this I'm glad I bought a 5 year warranty plan for my iMac. Not with Apple itself though.
Weird
I know, tech stuff is draining money
way more 😭 your imac is at least from 2021.
the 2015 models are going at $700ish dollars in england still pre-owned. you've lost a lot of money 😭

you win some, you lose some, the circle of life. don't worry about it. other good stuff will happen, Almighty willing :)
Prices in the EU include tax.
Mac M1 is better than having an Intel chip one...
I don’t know if it still stands true, but I’ve always heard people say that Mac’s are known for retaining their value over time, at least much more than other products.
You answered your own question, you wanted to sell it fast. What’s the point checking the true value on resell then?
It’s cool dude we’ve all made someone’s day by giving the a killer deal 🙏🏻 if it’s any consolation, it was $950 before fees and shipping so I only got like ~$750 haha
No.  You still gained $500.  You just could have got more.  

You paid $950.  You used it for a year.  And now sold it for $500.
have you tried changing the garage door hinges? that may fix it.
I smashed my iPhone 16 Pro on the pavement because the cat got on the windowsil.
Are you selling that for a great price too by any chance?
Yep, $700 would be a good price! I am tech guy, always keep my tech in good condition
How idiotic
obviously if you're using a cheap plastic mouse that you found in an old box of computer bits from the 90s then yeah sure. If you buy a proper good mouse, something like the Logitech MX Master 3S, then it does not break the computer's beauty at all.
The computer you’re looking to buy isn’t out yet, why does selling it quickly matter?
Another way around, if you really liked the display of the iMac, is to buy the aforementioned MBP and a Studio Display.
Sure but like use any mouse, trackball, anything, whatever suits you. I use a vertical trackball with my macbook air. If you didn't like either of the things you tried, you still aren't going to like them when you have the replacement computer either.
600 wouldn’t hurt. But given you parted with it for half the cost - you’re a good soul.
ah well!
I am as well, I was just making a joke.
Yeah 🙁
Of course! I am waiting for M4 MacBook Pro
[deleted]
Okay, things come thing go
Selling my house, the garage is too quiet now
No motivation to sell a thing under $100🤣
Then why did you sell it for $500? If you’re a tech guy, you should be *more* informed about stuff such as the aftermarket value than the average guy, or at the very least know how to research the topic efficiently.
It’s coming out in 11/1
Studio display is about to update
MacBook Pro built in trackpad is the best I ever use
You Funny!
Better in speed, efficiency, stability, software longevity
Intel Macs were also shit for upgradability, unless you go back to extremely outdated CPUs
Try selling a car on Bring A trailer, I just lost like $3000
Selling myself because I don’t have a house now
Lmao bro OP is so fried 🤣🤣🤣 I feel bad his comment have be laughing out loud 🤣
Who cares? Maybe he wanted to get rid of it faster or give someone a deal. Honestly, he doesn't look like he needs the money... there are good people out in the world.
Stupid myself was looking into Apple and bestbuy trade in value!😭😭😭
Runs way cooler as well.
Alright boys settle down. They both have tradeoffs
Too much minuses for me, guys. 

Better speed is a trade off when you have everything soldered, including SSD. Apple processors are far better in energy efficiency, yes, but we are talking about desktop here, not notebooks, so battery life doesn’t matter here. 

And for software longevity, are you serious? If Apple wanted, they would support Intel Macs longer, they just don’t care
AFAIK, the latest 21.5/27-inch iMacs' CPUs are upgradeable. They are using 9th/10th-generation chips, which are not too outdated imo
I just upgraded my 2019 with two 4tb SSDs (one nvme and one SATA) and 128gb ram and an i9 processor… 

Not bad for upgradeability.  And if you really want, you could use an external GPU which afaik you can’t on M1 Macs.
I meant SSD and RAM first of all
He was asking multiple times if it was a good deal, and what he should’ve charged, instead. That tells me that OP lowballed due to a lack of knowledge, rather than good intentions.

I honestly don’t care that much. OP asked a question, and I answered. I just found it weird that a tech guy, of all people, wouldn’t know how much their own devices are worth.
Or maybe OP was simply ignorant.
Never look at the trade in value, lol. Trade-ins are *always* significantly lowballed. They allow themselves to do that because it guarantees you won’t be scammed, and because it’s convenient.

The aftermarket value will ALWAYS be higher than trade-ins. Especially if you kept your devices in great condition, like you said you did.

Next time you wish to sell something, but you’re unsure of its worth, you could always ask us about it. Or ask another, relevant community. We’re here to help!
r/suddenlydankpods
Not without a severe headache for the typical user.
Fair, that's a really good point.
Yeah, and the original poster had a good point. OP was already asking so natural conclusion.
Thank you so much 😊 !
At least I know I never do car dealerships trade in, that’s thousands dollars 💸 loss
usually, the typical user wouldn't be upgrading it themselves anyway, they'd take it to an apple certified shop, or to a friend that could upgrade it for them.
I agree the cpu replacement is not fun.  I bent pins on my board the first time I did it.
I imagined what it might look like if Apple made a controller/gamepad.
Shout out to the Wii Classic Remote, the 8bitdo N30pro, and Polyman Studio who made a very detailed model of the Apple TV remote. Made in Blender and Photoshop. 
I can feel the carpal tunnel already. Nice work.
Looks way to thin to hold comfortably for long. Pretty but not ergonomic. So, just like the Magic Mouse. Spot on.
You really nailed the whole “hurts to hold in your hand” philosophy of Apple peripherals.
Looks horribly unergonomic and uncomfortable to use, so I’m sure Apple would be all over this.
The charging port would be  on the D-pad
Not quite Apple enough, it should be only touch, no physical buttons. Since it’s a new device there shouldn’t be a charge port, wireless charging only and a few cm thinner. Edges should taper too 😂
No need to imagine: https://www.flickr.com/photos/kalleboo/51059684466
Charging port on the bottom?
They could go flatter with 3DS-like or PSP-like circle pads instead of joysticks that stick out.
It would be outrageously expensive and a much less attractive option than the controllers that are already on the market.
Hmmm... If Apple made a controller/game pad wouldnt it only have one button?
So smooth, I can already see it flying into my screen.
Charging port needs to go somewhere that makes it unusable plugged in :)
Nailed it, a beautiful ergonomic nightmare, but hey, people still use the nes controller design
Looks very uncomfortable
[deleted]
Im pretty sure apple made a console before, i think it was called pippin
The thing is, this is actually pretty accurate
it looks like an 8bitdo sn30/sf30. it would be horribly uncomfortable for any game that extensively uses both sets of shoulder buttons or any of the analog sticks
They might think about this .
Make it have a glass back so it can shatter when you drop it. That way you can pay $7 a month for apple care on it to get peace of mind.
What are those…. Buttons? Not on an Apple controller
Charging port should be inside of a button cap, so you can definitely not use it while charging.
the touch wheel + 4 way is interesting....
There’s no way the charging port wouldn’t be in the middle of the face buttons

…and proprietary
Not ergonomically sound.  Apple approved
This thing looks like it was designed by someone who never played video games 😂
Sooooo… is this a secret leak now?
Love the ergonomics
New way to wrist pain after Magic Mouse
The charging port would be in the middle so you can’t use it whilst it’s charging
too many buttons. should be completely flat
Ergonomic nightmare monstrosity
Who needs ergonomics when you can have aesthetics? /s
This is 1000x worse than the Magic Mouse yet I can still ABSOLUTELY see Apple trying it anyway. I think you’re hired?!💀😭
That looks like the most uncomfortable modern design.
sounds about right: poor design, terrible ergonomics, less features than other similar devices, not taking user feedback into consideration. Sounds just like apple.
Only change I see that's needed is to move the usbc port right smack dab in the middle of the 4 buttons so that they are entirely unuseable when it's plugged in. 
It's not even real and I already feel it dropping on my floor and breaking immediately. And since it's apple, it's gonna be an expensive replacement. Terrible battery timing as well
The controllers would definitely have a glass back. Charging port would be on the right so that you can’t use it while it’s charging.
That’s extremely good work man!
We all know if Apple made they'd do something dumb like put the charging cable in one of the joysticks where you can't use it while it charges or some stuff like they did with magic mouse.  lolol
Add a charging port directly in the middle of the d-pad and your render is complete
This needs to be made
The usb charging port would obviously be on the bottom of the controller.
It'd have way fewer buttons
PLEASE? This would make Steam gaming SO much better too!!
 Why do I want it so bad
People forgetting oldschool pads like those of SEGA Master System’s or Nintendo. People used to spend hundreds of hours with them and never complained 😅 This pad looks gorgeous and it would be light as heck with that design which would be refreshing.
My hands are cramping from looking at this.  It’s definitely something Apple would consider
Apple TV remote D-Pad is wild
Nice design.
The magic mouse of game controllers, perfectly designed.
it’d be all touch and siri-controlled

“hey siri, input down, down forward, forward, and hard punch”

“that’s a bit forward but i’m totally down for some *hard* fruit punch too. *ha-ha-*“

/s
I keep saying that Apple should really start pushing more into the gaming space. Bringing triple A games to the Apple TV would be awesome. Even coming out with a “Apple TV Pro” that is geared toward gaming and then work with companies like Ubisoft, Take-Two, hell even Microsoft (since they are basically killing the Xbox anyway) on developing games for it.
I would buy this instantly
apple tv remove and joycon. just like apple, hard to use.
Needs some bulging on the back for grip
Starting at $299…but at least the center d pad button has Siri if you hold it down.
My hand already hurts looking at it
The 8bitdo that you mention is actually fully compatible with Mac, and it’s more ergonomic. It’s also probably cheaper.
Looks like an ergonomic nightmare.
$299 only XD
Ability to change icon on buttons to match whatever controller you are trying to replicate and it will sell. Touch ID/Game Center button in the center to approve game purchases on the App Store.

$299. Comes with the apple cloth.
If the Wii Classic Controller and Steam Controller had a baby
I would buy it.
Looks kind of uncomfortable though very much Apple i’d say a cross between it and the pipin controller as Apple did make a games console and controller already
If Apple made this they would put the charging port on top of the thumb stick so you could not play while charging
The pippin “am I a joke to you”
And it’s yours for only $249, compatible with iPhone 15 / iPad M3 or newer.
Awful user experience like the Apple TV controller, human hands are not flat!
Looks like an appropriate lack of ergonomics
wow it’s perfectly non-ergonomic
I'd expect that Apple would place the start/select button lower and more centered vertically either with the middle of the controller of the middle of the dpad/abxy.


I would expect the sides to have a similar curve to the MBPs instead of the 
flatness of the iPad. Probably slightly thicker as well.
0 ergonomics
except the charging port would need to be somewhere completely unusable, like coming out of a joystick
Too thin to hold comfortably for a long time and the changing point should be somewhere awkward so you can’t use it while charging.

Let’s hope they never make one like this.
It would be Apple iRcade not arcade...😂
Charge port should prevent use while connected line their mice.
Knowing Apple they would put a lightning charger on it like the fix the Magic Mouse.. :(
Charging port should be on the back tho
looks horrible to use. exactly what I would expect from this company.
Apple already tried this, with the Pippin. This could be a modern sequel to it
Would be typical Apple to make a controller in the least ergonomic way just so it looks stylish. I can’t imagine using it for more than 2 minutes
Only authentic if the charging socket goes right into the middle of the back OR even better, the front side so it’s literally unusable or at least a huge pain in the ass to play while charging.
There's a reason controllers have evolved over 40 years to be the size and shape they are today.
Charging port on the front side.
Beside that it’s very thin. I’d imagine it’s better than their apple pippin controller. That thing was oddly shaped. Can’t imagine it was comfortable to hold.
Less buttons and remove the logo replace it with some shitty notch and you got it nailed down 👍
The charging port has to be in the bottom, sorry! /s
Your scaling isn’t really right. It would be a super tiny thing if it’s that small compared to a Mac Studio
They would probably put the charging port on the buttons.
Charging port will be on one of the sides, so you would not be able to use it with both hands while charging.
although it would not be comfortable for what a gaming session probably is considered , 3-4+ hours, for taking it with you on a trip etc. without taking too much space in your backpack it would be nice.
That looks so utterly uncomfortable lol
Knowing apple they'd put the charging port in the middle of the buttons
Good looking and probably completely unergonomic and expensive. And of course the cord port (i hope it's lightning) is at a very inconvenient location.

You nailed it! I'd also try to introduce glass
Wrong charging port like the mouse please
Why the charging port isn’t on the back?
Too many buttons to be an Apple device. :)
Ergonomic nightmare.
Charging port should be in the most illogical place possible, just like the Magic Mouse. Maybe on the left or right side so that you can't properly hold it while charging!
Looks uncomfortable af
This looks like the worst controller ever
No buttons, only touch and turn. They will call it SpacialPlay. 

And proprietary protocol so you must use with Apple Arcade games. 

Requires daily charging. Again using some proprietary charge port just for this device. Maybe like a dock, so you can’t charge and play.
Needs thinner buttons with butterfly switches
The charging port must be at the front part, to make it impossible to play while charging. Also it should cost 999 without a battery, charger or cable, maybe even the joysticks... But it would be nice if more games worked on my m2
Looks waaaay too much like a traditional controller. No way Apple would create something so conservative and call it "a new way to play".
Do we have to remind you of apples first console the Pippin? Didn't work out
For the design place the charging port to the bottom 😋
More painful than the NES
heck yeah, it would be incredibly cool if Apple would launch something like this! bring back the Apple Pippin!
Nah, no where close. It’d have to be around the same size as their controllers on the appletvs, and only have the touch dpad 😅
That looks so uncomfortable to hold lol
Joycons would’ve been white.
When is your developer conference? You're up to something here
Yeah that’s awful
Well done. Looks very realistic. I actually don't even hate the design, besides some ergonomic issues for prolonged play :D.
Clearly not like that...
Minus the buttons, it should be all haptics😂
[All I can think of right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BnLbv6QYcA)
[x] Horrible ergonomics

[x] Needlessly thin

[  ] charging port that blocks usage

Good attempt, but I think Apple would go further.
Looks terrible as a gamer i would never use controller like that look at ps5 dualsense controller or xbox u need to get good grip from it and have fast reactions and that one would be missin the trigger buttons from the back
That looks like a very old way to play.
Joysticks and buttons? Very optimistic. I would expect a large haptic touchpad
Perfect in every way, except the charging port would be in the joystick
Too many buttons.

Should only have like one button, and a proprietary charge-port/expansion port.

Extra adapter required to allow for optional features like joystick/other buttons.

Of course its faster and better for photoshop
You forgot to put „reinvented” in the slogan xD
Definitely no buttons, full glass surface, charging upside down.
too many buttons
The charging slot would be behind the remote
Too thick, needs to be 1 mm
That’s the most atrocious thing I’ve ever seen, seems accurate tho
I’m sure Apple would keep it as minimal as possible and would not engrave arrows on the buttons
If we want games to get better/have more functionality, we really need to start thinking about controllers differently. Good job tho
I would buy it, no doubt.
Make sure to have the lightning cable / a new proprietary cable that doesn't come in the box :)

Also that design is amazing! I love it
Forged from a single block of Al-Lou-many-um the all new Apple controller is form and functional design perfection. With no actual moving parts and only haptic sensors to simulate the movement of the buttons and joystick, your games will practically play themselves. At only 2mm thick at its smallest point and a scant 30 grams you won’t even know you are holding it. $299. *Wireless charging sold separately but may not be available at launch.
Its almost perfect. You just need to move the charging port to a location that makes it unusable while charging. Maybe in the center of one of the joysticks?

EDIT: I should have read comments first. I Was beaten to the charge port location joke a while ago...
Starting at $399
It looks like a nightmare to use so it’s probably not far off.
_You’re holding it wrong_
The buttons, grips, cover etc. sold separately. Also, only connectivle to Apple products.
I think if they would make a controller, that would be a more traditional one. So I would imagine az Xbox controller but with minimalist design.
Now with this I will carefully rage and throw it in a soft pillow *desiged by apple as well
Charging port needs to be in the middle of the dpad
1900usd🫣
By new, you mean uncomfortable?
Very very cool! I imaging the two top buttons might pose a challenge being arranged horizontally, but otherwise I’d buy this in a heartbeat!!
Move the charging port to the back and it would be more realistic.
Add the lighting cable charging port not usb-c lol since they’ve completely neglected their mouse 🤣
That would be $500 please.
The tilt and roll sensors control the reality distortion field of the iGoggles.  If you tilt it to full nadir, Steve Jobs appears in your headset and yells and chews you the fuck out and calls everything worthless.
Oh honey you need to put the charging port on the bottom.
I would buy this day one
Given that this is a rendering of a fictitious product, I wish OP would’ve at least tried to add some ergonomics to the controller. 🫣
You also killed ergonomy
$599
Wrong.

If apple would have been to make a game controller, they would have removed every button and joystick and put the charging port right in the middle of it.
how much will it cost  
and im guessing they will get stick drift in about a week
To be honest, I’m surprised Apple hasn’t tried joining the gaming industry with a console or something.
It needs to be…thinner.
Incredibly uncomfortable design? Check

Strange button/stick ergonomic? Check

Charging port in an awful place? Check

Perfection.
[Apple already made a console and controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin)
£2000….. £500 extra for each joypad stick. (Getting flash backs of £999 wheels)
The Onion did a piece 15 years ago called: The Apple Touch Wheel. Revolutionary New Laptop with no Keyboard.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BnLbv6QYcA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BnLbv6QYcA)
Looks very uncomfortable, like how the PSP was.
Apple would replace the sticks with touch pads because they haven‘t played anything ever 😅
That’s a kickass idea dude!
I imagine the charging port would be in an inconvenient spot, like on the side where your hand would be, so you couldn’t play it wired 😅
“Charge it when you go to bed.  Not hard at all.” 🫠
Imagine what price on that thang.
The right needs to be abxy
Concept is beautiful. Plus, as a true capitalist you open up a new market of game controller cases. My sweaty palms thinks these would be awful without a case.
Charging port needs to be on the face
That'll be 400$ thanks, no batteries included
This clearly can’t be an Apple product there is no touch controls or gestures.
Ergonomic just like the magic mouse.
Don’t forget to buy our special case for longer (than 15min) gaming sessions for additional 10$
Can only charge while tilted at exactly a 30 degree angle, though.
Way, WAY to many buttons.

If Apple made it, it'd look more like an atari joypad, with one button.
the Apple iPad - catchy
That looks like the most uncomfortable controller I’ve ever seen.
Aesthetically pleasing. Ergonomic nightmare.
Dude I’d buy it, looks sick
Looks like it would make a wonderful hole in the wall
Then they would sell the handle adapters/extensions so those little controllers are more comfortable.

They would cost $59 each and Apple would sell one for bigger hands and that would be $89.
Put the charging port on the bottom and you're golden
They would put the charging dock on the front so its super inconvenient
How did you create this? I'm trying to learn more complex graphic design
this is just the psp go with extra steps
Pure nightmare. I hope I can sleep tonight.
It’s 250$
This looks terrible and I would still buy one and try to use it

What the hell is wrong with me?
Not realistic.

It need a method of charging that renders it unusable whilst charging. I'm thinking maybe you have to pull of the right stick to access the port.
Looks great, doesn't do it the normal or conventional way, would be an ergonomics nightmare, sounds like apple.
Ergonomics, not even once.
It would be everything except comfortable. Like this garbage mouse.
That looks miserable. You also would never be able to use it on a driving game because it doesn’t have analog triggers.
Needs way sharper edges, a Touch Bar at the top, butterfly buttons, Siri integration so it interrupts your game every time it thinks it hears a wake word, and the charging port at the side, right where your fingers would otherwise rest comfortable.
#courage

We removed all ergonomic functionality.
Looks awful to use. Very on brand for apple peripherals
If that D-pad is a click/touch wheel like on the iPod video and Nano I'm sold, please take my $300, or $450 for the Red Edition. Can't wait for the iGamePro, where the proprietary charging port is right in the middle of the face buttons, and the iGamePro2 PlusPro Edition, where the thumb sticks finally get a push button function for an additional $100.
did apple really just "invent" a controller that's been around for 40yrs? this just looks like a fancy snes controller
Classic controller vibes
Already super thin and not at all ergonomic - just make sure it’s unusable while charging and you’ll be golden
looks nice n painful!
Kinda goofy. Especially since it looks like it has 2 different D Pads.
My hands hurt already. Looks cool tho. Add some ergonomics and it would be cool
This looks painful. Swap the usb-c with lightning and move it to be on the top in the middle making it impossible to use while charging, then you’ve nailed it.
Looks nice but mad cramp
The charging port should be in the center of the D-pad.
Apple (well, technically Atmark) already made a controller in the past, look at the Pippin controller. I've never used one, but it looks both super uncomfortable and super 90s cool:

[http://xahlee.info/kbd/apple\_bandai\_pippin\_controller.html](http://xahlee.info/kbd/apple_bandai_pippin_controller.html)
This looks a lot like an "Apple-ified" version of my [8BitDo NES30 Pro](https://imgur.com/a/SRek2Gp) that I got years ago. (sorry that it's just pictures, this model has been discontinued) It was a decent little travel controller, but quickly gets uncomfortable to hold. Especially now that my hands are bigger 😅
Needs to have the word Beautiful in it to be legit.
Given Apple’s terrible track record on mice I wouldn’t be surprised if it ended up like that.
So… snes controller with analog sticks? eh
Your hands will cramp in mins holding this thing.
Nah man, thats not it, either the charging port will be on the face/front or you'll need to rest the gamepad on a magsafe to charge it and won't be able to use it while its charging to make sure "Charging is ergonomically efficient for the controller so it performs the best"
Taking into account their mouse - charging port has to be on the front, in the most illogical place possible xD
The charger  port would be on the back so you cant set it down
Ah yes, the Magic Mouse of controllers.

Price starting at $249, upgradable to $749
Now my hands hurt; I want it.
design at the expense of ergonomics. Sounds about right.
The ergonomics on that, though...😜
Nice, I can see this being a thing. Instantly seems Apple to me
Ergonomically horrible; very faithful! For it to be a true Apple device, put the charging port in the middle of the d-pad, and make it lightning.
Cool

Are you a designer?
Too many buttons
$2,999.99
Missing the letter A at the beginning of your post.
Somehow worse than a single side joycon
It'll cost 59 cents to make but they'll sell it for $299, and then brag that it's the most original design ever, even if it looks like an SNES controller lol.
they would totally make one that people would call "worst gaming controller in history" and then make a new one that will actually be incredible. they sometimes do that
The charge port would be in the middle of the buttons or somewhere extremely inconvenient.
Zero ergonomics. Yep it’s spot on!
🤢🤮
This would be sh** 😆😆😆
My hand is cramping just looking at this.
Thin, fragile, unergonomic. $229 MSRP
Only $140 with propriety plugs!
“Think different” does come to mind here
This is why they would lose the console race, but to be fair this generation has been pretty poor from Sony and Microsoft.
That does not look comfortable. I would pass that.
You got the ergonomics 100% accurate
I think you placed charging port wrong. It should be on back side, near Apple logo
It would have charging port in one of the sticks.
It would have charging port in one of the sticks.
What software do you use for this stuff cos I kinda want to create something similar myself, I do have photoshop if I should use that maybe.
does absolutely NOBODY here know that there already is one??? its called the nimbus and its pretty good. techincally it isnt because steelseries made it but regardless it is on their website and is sold as apple's controller/gamepad
I don't think so. 

Apple won't introduce a new thing unless that thing up-ends the market and causes people to drop the other product for theirs. 

This image shows a  standard controller in Apple style. Apple doesn't apply their style to things. They imagine them ground up as theirs with the intent of entering the market and having everyone leave the current incumbents for their product. 

This design is also terrible for actual use. It would be hard on people's hands to use it. 

I don't see any designer at Apple doing anything but shaking their head in disgust at this and thinking, "No thanks."

Now, would apple come up with one that was a superior touch device with better ergonomics and responsiveness as well as a few other advantages that make people wonder why they still have a cheap-ass PS or XB controller? Yes, that they would do. This is not it.
This would be awful.
I dig it.
Might be a virtual controller that may cost an arm, a leg and some nuts
Bye bye ergonomics. The Magic Mouse or gaming controllers.
You got it all wrong, IF it has a charging port, it needs to be in the most stupid place possible
Take the MSRP, double it because fuck you, and boom, new Apple product.
Looks impossible to hold comfortably. It's perfect.
The only problem I see is you placed the charger port in a sensible place apple would never do this
More like if DJI designed a gamepad 🤣
Thinking back to the Magic Mouse, the usb-c or lightning connector would either be on the left or the right of the device so you "couldn't" use it while charging... :P
There'd be no buttons, only gestures.
OP just inspired Apple
I think the charging port needs to be under 😀
Aesthetically beautiful and an ergonomic nightmare haha
“icontrol”
Starts from 499$ for 2 buttons and one joystick 
+ 299$ to unlock the other joystick and the touchpad 
PS: 
4,99$ monthly subscription for unlimited clicks
I was going to criticize the ergonomics like everyone else, but realized that the thickness is just like any normal phone, we are gaming on for hours. Yes not comfortable like the ordinary controllers, but still working perfectly fine.
ergonomic horror ngl
My hands hurt and I can already feel the stick drift just from looking at the picture.

Accurate.
Ergonomically, it looks like a nightmare, but knowing apple, it would still somehow feel great to use.
Let me guess needs batteries to work, and the batteries are OEM and only apple makes me.

Also the analog sticks are sold separately.
It will then cost 299,99$ CAD and only 249,99$ USD. Black model will be more expensive, just like their mouse. So 349,99$ CAD and 299,99$ USD for the Black model. Adapter sold separately and with MagSafe for some reason. Will also feature a M2 chip, for some more reasons. Won’t work with iPhone yet, will need an update for that. Wow! Such beautiful! Hope I am not too far from the real thing’s price.
looks shit
Physical Buttons? They'd all be force touch surfaces and "buttons" 😉
Starting at $399 for the 16gb version. We think you’re going to love it.”
A basic controller sold for $499
Kinda fire tho, make the vision pro some controllers next!
Like the Magic Mouse. Uncomfortably thin. Design over function.
Wii Classic Controller all over again 💀
lol
surprised at the lack of touch controls, i’d think they’d use something like the steam deck touchpads instead of what looks like 3ds style joysticks, but the absolutely horrid ergonomics completely make up for that
It’s too thin like the Magic Mouse. What’s so magical about it anyway?
oh god. zero ergonomics. id rather attach a ps4 controller and play
hell, I just wish they'd improve enough that they can handle the majority of games. 

Granted I haven't snagged a m series yet so I can't say for how they are doing now, but seeing as its Mac I assume
The charging port must be in the front face, otherwise it’s not Apple 😂
You forgot to place the charger on the most inconvenient place so you can't actually use it while charging.
I thought this was an AI joke. Can you imagine how uncomfortable that controller would be?
Buttons sold separately.
this is some how worse then the magic mouse
You can also [see what Apple already imagined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin?wprov=sfti1) when they did make a controller/gamepad.
charger port needs to go directly on the dpad
This reeks of market study for early prototype. Just make a bigger magic mouse and call it a controller.
What do the pentalobe screws next to the charger hold lol
You pay $150 for that, then $15 for a plastic or silicon case/grip that makes it usable 🤣
Looks just the right size and shape to get lost in my couch with the Apple TV remote.
How would that rest in your hands -  nice concept but might need to be redesigned for gamers .
Already see its an ergonomic nightmare
Please tell me you can’t play while it’s charging! Maybe the thumb-stick flips up to reveal a hidden lightning port. Keeps the controller seamless.
And then they slowly removed the buttons over the years, increased the price and said to anyone who complained they can't game without buttons: ur holding it wrong
Didn’t Apple create/work on a console like a really long time ago?
You forgot to put the charging port on the back
Yeah. I can imagine that could come from Apple. It will also hurt your hands if you can keep the controller from slipping out of them. Reminds me of the magic mouse. That was an ergonomic nightmare too.
Very bendable like iPhone 6.
Very uncomfortable like Magic Mouse.
At least they put the charging port on the side, and not like…in the middle of the stick button
Great Scott you’ve done it. Carpal tunnel. Whoever designed this is hope you use it.
The charge port needs to be on the left analog stick.
Pls dont cook again lol
It looks like the Nintendo Wii Classic Controller!
Hey Arthritis wait up for me!
I can already feel how uncomfortable it would be
The port should be at the bottom just like the magic mouse.
Swap out that usbc port for lightning and it’ll be perfect /s
Technically Apple already has made a game pad, the one for [Pippin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin).

But this is a fair take on the renaissance era:

- too thin to be useful or comfortable 
- those shoulder buttons look sleek but absolutely stupid
- please tell me the d-pad is capacitive and clickable
- the most aesthetic yet most useless action button legends
- thumbs still needing to reach to the bottom of a device
- that shit definitely doesn’t have Hall effect sensors and will have you paying for AppleCare in a month
You forgot it would also charge using a port that is where your hand would go, so its impossible to use it while charging.
I’m glad they didn’t, the Apple TV remote is just as uncomfortable lol
They’d sell an ergonomic grip add-on at a ridiculous price.
You have invented the 8BitDo SN30 Pro.
Nauh, that D-pad would drive me nuts, with the clicking.
I’d place the charge port on the d-pad so you can’t use it while charging as an ode to their Magic Mouse.
The charge port would be on the back so you couldn't lay it flat while charging and they'd call it a smart design decision. See magic mouse
The charging port is in the wrong spot since you can still charge it and play that way. Apple would do something like make the thumb stick removable with the charging port is under it so you can’t play while having a wire plugged in.
Fuck Apple.  That controller looks like garbage.
I wish apple would come out with a console. I hate Microsoft, I want an alternative to it without going to controller or emulator. I would love to play battlefields or squad 44 and even CS2. To me the best game on mac is WoW but I want more fps games.
Well the charge port makes more sense to be on the back in the middle of the apple. Just look at the mouse they made. Come on now.
I doubt it. There’s zero ergo
Looks great. Complete not ergonomic. Yup. Certainly what Apple would come up with.
Yea it would be apple to make the least ergonomical controller since the n64 triceratops 😂
That controller would be absolutely horrendous to use
Why didnt you put the charger on the top of the controller
Incredibly uncomfortable
Looks uncomfortable... Exactly what Apple would do!
Because a thinner controller is what gamers have always been asking for.
They already make one. It’s the Apple TV remote. 😭
you really captured apples “unusable ergonomics” design philosophy. the magic mouse would be proud
Starting at $499
The controller is thin. Imagine a person with anger issues rage quitting. He may snap the controller in two.
You’re holding it wrong.
That’s why you can opt for a range of Apple Certified grips. Giving you unparalleled grip, feel and comfort.

In addition there’s also the Grip Pro which adds a new revolutionary Haptic Max, giving feedback unmatched. 

Controller is 199 for basic, and 299 for black.

Grips start at 99, and Grip Plus with Haptic Pro is only 199, Haptic Max is 249.
I already have it so I’m good haha
I was about to comment this design would be god awful ergonomically speaking but then I remembered the puck mouse and it's complimentary spongy keyboard, the circular iPod headphones, optical mouse, magic mouse, butterfly keyboard switches, the touchbar, iPhone Max line, Magic Mouse 2, any holding iPad after an hour, the Vision Pro...

Yeah, this tracks.
Just like the switch controllers…
Was going to comment this 😂 beat me to it
Magic Mouse but for both hands
It’s just missing the charging. Port on the front
I had to respect Steve Job’s vision of the customer experience declining after the unboxing.
One thing I have to add is that the charge port is too conveniently placed. It should be at the back in the middle or under a button at the front.
Magic Mouse rocks. I’ve used it daily for over a decade. It’s only unergonomic if you somehow palm the damn thing. Grip it gently with your fingertips and enjoy.
On the bright side, it’s easily fixable if you buy controller protectors that protrude out handles and stuff under
Hand grips sold separately by a different brand
I feel like the travesty of a d-pad is pretty on-brand too but I'm not sure why
The charging port should be on the bottom
Put the charging port under a flipping joystick
Somebody at apple really despises ergonomics
I’m already imagining all the third party grip case accessories this would have…
Totally wrong, it can still be used while plugged in. To capture the real Magic Mouse essence, the cable should have to plug into the top of the joysticks.
Beat me to it.
“What if we made the joy-cons more uncomfortable” “genius”
real
Wdym, surely you can buy an ergonomic case for only 99$
Charging port needs to be positioned so that you can't use it and charge simultaneously, so like, in the middle of the left joystick.
Of course it would have to be: “The Apple Gamepad. The thinnest device we’ve ever made.”
It's so you would not waste too much time playing video games. Trust the design. /s
Starting at $599.99
Apple would develop a unique charging experience for the controller and go back to USB.
Underneath* the D-pad
No, the charge port goes in the middle of the controls
I could see Apple using touch in place of analog sticks but I think even Apple knows that physical buttons are sometimes better than touch.
It would need a usb c port because EU
I’ve got one of these, it’s bad
LTT made a video about it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h4t33tOG60
Nah it’s hidden right under the left joystick
Wireless charging only. So you can’t charge it while you play. Just like the Magic Mouse.
[deleted]
Yeah they would do that
Exactamundo
Of course! Otherwise it wouldn't be Apple! (For the record: typing this on an iPhone Pro, whilst taking a break from my MacBook Pro. Also own a few other Apple products so I'm not an Apple hatter: just wish they'd get off that horse and listen to their customers more...)
just a joystick
"The most aerodynamic product Apple has ever made" - Tim Apple
It appears to be on the bottom of the controller, so when you are playing games it has to sharply wrap itself to the top to reach the outlet
It could probably use the airpods autoswitch code but only when booting up games.
Thanks! My goal wasn’t to make the world’s best controller, just to ask: what would Apple do?
That is the point like the MM2
they're haptic buttons
Lack thereof you mean
Nah, the D-pad has a Charging coil in it,

It attaches with a mag safe like adapter 
That completely covers the D-Pad
Thanks!
"This is what I found on the web"
I used to be a gamer, but now only play game’s occasionally, so I’m not up to date.

How is Microsoft trying to kill the Xbox? What’s their alternative?
the apple tv as it stands is an ipad without the screen. 

there's plenty of horsepower for 4k streaming, 720p gaming should be on-par with steamdeck.

if it wasnt even morecrippled than standard iOS that is.
🫂
I use it everyday!
i was thinking more like 499.99, but comes with a cleaning cloth.
Except… it actually exist 😭
One more thing: charging port should be on the sides or somewhere where your hands go so you can’t use it while charging it.

That would be peak Apple and make these renders perfect😂😂

Amazing job thanks for the laugh
Blender- it’s free!
I use the controller everyday!
*Nice, I can see this*

*Being a thing. Instantly*

*Seems Apple to me*

No Artificial Intelligence used. Just Actual Stupidity.
I modeled and rendered it in Blender, and added some details/color corrected in Photoshop
I do believe the charging port would be on the top tho, also would perhaps be MagSafe 3
It’s not an Artificial Intelligence joke, it’s an Actual Stupidity joke
Calling that thing a controller is like calling a MacBook an eReader.
No judgement. 

Then the person can buy another one from Apple for $799.
You got me chuckling with this one. Surprised OP didn’t include a bumper…
with the flair to prove it!
No the charging port should be on the joystick
Nah, on the side, so it’s impossible to hold and play while charging
or on the underside....

Looking at you Magic mouse
Lightning port!
Happy cake day
Came to say this.
Nah they’d have no ports and have it be MagSafe 😑
it's also a usb3 port, which doesn't sound like apple would implement by choice.
It's way too asymmetrical, you could probably orient that correctly with your eyes closed, also it looks too easy to pick up without activating something, I'd recommend a touch sensitive surface on the back which would also have the bonus of making it more likely to break.

Thickness is perfect, great for RSD and bending.
I hate the “you’re holding it wrong” meme that people like to pout, but yes. You’re absolutely right. Theres nothing wrong with the Magic Mouse. 

Even the charging port placement argument is irrelevant. Like one minute charge finishes off the day. And it tells you for WEEKS to charge it. It’s your fault if you ignore the notifications and don’t just plug it in when you leave the computer.
And you can only use Apple approved ones.
We think you’ll love it.
Charger Sold Separately and uses a lightning port for charging
Charge port on the left edge so you can’t hold it comfortably while charging
How evil.

Perfect.
Hello,

I hope you are having a good day. I am a hiring manager at Apple, and your comment has indicated that you would be a great fit for our product design division. I would like to schedule a brief meeting to discuss potential employment opportunities with us.

Best regards,
John Doe
Senior Hiring Manager
And stab you in the tummy while you’re playing.

One of the things I hate about the Nintendo switch…
You’re missing one thing tho, you’re missing the Apple Controller+ Subscription
didn't think of it that way 🤔
PC.

Xbox games can be played on PC and Xboxes are basically simplified PCs. I don’t think the Xbox is going away, but no exclusives like the FreeBSD-based Playsation.
Me too! it’s a great controller!
I better get a certificate of authenticity for that money
How about the graphics and text?
Mine's broken unfortunately, but yeah I loved it when it worked!
What hahaha?!
“But it charges so quick and the battery lasts so long, I just don’t get the hate!”
Wireless charging baby.
Make dual charging qi and usb c charger
GENIUS
Beat me to it.
No it should be the on the main action button…no you are right the joystick lol. But knowing Apple it would probably be a wireless mat that only can be used for it. And it’s not sold with it and costs another $200 for the charger.
On the start button
No no that’s not sleek enough for apple, it will actually be behind the removable joystick to ensure you cannot play and charge at the same time, but hey it’s waterproof!
On the joystick, it attaches via magnets cuz it’s just the Apple Watch Charger. 😂
See the Apple logo on the back? It hinges, leading to a Lightning port…
That would actually be ok in this case. And if you’re using the controller, a USB sticking right out the back would be pretty nice. Front would be the equivalent of the Magic Mouse. Basically makes it unusable.
Nah, the 16 pin dust sucker from the past
Yeah, complaining that you have to flip it upside down to charge is like complaining you have to flip it upside down to change batteries in the Gen 1 Magic Mouse. 

If you really hate it that much, use a Gen 1. But they don’t because actually these people are not MM users anyway, they’re just bandwagoning.

I absolutely hated having to change batteries in the Gen 1. Plugging the Gen 2 in at the end of the day three times per year is much better.
> Best regards, John ~~Doe~~ Appleseed Senior Hiring Manager
needs a pro version that has both joysticks
Hmm, but you need a good PC, no? Or are they going all out on Cloud gaming?
Apple uses a font family called SF Pro. It’s free so I nabbed that.
lol i was making a joke about the magic mouse because your flair says “imac 2013, m1 imac 2021”
Honestly the Magic Mouse can last all day for like 20 min and if you charge a few hours it’ll last a month. So I never really had the bottom port be an issue. I do wish it was in the top though so I can use it corded
$200 with a glass back so you need to put it in a case.
What can I say Apple should hire me fr
It really would be something if Apple moved back to lightning years after they moved virtually every product in their lineup to USB C.
On one of the sides would be the perfect (horrible) charging port position.
This is what I meant
Not just on the front, squish it next to one of the joysticks or block some of the buttons. Simply leaving it on the top part of the front is still too functional
It really is charge three times a year too with weeks of notice of those charges. I once trialled not charging and seeing how long before it died - it took nearly a month. Ain’t no one using a mouse for a month solid without ever getting up from the computer. It’s literally not ever been a problem. 

I agree that changing the batteries was more of an issue with the gen 1. You had to have charged up batteries ready to go - which had half discharged on the shelf since the last time you charged them. Or spend a packet on disposables.
You don’t need a PC to play Xbox games and you don’t need an Xbox to play PC games. There are just no games you can only play on Xbox. They do have an Xbox cloud gaming service but it’s not replacing Xbox consoles anytime soon.
Oh yeah hahahahaha
If you have a 3D printer, or know someone with one, you can print a dock that will let you use it while plugged in.
It's all fun and games until it is dead when you actually need to use your computer.
Yeah, but mine says it’s running low on battery literally like an hour before it dies, so I always end up having to recharge it and take a break. It’s friggin’ annoying. Everything about the mouse is annoying.
Good idea, let’s make repairs for the broken back glass $150 bucks lol
And AppleCare+ but the glass back costs way more to repair.
Haha yeah, I probably should have said Lightning MK2. Trust Apple to come up with a new proprietary cable, stating some flimsy reason they can’t be equipped with USB C/Thunderbolt
...their magic accessories are still all lightning.. I am waiting patiently for USB-C. Same with the AirPods Max
And illegal in the EU, assuming they also want to release it there it would be quite bad news for them
on the shelf discharge??    just don't use old tech alkaline batteries

  
Ive been using gen 1 with eneloop batteries. Works perfectly.
Nope, mouse turns off while charging you literally can't do that lol
I have a 3D printer, it just doesn’t work. Doesn’t count?
Is there a 3d printer project that lets me drive my car while I fill it up? It takes about the same time.
I was a graphic designer and I used this as my daily driver. If I messed up and it died I went to pee and by the time I got back it was charged enough to use the rest of the day. Then I’d put a sticky note to plug it in when I left for the day and then I wouldn’t charge it again for a month or two and repeat. It’s really not an issue.
Courage.
Used to use the Apple batteries (they were actually rebranded eneloop). Charged them when I replaced the batteries in my first gen. Three months later when they needed changing, the previously charged batteries weren’t exactly 100% anymore. They still worked fine though.
Actually the mod does work, however it's more involved than simply printing the enclosure. You also need to rewire the battery connectors to make it possible to use while charging.

Wouldn’t it be easier to use the old AA Magic Mouse instead of doing all this shit? Probably cheaper also lol
Or just buy a different mouse.
And last longer than the battery inside the newer ones
The rechargeable one never bothered me tbh but the AA one should work fine for someone that’s really annoyed by random deaths since you can just swap rechargeable batteries
Does my Stryker still strikes?

With the current build i mainly use software cfd/cad/cam and i play in 2k
Do you post this every 12 months?
You need more stickers.
Damn.. it looks like 2020 and 2002 in one case
It's so lame and ugly that it underflows back to being cool.
Remove the monster sticker Kyle. And stay away from my walls.
this case has seen some shit. amd64 sticker.. nice! that was the beginning for me. 3500+ and a 6800gs
The stickers from several different generations and variations of CPU is the equivalent of someone putting a Nissan, Porsche, and TRD badge on a Honda Civic. I love it.
Nice PC, ugly to look at. It looks like a fridge with way too many magnets on that bitch lol. To each their own I suppose.
classic case
honestly i really like it
That blue radeon i wanted one so bad haha.
I love the Eva stickers.
Why is there an rtx sticker with a Radeon gpu
Keeping vega frontier is wild, why?
It’s very.. different from the stuff we usually see 

also is that a fucking CPU as the power button
Looks stupid
Honestly it doesnt matter how it looks. My tower is always hidden away. The performance is the attraction.
Furry Vibes
I know it has to be COOKING in that shit
Ah, with a cupholder! They don't make 'em like they used to.
looks strange but interesting
Hot
I can see you really like your stickers and you hate themes ;D
This is like watching someone slapping on stickers and decals on his late grandfather's race car
It looks like a teenager threw up on it
This is so ugly
It definitely strikes
its fucking awesome, keep posting it!!
Toss it out the window, I'm sure it'll strike something 👍🏻
Nah man i understand exactly what niche you are going for and it’s cool. A lot of people in here just won’t get it because they aren’t knowledgeable about it. Cool shit man
![gif](giphy|3o7TKnYVvhjh6qk0VO)
Goddamn.... its even worse than rainbow puke
How many time are you going to post this dogshit build
Why do you keep reposting this? It's like the 3rd time now within a year or so?

Also it's hideous and it screams autism if you ask me
Add two fans to the top please
What ever?
no
Bros got a CD drive in 2024
Needs more unixstickers
[deleted]
Nice, I’m still using a Vega too. Pretty good with games and AI on Linux.
It's magnificent in its ugliness.
never understood the stickers

often possession of stickers = lack of education
Love that athlon in the front🫡
I HAVE THIS CASE!
Why does that radeon gpu look like a WD40 can???
 Vega frontier edition has a green LED logo?
Damn I hope the noctua will fit with my Gigabyte B-650 and rtx 4080 super I'm buying soon.
How many lan parties has your pc been to?
I really like the Boo sprite on it…I need one now.
i like the pc fr
I still have use that case too although the top fan died a long time ago
It looks like those old nfs game where you could put an infinite number of stickers on your car to customize It.
Love the Sony sticker badge 😮‍💨
Love it bro looks sick
My first "good" build was about 12y ago and I used a storm stryker case. I loved that case! My rig was:

3930k,
Rog rampage iv extreme,
Gtx 680,
Corsair ax1200,
32gb g.skill ripjaws 1866 ddr3,
256 gb ocz vertex 4,
Bunch of spinners.

I sold it to finance my subsequent rig but I loved that case and board. Overclocked that 3930k to 4.7ghz like an absolute champ.
Damn i love it!
Not enough stickers.
Nascar?
Hardware might need an upgrade but the case fucking rocks i love it
Jealous of your frontier vega
Racecar livery shit
I have the same case. 

With the tool drawer intact
it is 100 times better than my pc
So much history here! I love it, got the feels so much more then the flat boxes we seem to get now.
Oh... My... ROG!!
That AMD64 sticker *really* takes me back.

Those were the days.

...And now I miss DFI again.

Nice PC, OP. A little sticker-ridden but fuck it, the nostalgia trip is worth it I suppose.

No Conroe-era badge though. Pfft, noob lol.
I got the Storm Trooper still. Solid steel can withstand a nuke and weighs about 68lbs with everything in it.

But I love it.
I like the old school vibe. Do you get good temps using this case?
that's one great looking case, i'm heavily biased toward Evangelion though.
I love this.
Now this is something different. Why buy evangelion themed parts when you can stickerbomb your case to oblivion? 

idk, a bit too crowded imho, but i can see myself liking this style if the sticker theme is a bit more coordinated. Feels more cyberpunk-ish with those stickers.
Love the old CM Storm Stryker case. Built like a tank. 
Its still a good case. I made it worst to go from Antec 1200 big tower case to Fractal Meshify C mid tower, now any newer big size gpu wont fit or barely :D but it looks good and has more tech features. Next case definetly big tower. No more mids, because of the long gpus. The antec 1200 is still used with same cpu i7 920 and the cooling is perfect.
I had the updated version of this case like 10 years ago. Thing was HUGE! was my first custom build and I loved it
you get a pass because you have evangelion stickers.
I'm still using an Antec DF85 from 2010 with my 3800x and a RTX 3070 x)
How’s it perform at 2k?
The CPU corpse on the front of the handle gives it Ghost Ship vibes.
Upgrade that GPU and you're gucci
I love it lol cpu power button 😂
This was my first water cooled case! So much space!
Not sure where you got the Evangelion text stickers but they’re typeset in the wrong kanji character set; the original used Japanese kanji characters but this seems to be using Simplified Chinese
Makes me wish I still had that case.
Some haters in here. I like it a lot I think it looks really cool
We have the same Mobo!
There is no need to ever upgrade that case. Rock that shit till everyone's dead.
I love it. The Vega Frontier is still a sexy AF card. Love the old school case too. very nice.
Just like a PC from Cyberpunk era
Sick ass little gaming computer though
Need more stickers
Get rid of the Monster Energy Drink sticker and you're good.
That shit is fugly
based Evangelion stickers
You sure it ain't from Night City?
looks like a build from cyberpunk
I think this case is different/great  :) , so sick of seeing same old style over and over again
Where is the hentai inside sticker
Gross
I like it, gives off Akira vibes
The following Reddit post is sponsored by....
Is this a Vega Frontier card? Thats a rare one then. But why still use it?
this and the cosmos 2 are my most loved cases
Why did old cases look so much better than modern ones
Holy shit stickers Batman. You’ve got Monster, Sony, PlayStation, MSI, Buzz Lightyear, Yoshi, Some kind of Chinese dragon, Japanese Anime, NASA….pick a theme!
OP rolls for strike.
Why do I love stickers in my 30s yet never paid any attention to them until now LoLZ
Poor case :/
Most ugly PC ive seen in a while ... Ken Block  commercial Mode?! sponsored?!
Could do without the monster sticker but otherwise it rocks, kyle
Do you think it makes anyone else want to tear out their own eyeballs?

I swear someone has a mental condition that needs treatment.
Looks much better than all the cringe cookie cutter builds posted here
Stricker no striking
This is too rough
i got the same case for my pentium 4 hd 3850 xp pc
W ratchet sticker, those games made my childhood
I don’t t like the stickers
Sold my Trooper years ago. I thought it was too huge, the coating was getting sticky for some reason and the huge gaps in the intake filters invites dust in. I actually regret buying it.
Yikes, no thematic coherency at all! Dissilussioned with the RGB revolution, I now fancy minimalistic pc builds and this one ain't it
This case goes hard, I love it.
let some women for the rest of us
Evangelion. This is enough to approve ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
I have the exact same case, in the same color.

The bad thing about it though is that it doesn't have anywhere for the type-c motherboard headers to go.

The good thing is the removable filters on the top/bottom, carry handle, and the ability to cram in a ton of HDD's (one direction or another).
I remember that case!!! That was my first pc build! The extra bolt holder was such an underrated feature that i wish other cases had.
I see Vega Frontier, I upvote!
It makes me think of the LEGO EXOFORCE humans vs robots both in mechs series.
Das a lot of stickers!
I absolutely hate every single sticker every single person has ever put on a pc.
Bruh I still have 4x Vega Frontier Edition 16GB in production.  Some of the best value I've ever gotten out of a GPU family.  These things continue to slap.  VR, compute, everything.

If the next gen Intel Battlemage cards come in blower style, all 4 getting replaced.
Just throw that ugly shit out of the window already...
This ain't a dirt bike mah bro...
What games are you playing in 2k?
To improve your gaming experience for $0, and reduce the insane fan noise that the Vega FE produces, consider installing gaming drivers. Installing gaming drivers will give you voltage control though Adrenalin performance tuning. Undervolting this GPU and memory will decrease heat and increase frames.

The FE doesn't support the Gaming version of Adrenalin without a [registry edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/e91rnr/psa_kmd_isgamingdriver_1_to_enable_non_pro_mode/). This means you have almost no control over your GPU's performance. With this edit, you can use the Gaming version of Adrenalin up to 4/2022. Versions after that do not support voltage control on Vega cards AFAIK. Even with this "hack," you should consider re-pasting that card if you haven't already. I installed the Raijintek Morphus II cooler on my FE because the HBM heat is just crazy.

I have since moved on to the 7800XT, but I was able to get a good, long run out of that card.

Edit: for clarity
I think it’s cool because it seems to bring you a lot of joy. Not everyone has so many memories and so much sentiment with their build
How old are you?
I always loved that case. Nice stickers too
Nice build bro, I really dig it. Modern cases got nothing on the classics.
How low is your 1998 Civic?
Does anyone know if a 7900xtx fits in this case?
It’s pretty dope :)
The Vega frontier is such a beautiful card. Too bad it wasn’t that great of a card.
I love what you did with your case
GPU could use an update, Vega is getting a bit old these days. 

Style wise...you do you.
You’ve got a late 2000s/early 2010s vibe with the case and I kinda fw it
Look it's a PC for kids
The sticker on the case make the computer stutter in game.
It looks like an 8-year-old girl decorated it with all her least favorite stickers.
Nice R&C sticker on the back
I usually hate stickers on things like PCs, but your build looks pretty cool)
thats a good pc
Add some more stickers?😄
Not enough flair
I like the sticker bombing for sure
how did you get all of those Amd and nivida stickers they look fucking sick
Where did you get the charm with the golden dragon on it?
Bumper sticker overkill.
I still have a 10 year old Cooler Master Haf X that is rocking year old gear. Those full towers were beasts.
Practice and you can hit some frags
Looks kinda junky with all the stickers.... just sayin
Love my stryker
This looks perfectly scary
Right? Ain't the first time I see this sticker ridden case around here
Same title from last time too.
I thought you might be exaggerating but he actually posts it every *three* months, and it just gets uglier every time.
Everytime it changes enough i post it again , is like if it’s my child
He indeed posts this every 3 to 6 months.... Even with the same title
Oldest post with the case is 4y ago
Came to say this
There is a bit of both in this case
[deleted]
It’s a kickflip
https://i.redd.it/ljy3h7q66acc1.gif
Said the same thing about the Monster sticker, it's lame.
U made a long way too !
Love it too!!!!
I accept your opinion, honestly i don’t like much this new cases, they all minimalist and with panels full of glass, that is not my cup of tea at all
I had this PC case like a decade ago. It's a total piece of shit. Miserable airflow, a nightmare to organise the insides.
Fine wine
❤️
On eBay, U.S. sellers are selling Radeon Vega Frontier cards for $200 once and a while. A few months ago, I paid a bit more for one to mess around with AI image generation with a CUDA workaround using DirectML, which was not as good as an RTX 2080 Ti. Vega Frontier is one of the coolest cards that I own. Might be AMD's last blue GPU.
Same here but with the aluminum 64, those shroud were amazing. the V logo on red or yellow are amazing
Thank u!
If you’re questioning any one specific sticker I’m pretty sure you got the wrong idea on this one
Because stickers are never enough, there are even of intel and many of nvidia
the top is littered with AMD and intel stickers. This thing is a travesty
Is not a bad gpu, it has some serious optimisation on certain field like the cad
Exaclty hahahahhahaha the power button is a mechanical switch as default, i did put on the top of the plastic an athlon 64x2
Performance is definitely important
OFC
U got the point
Ok i take it as a compliment
Thank u!!!!
I’m glad u enjoy this stuff as much as me!
As many as i keep changing it
Why? Isn’t enough one?
Just to keep the build with the right vibes
Because physical media is still WAY higher quality than streaming and worth preserving.
I’ve got 3 optical drives on mine
I have one installed and one is stored away  just in case.  I still have games on disk I play every now and then.  It's not a bad thing.
My gf made it, i wanted even a sonic
I agree and i think that the HBCC is really underrated, my previous card was a vega 56 reference
I don’t get what makes u think like that
Hahahahhah i found it in a abandoned pc in my city then i put it as switch button
NIIIIIICEEEE! SHOW US!
Is the logo of the vega FE
No, it’s yellow
It will, i anyway advice u to put the ram before installing it the complex thing will become one day to take away your rtx 4080 without disassembly the cooler
Then u got why i have a case with a handle!
I recently changed all the default fans with some noctua one because after 10 years they started to make a looot of noise, really glad of my new purchase, these are deadly quiet
It is, it looks like a formula one car and his sponsor
Thank u! I love it too, but don’t say it to my gf
I totally understand it, my best friend still has a 4790k overclocked on his trooper that is from 11 years ago, the only 2 things he changed is the 780ti of gigabyte that broke after 4 years with a gtx 1070 that he still run daily, and his all in one that leaked after few years (back on time the all in one were pretty bad overall), he actually adviced me to buy this case in the white version back on time
Anyway, really a nice build
And it’s gonna get only better, fine wine in action!
MOOOOOOORE COMING!!!
Yeah, the day i retire it i will convert it to a fridge or a skate
I know u are right, i had even the sticker of the amd athlon 64 x2 but i had no space for that , i will anyway in the next future probably take away some stickers and change them
Yeah it’s really heavy, totally understand
I have never seen my ryzen 9 5900x above the 60 degrees not even at 100% it’s really spectacular
Yeah, is mostly made in metal
Hahahahahah easy win!
That is a cool case!
Well, i don’t play the latest and greatest usually, but recently i played ff xv all maxed out in 2 k at 60 fps like a champ, i even played tekken 7 in 4 k by adjusting a couple of settings
Yeah is like the dead body of another pc
Like wtf is that 1200W PSU for?

I run my 7800XT with a 600W PSU and have no single issue
Sounds really overkill imo, with respect to your hardware
I ‘m considering maybe in the next 3 years to change it
I know 😂🤦
U right, it lacks of akira stuff , i will fix this soon 😁
Well, once the main account of seagate have written me “sick build” i would have liked to ask them a sticker and a drive but i ended up not doing so , my mistake
It has some really good optimisation on cad software
Cosmos is amazing as well
Because they have a soul
My point was of not picking a theme! But putting togheter different things
Because they combine many things u like in 1
It’s ok, not all the cases should be minimalistic with glass panels and rainbows around
U got me!
I’m not a big fan of this new cases all in glasses minimalistic , this case represent my way
I say to everyone or u love it or hate it
Nice purchase , my friend had it in the black version with a 4790k
Same!
Happens
I dont like fancy all glass minimalistic builds
Yeah they were really strong in compute and they even have  some specific optimisation in certain scenario, like for cad, what u use them for?
Also why u would replace them with some intel and blower? Do u have a really closed case? Like a server?
I have a dualboot of wind 10, in one of them i generally play, there i tried installing the gaming driver of the 04/2022 but i still have no control over the overclock and the fan speed, i didn’t try yet to change the registry
Thank u!!
Some by buying the products, some i got them from stealing them from the laptops of micro center , some from taobao
From a chinese friend
I’ve been following this sub for about 4-5 years and see it regularly. I had no idea it was that often. It’s like one trick pony karma farming.
My brain assumed this title was some 4chan era meme, but apparently it just gets posted often enough to be embedded in my subconscious.
I bet he is ugly too. Let's stone him to death
Indeed it looks like something only a parent could love
I like the sacrificial amd cpu glued on the top, could have been even cooler if it function as the on button.
They all hating their rig doesn't get attention lol
To hell with ur puns lol
😍😍 it wasn't a great time but it was what we had back then!
“WHAT THE FUCK IS UP DENNYS??”
Not my taste, but I see the appeal, lot of history and themes on it that fit the product no doubt. There was a time I enjoyed such a look aswell, especially if it reflected the games I play and what have you. But now I'm all about minimalism.
It’s not my taste, but I actually quite like it. Cheers man
For sure. We all have different tastes. I'm the one that very much enjoys the sleek, clean look. The perfect cup of tea for me. Like I said, still a good system and that's really all that matters.
I'm more of a minimalist myself when it comes to cases, but I think you've nailed the vibe on this case. Good job!
[removed]
Makes sense, I don't use cad so I wouldn't know how good it is at it.
I still enjoy your creation tho ;D
just put in 14900k+4090 with custom loop cooling and you will receive upvote

office tier build gets insta downvote
Noone wants to engage with you bro.
And don't have to worry about it being pulled from services or relying on internet to access said media
okay let's put it the other way, do highly educated folk care about stickers

&#x200B;

\[ \] y \[ \] n

and you've got the answer. in my books stickers speak of the user having 45'deg forehead

well, ppl just enjoy different things lmao
Even better!!😍
Old case nothing fancy needs a bit of cleaning around and on it.

https://i.redd.it/0gszgy8qqbcc1.gif
I thought it was really obvious tbh. this is the first time I've seen it lol
Or maybe like a old style skate as well
Idk why people hate on stuff like this personally I don’t really like all glass cases that much I have a phantom 750 I believe and I love it it’s covered with sticker
My current build if anyone cares

https://i.redd.it/ius60cds2acc1.gif

C700m case, i found it on amazon watehouse deals 50% off b/c the box was slightly damaged. Even at 50% off it was a splurge
Long ago I was going to water-loop it too, so glad I didn't haha, I couldn't imagine adding more weight.
Well, that psu is a deal i got from a guy, it was new, i got it for 100 euro, i have a lot of things overkill in this pc, like all the noctua fans, the noctua cooler, the case and as well the power supply, because i want them to last even 20 years if it’s possible
Mine is very stripped, the glass panel have to face the wall as I have to connect from the right to my sim rig. You just see the back panel with removed wall so you can see cables as well. Did this to improve air glow.
PCIe Expansion chassis fits 4x blower double wide GPUs. Radial fans wouldn't work.

Next gen Intel Battlemage cards should be well over 40 TFLOPs each vs 13 TFLOPs so worthwhile performance increase.  I wait till the FLOPs have at least doubled and are in my cheapskate price range.

I did cheat and get a RX 7800 XT for my guilty pleasure Windows VR / gaming box. 😂
It will run the Pro version (not the gaming version) of Adrenalin until you change the registry.
My power button is really like a mechanical switch, the cpu is placed there with a piece of double side tape, the good thing is that thanks to the little feet of the cpu it place there really easily without moving, and i can lower it or remove it whenever i want in less than 30 seconds
Bro... All of this over stickers? Why do so many people on reddit make these fake "helpful" comments that serve no purpose other than to feed into their own superiority complex. They're stickers. It ain't that serious, dog.
OP simply has a hobby, why does everyone on Reddit have to try and be a therapist?
Hey OP — Your post has been removed for not being in compliance with Rule 3. 

Be civil and follow side-wide rules, this means no insults, personal attacks, slurs, brigading, mass mentioning users or other rude behaviour

I think i showed a really unique build with some really rare parts to find nowadays, many people here don’t even know what they are, but it’s as u said, if there isn’t a i9 or a x3d or e 4090 the people just downvote it
Then why tf did you comment lmao
I thought it was enough for my config that’s why i got one, if u think i should put another one i consider to buy it
Why u think like that? Do the highly educated folk care about football? That is practically a bunch of people running towards a spinning ball? Well, yeah, a lot of highly educated people do, passions and interest don’t have rules, and taking apart others interest (as i just did with the football) it’s really an unnecessary way to belittle them
My bad it’s a nzxt 240
I would have liked to see that the manufacturer would have continued to produce this kind of cases as well, instead of switching all to the glass panel type
Crazy build, i do really like that case even if i don’t love the rgb, but anyway it looks really solid, back on time i considered to change mine for a moment with the cosmos
Specs?
Even if it has a lot of space that could even handle a loop easly, honestly if someone would ever make a mod of this case i would like to see 2 pc in 1
You can always do as you wish mate. If you think this is something minor and needs no attention then there's no problem whatsoever isn't it? 

And you say fake helpful comments when I believe these loner walks with self conversations when really done right can help a person achieve that elusive and the most precious transcendence of thought even but if you think this whole idea is weak then again do as you wish and let time tell the truth to both of us.
There are deeper implications of things that might seem trivial on the surface. He is putting these stickers even on toy cars. 

Losing oneself in that world of escapism I know about that because I have been through it and resist it everyday but you can ignore me like I am an idiot of course you can do as you wish. I just voiced my opinion about something that in my experience leads to horrors later on. Escapism almost consumed me because I was lonely.
[removed]
didn't read lol

if you don't care - you don't answer
Same here man it’s sick
Yeah i wanted a cosmos since forever haha. From a functionality standpoint the stryker is perfect though, and IMO the HAF/HAFx are probably the best they ever did for airflow. I have a workstation/ML rig in an ancient HAF and its such a dream to work in. The C700m is HEAVY tho! Like over 50 lbs without the components. 

Specs? Pretty much top of the line:

7950x3d, x670e taichi, 64gb Hynix A-die at 6200mhz, rtx 4090 giga gaming oc, 3x sn850x 2tb (those get real cheap sometimes), rm 1200x psu, a few 2.5" ssds and some spinners. Cooler is a h115i platinum(or was it elite, dont remember) and fans are corsair 140s. The gif doesnt show but there are 6 top/front of the case and the one at thenback.

Yes, lots of unicorn puke rgb but I love it 😂
It has support for MOBOs that have two CPU's haha. Could be done.
Listen, I was a bit abrasive in my response and for that I apologize. But you have to understand that giving people unwarranted advice, over something as trivial as liking stickers, can be seen as patronizing and demeaning. Telling someone to change their lifestyle (whether it be an improvement or not) over an aesthetic choice is unnecessary.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Amd) if you have any questions or concerns.*
the Haf is really a beatifull case as well, anyway, 50 lbs as empty is a crazy ammount, mine was 44 lbs and it thought it was really hard to find something heavier,  anyway i love your build, i hope cooler master will not dismiss this top of the tier full tower, but i admit they becoming really more expesive
You think of it as something trivial? You are even putting those stickers on toy cars. Our mind can't handle any kind of voids it ends up desperately wanting to fill it with whatever. Those walks can give the mind something profound to fill that void with otherwise it would do it by itself and it won't be pretty.

I know because I do the exact same thing but in different ways. It's not the stickers for me but other self destructive things but it remains to be the same concept. Please don't take it lightly. If you don't care about my opinion then fine who am I right. But at least go for that walk and ask that question to yourself again is it really something to be taken lightly?

I am sleepy right now so can't talk about the deep psychological aspects of those stickers but trust me it's straight up horror. It's that escapism thing that starts to become the meaning and coping mechanism of one's life and all that sort of stuff where it will leave you all alone when some tragedy comes. 

Like it won't help in a tragedy if you turn to it. I said it in very simple words here I know it ain't enough but again I am very tired right now can't type all I have in mind.
Yoo it aint meth dog 🤣🤣
Found a gem at my local Microcenter
$200 for MSI Gaming X Trio RX 6800 (refurbished with warranty)
Ur winning son
wtf
Wow what a steal.
Nice that it has warranty. You could try carefully removing the warranty sticker using alcohol without ripping it and then replacing the thermal paste with ptm7950.
i paid $200 CAD for an RX 5600 XT, and you're over here getting $200 RX 6800s.

Damn you Microcenter for not opening up locations in Canada!!!
I just spent $315 on a used rx6700xt 😞
Yo nice deal! I just nabbed an open box 4070 super with warranty for 500 at my local microcenter. I will never live anywhere that isn't near a microcenter ever again lol
I wish my country has Microcenters
[deleted]
OMG
Nice, and I thought I was doing great with the Red Devil 6750 xt for 239$ I picked up there.
Hey thats the same GPU as mine! Its a great card but doesn't do to well on raytracing haha
lol that was def a pricing error. Great find!
Good job. Nice find.
I want to go to my microcenter now
Very nice grab!!
Seems like Microcenter knows something about the card you don’t…hope nothing happens after your 15-day return period.
Damn good deal, bud!
Not many Mc thru in usa
Wish I had a microcenter near me tbh
![gif](giphy|6nWhy3ulBL7GSCvKw6)
Nice! I picked up the same card used a little over two weeks ago.
I got a second hand Reference RX 6800 for $340 last year. This puts mine to shame!
That’s a score, gotta love MC. I snatched a 7700XT they had for 300$ about a month ago.
Remember to socket the gem in the right item, otherwise you might regret the unsocket cost at your local vendor. 😝😂
Hell of a deal.
Microcenter propaganda
Wtf paid 330 for a 6700xt... That is a great deal man
Is a 3080 ti evga ftw3 ultra refurbished for 619.99 plus rax good
Only one way to find out what the temps are while gaming. Worst comes to worst your only down $200 and can sell it for $350 and use that to get a new card if the temps are really that bad
I’m pumped up about finding my newegg refurb 6750XT for 270 w warranty as well. Sheesh what a deal, good find man!
I hate to say it, but this model has a terrible cooler which leads to high hot spot temperature.
Nice deal!!! Curious if there is buzzing, allot of the microcenter refurbs were due to coil whine.
Lucky, I picked up a power color 6800 for $350 with warranty. It was the only 3 fan card that would fit my case for the price range
Dang that’s insane! My micro center only has refurbished 6600 XT’s for $210
It's so beautiful.
it saddens me knowing i dont live near a microcenter every time i go looking for parts when states like georgia for whatever reason have 2 of them so close together
It's an AMD though, unfortunately. I just purchased a 3060ti. Gonna use my 5700xt in my 2nd computer. It's been nothing but problems in the years I've owned it. Green screens. HDMI audio cut out issues. Games worked fine, for the most part, but as a monitor and TV it's useless. 

Goodluck.
I wish I had a local Microcenter
Can't believe that honestly. No receipt pic or didn't happen.
Warranty sticker is a fraud. It's illegal for then to deny claims just because the sticker is gone.

Unfortunately, they are allowed to lie and place the stickers to scare the general public.

This in the USA anyway. Not sure about elsewhere.
You have typo its PTM7950
>then replacing the thermal paste with ptm7950.

Why? What's the point?  
This is a monolithic chip, the same as all GPUs from past generations. These don't suffer from pump out like RDNA 3 seems to do. There is really no point in using anything other than thermal paste.
I’ve been wanting to try that stuff out. What has your experience been?
The cheapest 6800 I can find here in Canada is [https://www.kijiji.ca/v-computer-components/city-of-toronto/msi-gaming-radeon-rx-6800-16gb-gddr6-256-bit-hdmi-dp-2155-mhz-rd/1688627139](this one).

The prices are crazy in Canada. The used market still has a premium. Maybe we don't have enough of a market here to really get cheap used cards 🤷🏽‍♂️
I always think like this, then I remember 200 USD is like 280 CAD.
I live in India and gpu prices here are much higher than your Canadian prices. I wish I were a Canadian. The grass is always greener on the other side ;)
I was lucky enough to get a 6700xt for $300 plus shipping haha (used but not abused)
Damn you microcenter for not opening in Europe
USD? A brand new 6750 XT is currently 330.
Still a great card!
brother I paid 1000 for this at the height of covid hahaha good deal
Honestly I just got lucky. Our used market is pretty pricy also. Lowest I saw was $300 for a used 6800
Just got a refurb 6750 xt for 270 from newegg , 240 is still a great deal- op’s is just insane
That’s a dangerous game my friend lol.
Their refurbs from microcenter come with 90 day warranty. Plus I got 2 years. So it’s covered.
That’s a great deal! Happy for you
![gif](giphy|NxckxXIAzumvCP1mUj)
The 3080ti is a good card but for that price I wouldn’t. You can get a 4070 super for cheaper if you want Nvidia. Or 7900GRE if you want AMD. Both of these cards are cheaper, newer, more efficient, and slightly better performance.

The cheapest I found both cards was $549.99
Temps are great. I usually undervolt and underclock slightly. MPT tool for further tweaking
So selling a card with heating problem with a %75 mark up?

And you guys think scalpers are scammers.
So far no issues. But I usually undervolt immediately. 6800 shouldn’t have this issue compared to the 6900xt. I always had high temps (reasonable) with the 6900xt so it was always normal for me.
Good excuse to run liquid cooling. The eiswolf 2 aio can be had for under 300
This uses the same cooler as the 7900xt/x, no? I have the msi 7900xtx and in my case I’ll get a GPU temp of -65 and hotspot of 80-85 depending on the game!
Would you rather have a 6600 at that price?
No buzzing 😊
Recent AMD cards and drivers are doing great, otherwise you won't read people advising RX 6000 and RX 7000 series.
You and me both brother
Just for you

Just like the big trucks that say “NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BROKEN WINDSHIELDS.”

The original sovereign citizens in terms of legal competency.
>Unfortunately, they are allowed to lie and place the stickers to scare the general public.

No, they actually aren't and there are fines. Hell the FTC is actively going after companies that deploy warranty stickers and are trying to use "right to repair" to void warranty. This is my favorite example since it hit Harley-Davidson. [https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2022/07/ftc-says-companies-warranty-restrictions-were-illegal](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2022/07/ftc-says-companies-warranty-restrictions-were-illegal) 

Just a shame this was a settlement and not court tested and made into law.
They apply where I live unfortunately. If you are patient enough, there are tutorials online where they show how to remove the sticker perfectly without damaging it
I have to say, I haven’t had any issues sending shit in for warranty, even with US lack of right to repair laws. Which luckily seem to be gaining traction.
by law you are allowed to customize i believe in the EU so that sticker is in conflict, anyway the lack of proper thermal paste or pad for gpu core like PTM7950 already encourages users to void warranty which should be illigal if you gonna put up BS like this you better make sure to use PTM7950 else there no point for me for example to get a Liquid Devil 7900 XTX i may as well grab a nitro+ and grab a waterblock and then slap it on there along with proper pads and PTM7950

Which again is allowed by law, only thing you must do is bring it back to factory condition aka put on back stock cooler, ignoring that sticker that is in conflict, also user damage is not covered but that has always been the case.
Thanks for pointing it out.
I am just speaking from what I heard from my friend. He had the same model (gaming x trio) from MSI but it is a 6800xt. The stock thermal paste dried out quickly within a year and he had to reapply the thermal paste. Of course, if OP doesn't have any problem he can keep using the factory applied thermal paste but it doesn't hurt to use a proper thermal pad/paste to make your card last longer?
I tried PTM7950 on my 7900xt (XFX Merc). Magical. Getting 70C core, 78C hotspot under full load, no undervolting. PITA to apply tho, do your research on that.
Haven't tried yet on my 6800xt because it is still in warranty and temps are good with stock cooler and paste so far. I am going to do it as soon as warranty runs out.
Christ I just picked up a 7900xt today for that price in eagle town usa
Oh shit it is?

oop
Oh absolutely! It was insanely worth it coming from a 2060!
So £240... Quite a big difference still
Why is that? :D
It's a psyop!!! I gotta wake up they will send me to bug planets! Ugly planets! Frankly, I find the idea of a center for microchips offense!!
I have my 240mm ID cooling on my Radeon VII. I might switch it out 🙂🙃
Wouldn’t that beat the purpose of getting cheap refurbished card?
I think MSI did use the same cooler. Mine 6900XT can have the hotspot temperature over 100 C sometimes. MSI seems to have weird relationships with AMD recently. They didn’t give new designs for RDNA3 cards, skip Zen4 TR motherboards, and they completely ignored 7700/7800XT.
I have a 6900XT with the same cooler so I know it’s pros and cons. If possible, I’d say go for other models.
Then insane deal man!!!! I wouldn’t sweat higher temps if it works @$200.
I have it connected to a Sony x90K. It won't recognize the features my set has. Example, HDR, 120HZ, etc.

I've tried fiddling around with settings such as changing HDMI from standard, to enhanced, to Dolby enhanced, but nothing helps.

It's gotta be the GPU 

I guess I'll find out when my new one gets here.
You said you paid $200, receipt says $209.99 idk if I can trust you. /s
Damn. Lucky mf, sorry for doubting you. The price is unbelievably unbelievable. You're so lucky man. Congrats and enjoy
What I do is; before initiating contact with the company, write "not responsible for other drivers' unsecured load" on my hand. 


Equal standing under the law.
They need to tear apple a new asshole then
I am curious. So you can remove it cleanly how do you put it back on so it will adhere, assuming the solvent will make it not very sticky anymore...
What size did you purchase and from which site? Thinking about giving it a go on my 7900xtx.
RTX 3080 here (pure badass). Running EK full waterblock. Full load gaming temp 30c. Oh yes.
You picked up a 7900 XT for 400 USD? Damn, that's a crazy deal
Where from for 400?!?
Used 6700XT’s go for a lot cheaper used, just picked up a reference 6700XT for my brothers build from someone off facebook marketplace for $180, and that was down from $220 cause they said they weren’t getting any buyers.
Yeah I went from a 1060 6gb to a 6700xt last year. I as a pretty crazy bump. Currently saving up to hopefully do a brand new build next year.
Keep in mind no one in America is including taxes
My apologies. I wasn’t sure of the exchange rate.
I always come out with something hahaha
![gif](giphy|xT9IglWMahJY8B8U2k)
That would be sweet, I'm curious what the temps would be like. My reference 6950 gets to about 80c on air, but I'm planning a custom loop for my 7900 xtx
Yeah big brain move.. spend 200 on the card then 300 on cooling lol

If the temps are really that terrible i would get a completely different card, and sell this
Perhaps repasting might help?
Thanks man 😊
Interesting, did you try it out on a PC monitor with HDMI and DisplayPort cable? Some say it works fine on several monitors, others are saying it's a headache.
They are, Apple customers just need to raise on going issues to get the ball rolling. [https://www.cultofmac.com/540799/ftc-unauthorized-repairs-invalidate-iphone-warranty/](https://www.cultofmac.com/540799/ftc-unauthorized-repairs-invalidate-iphone-warranty/)
Just use a glue stick or any kind of transparent glue behind the sticker next time? That's how I did it for my old card.
80mm x 80mm on Newegg. More than I needed for a single repaste, but wound up having to do it multiple times b/c I replaced the memory pads as well (wound up using thermal putty for that (Upsiren U6 Pro), couldn't find the right size pads).
U said 30⁰ on full load on a 3080??? WTF
Sorry, 540 USD I didn't see the CAD.  Not as good as 400 but still 200ish less than MSRP. Got it off Craigslist from someone who bought it last month and needed something different for video editing but they paid 700+ for it off newegg
I was about to try to talk someone from $250 to like $220 in my area but apparently at some point my access to marketplace got revoked and I don't have any recourse😭
Taxes on used goods on peer to peer sales sites?
I’m broke so it don’t matter although I’d by an 6800xt for 200 probably
I never recommend it, I think the stock 6950xt has been perfectly fine on the stock air cooler. But if someone is so concerned about the cooler, that is an option. Personally I wouldn't invest in water-cooling anything that wasn't top of the line
Not really. This cooler has heat pipe directly contacting the gpu. Without a copper plate, the contact surface is inherently a lot less uniform.
I did not try the display port cable, but if I did, how would I have audio? Never used that cable before. I did however change the picture input various times with no solution.
Fuck yes
Well it’s from 2018 and since then they’ve been disabling features in phones if you use a third party screen camera etc
I see, solid!
Wound up getting it from Amazon from the seller Joyjom (for anyone seeing this later). 

At 100% utilization and 390w power, the max the hotspot hits is around 90c (down from 108c, it was hot) and core 73c. My whole PC is so much quieter now. Magic indeed. It hasn't even had a chance to bake in yet so hopefully that hotspot will drop a bit more. (ASRock Phantom Gaming Radeon RX 7900 XTX)
Yeh man waterblock is pure badass
Just had a few hours on Helldivers 2 maximum settings 1440p. Max temp GPU core is 30.9c, hot spot is 46.6c and memory is 40c. Oh yes.
Good find.
Taxes are still accounted for in the overall price of products in the secondhand market, generally. A used product that was 500 from the store would probably be cheaper than if the same product was 600 new in store.
I couldn’t just let that deal go lol
I carry audio too, but tvs don't have DisplayPort (exclusive for PC).
yup, and apple owners need to raise that issue with the FTC. They will find Apple in violation of the 2018 ruling and fine them again. This is a cat and mouse game, and always will be.
It should drop a little bit more, mine was hitting 81C hotspot before bake-in.
That 3080 silicon will live "forever" at these temps lol
Interesting. Thank you for explaining it :)
I’m On my way now lol no lie
So, how could I do it? HDMI to display port?
Hopefully so. I’ve undervolted it like crazy too so that running cost is reduced ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)
May the force be with you 🫡
Checked it out and got info on open boxes and refurbished items from a guy that works there
Find anything nice?
After 15 years of nvdia i built my first team red system
Sapphire Nitro7900 XTX / 7800 x3D
![gif](giphy|l0MYs36RKd3ze7yVy)
Turn your rear fan around as it's currently pulling in air from a non-filtered intake, other wise good job bud!
For the Horde?
It looks amazing! I need it 😭
team red, seems legit to me💯
Sick build friendo! 

Two lil things to make the build straight fire. The first, as someone else mentioned, not a bad idea to turn the back fan around and run it as an exhaust. The second is to space out the gpu cable combs.
Sick set up mate
Yeah, that’s clean
And ofc you had to go with my favourite looking card to make me jealous 😔

Jokes aside, Sexy looking build op
Trying to summon a demon?
respect
I've got the same CPU and thinking of going red with that 7900xtx. Hearing really positive things about it. Do you mind if I ask what game you're playing in and at what res? Interested to know performance on her.
Oh yeah, beautiful. Congratulations.
This is the most chaotic fan arrangement I've seen off late. Front pulling in air, side immediately exhausting it before it has time to reach the components, back pulling in air again for some reason.
Very nice!
![gif](giphy|LTfmQksK7uq4eK9JPZ|downsized)
nice
I went red breathing style but the red steady works for pics
Sexy
What power cables you running?
Very pretty, but red has a psychological effect of putting you in a hurry so you got that to consider
Welcome to the dark side brother. Team Blue and Team Red (Intel CPU but AMD GPU)
shall i ask the darned question of why no 4080S?
Welcome to the not wasting money club for a name product 👍
i did same move month ago, moved from over 12 year's of nvidia, last gpu rtx 3070 to rx 6800. I didn't want to buy expensive card, but to trade off for same money.

Great decision ever.
I think now  I'm in love with this Black and Red theme.
Wow red Kryptonite, the only weakness to Nvidia and Intel fanboys. You can be sure they will not enter you room *😂
What specific cables are you using for the GPU? :D
Blud really went team red
Yup. I've been using nvidia since the 9800 gt, Just bought a rx 7800 xt a few days ago. Waiting on it to show up tomorrow. Price to performance just isn't worth it with the new rtx cards for me, especially since I don't care about ray tracing.
awesome in the words of my favorite movie die hard "welcome to the party pal "
Looks pretty nice , Congrats.
Great choice in card I love my nitro +
Same for me brother I hope you love it. So glad I got the 7900 XTX back in February 2023. Been having a wonderful time on it. Crushes my old 3070 DTI.

I just really hope AMD improves FSR upscaling quality, maybe even goes AI or gets as good as Intel XES in some games like cyberpunk where it’s much better, and keeps rolling out and improving FSR three frame generation 

Now that AMD is going into AI, I’m expecting some wonderful things to come
You will not regret it, Ngreedia has dug its own grave.

Even if userbenchmark might tell you otherwise :)
Might be a massive mistake with whats going on
Welcome to the dark side. I made the switch last year
It’s beautiful!!!! That’s the same build I’d love to have but with different case. It’s bad ass!
Rma-ing thst same card so pro tip DO NOT us the argb cable to sync all your rgb keep it unplugged and just controll it on its own my rgb stopped working and will now ONLY WORK  with the argb cable in and with a mobo rgb control app to change it (msi center for me) dont even think sapphire cares or knows how to fix the issue they just told me to rma
Please put up a requirement for these kinds of posts to list all their main parts.

Welcome home, brother. Have a seat, have a drink. You've done your part. There's no turmoil anymore, there is peace. Just switch on image sharpening with one, easy click and enjoy your gaming experience. It's that easy.
And….don’t love it?!
you will regret it
My condolences.
I think you went a little too far with the theme. I had RGB lights once, and since then I've built my PCs in black boxes to keep all the light in. Turns out, even the blinking of the network LED on the back when the PC is off was too much for my sleep.
Have fun with Ray tracing
I don't know if it's red because of the lighting or because of the heat your generating.
Welcome…..To the dark side…
Just to be clear regardless of comments about my preferences, that's a sick build.
What iceu profile is that for the colors ? That’s sick man
The devils in those details… 😉
![gif](giphy|l0HTYUmU67pLWv1a8|downsized)
I think you took "team red" a bit too litteral
What monitor u use
What pc tower is this?
And red also looks better than green![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
Sick!!!!
How do you control rgb of your graphic card?
Specs please I wanna build this
🎵Roxaaaaane!🎵
How did you control your RGB? with Trixx or argb motherboard controlled? Razer ARGB controller for the sapphire nitro doesn't seem to work. :(
Reds easy in the eyes at night. Love it.
Welcome to the team that can't run AI like green team 😊
What's your cpu temperatures with that corsair cooler?
The Official Bang for a Buck PC
Welcome to the family son
Remember to do research on newly released games before purchasing to see if they work on amd cards, just bought Helldivers and it's currently unplayable for a lot of AMD users me included
Glad to know you're cured from that disease
Love it
Haha
I can't comment on something I know nothing about. The only information I see is that it's called A "Sapphire Nitro7900 XTX / 7800 x3D" system. Where are all the specs like Processor, Memory, Hard drive, motherboard?
Aaaaaaaand it's gone!
Sick.
I see Ur a intel fan
Now to turn it into a hackintosh…
Love team red but sad helldiver's 2 is crashing on amd gpus
The Dark Side is strong with this one.
Kinda looks like mine, ngl lol
Only thing is better cable management under the desk
it had better score over 9000 somewhere with that graphic on the screen:)
All the way baby
This had me weak 😂
That Frasier! Always up to something
ur right, gonna fix it asap, thank you!
Yeah, but the RGB.
Negative pressure from the top seems to cool my gpu better. I tried flipping the rear fan but my gpu ran 5c hotter.
Hell yea
All right thank you!!
Thank you and it also performs amazingly!!
I have 7900 XTX ASRock Taichi - with AQUA bios update you can rock 550W monster, and its the top PCB on the market. :)
I am currentyl playing RDR2 in 4k at max settings except the volumetric options, stable 120 fps
Thank you!
Thank you for the feedback! Ive built the system last week, and as the first system ive ever built it was prone to have some mistakes. Already fixing the airflow 😉 im thinking the front 6 should be intake and the aio fans and back fan should do exaust right?
Ordered them directly from corsair
Thank you fo your concern, i have the habbit of not game where i sleep. The pc is in my office ;)
I ordered them directly from Corsairs website😉

Who said OPs PC was in his room? My PC setup is in my office.
ray tracing is overrated
AMD cards have RT
We prefer to game at 120 fps and more then 60 sorry.
As someone who has been using an rtx2070 mobile this entire time, I can attest that even the weakest and most basic levels of ray-tracing are sufficient as those RT-cores go basically unused when rasterising, meaning that the RT capabilities only affect how many RT effects you can *add* to the game before destroying your fps.

Gen1 RT cores appear to be able to do 1 RT effect in high quality or 2 in medium/low quality. Seeing how most games only have 1-2 RT effects available with the max I've ever seen being 3 (and even then Portal RTX has really bad RT effects to the point where disabling some of them will actually improve the quality of your graphics, and control has been optimised to such an extent that even my 2070 mobile can handle all the RT effects at 720p/1080dlss).

And now that I'm experimenting with FSR2.2 as some games either don't support dlss or dlss won't let me use the settings I want, I'm no longer on the dlss hype-train as FSR2.2 gives you a much crispier image with significantly less noise and TAA artefacts (sure the image is a little unstable, but at least things don't turn invisible when they're moving around, and at least I don't get after-images of anything that doesn't turn invisible).

So far the only genuine downside to AMD I've "seen" is the input lag, however every single input lag test I've seen of the nee tech also uses fluid-motion frames simultaneously, which makes me think reviewers are actively trying to bork AMD's results in order to give Nvidia buyers a gratifying reason to justify their overpriced cards.

I honestly would like to see an RT comparison between an AMD RX7000 series card and the Nvidia card that's the same price as it (even if it's a "lower level" Nvidia card, cause at this point the performance tier of the card doesn't matter when prices are this insane), as I have a sneaking suspicion that AMD will match their RT performance, or compensate for any RT fps loss with a rasterisation fps gain.
I use signalRGB, its the only program that works with all my components. The theme is Solid Colour

Can u explain me why a casual gamer would want to run AI?
Around 40°C on idlle and between 60 and 75°C while gaming
That's the King of Queens.
Also, flip your side fans around.

They're basically just sucking out the air that comes through the front. As the front panel is already quite restricting, this pretty much means you don't have any air intakes.

What you want:  
front and sides as intake  
top and rear as exhaust
Yeah, I can imagine. The 7900xtx and 7800x3D is a BEASTLY combo
Lucky. I got the same combo and none of games boot up. I gave it to geeksquad and am praying they can get it running beastly for me as well
>Thank you!

You're welcome!
Yes. To be honest, just the three on the front would have been enough and you aren't going to see enough returns by having the side fans but in the very least by having them as intake they aren't disrupting the airflow.
I'm running the 7900x, which has half the 3d cache as yours @64mb (still a lot of 3d cache)

Yours, but it's an amazing cpu . But I do have a 4090 that was, for me, something more of bragging rights at the time . Although I am building my kids' comps now, and theirs will be amd up down left right and center 

I commented because in the years prior every computer I have ever owned that I had any success with has an AMD CPU . Ever since the amd athalon cpus came out . Since the fixed 1.8 ghz system, which was my first . They are workhorses.  I see Intel guys underclocking their 13900ks and 14 series because 3 360mm cooling fans aren't enough on their radiator . (To me this is ridiculous for .2ghz increase in turbo speed . Nvm the fact amd has better singe thread performance anyways)

My arctic air two 120mm radiator barely spins with my cpu.  39 degrees at idle . Never reaches above 70.
This. I recently bought 4080 Super for the AI stuff (and my 3d hobbies) and decided to test the raytracing for a few games that I had installed. My first reaction was like 'Uhh, that was it?'

On the other hands, Almost instantaneous viewport render in blender (accelerated by the raytracing cores) is really awesome though. I hope AMD can improves those productivity applications where having hardware accelerated raytracing can greatly benefit their performance.
It's really not at this point. It's becoming a staple feature in most AAA games and looks absolutely insane in games like Cyberpunk and Alan Wake.
You're really gonna regret that mentality when it is the predominant way of lighting games.
Ya but it’s ass compared to the 4090
Lol at not being able to hit 120 with RT.
Thanks
Btw this is a masterpiece love it good job
Cuz i wanted as casual gamer and it's a pain with AMD.
Pretty sure that's The Big Bang Theory
All right! Thanks
Rocm for Linux is really helpful
That's going to take years yet.
Yeah maybe in another decade when it's more widely available and makes sense.
i don’t usually play games for quality and also team green is overpriced asl
Considering that majority of people are running GPUs like 3060s, 1650s and 1060s, I don't think that's going to be standard for quite a few years to come, and if it did become standard, they would have to implement it in a way where it works well with all GPUs.   


RT definitely isn't overrated, but we're still quite a way off from it becoming the standard.
Yeah but the 4090 is literally $1000 more than the 7900 XTX bro. Not everyone can justify spending that much dude.
Whatever makes you feel better after spending 3 grand on a GPU I guess lol.
[deleted]
Tf yall on, that's Malcolm in the middle.
You might be right, but tech is moving fast, AI particularly. It'll be interesting to see what we're working with in just 2 years.
Nah I'm just excited about having a good rig for the first time in years, but I forgot being happy about something translates to being a fanboy on this cancerous fucking site.

E :lmao at that gatekeeping edit you made there.
More prevalent at that point but still far off from being a requisite requirement.
[deleted]
Not required, but absolutely not overrated as the comment I responded to stated. Anyone who genuinely thinks it's overrated hasn't used it at higher performance. It's breathtaking. 

I do not think it's more important than just, you know, being a good game, but overrated? Have they seen Cyperpunk with full path tracing? It's ridiculous.
[removed]
I've seen it. I don't care about the performance, I've seen it at all levels and... meh? Sometimes it makes the interaction of light looks nice, sometimes it doesn't seem to make a difference. I took a few screenshots in Cyberpunk -

[Ultra graphics preset](https://i.imgur.com/FituMpa.jpeg)

[Ultra graphics preset and ray-tracing "psycho" preset](https://i.imgur.com/BrhKwO5.jpeg)

[Ultra graphics preset & ray tracing "psycho" preset & path tracing](https://i.imgur.com/FituMpa.jpeg)

It's... fine. Even in motion it's not convincing me that it's something I desperately need, and path tracing even more so. Sometimes there's a nice improvement, sometimes it doesn't seem to change much at all, but with a stupid dip in performance. It's just as well I picked a 7800 XT that I don't care about it but I ran it through several runs and in some other games and rapidly came to the conclusion that it'll be nice when it matures, and graphics card technology with it, but we're a long way off from that.

Until then, I'm gucci.

Letter to AMD: Ongoing AMD hardware/software/firmware problems
Over the last 5+ years I have been working to better the Linux virtualisation space through my work on QEMU, KVM and the Looking Glass Project.

You may remember me as the thorn in your side that brought the AMD GPU reset issues to your attention back in 2019 with the release of the Vega 10 (Radeon Vega 56/64, etc), and again in 2021 when you were about to release Navi 21 (Radeon RX 6000 series) after seeing that you had still not fixed the issues with the release of Navi 14 (Radeon RX 5000 series).

While things with Navi 21 improved somewhat with the addition of a partially functional PCI bus reset, things again have taken a step backwards with the Navi 31 (Radeon RX 7000 series). For some the bus reset works most of the time, for others the bus reset doesn’t work at all. When the GPU crashes for any reason, VFIO or not, often it ends up in a state that is completely irrecoverable without a cold reboot of the PC.

While the general consumer might be willing to accept these issues to a certain extent (I mean, it’s not like you advertise these GPUs for VFIO usage), what I find absolutely shocking is that your enterprise GPUs also suffer the exact same issues and this is a major issue, especially when these customers are paying in excess of $6000 USD per accelerator.

Many compute deployments often run multiple GPUs in one system, with the GPUs running in virtual machines so that the resources can be leased out. If one of these GPUs crash, instead of just recovering the crashed device with a industry standard reset method (not some device specific register poking magic), the entire system often has to be restarted forcing the interruption of the remaining still working instances.

You might be thinking that this is to be expected when using consumer GPUs like the Radeon, however I are not talking about your general consumer GPUs here. These enterprise deployments are running hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of AMD Instinct compute accelerators.

I find it incredible that these companies that have large support contracts with you and have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into your products, have been forced to turn to me, a mostly unknown self-employed hacker with very limited resources to try to work around these bugs (design faults?) in your hardware.

Three times in the last two years I have had three different international companies reach out to me to help them diagnose and try to resolve these exact issues. I know that at least one of these companies decided to discontinue using AMD hardware as a policy due to your abysmal support with these reset issues.

We get it, GPUs are complex devices and require thousands of man hours to develop drivers for, consisting of hundreds of thousands of lines of code. That code is never going to be perfect, the devices are going to crash due to mistakes/bugs. The silicon is not going to be perfect, it’s also going to have erratas that cause it to crash/fault, and the firmware like any other software is going to contain bugs.

The ability to “turn it off and on again” should not be a low priority additional feature, but rather an expected and extremely important hardware requirement. Have you actually taken the time to look at how much code in the drivers that is devoted to attempting to recover a crashed GPU? How many man hours have been wasted here that could have just been replaced by a single line of code to trigger the GPU to perform a full reset?

Every other GPU vendor has had this working for 10+ years. NVIDIA devices are amazing, no matter how much abuse I throw at them, from overclocking to poking random registers with random values, every time the GPU crashes, it’s recoverable with a bus reset.

While you have implemented several reset methods into the silicon such as the PSP resets, and the BACO reset, none of these work reliably, and none of them will recover a GPU where the PSP has crashed/hung which is a frequent occurrence. Even the aforementioned PCI bus reset will not recover a GPU with a crashed PSP.

**I have several requests that I hope to see as a result of this letter:**

1. Make the PCI bus reset actually perform a full reset of the SOC, not just certain IPs. Reset the entire SOC, **including the PSP**. The GPU should be in a virgin state after a reset, as if the PC had just 	been powered on and the BIOS has not yet attempted to load the option rom.
2. Stop holding the documentation so close to your chest. Even Intel with the Intel ARC release register level documentation of their GPUs. It lets those of us that want to help you, actually help you. Having 	open source drivers is practically pointless if you do not provide the hardware documentation!
3. Start actually providing support to your enterprise clients, listen to them and fix the bugs they report. I know for a fact that your clients with compute accelerators have been reporting these reset issues for years.

**Why should you listen to me?**

Because people are getting sick and tired of this. Not only is it damaging your reputation, it’s costing you sales. But don’t just listen to me, look at what you are doing to yourself:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr0rWJhv9jU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr0rWJhv9jU)George Hotz – giving up on AMD, abysmal commit messages, lack of documentation, switching to NVIDIA due to the instability of your drivers.

In the VFIO space we no longer recommend AMD GPUs at all, in every instance where people ask for which GPU to use for their new build, the advise is to use NVidia. Even if the AMD GPU manages to reset/start properly, overall stability of the GPU is terrible in comparison to your competitors.

Those that are not using VFIO, but the general gamer running Windows with AMD GPUs are all too well aware of how unstable your cards are. This issue is plaguing your entire line, from low end cheaper consumer cards to your top tier AMD Instinct accelerators.

Please AMD, help us help you!

EDIT: AMD have reached out to invite me to the AMD Vanguard program to hopefully get some traction on these issues \*crosses fingers\*.
I think this needs more mainstream coverage - someone like Wendell@Level1Techs should be interested in this and related phenomena.
Same experience when using AMDGPU on Linux. Hardware rings will reset after timeout, but you have no guarantee that functionality will return to normal after the reset. The only solution is to reboot the entire system. The video codec rings VCN/VCE/UVD is seriously affected by this. But there seems to be nothing the kernel developers can do about it. [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3098#note\_2236916](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/3098#note_2236916)
"The ability to “turn it off and on again” should not be a low priority additional feature"

THANK YOU



Please please please AMD fix this. I use your CPUs and GPUs, and have for a long time. I am also a some time VFIO user, and I do NOT want to have to buy an NVidia GPU for this purpose.
>listen to them and fix the bugs they report

AMD have been dropping the ball on this for decades, and aren't about to pick it up any time soon. It is genuinely astonishing how poor their bugfixing/driver development approach is. I filed a bug recently and was told they didn't have a single windows machine with a 6700xt available on for testing/reproing a problem, which...... is quite incredible
"EDIT: AMD have reached out to invite  me to the AMD Vanguard program to hopefully get some traction on these  issues \*crosses fingers\*."

That is a great idea actually and I vouched my support on the matter.
They couldn't care less. We've had issues with AMD drivers in a video production house where we ran Vega GPUs under Linux for DaVinci Resolve editing on the desktops and for rendering on the farm.  
Those were the worst years of my life where I had to support the investment that failed as soon as the decision to go with AMD was made.  
It costed our company the weight of those cards in solid gold.  
After years of battling AMD and failing, I made an ultimatum to our ceo and told him directly that I didn't want to support this anymore and that I'd leave if we didn't switch everything to Nvidia and I actually quit the company over this because the response was that it was impossible. 2 months later they sold all the AMD hardware at a fraction of the original price and managed to take a credit to switch everything to NVIDIA.

Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.

Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware. Thousands of editors, graders and admins go on forums and ask about AMD only to just get directed to Nvidia by the BlackMagic staff.

Great job AMD! You don't deserve a single customer...
Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..

* Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things.
* No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues.
* I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality.
* AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a "We have this too guys look!!!". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech.
* Speaking of tech demos, features like "AMD Link" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as "High quality"? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently.
* AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist.
* The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of.
* Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA.
* The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it.
* There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??

If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.
Yo, I saw the title and thought this gotta be Gnif2.
And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(

Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others? 

Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware? 

Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.  They working with some kind of magic radiation over there?
I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.

What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.

This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless. 

So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.

You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.
Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this. 

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc). 

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment. 

So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.
6600xt reset just fine but my 6800, oh boyyy. amdgpu refuses to unbind it so I can restore it to the host. Thank you for all the great work!
I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes. 

And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long. 

The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later. 

I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.
I promise you the Vanguard program will yield nothing. "*AMD Radeon*™ *Software Vanguard* Beta Testers are selected community members with exclusive access to early drivers to provide critical feedback."

Basically they made a program out of you doing free QA work for AMD. Don't fall for it.

Watch their hands, not their mouth. Docs + firmware source = good. Promises + "access" = worthless. I fell for this too, not again.

These issues haven't been fixed for a decade. I doubt AMD is capable of fixing them. I think a lot of community people could with docs and source, but AMD doesn't even seem willing to take that step.
[Wish i could play Hell Divers 2 but when i bought it took 30 seconds to get a driver timeout,](https://i.imgur.com/FqM9MRx.mp4) anyway i decided to not switch NVIDIA cos i also well usually play a lot of World of Warcraft but that game has problems for both AMD in form of freezes and driver timeouts gradually getting worse until you update drivers again, cos shader cache gets reset it stops crashing again for couple of days, then starts crashing more frequently and the frequency varies per user and what they doing as well as if their some sort of memory leak.

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

Speaking of which users started reporting flickering issues in browsers such as chrome, or any chrome based browsers, and their 2 reports of it being fixed after MPO is disabled so i guess MPO issues are back on the menu.

[Also i would love to see AMD Gaming YouTube channel to play and livestream Horizon Zero Dawn with HDR turned on in game using AMD relive ](https://i.imgur.com/1RtZtsi.mp4)

Their also way more issues then i just mentioned i have like 41 commonly reported issues from reddit and forums that not been fixed in 24.3.1 and its still going up, some of my own reported issues as well.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

I think developers and studios etc all should work together, instead of trying to sabotage each other for the sake of monopoly i am looking right at you NVIDIA just stop.
Long but worth it read; Well Done!
Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are "just" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. "It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.

On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the "proper" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.
I had the same problem with the Vega 64 liquid edition...    On my PC the 6800xt is working ok... The 7600 on my work pc is SHIT ... Same problems with Vega and if you have a second monitor is x2 :(
The reset issues also happen in Windows, even when it recovers after 5 mins (what the hell it's quicker to reboot, nvidia cards reset in 10s max), the card is not fully reset and some issues i personally noticed with display detection/wake-up not working normally; 

Also in a crash UEFI portion doesn't load properly so either the bios resets CSM to enabled, or if your mobo/bios doesn't do this it will go without video output until windows loads. This is with 6900xt, huge FAIL in my opinion.
> Those that are not using VFIO, but the general gamer running Windows with AMD GPUs are all too well aware of how unstable your cards are. This issue is plaguing your entire line, from low end cheaper consumer cards to your top tier AMD Instinct accelerators.

Not over here my guy. I switched from a 1080 Ti to a 6800 and it actually fixed crashing issues I was getting in Cyberpunk. Used that 6800 for over 3 years with no issues, and then switched to a 7900 XTX and also no issues. 

I also have a used 7600 I bought cheap for one of my TV computers, and that one has also been fine, even when I borrowed it out for a while to a friend so he could run Helldivers 2 without the text graphical glitches he was getting with his old 1080 Ti.

I know there are some issues with AMD drivers, just like there are issues with Nvidia drivers, but I feel like I'm taking crazy pills where the internet is screaming about how incredibly terrible AMD GPU's and drivers are and I'm over here using them for years with no problem.
AMD solftware stack is lacking hard. . . The AI / LLM issues recently and now this. AMD needs to invest in it's software side now.
I’ve been using the 6800xt for almost a year now and from the crashes to the timeouts I decided that im gonna pay the green tax so i paid 900$ for a 4070ti and magically all of my problems disappeared as much as i love AMD i just cannot recommend their GPUs
Thanks for bringing some sense of consumer advocacy towards VFIO.  Very difficult dealing with AMD lately, especially with RMAs on busted CPUs/GPUs (had Vega and 5950X die on me). Let us know how the Vanguard(trash name) program is.
Exactly why I got rid of my 7900XT and went back to using a GTX 1080.  The constant crashing was driving me nuts.
why invite to a conference instead of directly contact gnif and fix the problems 5 years ago? why does gnif need to create the reddit post, begging amd to fix their shit? Why can't amd fix the problems without external impetus? It says a lot about the company.
AMD bugs is why my workstation runs Nvidia, I'm hoping Intel moving into the GPU Space is a wake up call to AMD.

I had these issues as well.
Nevermind, you just came to do god's work, and a very good one btw, to find the same fanboys "I've had Bla Bla years experience and bla bla I game and bla bla never had problems with AMD."

God damn those guys are just blind. Every time I say the truth about the instability of AMD software, I just get downvoted by people that are just blind.
I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.

We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is.
I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.

Note I said attempt...

I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is:
They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.

Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc

I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?

And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

"I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!"

Or even better, "That is because you suck at computers" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..

I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job.
I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here).
Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.
Competition between hardware manufacturers is overall good for innovation, and good for our wallets.
Lmao as a recent AMD intern I feel this in my bones. I still can’t fathom just how little effort is put into software stability these days.
100% all of this...

Love looking glass by the by
How does say VMware handle this? Does it kind of just restart shit as needed?
> Those that are not using VFIO, but the general gamer running Windows with AMD GPUs are all too well aware of how unstable your cards are.


Wait really? How come I never noticed this on over 15-20 amd GPUs since 2016, I game a lot and use them for 3d modeling... Always stable as a rock.
well you know what, I got a amd 7950x based machine with a 6800xt and 7900xtx with unraid handling 2 windows vm. I agree that rdna3 cards are more difficult to run but man the 6800xt worked well without doing anything and 7900xtx only needed a few clicks. for cards not meant to do this it's quite good.
btw build has been running flawlessly since feb 2023
I really think AMD gives users too much control. They've popularized Precision Boost Overdrive and tuning your GPU within the driver which dramatically will increase the issues people have.

For example: black screen restarts will significantly increase when PBO is on during gaming even without curve optimizer. Do you know how many issues I've helped people fix "with their gpu" by just resetting their BIOS and turning on XMP?

Also, too many people go online and watch a 5 min tutorial on GPU overclocking. They throw on Fast vram Timings, undervolt their card, overclock the core, and set a fan curve with 0 testing.
AMD lost a graphics card sale to me because of this issue -- Went with the 4070 instead of the 7800xt.
As a Linux user I feel your pain!

Even more as there are a lot of programs and game that either don't work at all with compatibility layers or they still have a lot of problems even if they work.

And that's besides the extremele huge amount of time wasted with the "trial and error" to find a working combination of configurations.

A properly virtualized Windows would solve so many problems until more programs and games become Linux compatible, either natively or through compatibility layers.

The moment a GPU vendor takes virtualization properly and works on the consumer GPUs and works well, I'm gone!

Price doesn't matter as much for mas the quality!

So AMD, please stop with the bullshit that virtualization is required / needed for enterprise cases only and make it work well for all the consumer GPUs, or get lost!

I'm really tired of this crappy attitude!

I'm already very upset upset that a 30 dollars Raspberry Pi has CEC support to control the programs on it with the TV remote and your 10-20 times more expensive GPUs don't!
> Those that are not using VFIO, but the general gamer running Windows with AMD GPUs are all too well aware of how unstable your cards are.

Hyperbole - most people have few issues - this is one of those perceptions that isn't really matched by reality.

Things like ROCm are definitely still flaky, but gaming is basically fine - it's not as if Nvidia drivers never give people issues. If AMD's drivers were as bad as people make out (for gaming), no one would ever buy them.

does crashing a OC on desktop on GPU, reset CPU PBO settings from bios still ?
Agree with the post. As someone in the industry (and a homelab), we all know buying amd is a compromise.
a few years ago I emailed Lisa Su about a big problem with Instinct GPU offerings in Azure because I couldn't figure out who to email the problem to, and the issue made AMD look bad even though it was a microsoft problem.  She cc'd in the correct engineering department, and a week later they rolled out a fix
  
I'm not suggesting everyone email the CEO for any little thing, however if the problem is severe enough then you could try emailing her and explain why this makes AMD look bad even to AMD supporters and why it should be important to them to care about
"You cant get fired for buying Nvidia", they dont even need to say it.

This was a old saying back then about IBM
Ever since I switched to an RX 6800 I'm getting a bluescreen maybe once every 100 hours in Windows 10. My GTX 970 was extremely stable in comparison.
well, after facing annoying blackscreen flickering with my rtx 3070  @4k 120hz iam not ao sure about driver stability in nvidia.
[deleted]
If PSP crashes, the security state of the data on chip and on the board is compromised and it should not be recoverable. I think it opens up the chip to all sorts of vulnerabilities.
It's wild that this is supposed to be such a big issue, but I've been on AMD for nearly a decade and have had ZERO issues. 

Methinks that when you power users get into super complex setups, you forget your basics and lead yourself into your own problems.

While I'd love for AMD to fix its problems, I think that it's simply that smaller, lower visibility markets matter less to AMD. Working to be competitive both for gaming and for AI servers is work enough.
maybe stop using consumer grade GPUs for enterprise ML? I'm glad these issues exist.
Gnif is active on the l1t forum. Wendell can't really do much on his own either, root issue is just amd stonewalling and sticking its head in the sand
I use my second monitor to check my 9 cameras. They use video hardware acceleration. Every time I open or close a game in the main monitor the client freezes and crashes...  😤😭
Serious question, why would you not want to buy what just works if you're having problems.  Brand loyalty doesn't compute in this scenario to me.
it is the reason i stopped mining to be honest. i had a vfio server that during dead hours i would start hiveos or something to mine on. it was a great automation project and the server had like 4 gpus so i was a good bit of money but the need to have the server reset for the vdi to work in the morning was awful
Thanks mate I appreciate it, glad to see you here :)
Yes, lets fix AMD stuff for them. Im sure they love free labour.
So, did you join the vanguard yet? and are you seeing just how worthless that program is?
I enjoy a variety of hardware with elements from AMD. Such as my ryzen based desktops and laptops. Ps5, ROG ally. But i just wont buy a high performance AMD based GPU. Especially for productivity tasks. Too many software issues and the support just is not there. Steer clear when your livelyhood and income depends on it. 
Boy do I remember some of this. Wasnt even a company I was working at, but they brought us in as a SI to "help" fix some of the resolve issues. After working with BlackMagic we just used their PR  to tell the customer "Sorry, you are shit out of luck. This is not supported and there is nothing that can be done. it's time to rip and replace and eat the cost, unless you do not care about profits and having a functional business.".
Lol wow.

People wonder why Nvidia has a $1 trillion dollar market cap....
This sounds more like a RIP on black magic than it is AMD... after all AMD hardware works fine for those tasks in other software.
I agree with most things except VRAM, you have to compare GPUs with the same amount of memory, otherwise it's typical to use more if more is available. Why would you load assets constantly from SSD/RAM instead of keeping them in VRAM for longer. Unused VRAM is wasted VRAM.
>HIP often being several times slower than CUDA

ZLUDA proves that HIP isn't slower... the application's implentation of the algorithms written over HIP are just unoptimized.

HIP has basically 1-1 parity with CUDA feature wise.
This is honestly why as much as I'm liking my 7800XT, I'll probably go with the "5070" or whatever it's called next year
Epic. Thanks for details.

I seen many times how youtube-creator/streamer went for amd gpu, get multiple crashes in first 20 min of using it, and returned it and get replace for nvidia, also vr-support on amd is joke, especially with screen capture.

For me it always was crazy to see how "tech-youtubers-hardware-reviewers" never ever test VR or/and ML on AMD, and those who promote amd-for-linux on youtube - they dont even use amd-gpu themselves, and do alll video-editing and AI-ML stuff on Nvidia... for promo video about amd-gpu... ye

I have experience with amdgpu from integrated gpu in Ryzen, and I was thinking to go for amd for compute-ML stuff just last month, but I did research:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCm/comments/1agh38b/is\_everything\_actually\_this\_broken\_especially/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCm/comments/1agh38b/is_everything_actually_this_broken_especially/)

Feels like I dodged the bulled.

>AMD's AI game upscaling

Nvidia have RTX voice, they launched upscaling of video in webbrowsers, and now they launching RTX HDR - translation 8bit frames to hdr.

It is crazy to hear from "youtube-tech-reviewer" - "amd good at rasterisation"... we in 2024 - you do need more than just "rasterisation" from GPU.
>There are still people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??

My only fix for this with two monitors is:

1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz
2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within "Custom Resolution" in AMD Adrenalin.

Basically I set a "custom resolution" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

That being said, this is typical AMD BS that you have to deal with as an owner of their GPUs. There are countless other examples that users have to do similar to this to get a mostly good experience.
Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:  
 


"Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards"


Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't. 


Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals? 


There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'. 


So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with? 


My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures. 
Funny, I saw the title and thought the same too!
SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.

But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it "can" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's "Brilliance".

I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).
```Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade```


If they're big enough they'll just write their own firmware, drivers, and etc.
one of the 2 reasons I refunded my 7900xtx and went back to my 3070
All of zen 4 has an igpu output. I would try to set some custom resolutions on that 3rd monitor in Adrenalin. For example if that 3rd monitor is rated to 144hz, try custom resolutions from 134-143 hz and see if any one of those settings drops your idle power!
It's a memclock physics issue and the same threads are on the nvidia forum. Just get one 42/48" monitor or two max at same res and hz and call it a day. Other combos can work. Plugging 3 different monitors in isn't doing any favours.
>I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues

Not a lot of logic to this.

You are talking about today versus 2018 -- those are not the same companies. The number of employees more than doubled and revenues more than tripled.  Whatever challenges and resource constraints AMD faced back then are not the same as today.

That's not to say they don't still have resource constraints and will be able to immediately fix every issue. It just means you cannot make extrapolations from an experience years ago with CPU/platform all the way to GPUs and accelerators today.  

Obviously there's no memo going around which says "make the customer experience bad. signed, the management"
>Watch their hands, not their mouth. Docs + firmware source = good. Promises + "access" = worthless. I fell for this too, not again.

Exactly, docs + firmware source code is what matter, not promises!

back to discord rants...
I've had issues with Nvidia drivers too where AMD have been fine. Guess it's really situational
```but I feel like I'm taking crazy pills where the internet is screaming about how incredibly terrible AMD GPU's and drivers are```


OP was referencing data center use cases, which can vary wildly, and stress different parts of the GPU depending on the task.


It's why AMD clocks EPYC processors significantly lower than the Ryzen variants. Because a Ryzen CPU isn't intended to be hammered 24/7 @100% utilization for months and sometimes years on end.


Now imagine Radeon's bugs but on the scale of enterprise/data center/servers and that's why OP pretty much typed out a cry for help.
I dunno man. I’ve been through a few AMD cards, and getting frametimes rock solid has never been possible for me in certain scenarios. That said, and in fairness, I haven’t used anything by team green lately, so it may all be the same shit , different pile.
Same for me. Went from 1070 to Vega to 6800XT and it's honestly been totally fine. Even Vega I can't recall having stability problems on the games I played. AMD has plenty of feature limitations vs. Nvidia and the prices reflect that.

90%+ of the people who complain about "Radeon can't do X" only bought Radeon because they didn't want to pay for Nvidia. I really don't think Nvidia pricing is unfair, you do get what you pay for. Doubly true for Nvidia's A-series pro cards.
Lol same with me tbh I haven't had any problems 😂 but I guess some do idk 🤷. I have crashed less with AMD than my old  Nvidia card.
gaming is completely different to compute workloads.

it's also different when you're running multiple of these 24/7 in a single machine at full load and if any one of those hard crashes, having to reboot the whole system is really really bad.

read what others' professional experiences are in this post. AMD GPUs are just terrible in the datacenter.
I've had a fair number of issues with my 6950 xt. System wide stutter from alt tabbing in a game because instant replay is on. Video encoding that looks worse than what my 1050 ti was able to do (seriously fucking disappointing there). Text display issues due to some setting AMD had on by default. AMD has caused me a lot of issues that I shouldn't be getting from a card that cost me £540. I get it, it's last gen and my issues are kinda trivial, but it was a huge investment for me at the time and now I'm wishing I'd spent £200 more on a second hand 3090 instead of this.
It doesn't handle it, it has the same issue.

I personally also never had any major issues with AMD/ATI cards I can think of. One thing is true though, sometimes they do really take a long time to fix certain bugs.
Same, used a 6800 for over three years with no issues (actually solved crashing issues I was having with my 1080 Ti) and now moved onto a 7900 XTX, also with no issues.
Me neither. I use a RX580 8GB since launch and not a single problem.

Because they're talking absolute rubbish that's why.
You are one of the lucky ones!
How is an AMD feature "giving users control". If they advertise something and people use it, it's not the end users fault. It's amd for (once again) coding shit features that break things.
Most people that have issues blame the game because of the way that DirectX debugging works. Unless the developer specifically enables the debug layer, and the user has the SDK installed (it will crash without it), and the user runs software to capture the debug strings, there is simply no indication presented to the user as to the cause of the crash that is actually useful, or even hints at a GPU level fault. The game ends up just crashing with some generic error.

That's more of a CPU/platform issue than a GPU issue.
Pretty sure gnif2 mentioned once that he had communicated directly with her in an effort to get this problem resolved.
[removed]
Then if it's crashed, why doesn't a hardware watchdog send it through a full reset, bringing it back to a known safe state again?

Sorry but this makes no sense, leaving it in a crashed state is not making it "safer" but rather in a state that it's behaviour is undefined and could lead to any such secrets being leaked out.
So you have had nearly a decade of experience with GPU passthrough, ROCm, and AMD Instinct compute accelerators?

Methinks you didn't read through the original post.
AFAICT OP is the author of [vendor-reset](https://github.com/gnif/vendor-reset) kernel module which was used to work around some of the VFIO reset issues on Vega. I suspect that they have more knowledge of these quirks than anyone else outside of AMD (and certainly more most on this subreddit). Do you have any additional info to confirm that it's a user error?
[removed]
Maybe read this through again and see that AMD Instinct GPUs are also faulting.
```what I find absolutely shocking is that your enterprise GPUs also suffer the exact same issues```


This legit killed me lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣


I hate to say it, but I understand why companies are paying god knows how much for B100 now.


Gamers used to joke about Radeon drivers but this is next level.
If you search for \`vcn\` in drm/amd, there are many similar victims using 6800xt (and navi2x). [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2156](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2156)

AMD's video codec IP seems to be heavily influenced by other IP blocks, such as SDMA. And they only have one chance to get it right each time they submit a set of commands to the VCN, otherwise they have to reset the entire GPU and lose your desktop context.

  
Another interesting fact is that these instabilities may disappear when you switch from Wayland to Xorg.
I usually stick to AMD because I'm a Linux user and conventionally it has worked better with Linux, and has open source drivers that aren't garbage. My brand loyalty is not absolute, I've used Intel and NVidia before.
I mean, the main reason I wouldn't want to is because it further supports an anti-consumer costing structure...

But if I was buying for enterprise, 100% I'd just buy the thing that works. I just won't personally do it as an individual.
"NVIDIA, it just works"
NVIDIA have already demonstrated multiple times over a decade or more of what they do when they have a near monopoly on the market. I do not want to see what their behaviour with a full monopoly looks like.

That and AMD has the better FOSS driver situation.
Bingo. It’s as cringy as the noctua fans. They really believe moctua makes the best and most reliable  fans in the world. It’s like a cult over there. 

AMD has been throwing L’s lately - and it feels like they’re going backwards.
What is the AMD Vanguard?
I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.

Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.

A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.

Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.

Not only is this using a "diagnostic" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.

I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.
Definitely not because of lack of those issues but investement in AI.

Frankly speaking going forward I fully expect Nvidia to drop the ball as well. Rest of their business compared to AI is just so miniscule.
You misspelled $2.3T market cap....
Okay yeah fair enough, hadn't considered this. Removed it from my post
So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.

Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..

https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif

From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.

* **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**  
In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today.
* **What's the future of the project?**  
With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).
So HIP isn't written badly because it has "1-1 parity with CUDA feature wise".... on this episode of I don't understand what I'm talking about but I have to defend the company I like.
If you have good raster you dont need upscalers and fake frames via generation. Those "features" should be reserved for low to mid range cards to extend the life, not a requirement to run a new game on a high end GPU like we have been seeing lately with non-existent optimization.
This is not a fix. It's a compromise.
Someone else pointed out this is likely just because it has more vram it's using more vram, I think that's the real reason looking at comparisons with both cards at 8gb -- I've removed that point from my post
Any card that has 8 GB of VRAM wont be running a game at settings so high that it would cause a stutter due to lack of VRAM in anything but snythetic youtube tests.
AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.

But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.

Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).

Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).

People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets. They are even trying to enter VDI market with GPU Flex cards based on Alchemist GPUs(SR-IOV was disabled on discrete ARC consumer cards). Hopefully subscription-free model can make Nvidia a run for its money, at least in entry VDI solutions that Nvidia has no interest in.

AMD's Virtual Graphics products are aimed directly at the cloud service providers now. You'll note that the recent virtual product lines are not available via the channel/distribution.
>AMD is just not a player there.

Except all the playstation streaming is doing from AMD GPUs probably outclassing every other vGPU instance out there. Most of the other streaming platforms were done on AMD as well... of course most of the generally fail due to the entire premise being silly.
It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand. 

As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh. 

Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.

And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.

As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they "improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely. And the thing I hate even more then just waiting forever for a fix is being stuck in limbo not knowing.
>Not a lot of logic to this.

Look at my other reply

I'm the same. my issues with Nvidia drivers were so bad it made my gpu and entire windows install functionally bricks. Got rid of my EVGA 760 when the 900 cards and AMD's 300 series came out, jumped to R9 390 and haven't looked back since (R9 390>RX 5700xt>RX 7700xt) The only issue i ever had with AMD was the first few months of the 5700xt and its awful unplayable performance issues in DX9 games, but that was solved within months, and they eventually went on to improve opengl performance on Navi/RDNA as well which was a nice welcome surprise. Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem. More often than not any system issues im having end up being the fault of Microsoft, or a specific game wasnt tested on AMD properly and the blame lies with the devs.
The comment I quoted was talking about people playing games having issues.
> It's why AMD clocks EPYC processors significantly lower than the Ryzen variants. Because a Ryzen CPU isn't intended to be hammered 24/7 @100% utilization for months and sometimes years on end.

I think that's more about the unreasonably high power they'd use if they boosted the same as ryzen
The thing I quoted was talking about people playing games though.
I've also had numerous issues with my 6800XT, currently stuck with a 23.11.1 driver version as all newer ones are just trash on my system. This one is usable, newer ones all have a ton of stutter and all that Radeon stuff. 

I should have just re-pasted my previous GeForce and ride out the pandemic shortage, but I wanted a faster GPU and thought I'd give a Radeon one final chance. There wasn't a 3080 or 3090 available back then, otherwise I would've rather bought one. 

While 6800XT has had some okay drivers here and there, the overall experience remains sub-par; the road still is full of unpaved and rough sections. I've decided to ban Radeons from my household after this one is evicted. It's not worth the driver hassle, not even the numerous Reddit upvotes you get by saying you use a Radeon. :D 

It's good that AMD still has the willingness to keep fighting back, it's good to have rivalry. But... I don't know, man. I'm not giving them a consolation prize for a lackluster participation.
I spent 330, you spent 540, we could have spent 1000 in the 7900xtx, it isn't supposed to have these kinds of problems, and all the hours of troubleshooting that comes with it.

OPs not being able to reset the card state without a hardware reboot is just.. bad especially on the server side of things.

We have to start calling things by their true name, and all of these situations are just bad firmware/software/vbios/drivers implementation by AMD.

That and drivers install are just finicky like it happened to me in the latest chipset driver install.. sorry not normal.

Just saying you have no problems won't erase the existence of these thousands of cases of people having problems. And the truth of OPs issue he mentioned in this thread.
Idk, I don't use Linux
Yeah, they are around 20x smaller than nvidia so kind of expected imho
RX580 is Polaris, before the big redesign that was Vega and brought the PSP into the mix. Note that none of this is referring to that GPU. Until you upgrade to one of the more modern GPUs, your experience here is exactly zero.
No I am not, this is 100% the truth, but you can of course think whatever you want and be ignorant.

And don't forget that AMD has invested into adding debugging to their drivers so that people like you can submit useful bug reports to try to get to the bottom of why their GPUs are so unstable. When was the last time you saw Intel or NVidia need to resort to adding user debug tools to their drivers!

I don't know man, most of the people I know that use Radeon have not had issues at all. Some are running 5000, 6000, and 7000 series cards.

Don't mean to downplay the issues with VFIO, just my perspective.
Because adding a feature for a product literally gives users more control for that product.
And If I get no crashes with my AMD graphics cared - how does that fit your narrative?
> That's more of a CPU/platform issue than a GPU issue.

It happened to me 0 times with an Nvidia card while OCing for hundreds of bios cycles and thousands of hours on AM4/AM5, while Radeon users are experiencing it all of the time. The CPU/platform is fine.

The Radeon graphics drivers hooking into CPU OC and platform controls intimately - or even at all - for no good reason are not fine.

It should reset, maybe it doesn't know it's crashed in the specific bug you have generated. But your data should not be recoverable. If you have reproduced the bug confidently and sent the report to AMD and they haven't fixed it there is nothing more you can do.
Sorry to jump on a random reply - but does this have any relevance? It might just be PR hot air

Yes, I am the author of vendor-reset. This is my third attempt now to get AMD to resolve these issues properly. vendor-reset was supposed to be a temporary stop-gap workaround while we waited for a new generation that was fixed.

I get that you are being cheeky, but the use-case is very difference and the professional-demands are far far far higher.

When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.

I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.

So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.

I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.

Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here. To people that didn't get what the main issue was, hopefully my explanation helps.
> Gamers used to joke about Radeon drivers but this is next level.

Getting banned from games is peak driver fail.
Yeah, I always wondered why NV was so huge in datacenter stuff also for compute way before this AI craze. especially in fp64, AMD used to be competitive especially factoring in price.

But reading this explains it all.
That beeing said, Nvidia's GSP approach and Red Hat recently announcing Nova (Nouveau successor written in Rust), things might change in the future. E.g. AMD's HDMI 2.1 not beeing approved to be open sourced is a perfect example, which works fine in Nvidia's hybrid approach (from a legal/licensing perspective).


AMD has the lead regarding Linux drivers, but they need to keep pushing, if they want to stay ahead.
*wayland users have joined the chat
You're falling for slogans.
To be fair, Noctua do make some of the best fans out there (if you do not want rgb ofc).


From their server grade ones up to consumer grade ones.


They are really expensive, true, but the sound profile is by far one if not the best one.


Pair that with how high the static pressure and airflow are, and yes, its the best out there, for an expensive price.


With half the price you can get 80% of the performance on other brands, I wont deny that, but if you are qilling to spend money, they are the best in the market, period.
Unpaid beta test program that has existed since ages... hasn't resulted in any of the complaints in this thread getting fixed though.
[https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adrenalin/amd-vanguard-program.html](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adrenalin/amd-vanguard-program.html)
you're kinda missing the point tho, it's because they do pay attention to software and firmware that they were able to establish that foothold.
Honestly after a trillion I kinda stop counting 😂🤣
VRAM usage is specific.

In context of Unity games and VRChat - Nvidia does use less VRAM than AMD... but only in Windows, only Nvidia DX driver in Windows have this "hidden feature" and only with DX API. So it may be DX feature. It very common/easy to see it in VRChat large maps, or large Unity games.

In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.

P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating "how much it want" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less. In Vulkan - DXVK have huge overhead about 1Gb on Nvidia GPUs in many cases, and Unity "eat all vram possible" behavior explode difference.
No its more like, nobody has bothered to optimize or profile HIP applications for performance for a decade like they have those same CUDA applications.

I'm just stating facts. You are the one being aggressive over... some computer hardware good gosh.
Let me tell you some stuff regarding how a GPU works.


Raster performance can only take you so far.


We are in the brink of not being able to add more transistors to the GPU.


Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.


Saying that these "features" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.


RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.


Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.


The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.


GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.


Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.


Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.


No one complained about that. It works.


And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.


Im damn sure (and I did this before with people at my home) that if I provide you with a game blind testing it with DLSS and Frame Gen, along with other games with those features on and off, you wont be able to notice at all.
I'm just trying to help, not debate the semantics of what is considered a fix or a compromise. Purchasing an AMD GPU is already a compromise.
It's not a dumpster fire.. you just have to buy an overpriced GPU to even have it... so pretty much a completely utter nothing burger that AMD is not even interested in.
Except the V620/520 are not the only GPUs that support MxGPU, Instinct's line does too and offers the same "features" as the V520/620, but the native driver support is more geared towards GPCompute and not 3d rendering, but are also supported by the exact same driver family as the WX workstation, V cloud, and RX GPU lines. 

Also, been a lot of offloading of the V520 and V620 "cloud only" GPUs on the gray market, and I can CTO HPE servers with V620's by enterprise ordering today.
This is not at all on the same level as what the OP is talking about.

I can also stream from my RX6600M, RX6600, my Ally,..etc just like you can from the Playstation. But it has nothing to do with VFIO, virtualization, or MxGPU. 

What my bitch about, and it aligns with OP perfectly, vGPU support (MxGPU) for VDI setups on non-VMware solutions. AMD has completely dropped the ball here and its never been more important then **right now**.
Hey, just trying to help your setup right now. I would be frustrated too, I had the same issue with two monitors, not three. I was able to fix the idle power issue by setting the alternate monitor to 60hz and setting my main monitor to 162hz (max 170). Obviously spend your money where you think it's worth it.
>It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.

Have your displays continued working reliably? Oh they have? You are over the vblank limit for idling down... so its not and never will be a bug on ANY GPU.

This is far more akin to your car idling up when the AC comes on... you have 3 displays on a certain amount of framebuffer bandwidth is REQUIRED to implement that, + a bit more to account to account for any lite tasks that might be running on the GPU at the same time.

The whole issue here is that your memory bus with 3 monitors active is NOT idle... if you want it to idle down turn your dang monitors off, its that easy.

At some point they may have a solution that just powers up a single memory lane or something and allocates the frame buffers in there, but people complaining about a problem that doesn't have a solution and only affects 0.5% of people is annoying.
AMD is working with [Amazon ](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/)and [Azure](https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/nvv4-datasheet.pdf) on systems with 1-4 GPUs supporting SR-IOV/MxGPU. This is only with "Pro" or "Instinct" cards though. 

I'm sure there has historically been little incentive to make this rock solid on consumer GPUs. Though that is a shame.

However I see no reason to assume the constraints which led to that choice in the past exist today.
True, windows had an awful habit of breaking my system by continually trying to uninstall new drivers
What are you talking about? AMD employs 26000 people, NVIDIA has 29000. They're the same size... oh, you mean profits? Well then, yeah...
Idk bro, had 470', 570', 580', 590, 460, few of vega64, 56, 6700xt, 7900xt.... Never had issues, even with those vegas I abused, overcloccked etc
Oh then just ignore my comment 😅
I'll be honest, I've been using AMD GPUs since 2010 and they've been solid.

However the features Nvidia is rolling out is making me consider a 5070 next year
Heartbreaking to see you downvoted by bringing these issues up. Reddit is such a terrible place.
Awesome, not biased at all, now pull up a similar list of nvidia and intel driver issues, it wouldn't be any shorter...
And you keep grossly overstating the issue. 

Most of which were quickly resolved and/or effected a small number of customers and limited to specific apps, games or usage scenarios.

I've had an AMD gpu in my primary gaming PC for the past three years. Not a single one of the issues you listed effected me or a majority of owners. 

And umm yeah, Nvidia also have bug / feedback report tools....

Intel right now are causing me far more issues with their Xe drivers so please. I'm still waiting for Xe to support variable rate refresh on any fucking monitor.
\> Don't mean to downplay the issues with VFIO, just my perspective.

Understood, however you responded to a comment directly related to someone that has been lucky with VFIO.

u/SckarraA I am curious, have you tried simulating a VM crash by force stopping the guest and seeing if the GPU still works? This is usually guaranteed to put the GPU into a unrecoverable state.
[deleted]
It's really weird how many AMD fanboys like yourself are popping up and denying the existence of a well known and documented issue because it either isn't majorly impactful to them or they don't know how to recognize it.

Just because it doesn't affect you doesn't mean it's not a real issue and doesn't mean it shouldn't be addressed.

Quit being so obliviously self-centered.
It was only a few months ago that an amd feature in their drivers literally got massive amounts of people banned in online games, so much so that amd hat to completely pull that feature and no one has heard of it ever since. 

How can you claim that amd drivers are in a good position?
Also what sucks the most is that such a bios change takes a preboot 40-50 seconds before anything is even displayed on the screen
I definitely got it all the time while OCing on nvidia cards. Sometimes it just resets for the hell of it on a reboot where I wasn't even doing anything.

I'm not sure why you think AMD's GPU drivers have some intimate link with the BIOS. They don't.
WTF are you talking about. Do not apply CPU OC from Adrenalin Ryzen Master API, and it won't reset on GPU crash.   
Spoiler, if you save preset with GPU OC, while you have CPU OC applied through separate Ryzen Master or BIOS, it won't be affected by Adrenalin OC reset on crash.

How it is that i had never had my CPU PBO reset after dozens of forced GPU crashes (through UV and one bug i found out on occasion)?  
There was only one case where it was affecting people. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master API in Adrenalin for the first time, as previously saved GPU OC presets had no CPU data, and forced CPU OC to reset to defaults. After re-saving GPU OC profile, it never happens again.
Yes, it should and when the GPU is still in a semi-functional state we can tell the GPU to perform a reset... which does nothing. So yes, it should reset, but they do not.

\> But your data should not be recoverable.  
Correct, we are not talking about recovering data, just getting the GPU back to a working state without rebooting the system.  


\> there is nothing more you can do.

Not entirely true, if it was the case the \`vendor-reset\` project would not exist:

Honestly, the HDMI 2.1 fiasco has pushed me (and many other people) to stay away from HDMI, not AMD.

As for Nova, we'll see how it goes, but it's likely a multi-year endeavour, just like it was many years ago for the Amd open drivers.

Currently, from a consumer and Linux user point of view Nvidia should be avoided whenever that's possible, and I speak from experience since I made the mistake of buying a laptop with hybrid graphics and Nvidia gpu.
It was a good deal, but that has cost me *a lot* of hours of troubleshooting of different issues, that never happened with AMD or Intel. 

The strange thing about Amd is that they focused a lot, in the past few years, on consumer drivers/software, while from the hardware pov they pushed the accelerator on HPC/AI hardware, so there is some kind of mismatch and often their product either have great hardware or great software, but usually not both.
Agreed, they cannot rest on their laurels.
Execept for when it comes to VFIO usage, NVidia literally just works. They even endorse and support it's usage for VFIO Passthrough, as niche as this is.

console gamers know pc’s are better and don’t really complain about upscaling and 30fps.. you’re right that competitive sacrifices everything else for latency. also may be true that your average casual gamer wouldn’t notice increased input latency. but they have been adding transistors and ppl were willing to pay doubling amount of cost for them. i rmb when a midrange card used to cost 200.
I'm well aware of what VDI desktops are... it effectively the same thing though.

And yes... Sony does use vGPU/MxGPU for streaming PS games.

There really is no ball to drop because no solution has exited outside of VmWare. at least not one that has involved a company actually working with AMD to build any solution.
Haha dw, just venting a bit.

It's also genuinenly my only gripe with the card and setup, it's just annoying it's not getting fixed and I can't apply any workaround, particularly for the price I've paid. 

I would just put in any of the older cards I've got laying around just to drive the other monitors but then I'd have to give up 10gbit networking, and I'd still have higher than ideal idle usage  but it would be cut down a bit. 

So I'm mostly miffed that if I wanted to actually resolve this it would be by moving to a cpu with integrated graphics, and that's money I don't want to spend. But if I don't, I'm spending money I don't want to spend.
Apparently 100watts is "normal" and to be expected, and I should just be grateful, the fk are you waffling on about? That's 20watts short of the max TDP of a 1060... a card that could run these 3 monitors without trying to burn a hole in my wallet FYI..

And fantastic solution, so I spend over 1000euro's on a GPU but then have to turn my monitors off, genius... Quality stuff, can't make this shit up. Also like I actually typed out:

>the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off 

so how would that work? Oh maybe I can throw my main monitor in the trash and then the problem is solved I suppose?

>but people complaining about a problem that doesn't have a solution and only affects 0.5% of people is annoying.

Am I supposed to complain about issues that don't affect me? Or are you saying I've got no right to complain? Is me having a bad experience annoying you?

and if not by complaining how am I supposed to know this issue doesn't have a solution? Do you even listen to what you're saying?

You know what's annoying? People dismissing other people's complaints because "they don't like it" or they're such fanboys they can't stand someone criticizing their favourite brand.
Sorry but AMD "working with" is a joke. I have been working with companies that have hundreds to thousands of AMD Instinct GPUs.

I have been able to interact directly with the AMD support engineers they provide access to, and the support is severely lacking. These issues here have been reported on for over 5 years now, and what has AMD done for these clients?

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.

Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

Why did it take some random (me) to have to publicly embarrass the company before we saw any action on bugs reported by their loyal paying enterprise clients?
>AMD is working with Amazon and Azure on systems with 1-4 GPUs supporting SR-IOV/MxGPU. This is only with "Pro" or "Instinct" cards though.

and MSFT, but we are not seeing these changes upstream via open standards. We still are lacking working support for the likes of Nutanix and Proxmox (both KVM), where Redhat has some support but there are still unresolved issues there.

Fact of it, the changes AMD is pushing at AWS would upstream to every other KVM install and bring those fixes to mainstream. But this has been going on for well over 6 years that I can recall and still we are no closer to a ODM solution released to the masses. I had hopes for RDNA2 and I have expectations for RDNA3+/CDNA3+ that are just not being met outside of data sciences.
I am a FOSS software developer, on hand right now I have several examples of every card you just listed, including almost every generation of NVidia since the Pascal, Intel ARC, Intel Flex, AMD Mi-25, AMD Mi-100.

Even the Radeon VII which AMD literally discontinued because it not only made zero commercial sense, but suffered from a silicon bug in it's PSP crippling some of it's core functionality.

I have no horse in this race, I am not picking on AMD vs NVIDIA here, I am trying to get AMD to fix things because we want to use their products.

You state you never had issues, however, how many times have you had a game randomly crash with no error/fault or some random error that is cryptic? How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?

Very often these are caused buy the GPU driver crashing, but due to the design of DirectX, unless you explicitly enable it, and have the Graphics Tools SDK installed, and use a tool that lets you capture the output debug strings, you would never know.

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-layers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-layers)
Why does every valid criticism of amd has to be dragged down to that tribal stuff? Stop being a fanboy and demand better products.
I am not at all stating that NVIDIA GPU do not crash either. You are completely missing the point. NVIDIA GPUs can RECOVER from a crash. AMD GPUs fall flat on their face and require a cold reboot.
my dude this is a guy that has worked with both of the other 2 companies and has repeatedly complained about the shit locks and bugs in both intel and nvidia. the software that he has created is basically state of the art.

this is /r/amd not /r/AyyMD
Not at all, you just keep missing the point entirely. You agreed with the post above you where is stated that the GPUs are rock solid. I provided evidence to show that they are not rock solid and do, from time to time have issues.

This is not overstating anything, this is showing you, and the post above you, are provably false in this assertion.

Just because you, a sample size of 1, have had few/no issues, doesn't mean there are clusters of other people experiencing issues with these GPUs.

\> And umm yeah, Nvidia also have bug / feedback report tools....

Yup, but did they need to make a large press release about it like AMD did. You should be worried about any company feeling the need advertise their debugging and crash reporting as a great new feature.

1) It should have been in there from day one.

2) If the software is stable, there should be few/no crashes.

3) You only make a press release about such things if you are trying to regain confidence in your user-base/investors because of the bad PR of your devices crashing. It's basically a "look, we are fixing things" release.
My friends don't do VFIO stuff so I cannot say about them, but while I've never forcibly ended the VM (via htop or something) they have crashed repeatedly in the past, [especially this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/11c1sj7/single_gpu_passthrough_to_macos_ventura_on_qemu/). I've even got a 7800XT recently and haven't had any issues. Though this might be anecdotal since I am focusing on college right now and haven't put a ton of time into this recently.

EDIT: Also, I love your work, I hope I wasn't coming off as an asshole, I just have autism.
Guild Wars doesn't work on 7000 series cards and I assume it never will. a 3rd of the FPS I get with a 2080
I'm not denying the existence of his issues around VFIO, I'm pushing back against him conflating it with gaming, for which there is a known circlejerk around AMD drivers being seen as 'unstable', which is hugely overblown.
[deleted]
You mentioned earlier you are diagnosing issues for a corporation related to IOV in GPUs they purchased. Are you refering to Navi based cards or Datacenter parts?
I partly agree with you there. But unfortunately it's difficult to avoid HDMI 2.1, when you need to hook it up to a 4K TV. I would absolutely *love* to see 4K TV manufacturers offer DisplayPort in future TVs, but that's probably not happening anytime soon.


About Nova you're probably right. But please keep in mind, that its scope is much more narrow than any other open source driver out there. Mostly, it only serves as an adapter between the Linux kernel and GSP firmware. Current Noveau implementations reflect this: GSP features are easier to implement and thus currently more feature complete. And since there is an AI/Nvidia hype train at the moment, they will probably also dedicate more resources into it than say stratis-storage.
When did they do this switch? I remember years ago when I configured that their windows drivers weren’t being so nice to the card detected in a VM.
The price of the GPU is not determined by the transistor count, but by the DIE size.


In the past they used to shrink the size WAY faster than now, enabling doubling transistor count per square inch every 2 to 4 years.


Now they barely manage to increase density by a 30%.


And while yes, they can increase the size, the size is what dictates the price of the core.


If they "just increase the size", the cost per generation will be 2 times the previous gen cost :)
>I'm well aware of what VDI desktops are... it effectively the same thing though.

Nope, not at all. One is virtual with IOMMU tables and SR-IOV(and a ton of security around hardware layers), the other is a unified platform that runs metal software with no virtual layers. Clearly you do not understand VDI.
You can just stop looking for solutions as it's not a bug. Your setup clearly exceeds the limkts for v-blank interval to perform memory reclocking. In that case  memory stays at 100% and you get a power hog (Navi 31 is especially bad because of MCD design. Deaktop Ryzen suffers from the same thing).

This will never be fixed, as there's nothing to fix. Works as intended and if you try reclocking your memory when eunning such a setup  you'll get screen flicker (happened in linux a month ago because they broke short v-blank detection)
if the monitors run at different resolutions and frequency than each other my power increases. if my monitors match, idle power is normal
100w is normal for the memory bus being clocked up.... yes.'

The exact same problem occurs on Nvidia hardware also since a decade also.
> You state you never had issues, however, how many times have you had a game randomly crash with no error/fault or some random error that is cryptic? How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?

I'm not the guy you're replying to, but for me, almost never.

I've had exactly one driver-based AMD issue - when I first got my 5700XT on release, there was a weird driver bug that caused the occasional BSOD when viewing video in a browser - this was fixed quickly.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.

There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.

Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about? Even if you aren't, it calls into question your credibility on the main subject of your complaint.
> You state you never had issues, however, how many times have you had a game randomly crash with no error/fault or some random error that is cryptic? How often have you assumed this is the game's fault? 


Literally zero. I guess I just have a good pc setup... It is weird how some people always have issues
> You state you never had issues, however, how many times have you had a game randomly crash with no error/fault or some random error that is cryptic? How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?

My aging 5700 XT crashes in games far less often than my friends who are on various Nvidia cards from 2080 Ti to 4090.  Same for when I was on Polarix with RX 470s.

Game crashes are rarely the fault of the graphics driver (or hardware), regardless of brand.  This isn't a good point to be making, because it's just wrong.

> suffered from a silicon bug in it's PSP crippling some of it's core functionality

This again?  No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.

Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.

People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.

It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.

Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.
Part of it is rooting for the underdog, part of it is probably due to people legitimately not having problems.

I was an Nvidia user for several years, and moving to AMD I've had a lot of problems with black screen, full system crashes and driver timeouts that I haven't had on Nvidia.
Good ol' "it works on my machine".

It's a small and niche userbase so it gets downplayed, backed by "it works on my machine" when you express your concerns, despite the fact they don't use that feature or have zero knowledge on the topic. Same goes to H.264 hardware encoder being worst of the bunch for years.

And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.

But that doesn't mean AMD should be ghosting the issues as people have been expressing their concerns even on datacenter systems where real money flows.

How many r/Ayymd trolls actually know VDI, VFIO and let alone what "reset" means? Probably has never google'd them, despite the fact one of the most well-respected FOSS wizards in this scene is trying to communicate with them. I hope gnif2 doesn't get upset from the trolls alone and wish him a good luck on Vanguard program. (I also came across his work on vendor-reset when I was poking around AMD integrated graphics device passthrough.)
Demand what rofl, I have literally zero issues. 99% of criticism is not valid and is extremely biased and overblown, that is why.
No they don't

I've crashed AMD gpu drivers plenty of times while overclocking and it recovered fine

AMD have dramatically improved their driver auto recovery from years ago when such basic crashes did require hard reboots.

Might still be shit in Linux, but what isn't...
Oh and XE also have bug feature reporting.

Omfg!!!!
Nobody is 100% right ;)
Guild Wars 1 or 2 (does Guild Wars 1 even work anymore?? XD)
It's been explained why what you just said is wrong and you appear to be ignoring it.

You don't understand the issue at hand and are just running your mouth making an ill-informed and baseless argument that is irrelevant to what is being discussed here. Either you tried to understand it and failed, or, more likely, you never tried to and just want to whine about Redditors.
Firstly, i am barely even able to find any posts about this issue. Which means that issue is extremely case specific, so you should not categorically blame AMD and Adrenaline. With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).  
They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.

For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

  
From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default. To fix that you just needed re-set GPU OC and resave preset after update.
Yes, these are Instinct Mi100 for now, depending on how things go with this GPU it may also be later GPU generations also.
What about using a DP to HDMI 2.1 adapter for that situation?
2021 my guy, it's right there on the date of the article.
LOL you literally just said this one thing is not like this other thing because its the same as the thing. PS Streaming runs multiple instances of hardware per node... with separate virtualized OS deal with it.
They could do something like relocate video framebuffers to one memory channel and turn the rest off... if idle is detected.

But that would be very complicated.
I see your point, and perhaps my statement on being so unstable is a bit over the top, however in my personal experience (if that's all we are comparing here), every generation of GPU since Vega I have used, has had crash to desktop issues, or BSOD issues under very standard and common workloads.

In-fact no more then a few days ago I passed on memory dumps to the RTG for a \`VIDEO\_DXGKRNL\_FATAL\_ERROR\` BSOD triggered by simply running a hard disk benchmark in Passmark (which is very odd) on my 7900XT.

Note: There is zero doubt that this is a driver bug, I am running a EPYC workstation with ECC RAM, no overclocking, etc.

At the end of the day here, I am not trying to say "AMD is bad, do not use them". I am trying to say that AMD need to 
 provide an industry standard means to properly and fully reset the GPU when these faults occur.

The amount of man hours wasted in developing and maintaining the reset routines in both the Windows and Linux drivers are insane, and could be put towards more important matters/features/fixes.
And I guess infallible game developers too then. /s
So you decide what criticism is valid and what not? lol
AMD cards don't recover from a crash. This is well known and can be triggered in a repeatable manner on any OS.

You don't understand the issue and are just running your mouth.
Yup, but do you see them making a big press release about it?
that is not how it works but sure

7900xtx dips to 30fps in combat or around players. 2080 never dips below 70
>whine about Redditors.

The irony.
IF I got an AMD gpu, that would be my only option.   There's mixed reports on that - you have to make sure it's an active adapter - and some of the Display port 2.0 to hdmi 2.1 adapters might work.   Some ppl say a 'Cable Matters' brand works but you might have to update/upgrade the firmware.   But, if you are shopping for a higher tier card - for e.g., a 7900 xtx - that's a pretty expensive risk - especially when you have to factor in the cost of an adapter, too?
learn to comprehend.
Thank you for your response - I actually agree with a lot of what you are saying. AMD is lacking in pro support for quite specific but very important things and you aren't the first professional to point this stuff out.
How much of this is down to a lack of resources to pump into software and r&d compared to nvidia over many years or how much of it is just plain incompetence I can't say
>every generation of GPU since Vega I have used, has had crash to desktop issues, or BSOD issues under very standard and common workloads.

I thought it was only me... but ye it is this bad - just watching youtube and doing discord video call at same time - crash

>At the end of the day here, I am not trying to say "AMD is bad, do not use them". I am trying to say that AMD need to provide an industry standard means to properly and fully reset the GPU when these faults occur.

I can say - AMD is bad, do not use it, their hardware do not work.

Wasting time to "debug and fix" their drivers - it can be fun for "some time" until you see that there are infinite amount of bugs, and every kernel driver release make everything randomly even worse than version before.
> Note: There is zero doubt that this is a driver bug, I am running a EPYC workstation with ECC RAM, no overclocking, etc.

Can you replicate the issue?  If so, it could be a driver bug.

If not, have you actually tested your memory?  Being a workstation platform or ECC memory means nothing.

I bought some of the first Zen 2 based servers on the market, and I got one with a faulty CPU with a bad memory controller that affected only a single slot.  Dell had to come out the next day with a new CPU.
No, that would be you obviously /s
Oh so it's only applicable in specific usage scenarios outside of standard usage...

Got it.
Yea, given the state of XE drivers every major update has come with significant PR.
Why not ;)
Go word salad elsewhere.
I have replicated the issue reliably yes, and across two different systems.
If discord crashes my drivers.. once every few hours. I have to reboot
Discord doesn't crash my drivers

I don't have to reboot.
UI, change it back!
It just switched for me, it looks like absolute crap, everything is too big, change it back please, it sucks hard!

Edit: to add more, it's too similar to the phone one without being one (I'm on browser), posts take so much space but the text is super little, there is wasted space on the right on the main page and the dropdown menu only stays open along the page if the window is super large, even if there is space. Browsers are not phones not everything needs to be a big dumb column.

Edit2: for those whose eyes are dying using "https://new.reddit.com/" seems to get back the previous UI! (Edit 3: unless you click something that would open a new tab, that goes back to this new garbage, add new to the url)

Edit 4: there is an addon to force nee.reddit here:
https://old.reddit.com/r/help/comments/19dvgwy/change_the_ui_back/kpjnc71/?context=3
Did they hire a three year old?
Dear god this is horrible. Less than 1/4 of my screen actually shows anything useful. The text is tiny and hard to read. How did this make it into live without anyone pointing any of this out...

Now we need an "opt out of new new layout option"...
I agree, the new UI is horrible. And they changed the pictures aswell, you can no longer click them and get a larger version, it's just the same small crummy image WTF! This is horrible to browse and in functionality.
Workaround:

To use previous new style (not the newest), type `https://new.reddit.com` in the address bar.

For links in the notifications and using previous new style (not the newest) everywhere, use extension Redirector - for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirector/), [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd).

Use these options:

- Description: `Reddit redirect`
- Example URL: `https://www.reddit.com/`
- Include pattern: `https://www.reddit.com*`
- Redirect to: `https://new.reddit.com$1`
- Pattern type: `Wildcard`
- Pattern Description: `Redirect reddit newest to new.reddit.com`
- Click to "Show advanced options..."
- Exclude pattern: `https://www.reddit.com/media*`
- Save

Known issue of Redirector: opening the image in new tab does not work, therefore using exception for images, these are opened with the newest style, but everywhere else previous new style is used.
This UI sucks so much. It isn't even fully functioning because at r/anime whole Filter by flair is missing. This new UI drives me crazy. Why on the earth is it so trendy these days make everything so big?
[removed]
Right now I can't even post a comment using the mobile UI. I have to force desktop or else my comment just vanishes into oblivion when I hit submit lol
Please bring back compact mode, the cards and classic are too big..
CHANGE IT BACK!
Came to post this. Please. My eyes. I need a reddit alternative!
Happen to me right now, the new UI is totally garbage... also the subscription comunity filter (serch bar) on the left is missing, and in general interface is inconsistent, the reddit preferences still with previous interface.
All the links get a preview now. So if you add a source, it adds a pointless huge preview underneath the post, making a regular post into a "link"-post. Completely stupid, can't find a work-around for this.
Yes, this is awful. I am changing to the old UI (as in old.reddit.com), because this is absolutely useless.
This just changed for me... and it sucks. I quickly got used to "new" reddit because while it looked differently than "old" reddit, it was still usable just as fine.

This "modern" reddit is terrible. So much wasted space, both vertically and horizontally. I don't need a "sidebar" with my subreddits. I don't switch them at all and instead have them in separate browser tabs. And the feed just got reduced from 10 items on screen to 6 items, what an improvement!

It's all mobile-y and it honestly reeks of some generic template. Hell, even the black color of the background is somehow unpleasant.
BY THE GODS THANK YOU for the link taking me back from this horror

I couldn't even find the list of people I followed, I was about to throw up
[new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) is not the same as it was before... it doesn't open new post as an "overlay", it also seems alot slower? Guess I will have to revert back to old reddit again...
Yes, it's so laggy on the feed. Unusable!
Sooo, is the old browsing experience dead forever?

current new.reddit is not what it used to be, for example, threads open a web page on purpose instead of a overlay window. It is a continuous redirectin, I don't know if I can explain myself.
dear mods...

there's a sports site called ProFootballTalk.  i used to spend 3 hours a day on the site and used to be a top commenter.

they changed their website to something unusable on PC and I full stop don't use the site (also barely follow the NFL at all) as a result.

This new interface is just as horrible as the PFT redesign.  its "i'm not going to use this site anymore" bad.

Please consider your next steps...

(or maybe you did the redesign as a self-sabatague a la Twitter...?)
Seen it pop up on a few Reddits. I've stop browsing said Reddits. Whoever thought that this is what a community should look like needs to find a different position. Hopefully something on Antarctica.
The new UI only let's me see 4 posts in my home feed. Then it stops...
im changing to old old reddit. The new UI feels like its made for an Ipad
Thank you so much for the "new" reddit link.   


Got the new-new UI today myself. and guess what. whenever i had to make a comment i had to switch back to [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com) , because new one just simply refused to work 💀 Like not only was it so awful to look at with fonts etc. but it didn't even work properly either
ever since they rolled it out for everyone, i've been having connection issues...  


it's broken, too, i can't comment unless i'm using the old UI
The new UI is completely broken.  I can't even post comments.  I'm back to using https://old.reddit.com again.

I am amazed at the level of instability of Reddit the past year.
Yeah, it's pretty rough lol.
Ageee
If it wasn't mentioned yet, DARK MODE is now a flashbang every click.
For someone with ADHD this new layout is a mess i get lost whenever scrolling the feed, it makes me not want to open the posts because of the lack of highlight to separate the posts from each other and from the rest of the page, even removing the side panel doesn't help.
If you think the person who created this horrendous thing would feel proud?
Horrible. I guess reddit is being reddit.
Browsing a sub is horrible now. I read a post and have to click on "back" in the browser to get to the overview of the sub. Sometimes I don't even land in the same sub I started. Wtf is this? Did anyone actually test this new design?!
my home feed is 3 posts and half the screen is empty. also the side of the text in comments is too small.
JFC this is terrible. I'll come back if and when this ends.
For somebody who uses the space bar to scroll down reddit because of a chronic illness, doing that has become almost impossible now.

It's hard to find a place on the page where you could click to start to be able to scroll down the main frame via the space bar/arrow keys. You either expand or shorten a single post, or you start to scroll down the rules. A nightmare.

Honestly it's just incredibly bad for very basic accessibility. People need to be able to scroll down pages in different ways!!
Pure rubbish
Why would they do this? This UI it's awful!!! Maybe they want less traffic?
I'm now wondering what the point of asking here or having this thread is if these buffoons don't answer. They probably don't even see it or care for this thread. Or am I wrong, and they do answer your guys's questions?
We went through all this with "new Reddit".  The only help I have is understanding the process.

Reddit's goal is new users and increased user engagment.

The meetings with marketing and the UI/UX developers are done. Budgets and designs are approved. Developers have been told what changes to make and they are rolling them out. 

There is a certain amount of testing and user feedback built into the process but this is the redesign now.

I had many of the same complaints as you with "new Reddit" Font sizes, use of space, and for me the resulting eye strain. I'm afraid to even look at new-new Reddit.
Interesting
For the media popups to work in Firefox Redirector, add this exclusion (in Advanced options):  
"Exclude pattern": https://www.reddit.com/media\*
"We had a server error"
Why is reddit just ignoring this?!
ssss
does any1 know why our karma was tremendously reduced?
new . reddit is now using the current Reddit UI

I went from being able to see 10 threads at once on my screen (by just having a very thin line with the title) to only seeing 2 big pictured squares... How do I fix it?

And the two columns on the sides take almost half the screen, I don't need to see this constantly!

Reddit, people still use computers, don't force mobile designs please...
The only extension that worked for me was this one: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ui-changer-for-reddit/  
It's on Chrome as well but I can't find the link.
Thankksss this helped a lot. The new Ui is such a garbage.
Thank you for the elaborate response. Just used redirector and everything's fine!
This is even worse than the "new" UI changes age ago. Damn it. This compay just cannot make a decent UI.
Agreed. Who the hell comes up with these "new changes"? I swear it's like they purposely change things to make using reddit as inconvenient as possible
I hate it, too. It feels too... narrow and cramped. Feels like I'm walking through a sketchy alleyway in London
holy thank you
The new.reddit is fked too now , it refreshes the whole tab when you close a post, losing where you had scrolled too.
Not sure if it is just me, but I am unable to quote any comment while replying in the new UI. Makes it sooo annoying. Am using the web version.
Indeed. The design feels like old Web1 days with such a narrow page that doesn't use the full screen width, and the tiny font size.
I f-in hate it. It eats horizontal screen real estate by filling it with garbage I never click. This results in me not being able to zoom in as much as I need for my sight, so it's an accessibility issue. Sucks.  


Desktop, don't care about "old reddit".
we need www.oldbutnottooold.reddit
it's bad on macbook 14inch, it's bad on my 27inch 1440p monitor, it's F bad. I seriously can't believe that this new design was approved and don't get me started how it's slower at loading and bugs are everywhere for basic stuff.
It's exactly the opposite for me with the pictures? Before, clicking a picture opened the post in another window. Now, it just expands the post and show the bigger picture in-line with other content.
A true godsend. You made my day after reddit ruined. Thank you.
This still doesn't open the posts in "overlay" mode like it used to, so not completely same as we had it before
I hug you sooo big, you are my hero.
THANK YOU!
This needs more upvotes thanks, I was getting tired of having to change www. to new.
thank you so much! I really appreciate it
Bro, I might genuinely love you
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! It just changed for me a few days ago and I hated it soo much. You saved the day and my sanity! True hero!
When I use this I get a privacy error and it doesn't work for me
oh my god you're amazing! i could kiss you.
Thank you.
[https://new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) this worked, thank you sir.
I can't get the extension for Chrome to work (does not work on my computers).  
This extension for Chrome does work for me (the link below):

[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/reddit-ui-redirector/nkoapgdkoheaadbeijfdlnogkjlgcimc?hl=en&authuser=0](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/reddit-ui-redirector/nkoapgdkoheaadbeijfdlnogkjlgcimc?hl=en&authuser=0)
It can't even track replies i read as everything notification is still there, even when i clicked mark all as read
Use old reddit. 

The new new reddit is all the things people hate about new reddit multiplied by 10. Old reddit is so good and almost ad free.
Please feel free to be mean. The redesign is awful and they are forcing it on people just like youtube did with their awful redesigns.
The way you feel about the new new one, is how I feel about the new one. With the 3rd party apps gone, the day old reddit is gone is the last day I use reddit. I can't even bring myself to view what you guys are talking about because I can't even imagine how it could be even worse.
Same here. I had to use the "new.reddit.com" in order to post the comment from the desktop. I tried different browsers too.
Omg thank you! I’ve spent the last hour or so trying to figure out if I was banned or what was going on
That would explain the issue I had yesterday with my comments not posting!
Yeah why did they remove compact? I get changing the style but why remove a reading mode entirely? The other two modes take up waaayy to much screen space on my large monitor.. I like compact because it's very information dense and kinda like reading a forum. This 'upgrade' is definitely a downgrade...
Browsing your feed is borderline unbearable without compact view. Everything is just pushed into your face, a change that makes it insanely difficult to ignore all the nonsense posts of popular subreddits.
And now I noticed that preview only links back to your post, and not the source that you've attached as a link. It's completely stupid.
That's the old-old reddit. If you want the old-new reddit, use [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) and check this commend here, it made my day:

https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1am1s6y/comment/kpj6jyr/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3
'new' is super slow for me too.
Fyi, its admins (reddit employees) not mods (volunteers to manage subreddits)
Just woke up, and it seems fixed
Yeah and THEY don't seem to even know it's broken.

Seriously the people being paid to maintain this site need to be fired.  Random UI switches, now posting and commenting doesn't work.  It's like they are trying to destroy this website on purpose lol
not for me, yet (fingers crossed). That UI still terrible as the day it came out
same for me, I came back here to check if I was the only one
Will do
kind a shity method to filter the numbers of genuine complaints
does anyone believe they're actually reading any of the input received there?
thank you  my bro   love from china ♥
Found the Chrome version: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ui-changer-for-reddit/bfcldjodnnkndfccfjndmdlppfkmccgh
"Mobile first" design on full display.
This seem to work for now: [https://new.reddit.com/](https://new.reddit.com/)
After clicking some more pictures I have to admit, I can find no continuety rhyme or reason in how they made it. Some are small, some are huge. The images I myself have uploaded of my painted miniatures are small, resulting in not being able to see details propperly, even though I uploaded a good size.
> This still doesn't open the posts in "overlay" mode like it used to, so not completely same as we had it before

It WAS like that before, it is a bug, started probably 11 or 12 days ago, I reported it, but just 1 reply/confirmation yet.

[Posts are opened fixed, can't close or switch to previous/next post](https://new.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1ae5n2p/posts_are_opened_fixed_cant_close_or_switch_to/)

u/spagettiosoup reported it via ticket.

Report this bug, contact moderators, admins...

https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new

The problem is, that perhaps it's not a bug, it could be on purpose, to force users to use newest style, because compact view is hard to use without that bugged feature.

I wonder if I'm really the only one, who used that feature - compact view, sorting by new, X to close post, P and N keys to switch to previous/next post without going back every time? :(
Probably wrong address, it should be `https://new.reddit.com`  not `https://www.new.reddit.com`.
For many of us, not even new.reddit.com works.  I had to go back to old.reddit.com from the 90s.

They've got a bunch of morons running this website
I submitted a ticket that the new UI wasn't accepting comments, they just vanished when submitted.  But the old UI works.

The response said that my account looked fine, but there seemed to be some issues with others, too.  It seems I'm not alone.
It's ridiculous. Compact mode allowed me to see 6 posts without scrolling. Classic brings it down to 4. Card reduces it to like 1.8
Thank you. Maybe I will look at that plugin. Just so sad we have to enforce sane behavior from sites.
oh my god, old-old reddit, old-new reddit, new-new reddit...

i hate you, reddit. I've tried using new-new reddit for over a month now, but new-new reddit is so frustratingly broken that it feels like it wasn't even beta tested before it went live.
ah, thanks.

you've now been promoted to IntermediateArmadillo ;) :)
okey so if you click on "create a post" on new.reddit  it will take you to the previous ui and if you click on the logo in the top left it takes you to the proper homepage but its not permanent if you refresh the page
Admins look at this sub. I did get a response, recently, on another issue, so they do check it.

The issue is that the new UI is likely here to stay. It's extremely rare to see a dev team scrap such a massive feature. They have sunk so much wasted resources into it by now. At best, they can try to improve it, but the insanity of it is that no matter what they do, the previous redesign is currently superior already, and does it better, except with viewing certain type of media.

It doesn't seem like the most genuine complaints ever got taken seriously even for a second. The whole platform protested the greedy API changes and as you can see, they did not care the slightest. It would be pure insanity to consider they would care about a "small thing" such as messing up the entire desktop UI.

TL;DR: Reddit no longer cares about our most genuine problems and nothing will stop this team from ruining it in order to make a profit. It's clear that this is the motive behind EVERY decision they have made.

Of course, it's normal to want to make money. But it's not OK to completely destroy what gave you the chance to make money in the first place. It is, in a big sense, theft, as the users are what drives the content and traffic here, and what makes adverts worth anything. The users got given the middle finger so hard with all of these HORRENDOUS changes.

You don't deserve this platform, current CEO/dev team. You are a disgrace and this is the truth. I may not be rich, but at least my work in IT lets me sleep like a baby, I am not hated by our users or clients.
Peoples complaints they made here that I suggested the form on, are still up here and not removed.  The form is what the admins requested people use to provide feedback.
You don't have to submit it
Glad I could help!
Doesn't seem to be working..unfortunately
Which is stupid since if you visit on mobile browser it redirects you to the app anyway
Not really, just exceptionally bad design.
goooooooo
Oh god my eyes are saved lol. thanks!, will put it in the post
Two problems tho, for a while it'll be hard to know what you've already looked at since it doesn't remember (only potential up-/downvotes can assist there). Besides that 'new' is suuuuuper slow for me, it's unbearable. :(
Apparently they're removing it later this year. I can't stand old reddit for image posts, and new new reddit hurts my eyes and 40% of the screen is taken up by useless bars. Do they want me to leave their app?
Works for desktop at least, but desktop users already have an opt-out for the new UI in their settings. I think it takes you back to old.reddit, so desktop users have the best of both worlds, getting to choose which non-new UI they prefer.


Mobile site users are stuck with an awkward exploit, and app users are just fully screwed.
you saved my bleeding eyes
Thank you for saving me, Sonic. I was worried I have to put up with this interface...
thank you so much !!
I made an extension (for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ui-changer-for-reddit/bfcldjodnnkndfccfjndmdlppfkmccgh), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ui-changer-for-reddit/)) to force the previous UI (or any other UI for that matter) so it doesn't revert. No need to mess around with regex or other technicalities.
Do I go to this URL everytime? THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!
DAMNNNN BROOOO!! IDK HOW TO THANK YOU FRFR!!
I just clicked a bunch of images and found a connection.

It semms that if only one image has been uploaded, it can be viewed as a large image.

If there are more than one in the upload they have all been scaled down, waaay down.
Thanks for the feedback, and I do believe it's on purpose to force people to the newest design... But I will submit a ticket anyways.
Meanwhile I will use old.reddit and RES, but I would like to have back the old new design
I'm surprised I got a response so thank you so much. It's working and now I don't have to endure this horrible UI anymore
Can't believe we lost amazing products like Apollo for this. It's insulting to say the least.

These devs non-ironically forgot to implement Compact viewing mode too, essentially removing the desktop UI viewing mode. This has to be a social experiment, or something...
Old Reddit has always been best Reddit, anyway. (also, Reddit started in 2005)
I know the feeling.. On my desktop (32" 1440p monitor) it's 25 posts vs 6 posts..
Yes, just as sad as the API play back then which made me stop using reddit 100% on my phone, only PC.

&#x200B;

And now this. It's a very light plugin that just redirects all reddit links to [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) instead or [reddit.com](https://reddit.com). Enjoy while it lasts, it's reddit after all.
use the edit4 addon, it forces any www.reddit to go to new.reddit so that you keep it that way
They literally could sell "skins" redesigns of site

Just like games do with new skins for weapons or  chars in their games and let ppl who like to feel different or "wear a new thing each day" to just  buy , and let the "old boomers/conservatives" wtv ppl like to call ppl who dont like changing something that works  


Its literally a win win situation for social and monetary health of the company.. and yet.. and yet.. 

but i guess ppl are dumb and dumber on this site managing side
Imagine they had spent that dev time working on accessibility issues, or fixing the video player, or stopping repost bots...hell, they could've given everyone a sabbatical and it would've been a more productive use of time.
Works for me. Have you actually clicked on the extension and chosen the UI you want?
The principle is sound enough. Most people are on phones or tablets, so designing websites with that in mind makes sense. The problem is when it all stops there. When it's not properly tested for other platforms, or other platforms are just ignored.
No like literally. It looks like the mobile browser version. Hell to use on mobile too actually.
Not ideal though. Open up a reply or similar and it defaults back to the new crap...
Yes, they are destroying Reddit.  Maybe it's intentional.   I've already noticed my usage is way down since the UI is now basically broken for me.   It takes a lot more clicks, tabs, and time to use Reddit on the new crap UI.  I was even opted out of beta UI testing and they switched it for me anyway.   

The Devs and Reddit management are laughing at us.  They don't care at all how miserable they make the UI experience for us.  Ah well, maybe this will be the final nail in the coffin for Reddit and force me to use another platform.
That's weird.. my monitor is 1440p as well.

Oh wait. I'm using 140% size in my browser because tired old eyes.

At 100%, compact vs classic is 8 vs 7 for me... not that terrible if I'm entirely honest.
Yep. but at lest scrolling is fine
[a fix for that](https://old.reddit.com/r/help/comments/19dvgwy/change_the_ui_back/kpjnc71/?context=3)
Here's a fix for you - browser addons that force it to new.reddit.com every time

https://old.reddit.com/r/help/comments/19dvgwy/change_the_ui_back/kpjnc71/?context=3
Oh thanks, I’ll add it to the post
This helped me a lot!
Discouraged from Using Reddit
I’m new to Reddit and although I was excited to have a place to ask questions, I find myself frustrated and confused with the rules. I find myself getting downvoted or getting my posts removed on some subreddits because I didn’t format something correctly even if it was unintentional (and hidden under a list of rules that feel like college citation guidelines). And even when I fix it, I still experience removal and downvotes because I’m told my posts usually fall under a different tag or something. How am I supposed to know what tags are usually used in a particular subreddit if I’m new? I also don’t really understand how Karma works but it’s also sad to see my 10 karma go down when I’m just genuinely interested and passionate about something. It’s just frustrating, and if there’s anyone with advice on how to better navigate Reddit, it would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the small rant, but thank you everyone for your help! 
My advice: when you have a lot to say break your post or comment up into paragraphs. Nobody likes reading a wall of text, it's hard on the eyes and hard to follow.
It can be tough to get started, but Reddit can be a lot of fun. I would suggest to check out r/NewToReddit, and before posting in a sub, read the rules of what is allowed and isn't. r/NewToReddit has covered many basic questions, like it has [Subs with no to low karma requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/wiki/index/newusersubs) and [Reddit and karma explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/wiki/ntr-guidetoreddit/#wiki_reddit_and_karma_explained). 

Try to find subs that interest you, comment what you like and when you feel like it, and karma will follow step by step. (Obvious) Karma hunting can work the opposite way sometimes. Good luck fellow Redditor :)
The most important things to remember about Reddit:

Read the rules, don't care about karma, Reddit is a cesspool and an echo chamber, but most importantly, good luck, have fun.
[deleted]
Reddit has certain rules in place that essentially force you to 'listen' a lot more than 'talk' when you first join up. This also helps with getting to know how reddit works, how certain subs work and prevents people from posting garbage.

Every time I see a post like this, the person is always upset with reddit because the first thing they want to do after creating their accoint, is instantly make a bunch of new posts in dozens of subs without understanding how anything works. Not just platform mechanics but reddit culture.

Karma and account age limits prevent you from doing that so you have to comment more and spend more time reading other people's posts.
If all you want to do is post, you can go to your profile and post right there. Or start your own sub with no rules (still gotta follow the Content Policy and the Code Of Conduct) and post as much as you want.

If you think the rules, culture, or norms of a certain community are bad or you disagree with them, then move on and find a community that does fit you.

With 100,000+ active subs, you'll likely be able to find at least a few dozen subs to hang out and participate on.
Take it less seriously. 

Seriously.
This is my personal opinion, but...
Reddit isn't for attention or fame. It's for stuff you're passionate about. Yes there are subs that have lots of restrictions, but what you need to do is find something you like (mine:crochet, thrifting, splatoon3) and find the general sub for it. (R/crochet, r/thriftinghauls, r/splatoon). I joined these subs and in my main feed I get to see posts about the things I love. I can comment on and upvote posts I see every day. Sometimes my comments get up votes! But I don't think about that too much because I'm in a community that also loves the thing I love. 
I read all the rules and now I'm ready to make my own post in the sub! Let me show off my crochet project I'm working on, or a funny clip from my game, or my haul from goodwill. Sometimes no one comments and I just get a couple up votes, that's okay! I don't post again for another couple days because there was nothing for me to post about. But I left several comments on different posts with people who have questions or need advice or just showing off cute stuff! 
The point is to have a community with other people who share your hobby or passion. Stop getting so worked up, read the rules in each sub, and follow them because some of these mods don't mess around.
My advise... Every subreddit (group) is entirely its own beast.  Every mod has the freedom to act like a dictator.  Reddit is not a democracy.  Always read the rules in groups before you post.  If the rules are long and annoying then move on.  Find a good subreddit or two... Make them your home.  The people you meet in those subreddits can direct you to the safest places to post your questions to.  

The last chunk of advice I can give is the most important. Sit on your responses before posting them.  If you are upset, bothered, or angered by someone's post, Don't reply. It is likely a trap. If you must reply, sit on that reply until the post you are replying to does not bother you anymore and you can see it for what it is.
At this point, forget about the karma count. People are dumb on here (like really dumb) and WILL downvote you for zero reason because they like to make problems out of nothing. Format wise, don’t write a big chunk of text. Split it into paragraphs. It’s neater and easier to read. I actually can’t stand when people write a whole block of text, it’s barely readable half the time. Gaining karma comes from people upvoting your posts/comments. You’re more likely to gain a lot if you add to discussions on large subs.

I also suggest reading the rules on every sub you join and looking at other people’s posts to get an idea instead of jumping straight into making a post. I swear some subs are so strict with their rules so you actually have to be really careful when posting. One wrong thing and it’s getting removed. Also, join subs you’re actually interested in. It’s more bearable and you’ll probably gain more karma.
I would suggest spending time in subs just reading, seeing how others post, what sort of questions they ask, what sort of things get deleted. Everyone wants to jump right to making 10k karma posts and getting all that juicy juicy attention.

Then when you feel you are ready to post, put together a well thought out, paragraphed, punctuated, piece. If you have problems creating paragraphed, punctuated, pieces, write them in a Word/Note document first, get them all formatted, let the spell/grammar checker run, then copy/paste.

Each and every sub has it's own rules, and most of those are pretty easy to follow. No personal attacks, no spam. If you post the same photo twice in the same sub...that could be caught as spam by a bot filter. If you don't know how to "Flair" your post (tags/labels) - there is often a Flair Help link somewhere on the page, if you look for it. it tells you which flairs to use for what sort of posts (Good Vibes Only means no negativity wanted, etc) The Flairs are also pretty user-friendly. "Support" (I need help) "Collector" (this post is about my collection.) Flairs vary by community but none of them take a phD to figure out.
Hi there, check out r/newtoreddit
Reddit mods act like they own a formal business to distract them from their sad reality where they can't enforce anything on nobody
This website is either made or known for having power hungry mods that create rules teetering between necessary and stupid so you don't rightfully call them out for making some rules specifically to boost their power fantasy, either get used to it, find a way to circumvent it or use forums
Brief snarky comments = lots of upvotes 

Heartfelt wall of text with no space breaks = lots of downvotes 

If karma farming is your jam, just lurk on the popular subs and be one of the first to comment. That usually gets a lot of upvotes irrespective of value or insight.
I experienced this as well when first starting. I was banned from many groups, for simply asking questions, (I didn’t read the guidelines) but after a few posts of basic things, on already established groups, I started earning karma, & my posts were more visible. I agree with the others here, there’s a subreddit for everything, someone tagged the “new to Reddit” below, good luck, and have fun!😊
What I learned about Reddit after being on Twitter (X) and finally giving up on it and leaving:

Politically... there are Far Left subs that have "Right" sounding names.  If you post a "Right" sounding post in a "Left Leaning" sub... forget it.  Your time on Reddit is over.  Downvoted, reported, banned, negative Karma.  All subs named after cities and provinces are Far Left.

Read through a bunch of posts and comments before commenting.  Determine if the sub is Left or Right leaning.   Then LEAVE AND HIDE that sub if it doesn't match your political leaning.
It's really annoying when you join a sub and realise they've got so many editorial rules they're practically a magazine! There are subs that are less fussy, good luck!
Stuff like this is why Reddit has started to get a tarnished rep these days.  It's not just you sadly--its a universal experience that it's tough to actually SAY anything here because the rules are so esoteric, and they change depending on which subreddit you're on.

Depending on what you're looking for, it might be best to find a private internet forum that's dedicated to the subject.
Thank you for everyone’s advice! I will definitely make sure to break up my posts and spend more time listening before posting. I greatly appreciate your feedback.

Although I’d like to address a few things. Yes, I only have one removed post, but I have also personally deleted other posts because people were messaging me saying this isn’t up to their standards— even if I followed all the rules and that it would get removed anyways. 

I am aware that certain subreddits are for certain things however, I am not oblivious. I also search the subreddit to see if there are similar posts (for example, if there are discussion or question posts even if it’s not what subreddit what intended for). However, I understand that point and will be more diligent in future to be hyperspecific.

I feel like I’ve been eager to learn and professional, but some of the comments rubbed me the wrong way. I wasn’t aware of there being a culture at all since most other social media you are just free to ask whatever and people always answer without pointing me to some rules. 

Anyways, thank you for the advice, and I will also be checking out r/newtoreddit for further guidance. 

Thanks again, and please take care!
Here’s the Reddit system: if I don’t like, don’t agree, don’t understand, can’t see what you’re posting, I’m down voting. 

If I agree, think is funny, believe it’s factual, or great advice. I’ll *maybe* leave a comment about it. 

People are pocket pinchers for upvotes but Happily give out those downvotes like candy on Halloween.
Yes, reddit mods are infamous and you will learn to hate them fast.
Welcome to Reddit lol. It’s way too often that I provide facts and sources on a topic and get downvoted into oblivion because I’m disagreeing with the collective of whatever subreddit.  
You’ll start to pick up on biases in various subreddits, use that knowledge to decide which subreddits you want to spend time in.  
Much like real life, you won’t get along with every group so just find some groups that work for you.
You don’t need rules to be explained. You just need a hug. Here, take one 🫂
the weird thing is posting a comment that promptly gets deleted because i don't have enough "karma" (or because the comment was somehow mistaken for spam which makes no sense since i post a couple of comments a week, at best)

that kind of thing just makes me post less.
honestly this is why i don’t really recommend reddit to people. considering every sub has drastically different rules and posting styles, the significantly lower dependency on forum-style social media, and the bot issues in recent years making most subs inaccessible to newer users, it makes this site really hard to use and understand being a new user
Totally. Need Karma to comment, but can’t earn karma without commenting. Arcane rules are frustrating and seem petty
My advice is to go to a subreddit where there are a higher percentage of people who are interested in your topic.  
For example I checked your post history and saw that you posted a question about Jujutsu on r/manga, but the people there are probably interested in talking about things like manga culture in general and new popular manga series. So it’s probably better to post on r/JujutsuKaisen where all the Jujutsu fans are, if you want to ask a rather specific question about it.
I don't know which subs you follow or post but reddit directly doesnt have any influence over the rules made by each sub.

Even I agree the moderation part on reddit is really screwed up. Some low life mods feels that they have achieved the position to rule the world while some comes with an excuse that since they are doing a free social service they should not be questioned and don't have time to look into anything in deep but still they won't resign.

I would suggest you to participate in mature subs they don't concentrate much on the posting style but they are more solution centric.

For gaining karma there are some tricks, even I follow them. Be mature, a reddit karma won't help you to improve your karma in real life. Just achieve about 1k karma, more than 97.38% of the total subs can't stop you from posting and commenting. 

Many might downvote this post as well.
Yea, the rigidity of the rules in some subreddits is frustrating and discouraging.
Also that one (ONE) post you had removed? In MANGA COLLECTORS....can you look at the name of the sub and tell me why your question about Manga got removed? 

It's not a sub FOR questions about Manga, it's a sub for posting photos of your collection, ONLY. See. Right in the name. MANGACOLLECTORS. Look for something like mangaREADERS or mangaQUESTIONS. 

Just like...pay attention.
What are you talking about? 

I went to your profile, and there was maybe one post that was removed. 

Stop catastrophising everything. 

And unfortunately, the sub rules are essential for ***everyone*** to enjoy Reddit and have a nice time here. 

Let's say you made a post, and it was in the wrong sub, or asking something that the rules said not to, or whatever, yeah, sure. It is one post to you, but for even a small sub that has only 10,000 - 20,000 members, if even half of regular posters did the same thing, there would be so many posts to clean up.

That's why the rules are there, to ease things on the mods, and because it has. Even a lot of trial and error to get the rules that suit the I dividual sub the best.


Seriously, please read the rules. It's not hard. Most things are just commonsense things. But it is the absolute bare minimum of being a decent participant..
It really does take a lot of time to get the feel for reddit, I lost my account that was almost 3 years in age, another badge of a reddit user and now have this account so I've been on there that long and I still get the rules wrong in subs or have accidentally posted a repost before and gotten my stuff trashed but that's fine it's just part of life, mu lly fault for not reading or checking properly.
Has OP even come back since posting?
[deleted]
Pick a few subs, learn their rules and pay attention to what people post. Learn those subs then start expanding.  Keep in mind that most subs state their rules and expectations, but some mods are a bit nutty and will ban you for breathing.
And just realize that the moderation in some subreddits is just arbitrary  (to say the least), and a misunderstood post could get you permanently banned from that sub for life with no recourse. Most subs are good, and those are the ones you want to participate in. When you run into those poorly moderated subs, just move on and don't look back.
Redditors really believe people create an account to join a community. Normal people create an account to ask questions about specific topics that most times don't have a sub for it or has almost no members. 

For example, if you want to post about your culture, there aren't any subs, and if you want to ask or post about a cartoon, you have to post on cartoon that has much fewer members than anime. The america subreddit has 9k members. There is no sub for anecdotes or funny occurrences
Agree completely- it’s a crazy 🤪 platform with many subreddits run by power hungry people who seem to get a kick out of making up obscure random rules often arbitrary and not posted. It’s the Wild West and a mind F😋ck
>I find myself getting downvoted or getting my posts removed on some subreddits

It happened to me twice but It's not like I was rude I just shared my personal experience, so I know your pain.
I agree people downvote because they don't bother to read the actual intent and message correctly and if they dint like. What you say they downvote. Take the downvote win. At least, people are reading what you have to say. Your Karma will grow quickly. Just engage daily it will clime fast.
Since you are having issues I would make sure you read the rules and read some posts before posting. Some subs have a karma limit before you can post. I have had posts removed and I know it can be disheartening when you believe you did not break any rules.

I do agree with breaking posts up.  If it is difficult to read, most people won't bother.  Also, maybe start with some light subs, like a TV show or sports team you like, or pets
I got negative karma now, I can’t post comments in the few groups I’m active in. Sad but what can one do. Hopefully this posts anyway.
Yeah, “reddiquette” can be tough for new users to navigate, especially when attitudes will vary drastically depending on the sub you’re in. You’ll find that most of the huge, popular subs actually have pretty awful moderators, and it’s because they’re all the same people. People literally collect subreddits to moderate, not because they care about the subs, but because they like the position of authority. It’s just something you have to live with if you want to be a member of those subs. The smaller, more niche subs are often much better.
I think Reddit requires more ‘politeness’ than would be assumed to a new Redditor.  The anonymity of it makes it feel like you can jump in and casually speak your mind (and you can!) but it’s easy to assume people will ‘get’ your tone or points.  

It’s helped me to be extra thoughtful about my post to make sure it’s written in a way so that that my point is gotten across without being perceived as rude or insulting (IRL I’m way more blunt) and with way more supporting detail (IRL I assume people need less dot-connecting on things I think are obvious).  It makes a huge difference, and actually taught me a lot about communicating with different types of people outside of Reddit too.
Please dont feel bad because reddit isnt the place it used to be. Its packed with so many bots and negative softy people that cant stand it when you go against the grain or have a different opinion then them. Also lots of sneaky ads that get place into a topic making it seem like someone is asking for help or is helping someone while its just a ad.

Real shame is that social media's killed off the old internet and i have a feeling people getting tired of this one sides solution we have now.
Reddit is a platform where you have to just agree with everyone else and not say anything remotely controversial. It can result in permanent bans.
First, you're right.   I experienced (still experience) the same thing all the time.

There are a lot of trolls and know-it-alls on the app. The app is very much opinion driven. If someone doesn't agree with one thing you say...DOWNVOTE.

Even the subreddits that are fact-base  in nature are difficult to post in. 

Example,  just the other day I posted a question in r/plumbing.   I thought it was a simple question and that it was clear what I was asking so I didn't even add a photo.   The responses I got were 'have no idea what your saying', 'post a picture' and downvotes.  It's fine if I am unclear...but the downvotes are ridiculous....i am obviously looking for advice on a subject I'm not familiar with and we may need a dialogue to make it clear...but the downvotes make it seem like I did something wrong. 

What I have found is you have to treat reddit like a game.  There are rules to the game you have to follow...and part of the game is to read the rules on each step (each subreddit).The end goal is to accumulate many more points than you lose. 

 It's hard to start the game...some paths are blocked until you  reach a certain point level.  It gets easier as you gain these points and learn how to play.  Sometimes you may have to post something warm and fuzzy or brilliant to make up for a post that caused you harm.  There are monsters/bad guys in your way that will try to prevent you from reaching your goal...you have to figure out a way to either avoid them, charm them, or at least minimize the damage they may cause you.  

If you look at it this way perhaps it will be less impacting on your psyche. Hope that helps.

Edit:  see, you're already playing by posting this topic that so many of us have experienced and agree on!
Long story short Reddit is NOT a friendly place. It’s one of the most hateful places on the internet. It’s not for everyone. Literally the only reason I use it is because it’s a brain rot addiction.
Content not appearing on a subreddit will be due to removal by community moderators or the site-wide spam filter. You should contact the mods of that subreddit using the “message the moderators” button in the subreddit’s sidebar (desktop) or “about” section (official apps) to ask why your content may have been removed. If they can’t help, you’ll want to review our article on [spam](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504051-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer-) and try amending your post to conform with the information there.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/help) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Ur comment karma is every like u got from comments and post karma is every like you got from posts. If you get disliked it goes now and if you get like it goes up. Your combined karma is all post karma and comment karma.

I have no tips on how to navigate reddit tho
Read the rules of the subreddits you were posting or commenting on
I've never had a problem with Reddit & I've only been on for a few months. I've never had a post or comment removed or even got a downvote, let alone get kicked out of a sub.

I'm mainly on r/bordercollie and that's where I started. I explained that I'd never owned a Border Collie, but I grew up on a farm and we had them for herding cattle. We considered them Dad's because he was their boss, but they were family dogs too. I asked if anyone had a problem with me being in the group, they said anyone who loved Border Collies was welcome. I talked about our Border Collies and my Lab/Setter/Retriever mix. At first, I onnly posted pictures of the Border Collies, but someone asked me to post a picture of my dog.

On the other hand, I joined a Border Collie page that said anyone who loves Border Collies is welcome. After a short period of time, I was suspended for 3 months and not told why. I tried to contact the Moderators, but that wasn't allowed. I think it may have been because I posted pictures of the Border Collies and referred to them as Dad's dogs. I didn't think of that as posting other people's dogs without their permission. I worked and played with them, they ran with me. Shortly after I tried to contact the Moderators, I left the group.
>>college citation guidelines

Read them anyway. Usually there are not very many rules. 

>>downvoted 

Don’t worry about it. We can’t control what others do. 

>>karma 
Ignore karma.  Seriously. Just join the conversation. 

>>getting my posts removed because I didn’t format something correctly 

That’s why you read the rules first. 

>>even if it was unintentional 

Rules don’t have much interest in intention, unfortunately. Just read and follow the subs rules. 

>>tags 

What is a tag?
Get a feel for any new subreddit you join, before you comment or post. Spend a day or two reading first and learn the culture so that when you engage, you are more apt to fit in. Every subreddit is different and an engagement that is appropriate in one, may not be in another. I think that is one of the most important things to learn about Reddit when you are new. It will save you a lot of aggravation and negative interactions. 

Read the rules of the subreddit and if you find yourself bogged down and nit picked, leave it and join another one. The good thing about Reddit is that it has thousands of active subreddits for you to choose from. You don't have to stay stuck in one where you have to walk on eggshells to not be down voted or jump through hoops to make a post. 

Karma is only as good as the features it unlocks. Once it is no longer a hindrance to you using Reddit, then it doesn't matter anymore as it truly serves no other purpose.
That's why they say "reddit mods"
Honestly I would focus less on karma or getting gold and more on interacting with other users and enjoying yourself. 


As for formatting what most forums want breaks down to ease of reading unless it’s an advice forum or something specific like a help subreddit or a gaming subreddit.



I.e hit enter/return between paragraphs or thoughts, avoid run on sentences, etc etc.
rules are usually pretty obvious (respectful, no spoilers, no nsfw, etc.), but just check to make sure. you can scroll down on the side bar to find a list of rules, but also check the pinned posts b/c sometimes, there are additional rules due to recent circumstances.
Just ask, comment, troll, be mean, be good, do whatever you want - it's the internet nobody cares
I'm discouraged too, I belonged to a sub group that I'd comment a lot on, then I got banned when mods asked about the relationship to a certain 90 day fiancé person. I replied stating there was zero relationship with this person, then unbanned me, next thing I know I was permanently banned for ban evasion or something like that? I only have 1 profile on Reddit. Mods said they check the IP address, well the bots were wrong. I confirmed 1 profile. I can't even appeal because it states there's no restrictions??? But feel the mods did this. Maybe I'm wrong but I was tempted to share messages with this person but never did because who wants to be thrown under the bus? Treat those how you wanr to be treated? I'm sure it's a bot thing so I get what you're saying !!! It's so frustrating but just can't comment anymore in that group!! It is what it is!
Break up paragraphs; They can be annoying to read and people probably will downvote it.
First thing.

Don't worry about karma, its fake internet points, some of my most upvoted posts are meaningless, ones I have put effort in are sometimes ignored.

Secondly to a lesser extent, moderation of posts (banning and removal) is subject to the whims of mods.

Some can be good , even great, some act like weird little kings of their domains and will strike people down because they feel like it.
read for a while before you post

get the vibe of the place
And then you will find out that mod of any community can ban you for nothing at any time.
It is annoying but just join lots of subs that interest you and the annoying ones run by frustrated school teachers will fade into the background (like r/parenting)
Same. I've literally answered questions just to be downvoted to hell because the answer was not "ethical" even though it was the correct answer.

Subreddits are echo chambers of like minded individuals. If you present information that goes against the grain you are downvoted even if you are right.

I had to delete my comment with an answer of where a dress was from because the answer was aliexpress. My answer was correct but the sub didn't like it and they kept downvoting me without providing an answer that was different. In the end the mods deleted the post because the dress was from Aliexpress. On a sub about  asking where the dress is from *facepalm*.
Meh, people downvote if they don't agree with you, don't like the way you write and other petty things that do NOT warrant downvotes, but it is what it is 🤷‍♀️ My advice to you is to forget about karma and downvotes
Remember that MODS are the gods of Reddit and we are only “allows to live by that page’s law.   You are correct insofar that it is  not fair game.
I’m right there with you on that dangermammal! The bot says I’m to new to post, I just don’t understand????
People on Reddit are so soft and obedient so when they see something they don’t like or is slightly out of line they decide to downvote it. 

I raised a fair point on a thread and people downvoted me just because it was an unpopular opinion. Don’t worry about it.
I just leave subs that do that. They’re not worth the time or effort. Or start your own sub
I’m having a very difficult time figuring out how to navigate this platform. I’ve made several posts and they have been removed by the bot stating that my account is too new. That baffles me but I must readily admit that I’m not at all a techie. I have looked for a help page to no avail. I think it may be my lack of knowledge?
Reddit is heavily moderated and censored, and it gets worse everyday.
Learn how this place works, rules are annoying af, and that have got me tons of posts removed, but hey that's life...
I know right?? Like I have low Karma, and have been trying to raise it… unsuccessfully. I also have tried posting a couple, now scrolling through the comments I see to “break it up” but after doing it I still don’t see a whole lot of uptick.
Well I'm new too reditt as well. I joined one subreddit of my hometown as I wanted to organise a fun event (not commercial) and reach people of my city. I'm active on other social media app so I couldn't be active here and I don't want to.. we have a life outside of phones! 

But apparently I need to earn some karmas to post a simple get to gather invitation. I didn't know this before.. I had made one video of rain pics and posted under the photography group (I'm sure people of my city would have felt some connection as monsoon is special here, specially first rain) anyway that post was taken down and then I made another post as I had some question about books. That post didn't get any access either.


So when I didn't get any view on my both posts, I seeked help and someone informed me that I need karmas.. I replied to that comment that how many karmas I need in order to make a post and guess what? I had only one karma and with my question it got down voted and now my karma is in minus! 😬🤣

I was like geez.. did I enrol in Uni again!? Lol. I don't have time to earn karmas and I feel that I need to prove myself here just to invite people to my party!!  😬 I'm sorry to say this but it sucks.. it should allow people to ask questions..  

I'm not sure about the settings here but with my other social media app I can hide all new users and I don't get to see their posts. It's that simple but reditt seems complicated and not friendly! And can be stressful lol. 

I'm thinking what are the other ways to reach people because clearly this is not working for me! I mean restricting people to this extent doesn't make any sense. 

P.s I tried to make paragraphs lol. OP was asking for help but then everyone was going on and on about writing in paragraphs. I mean you pin point once and that's fine but whole focus was on it instead of being nice to a new member who was struggling.. crazy!
And ppl get jealous…they report you so you get banned….i got 7 banned for spamming and all i did was invite a few people to my community…✌🏼
I totally and fully agree.

They think that famous or idk people want to come out all at once, they don't understand that there are several famous people with high profiles on Reddit who would also like to know the rules in advance, like Keanu Reeves, which everyone knows is here, when can he post e.g. for example, an automatic email with some basic rules would not be completely wrong.

Lower post comments to 5 instead of 10, I still can't post in some places, after over 3 years.

Edit, high profiles are also regular people!

Edit 2,  it would be so cool if Taylor Swift was here on Reddit, as an anonymous user, but according to the rules, she probably gets banned because of weird rules.
You only need enough Karma too be able to comment.  Beyond that who cares ,  people who downvote are big babies .
You need to remember that the liberal medias are trying to convert you by staying in these type of medias. You have to find what you can put up with the subreddits. The problem of having conservative type medias is that the libs are trying to saturate those and bring them down or buy them out. Similar to how Texas is trying to rid of the California liberals moving there then trying to change the culture.
There are some things you can do.

Please study this narrative I wrote regarding  [Established Accounts and Content Quality Scores (CQS) - click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/s/LVFs88rVFn), new accounts and things you should know as a Redditor.

All Subredditors have rules and Moderators who create them.

So?

All Subredditors are different.

Everything from their ideology to karma requirements, how to post / comment to how negative karma effects your ability to post.


Don't give up on learning more!
If you have trouble following the rules of reddit, I'm worried about you navigating the real world.
Many have said it to you OP,  huge paragraphs are a pain to read. People will downvote for that alone.

Which is childish nonsense. Many of the reasons people downvote are childish nonsense. 

If I ran Reddit the first thing I would do is get rid of the downvote.

Don't be discouraged by it. I was, but when I stopped worrying about it Reddit became more enjoyable.
I am going thru the same thing. The moderator s are very rude. I've been a redditor for 7yrs. I tried to reach out in one of the communities I follow and I'm not allowed because of lack of karma. I asked a moderator about how to gain karma and I was muted for 28 days. I've never even posted a comment or reply in 7yrs and I get muted for asking how it all works...
People down vote you because they don't like your post. People are allowed to do that, most social media has like and dislikes.

It is up to you to read the rules before you post, doesn't matter if there is 1 rule or there are 100 rules.

It is YOUR fault if you create a post that does not follow the rules of the sub you are posting at or Reddit's site-wide rules.

YOU might be passionate about something, does not mean others will be.
That's what I keep telling people, even though many don't like to hear it.

Big walls of text are a pain, especially if you have dyslexia 😵‍💫
Thank you for the feedback! I’m so sorry that I wasn’t more mindful of this, but will be diligent to break up text in the future.
Using formatting helps too
Sometimes when I take a line space between sentences it just ignores it and condenses it when I post it. I'm on mobile btw
I just skimp them, tbh.
That sub is such a great resource. I came to make sure it was already said.

Not caring about karma is truly the most important thing. There are some truly insufferable Reddit users who will tell you to your face your experience is wrong, your information is wrong (it isn't), or just go on unhinged emotional rants for no reason at all. I would add: try to make the site better by treating others nicely and correcting people without insulting them.
Well said. I would add upside down circus
What is karma? (I'm serious, I didn't even know that existed)
...and don't take reddit seriously.
Yeah, there's a reason reddit mods and redditors as a whole have a horrible reputation and are the butt of many jokes...
This is excellent advice. When I first stumbled upon reddit several years ago, it was six months before I made an account.
Very much this and remember each sub can have its culture.  Something that might be upvoted in one will get you down voted in another.  So pay attention before posting.
It's fuccin reddit, not a new company
that said, i wish the zeitgeist around here was a little more forgiving towards new users understandably excited to start posting.
Thank you so much for your reply! I was just under the impression that Reddit is a treasure trove of information and you could just ask away. 

I will try just posting on my own profile and being more diligent to follow subreddit culture and rules. Thanks again!
Yeah, like there are many subs about a specific show and culture, geography, random things
I think take it more seriously and put more thoughtfulness into your post - if you want to engage and want people be interested in what you have to say.

But yeah, like who cares about karma or whatever - except that having none will exclude you from engaging in certain subs (which is the fun part for me,  bouncing my thoughts or ideas off other folks vs just reading)
Thank you for your help! I will for sure be more aware of subreddit rules, now knowing how strict some of them can be. 

I wasn’t sure about how karma worked and so that also was very helpful.

Thank you again!
Like really dumb. Yes! 😆
Doesn't matter what they post if you aren't allowed to post what you want even if it is related
100% - it’s their only power
True. Some mods act imperious to compensate for their sorry real lives.
OmG. This is a beautiful summary. I agree with your whole statement!!!
I see your interests involve manga. No way to sugarcoat it; that’s a cruel and unforgiving subculture. Good luck.
100% accurate.
Petty is a very good description of many “mods” who I am guessing only have power in their lives as a Subreddit Mod.
That’s really helpful advice. I’ll make sure to be more specific like that. Thank you so much for your help!
You forget what it's like to be new on reddit.  You have enough karma to post wherever you want.  

Those that are new struggle to get started.   The forums I wanted to post in when I started required a certain karma level.  I had to post in forums I didn't care about to try to get that karma.  For every 2 karma gained, I'd lose a karma because someone didn't agree.

Then, I'd run into responses like this...it's like you're spitting venom.  Why is it necessary to ridicule this person? For God sakes, this is the r/help subreddit and this is an obvious new user trying to figure it out.  Why not just politely help them out instead of judging them? 

THIS is the problem with reddit and the core reason the poster is rightfully distraught.  If they got more guidance and sympathy than judgemental rhetoric, they wouldn't need to have posted here .
I'm also confused. One removed post. All comments are either neutral or upvoted. I'm not seeing all these downvotes and banned posts.
Edit: weird this got double posted so removed the dup.
Even though my account is 10 years old, I don't post often because of the negativity!  If I'm at all sarcastic, which is my favorite language, doesn't matter what I post it gets downvoted or something.   I am currently muted from a channel because I asked 'Why are my posts being removed? It's the same post I've been posting for 2 years?"  Which is not against their rules...  The reason I got muted? because they added one rule after I had been using the sub for over 2 years and they didn't bother telling anyone, "hey there is a new rule."
I want to be educated in the topics of subreddits I joined. So I develop a thick hide to combat disappointments. I don’t take downvotes and removed posts personal.
This hits it right on the nose. I just wanted to ask questions hoping for an answer, but it feels more community-oriented. 

With how hyper-specific subreddits are, it’s just an inconvenience to find different ones when the one you’re in *could* answer your question, but can’t be bothered to based on arbitrary rules and regulations. 

I understand rules are there to regulate formal discussion but some of them just discourage people like myself from posting.

I don’t know why the rules can’t just be to respect one another and stay relatively on topic. Bots and spammers are going to be there regardless. 

But thank you for responding! It’s nice to hear from other people.
This is exactly how I feel haha.

It is not that I don’t care about rules, but sometimes I just want to ask a question and it’s hard to get niche info sometimes on the internet. 

But instead I have to go through leaps and bounds to even be seen when they could just answer the question. I understand that’s not how the world works and no one is entitled to answer me, but it’s not like I’m asking for legal advice from a lawyer. 

Thank you for taking the time to respond. It means a lot hearing from other users. I will definitely take your advice to treat it more like a game! 

Thanks again!
Excellent suggestion! I have been on Redditt for a year now and still learning. I don’t understand the karma deal at all. I come to Redditt to read and learn and interact. I have no idea what gold or karma even does.
Edit: grammar
I’m so sorry that happened to you! A lot of people seem to be really mean on here and care more about their rules than the actual topic of their subreddit. 

I really hope you’re able to find a good community that allows you to express yourself freely!
Only got downvoted by two big diaper filled babies .  Stinky pants.
What are you talking about? Texas has a LONG history of LIBERALISM !!! Have you never heard of President Lyndon Baines Johnson, among  many others !?!
I usually use reddit while travelling which makes it really annoying when I try to continue reading because it's way harder to find the place where I stopped reading.
Yes! 2-3 sentences max, and especially if you’re changing subject!
[deleted]
I feel the same with my ADHD. 

A wall of a text just seems overwhelming for me. If it's broken into smaller sections it feels more manageable.
I agree, but also I have both ADHD and dyslexia and I can never seem to remember to break my own posts into paragraphs, it’s usually just one long sentence without a second to breathe 😂
Again this platform is filled with a lot of people who have too much time on their hands. IMO
Mobile does that! It made me nuts, until I discovered double-spacing !!!
Exactly, it's like people try to do a criticism sandwich (what you did right, insult, something else you did right), but end up skipping the bread. .
Imagine Chinese social credits, but on the Internet and only *special* people take them seriously.
I agree with you. However, it is also a little frustrating when you see new users take the time to make many posts, get them removed, contact the mods and make posts in other subs complaining about reddit rules, but not take the few minutes to check a subs rules/about section.
As others have said, find a few subs that SPEAK to you, and stick with them! I have been a member for almost 3 years, and have only POSTED once, but COMMENT/ RESPOND often! You will be shocked at how fast your KARMA will grow! WELCOME, and the BEST of LUCK!!!
Yea, no problem!!
Hi thank you for being honest and letting me know! It’s greatly appreciated.
Agree 100%. Mods you know who you are.
I actually agree with this, I don’t get jumping straight to hostility. Yes, I agree that people should pay attention and all that stuff but I don’t understand the attitude. Some comments just sound so unnecessarily rude.
Thank you for your reply! It means a lot. 

I feel like a lot of the comments I got implied that I’m the odd one out and am being disrespectful for not understanding the rules.

I do read the rules on subreddits, but I ended up having to delete a lot of my posts because I got messages saying they would be taken down anyway. For example, using a discussion tag for a question that apparently wasn’t discussion worthy.

I guess I didn’t realize how legalistic and hyperspecific Reddit was. I’m used to other social media platforms where you can just ask away.

Thank you again for your reply though. Your sympathy means a lot, and it’s an encouragement to continue using Reddit. I will however, be more vigilant about listening and following the subreddit culture.

Wishing you the best! Thanks again!
Puhlease don't forget punctuation!!
I do format my sentences with punctuation and everything, and I still can't seem to get out of the gate.  I landed here because of exactly what OP has said.

What am I doing wrong exactly?

Anyone?
I also have adhd and will almost always skip over super long comments/posts. But, on the other hand, when I write a comment it is extremely difficult for me to keep it short and sweet because of my compulsive need to over explain, which I also attribute, at least partially, to my adhd lmao. So I'm just a big ole hypocrite :( lol
I know what you mean. I also have ADHD :(
I usually use paragraphs, despite my limitations, because I'm already used to it. I know that I won't understand a thing otherwise, even if it was me who wrote/typed it :D
Do you manually double-space or is there a way to format double-spacing where it is done automatically?
They state rules but have unwritten ones - ridiculous
Occasionally set your feed to show by ‘new’ instead of ‘hot’ so you can sometimes be the first person to say something good.

Sometimes just saying the same thing early in a thread that you would have said later can be the difference between getting 3 upvotes and getting 1400 upvotes just bc more people have time to see it as the thread takes off.
Reddit kind of screwed this up by getting rid of the option to search by rising posts.     

Comments are the easiest way to get Karma, but on already popular posts, they get buried.       
On unpopular posts, they're unlikely to be seen as well.    

Find a bunch of subreddits that you like and make a custom feed. You can use *that* to search rising posts and then make comments on those ones.     

Don't argue with people if you get down votes, it'll only mean getting more. You can always delete the comment if you're upset by the votes to avoid more down votes.      

Smaller active subs can be a good place to build Karma as they're less likely to have Karma requirements for posting.
Oh I feel that 

I'm late diagnosed though so I've masked most of my life 

So I can keep comments short with people I don't know 

But once I'm comfortable with the person the mask comes off and it's like essays or I switch to voice notes and they end up being like 10 min recordings 😅
It doesn't have to be either/or, short or long posts or comments. It seems that many posters don't realize they can and should break long posts or comments into paragraphs. 

Use line breaks. It makes long posts and comments more readable.
Same, and I skip right on past walls of text.
I'm wondering if any NDs actually have just one type of neuro divergence? I don't think I've met any yet 😂
Okay and how do you do that?  I'm not dyslexic, I am getting old and my memory is vanishing making my comprehension very poor.  I've managed to join a few groups (not rocket science)
100% agree on the removal of "rising"--my feed's been half-full of day-old posts ever since.😡
I use the phone app mostly and when you’re in a subreddit, at the top there’s a little flame icon that says HOT next to it, and if you click it you get a drop-down list and if you pick ‘New’ it shows you the most recent posts from the subreddits you’re subscribed to instead of the most popular ones.

You can also pick some other options like controversial and I forget what else.
I even get notification of "Now on reddit!" only to find out it is a week old. I turned notifications off because of it: it is useless to get notifications unless it is real time (one minute old).
I stand no chance of getting first in anything right now lol. It's taken me a good 1/2 hr to get here, and I don't see what I guess I'm expecting to see. Especially on the phone, for a multitude of reasons I need a full-size keyboard and screen.
Ah Apple, this is going to be fun.  Thunderbolt 5 cable without a “5” symbol just ⚡️. 
Not to mention the bunch of USB2 charging cables of 65W, 96W, 140W, 200W limits… or cables support USB4 but not display port, or support display port but only USB2 speeds, or cables where you can only use one of displayport or usb and fails if you try both, or thunderbolt 4 speed but only 65W or 15W…

Ahhhh apple, if you’re going to make a premium cable and charge premium money, this is the one time where I absolutely want an apple logo  on it. 🫠…

I've long said the USB-C connector is simultaneously the best & the worst invention ever.
Add it to the confusing mess that is USB-C
Ohhhh fuck this shit. Ever since TH4 which was 3 mixed with USB4 it was set up for usb naming chaos.
That is an expensive hand
Isn’t there a “5” in one side of the metal tip?
The spec should have never allowed USB C to run at USB 2.0 speeds
The USB-C cable situation is certainly confusing but basically everything you said about cable are wrong. There is no such thing as 65W, 96W, 140W, 200W cables; only 60W, 100W & 240W. There is no USB4 cable that doesn't support DisplayPort, nor is there any DisplayPort cable with only USB 2 speeds. There is also no cable that can't do both DisplayPort and USB at same time, and if you only get 65W or 15W from Thunderbolt 4 cables, that's your device/charger fault, not the cable.
you mean every cable made out there.

FYI, [this character only works on Apple devices](https://mina86.com/2015/on-unicode/).  It’s a Unicode code point reserved for internal use and it’s not valid to use it outside of a closed internal system.
It’s hard to tell parents which cable to buy when I myself have no idea which cable to buy.
This is not an apple specific problem. This is a problem of all cables with a USB connector (not only c).

there is usually no way for the end user to know the power or speed capabilities of a cable.

labelling cables should be mandatory.
Also boggled how many online retailers can’t list these cables decent on their site. Sometimes I just find charging USB C cables voor iPad or iphone. Getting a 100 watt one was a challenge.
Oh it gets more fun. If any of those cables are passive (about 1m long and without and internal ReTimer/redriver components) they will also work at TBT5/USB4 80Gbps.
I don’t know the difference between any of these specs and at this point I’m too afraid to ask
USB-C is a unified Standard.

#Bullshit.
It should be illegal to make or import a USB c cable that does not indicate it's capabilities/level/type

I was super in favor of USB c for a long time because I was tired of having a mix of USB micro, USB mini, lighting bolt, etc etc etc 

Yeah!  USB c!  One cable to rule them all!

Except that it is now the worst of all possible worlds.  The connector is the same but what it can do is different.  So you can't immediately recognize a cable you need, you don't know if a cable is not working b cause it is bad or because it is the wrong version, and every cable and charger is so finicky about what it wants and is compatible with
Solution to a problem is a problem now.
I use a label maker and label all my cables; been doing that for a while now, and it's a lifesaver.  Here is the tool I use currently:  **Brady M210** Portable Label Printer with this size tape (**Brady M21-1500-427 14' Length, 1.5“ Width, B-427 Self-Laminating Vinyl, Black on White/Translucent Color BMP 21 Mobile Printer Label**)

Thunderbolt 3 and 4 cables will still give you 80Gb if the host is Thunderbolt 5. The only difference is the PD.
I used to have a literal chart of all Apple port connectors since I mostly use Apple devices. I memorized it all but now it’s of no use 😭
I thought there was one that fit all. What the hell is this. They all look the same 😫
Is there actually a 20v and 28v standard on usbc? If so that’s borderline criminal.
They are waiting for USB5 to be released, to be confused even more between USB5 and TB5.
Man , when I see SCSI and RS232 port I recall those loud noise Dot Matrix printers.
You mean you don’t just use these cables for anything? Charging headphones? Sure. Transferring data/backing up a computer? Charging your Mac? I stopped giving a shit a long time ago and will probably come to regret it at some point, but eh. All USB-C look the same to an idiot who knows nothing about computers (me)
This feels like a trap set by Apple to sell more accessories
Ah, classic Apple! Always making cable shopping a wild ride
Most cables don’t have the number on it?
Is anyone going to bother mentioning that literally EVERY bit of information in the text of this post is wrong. Literally every bit. This is like a person complaining about how the color of the paint on their car is causing their gas mileage to be terrible.

Let me go through it: 


> Not to mention the bunch of USB2 charging cables of 65W, 96W, 140W, 200W limits…

There are three power limits that the cables may have: 60w (3 Amps at 20 volts) , 100w (5 Amps at 20 volts), and 240w (5 Amps at 48 volts). A charger may have any power limit it likes, but that’s not the fault of the cable you chose to plug into it.

 >or cables support USB4 but not display port, 

I’m fairly certain there’s no cable that behaves this way. And passive cables CAN’T behave this way. Active cables conceivably could, but I don’t think anyone would be stupid enough to build them like this.

>or support display port but only USB2 speeds, 

these cables exist (I have one), but they are breaking the USB C specification by leaving out 6 of the 15 wires. I’m fairly certain Apple would not sell a cable that does this. 


>or cables where you can only use one of displayport or usb and fails if you try both, 

As above, a properly-manufactured passive cable is incapable of behaving this way, and an active cable would never be manufactured this way.

>or thunderbolt 4 speed but only 65W or 15W…

Those are not recognized power limits of cables. 


Now, all of those goofy behaviors can be caused by the things that the cables are connecting. Plugging a 240w cable into a 30 watt charger isn’t going to get you 240w. But plugging a 60w cable into a 140w charger WILL limit you to 60w. 

And a USB C port that is badly implemented (or is properly implemented, just on a terrible computer) can totally refuse to provide USB connectivity while it is also providing DisplayPort data. But blaming the cable just shows that you haven’t really thought very hard about where the problem likely is. 

Also, for those curious, your PASSIVE 40 Gbps cables will work at the new Thunderbolt 5 80 / 120 Gbps speeds. Active cables will not get this free speed upgrade.
Is that Thunderbolt 5 cable hard to bend?
This is why I only use TB cables (right now TB4) for things that are not permanently installed (which are typically just power).

It’s a bad consumer situation, but I’d rather just use TB cables and know it works vs having to figure out if the random USB cable works for data transfer or power or both.
So funny 🤣 and true, usb cables with no marking
The meme picture is wrong. USB A 3.0 was released in 2008 which is the future square so the meme was made in 2007. In 2007 all those I/o ports were still the standard apart from the Centronics one. They missed out the purple PS/2 but kept the green one even tho both the keyboard and mouse ports disappeared at the same time when PS/2 became old times.
I feel like usb c authority is having smoke with snoop dog before they come up with name and definition
I get what you're trying to do here, but is this really such a problem for you? Why do you have so many cables with random ends beyond just to farm for internet points with that contrived pic?
Holy cables Batman
I think Apple's solution to this whole "many specs using the same connector" issue is they just always want you to buy the latest high end cable that is backwards compatible with the other specs. And throw out the old cables.
Buy a LABEL MAKER and label where you bought a cable and or which device it came with. USB-C / Thunderbolt standard have been all over the place. Further there are Random un-packaged USB-C cables that are sold at Gas Stations and Truck Stops checkouts.

Get one from Cable Matters. Theirs has a 5 on it. Plus it's only half the price.
Everyone wanted one port... Well merry fuggin Christmas.
Does System Information differentiate between cable types?
Missed branding opportunity by Apple. WTF Tim?
Im using Macs since years but never really came in the situation of using thunderbolt. What u guys connecting?
Some of my rechargeable bike lights won’t charge with either USB C PD cables or USB C 3.1 data cables, only with cheap USB 2.0 C cables. Others will charge with any of the above. It’s a mess.
Correct me if I am wrong, but it says “TB5” on one of the cables. /s
Windows :D
He rich rich
Someone needs to make a simple USB-C tester
Stick both ends in a box and it gives you speed, charge wattage, and Displayport stats
[deleted]
i’m pretty sure USB 4 is the first standard that mandatorily includes DisplayPort over USB support. cuz after trying and failing twice to get a USB 3 cable that i thought supported DP, i saw that USB 4 supports DP by default and just bought the cheapest 6 ft USB 4 cable i could find
You can clearly see the 5 symbol on the paper in your image.
I guess. Engraving aside, it looks like the person in the pic figured out how to label cables just fine.
That gets an up vote purely for correctly calling it a DE-9 not a DB-9 on the second image.
This is the reason I have a drawer full of cables. Thanks, Apple
It’s labelled on the metal part
OMG, the amount of hate I developed for USB-C immediately after getting an M1 MBP… sure every cable fits, but on the other hand *every cable fits* and not a damn one is marked up such that you can know how it differs from any other USB-C tipped cable. Took me like 3 tries to get a functional 100W PD cable and in the end I just bought the Apple one, because I could test it in the store and validate it showed 100W in the System Reporter. Grrrr…
I’m lost at why this a problem, we study about USB’s all the time. Must be a normal civilian, general consumer who’s doesn’t know computer peripherals. Y’all continuing education is vital!
I have VGA ports, display ports, composites, all around my room, gen alpha will understand
How is that a problem? Most of this is completely irrelevant, just like with mains power. You can plug in a 5W light or a 1500W space heater, it doesn’t matter, it’s the same plug and socket. The only valid point in this is that Apple should of course mark the TB5 cable.
whhhhaaaaattt ! OMG! Thank you so much, you’re the best!

Lock the thread. We're done.
Oh man I was so confused I didn’t realize that was just a zoomed in view; I was like man what the FUCK is that adapter for
Was gonna say it shows it right in the picture on the box too lol
Look at that. It was there all along, barely noticeable, measuring .2mm across, on the side you're guaranteed not to look at.
It would've been fairly easy to understand if companies like Apple just [followed the damn standard](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/usb_type-c_cable_logo_usage_guidelines_20240903.pdf). It **literally** tells you to put the **exact** capabilities right there on the cable. It's not like it is [impossible to get right](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Supports-Display-Transfer-Charging/dp/B09YM3V7NX), most manufacturers just don't give a damn about their users.
I do some electronics as a hobby. Designed a device with a battery, hooked up a charging circuit and an external usb c port. It was charging with USB A - USB C but not USB C - USB C because A-> C gives 5V no matter what and C -> C do some sort of smart power negotiation that wasn’t possible with any simple usb c port.
The whole EU regulation to standardize it just shows how much legislators listen to their supporters, and how detached they are from the things they are regulating. 
no it isnt
I have a love and hate relationship with USB C
It has a 5 engraved that will last longer then any logo, you just can’t see it in the photo
I think the USB folks are just having a laugh though. The newest announced standard is called USB4 2.0.
Put them in the river and you've got a royal flush
Yes.
yeah, but how is OP going to farm karma?
My main issue are cheap cables without support for faster data rates. It’s extremely hard to distinguish between a USB 2.0 and 3.0+ cable.
High-speed USB-C cables are length-limited. A USB4 Gen3/Gen4 cable can't go beyond 80cm without needing expensive signal boosting electronics, and even a basic USB 3 Gen1 cable is limited to 2 meters.

This means it would be impossible to make decent affordable charging cables if USB 2 only cables weren't allowed - not to mention that the cables would be a lot thicker and less flexible.
IMO only one good thing of USB2 cables is that they are much thinner and more flexible compared to their USB3 counterparts. I’ve been searching for a USB3 Type-C cable for my camera, but even the ones advertised as flexible are still twice as thick as the Apple charging cable.
The primary usage of usb cables is charging. They don’t need fast data transfer. This would have just ended up with everyone violating the spec and making 2.0 cables anyway.

Correect on the power levels. But DP is  more complicated.

Active USb4 cables do not need to support it. Only TB4 mandates it for active cables. And only up to 2m.

Passive cables do support it implicitly. But neither USB-C declares speed requirements for this, nor has DP publicly specified what DP speeds valid USB-C would be good for. 

So I'd be very interested in examples of cables that are not completely broken, support reliable USB4 connections and not DP.
The fact that comments like this are needed shows why I hate what they've done to USB.
I’ll strongly like to invite you to my home and test out the displayport situation… and connecting different supposedly thunderbolt cables to a supposedly pd supported thunderbolt hub
This sounds JUST like those facebook posts that our aunts make telling Zuck he's not allowed to use their photos or personal information
Buys two cables to connect two desktop hard drives > plugs everything in > nothing happens > scratches head. Before USB-C/Thunderbolt this never had happened to me.
I would kill for like, an alternative to Amazon that was 20% more expensive but actually enforced reasonable requirements for this kind of stuff so that you don't have to search through dozens or hundreds or thousands of pages of slush, much of it Chinese but plenty of it reputable name brands as well that all have the same problem, just to hopefully find what you're looking for.

I'd gladly pay extra for the convenience of a required, consistent spec sheet, or honest to god even just product titles that aren't the length of war and peace that have all the keywords within 14 degrees of separation of what you're actually looking for.
me too… i got multiple angry replies saying I’m wrong about cable specs in the original post 🥲🥲🥲…
That’s sort of like saying there should only be premium fuel because your sports car needs it. Everyone else has to pay for the expensive option when they don’t need it. 
I do the same, except I print it to heat shrink, and heat shrink it onto the cable.
Thanks, I probably should invest in one of this, instead of masking tapes and permanent markers. I have far worse cable management situations going on with BNC cables in the labs…
Does this do a much better job than the standard brother labeler? I think mine has 1/2" tape loaded though.
USB standards. They make as much sense as.
apparently [usb pd 3.1](https://www.usb.org/usb-charger-pd) can reach 48voltes for 240watts charging… I doubt even Edison will be happy to see this… ah… next few years of gaming laptops with PD eGPUs would be the next level of cable fun
Thunderbolt is a lot more Intel than it is Apple.
this is a $115 cable… there should be some ways to tell it apart…
Wait! Are you saying that the older TB4 cable (1m) from Apple will magically work at TB5 speeds when connected to TB5 peripherals?
you are the voice of reason. I might add, at work and home I have a zillion of cables, including USBs and TBs using the same connector. Well, if something comes with equipment I label it, if I buy a replacement for it I label it. Trashy cabels for phones or anything else it doesnt matter. Cables rated for 65W or 100W or whatever, I label it. I buy them from reputable places, I know the specs are right.

There's absolutely no confusion.

  
And yes apple fucks people over with accessories and cable prices. And RAM upgrade, etc etc. They fuck people over with price very consistently, so it is not a surprise.
it’s just a little bit harder than apple’s 2M 200W white USB2 cable, but much easier than any other random thunderbolt 4 cables i have on hand.

Just like the gypsy woman said!
No, nothing show up with only cable connected. Once something is connected on the other end, then it’ll say what speed is running at. 
However this is quite difficult when I’m connecting a 10Gbps SSD usb enclosure to monitor hub to thunderbolt hub then to a macbook, and SSD showing up as 5Gbps sometimes, and some other times display resolution is wrong but ssd running at 10gbps…
apple.com
On the cable it would be a bit more useful 😉
Couldn't agree more. The time and money wasted on non-functioning type-c connector cables is piling up to the point I'm just buying Apple's cable nowdays. Apple's approach is so simple; the white ones are USB2.0 speed for charging only, thin 1M for 60W, thick 2M for 240W; black ones do literally everything else, guaranteed to work with anything I plug it in. (I forgive apple now I found out apparently, they did put a "5" on the metal connector)
Different cables can transmit different power. You cannot charge a laptop with a phone charger cable even if they both have USB-C connectors.
Just: WHY? Did some idiot at Apple actually think it was aestetically vital to not have the number right next to the other logo they print on the connector? The one logo that allows one to make sense of the "5"?

Because "5" has no meaning for USB-C itself and would only lead to future confusion. The USB 80Gbps / TB5 speed is "Gen 4" in technical terms. Which means there might be a Gen 5 in the next few years that will be confused with any standalone 5 in relation to USB-C.

From ur photo
This is like finding out that you can change the orientation of the PlayStation logos on PlayStation 2’s so it will be upright whether the system horizontal or vertical .
Can’t wait for that to corrode away until it’s unreadable
Woo
Hey, some of us just got here.
Haha yeah I just noticed that zooming in too, but not until after I knew where to look.
I would doubt more than 25% of consumers have any clue what the possibilities are, let alone how to differentiate them.  
"I bought this cable but it only works for charging…"  
DP/HDMI are bad enough. USB-C is a whole new level.
I thought USB C was going to be the greatest thing ever. But even with the correct labels, which I think all cable should have, it's still a mess because they all still look the same. 

With everything else, the shape / color told you what the cable did. Now, a USB C cable can do everything or basically nothing.
Apple actually marks it on the connector itself.
Second this. Just like manufacturers do with UTP cables. It's really not that difficult. 🤷‍♂️
It’s on the connector though…
It’s on the connector though…
are you pointing to the USB website?

the same people who made USB one of the most confusing technology to date?
O.o WTF

But no, we have 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 gen 1 that are all 5gb…….
Yup. This is just apple being fucking dickheads for no reason, ignoring the rules made to help consumers. Just like when Nintendo botched the switch docks USB implementation in order to not let people use 3rd party docks.
EU only standardised it for charging mobile devices. The one thing that literally every single cable and port can do. 
The EU didn't standardise the cable.

They told the industry "pick a connector and use it". The industry chose the Type-C connector.
USB4 2.0: Available at all good local dispensaries!
I'll wait for USB4 2.0 revision 4.
Got a perfect condition 2019 iMac fully loaded for a good price recently. I have two external hard drives and figured it would be a good opportunity to buy hard drive cables to use up those USB-C/Thunderbolt ports and free up the USB-A ports, so I bought two of these cables on Amazon, but the drives won't mount using them.
Which is also ridiculous because those signal amplifiers should have been built into the ports/devices themselves, this way we don’t have to spend so much on cables that wear out.
Does the Oculus Link fiber optic cable meet the Gen3/Gen4 standards?
USB 3 cables have backwards compatibility with USB 2 ports, I’m no engineer but I think there’s a difference between making it backwards compatible, and just allowing a USB 2.0 cable to be made with a USB C connection
Again I understand the confusion, but inventing those non-existing cables won't help. Most USB-C  problems are caused by:  
1. Extremely cheap cable. You can disregard all what I said earlier since a 3$ cable from Temu indeed can be whatever mess you can imagine.

2. Unclear marking/labeling on devices.

What the device supports is important factor here. A Thunderbolt 4 from a reputable maker can support almost anything you current setup need. But if you phone only supports 15W, of course that what it gets. Most cheaper phone also doesn't support DisplayPort (cause that'll bump the price), that doesn't mean your cable or your hub not working. MacOS infamously not support multiple external displays, blame Apple for that.

In any case, the confusion is mostly about the devices, not the cable.
I don't understand your analogy
I think a better analogy to their comment would be requiring the labeling of the fuel you’re purchasing whether it’s 87 or 93 octane (or racing fuel at 103).  Not just labeling it “gas”.
I find these last longer and are fairly easy to use vs some of the other brands I've tried
Just only buy $115 cables and throw all your others out!  That's the Apple Earth Friendly way! 
Who cares how much it costs, if most companies don’t label it, that’s the standard?
It’s $70 dollars on Apple.com (US) and the number is labeled on the metal part.
If it is a passive cable, yes. If it is an active cable, no. Apple had apparently sold some active 1m cables, and some passive ones. So it will be a bit of a crapshoot. So paradoxically, the cheaper it was to buy, the better the odds that it is compatible with the speed upgrade, because the passive cables are just wires connecting the ends, whereas the active cables have chips that detect and then rebroadcast the signal down the wires, but they can only do that at the older speeds.

My recommendation is to try it and see what speed it connects at (I don’t know where to go in MacOS to see what speed it connected at, probably About My Mac, and then Thunderbolt Accessories) and only buy a new cable if it’s needed. But you won’t be able to test this until you have a TB5 computer and a TB5 accessory to connect to it.

My recommendation would be to buy this definitely-passive inexpensive certified TB4 cable if your current one does not give you the TB5 speed boost (it is certified to the same standard as Apple’s TB4 cables, and works for everything I’ve asked it to do): 

https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Charger-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B0DCHBVNZ1

I don’t know why people buy cables from Apple. Most of  their cables aren’t any better than anybody else’s (there are a few that actually ARE better, like the 3 meter TB4 cable, but we’re not talking about that here) but they cost way more. 

My general guidance is to buy from Apple ONLY the things that absolutely only Apple builds. Because on everything else you’ll be overpaying by a lot.
Actually, based on info from someone else, the 1 meter TB4 came from Apple is probably active, and thus would not work at the increased speeds. But the older 1 meter TB3 cable from Apple is passive, and WOULD work at the increased speeds.

There was no difference in signaling between TB3 and TB4. There is a difference in signaling for TB5.
oh wait… 🤬 apple is using black typec cables for their black ipad and margic accessories… erhhh
That’s just completely wrong. You can plug any USB-C device into into any charger with any cable as long as they all adhere to the standards. The devices will then automatically agree on a voltage and power. You can absolutely charge a MacBook Pro with a 10W phone charger, it will just be very slow.
Well, that really depends on the phonecharger and laptop on hand tho.. but that is the actual problem.
I guess Apple needs to justify its premium prices by engraving the "5" on rather than use a little ink. 

Sheesh.
You only need to see it when you’re plugging in. 

You probably aren’t plugging in and unplugging the cable that often. 

It keeps everything looking cleaner. 
> Did some idiot at Apple actually think it was aestetically vital

...it's Apple.
Yes
TB5 is 120Gbps
> Because "5" has no meaning for USB-C itself

Cool, it has a lightning bolt on it telling you it's a Thunderbolt cable, not USB.
\>Did some idiot at Apple actually think it was aestetically vital to not have the number right next to the other logo they print on the connector?

yes.
The TB spec has strict tools about the TB loco (your not permitted to just play with it).
I’d rather have it engraved the print on the insulation has a tendency to wear away to illegibility
“Some idiot at apple”. You think you know it better than the people at apple?

Sure bud. The thing is, USB Gen 4 is not the same as Thunderbolt 5. TB5 is a super set of USB. Also given that the thunderbolt icon is on the connector, not sure why you would try to associate the 5 with anything on usb-c.

But let’s call the people at apple idiots!
[deleted]
Or unable to read it after age 35.
At which point you’d still be able to tell because it’d be the only plug without any numbers on it.
But a good chunk of the reason people don't know is missing labels like this. If someone notices their cable isn't functioning as expected, being able to see on the cable that there may be differences in capabilities among cables is a super helpful indicator.
If you’d like to educate one of the 75%, I’d be grateful. 

Also interested in the issue with HDMI
It's the one thing every cable and port can do, *because* the EU forced them to support USB-PD. Anyone remembers QuickCharge?
i laughed
That’s another variation. (Badly) connected power wires and nothing else.
if my macbook supports TB4 and a TB5 macbook incoming, then I expect it to “just work” with everything i want to. Apple should just make more first party things that can do “just works”, and i’ll rather pay apple than to random companies making cables and hubs. 
It sounds like you’re from cable manufacturing industry? If I have TB capable matchbooks and TB peripherals, then ofc I’ll blame is the cables not the devices on either side. 
BTW my macbook pro can connect to multiple devices through a TB hub, but if I swap the hub’s manufacturer’s or apple’s TB cable to some other amazon TB cable, guess what, the TB hub becomes an usb hubs, so I hope it’s clear that some manufacturers’ TB cable is at fault!
I might have replied to the wrong comment. Or misread it. I agree it's all a mess though.
The fuel itself isn't labeled obviously so not really. The packaging is label in either case. If you fill a gas canister with and and forget what it is, it's no longer labeled (Assuming you can't tell the difference between gas I have no idea)
I think that point is that TB5 cables are very expensive and have capabilities that no other cables have and years from now when you're moving or setting up new equipment and you've forgotten what kind of cable you have it would be handy to differentiate the top-of-the line cable from the rest.
Not all cables will work with high power chargers tho.
I am charging a no name Chinese made Windows 11 Netbook with an iPhone USB C charger.
Actually, if you told me the engraving is better, because the logo might rub off after years of use I might believe you. But that still is no reason to not also put the number underneath the printed logo...
Apples thunderbolt cables have been good value in the past. Did you have a different view for thunderbolt 4?
They could engrave it on e plastic and fill it with white epoxy or something.
to be fair, the ink sometimes starts to degrade with time and disappear, the engraving stays for a long time.
>You probably aren’t plugging in and unplugging the cable that often.  
  
It keeps everything looking cleaner. 

This and the power cable would be the two cables you plug and unplug the most if you're using your MBP as a dock. 

Also, it still has a T-bolt logo on it, if they cared about minimalism, the would have put that on the actual metal port as well.  IDK, this almost seems like it's meant to infuriate IT professionals more than anything.
you can't read text that small on the connector (when you're older...)
I suppose Apple didn't consult those in tech support and that would also explain your lack of understanding of the problems that will ultimately be faced later.

> It keeps everything looking cleaner. 

How often are you looking at the back of your machine to care about a printed 5 on the cable? I can safely say I've never, not once, cared about the back of my machine.

I have, however, cared about *easily* finding a cable among a stack of other cables. Of course, when you work tech support - imagine telling people "yeah, it's on the metal bit, I know it's hard to see and on the smaller side. Good luck with that" will be incite much frustration, I guarantee you.

I pity anyone who works tech and has any users who do not have perfect vision. I already know that's going to be "fun".

Considering your extremely fortunate to have never worked with the public or users in such a way. May you one day feel the curse afflicted upon you that you think is nothing such that you understand **thoroughly** the frustrations others will feel.

It's always easy to dismiss others until it pains you one day. Then you shall reach enlightenment. But your cries shall be ignored by those just like you.
while that’s true… but I also just completely ruined the clean look by writing “TB5” on it when I initially didn’t notice that “5”…
Was not my point. But sure, its less important that be visible in plugged in state.

But honestly: I have not much empathy for this point of view. If you want to prioritize looks over functionality, then you how do you need the fastest speeds? To cater to the "visual" minority here makes it worse for everybody else.

And its not like Apple has been printing a 4 or 3 on the metal of past thunderbolt cables, no? So they are not even consistent internally. They have basically realized that their instincts with TB3 were wrong, but do not want to make it obvious.

Or that Apple labels the TB generation on the back of their devices even (or even the underside that they have started to put the power button on).

And I think, if a small "3", "4" or "5" nicely centered below the Thunderbolt bolt logo is aggrevating your sense of style (it has been the guideline and standard this way since TB3, all my valid TB cables look uniform that way), then you might have some OCD issues to take care of.

You might not have run into issues between TB3 and TB4, because they were so close to each other, but that problem is only going to get worse...
Do all Apple fanboys have the ability to somehow make looks priority over function every time they see a design flaw? Y’all are wild lol
Somewhat.

But so is USB4 as well. USB4 cables must support the asymmetric modes that do give you the 120 Gbps at the cost of 40Gbps of bandwidth in the other direction. For this cable it is irrelevant.

I find it slightly misleading to only give the higher number, because some people not realize that that is just redistributing bandwidth from 80/80 Gbps to 120/40 Gbps. But lets ignore that. And that is probably why USB4 does not define a logo for that asymmetric mode. For cables it is just guaranteed for all USB 80Gbps cables.

For USB4 80Gbps hosts and devices and hubs, it is optional to support those 120/40 modes. But we can have that discussion for TB5 as well. Neither USB4 nor TB5 (publicly) define when the 120/40 mode will be used. It is decided by the USB4 driver. And the best indication we have is, if more sending bandwidth is needed than receiving bandwidth. For example if you have 3 DP connections of 4xHBR3 speed or higher. But the minimum requirement for TB5 hosts ist only 2 DP tunnels at 4xHBR3 speed. So a TB5 host might be required to support the 120/40 USB4 mode in hardware. But it might not have any reason to use it ever. And I do not think we have heard how many DP tunnels Apple supports (and at what speeds).

And for more complex cases, like for example a PCIe connection (at least symmetrical 64/64 Gbps) + a DP connection (HBR3, \~26 Gbps sending), you can switch to 120/40 to make that possible without reducing the sending PCIe bandwidth. But that'll cost you PCIe bandwidth in the receiving direction at the same time. So probably, it will not be used in this circumstance. Because as always, DP and USB3 bandwidth will simply cut into the PCIe bandwidth (in sending direction). The 120 Gbps mode will probably only be used if you use DP tunnels and special USB3 bandwidth that exceeds the 72 Gbps that are available on a sending direction.

Intel actually does not define this at all. 1 Manufacturer of a TB5 laptop has explicitly stated that they do not support the 120 Gbps mode (even though all Intel TB5 controllers, which they use, have it), because they do not have the DP connections to make it useful at all. Apple of course has announced the asymmetric support. So you can be sure they support it. But since that is a USB4 feature, that means it is simply incompetent to not also list "USB4 (up to 120 Gbps)".
> “Some idiot at apple”. You think you know it better than the people at apple?

We're talking about a printed logo, not the next iteration of Apple Silicon. Design is subjective. You don't have to be an Apple employee to be qualified to say "hey as a user, I would have really preferred seeing the TB5 number right next to the TB logo so that I can instantly tell what cable I'm grabbing".
Any possible reasons other than keeping the printing in line with past Apple TB cables? As OP shows many other cables can also have clean looking connectors. They are just more informative by adding the generation to the TB logo, where you expect it and are used to it from Intel and all other TB manufacturers.

Yes, "USB4 Gen 4" and TB5 is not the same. That is why just the number by itself is a bad idea. If they engraved both the TB logo and the 5 on the metal, that could be argued for. But why split them apart like that.

For accuracy: USB4 Gen 4 is a technical name, not recommended for consumers for the transmission mode of a single wire pair. Or a the group of transmission modes of the entire cable (which could be in symmetric or 3:1 or 1:3 mode).

TB5 is a certification for

* USB(4) 80 Gbps (the official USB name and logo is "USB 80Gbps". Because its not specific to USB4 and backwards compatible. Just like USB 5Gbps cables are forward compatible to USB4 20Gbps).
* maybe 240W support (Intel was not clear if every TB5 cable must support this, I am guessing that)
* for cables up to 2m in length: guaranteed DP support, even if they are active (USB4 already guarantees this for passive cables, which this one is). Neither state a minimum speed. But Apple gives us the guaranteed DP capabilities of the cable on top of what TB5 might guarantee

And that is it. So TB5 on a cable actually gives you slightly more information than the official USB 80Gbps/240W logo would. But you need to know what it means by heart and cannot read it from the cable.

Neither of which spells out the exact DP speed (from what is labelled on the cable itself. Apples specs themselves are good here).

**Note** that USB4 already mandates all non-optical USB4 80Gbps cables to support the asymmetric modes. So the "up to 120Gbps" here is nothing that TB5 has to require, its pure marketing. And considering that there have been optical TB cables in the past with less features, it is unclear if TB5 would make stronger guarantees for optical cables that USB4 does not make (like USB2 support, DP support, full USB3 support, required asymmetric support)

**Note** that in the past, TB Logo + "3" on a cable meant 40Gbps capable, fullfilling all the TB3 requirements. While The TB Logo without the "3" was commonly used to identify 20Gbps TB3 cables that somehow failed those requirements.

So if you only see the TB logo and do not realize you have to look for a small engraving, this could identify cables ranging from TB5 down to a USB 5Gbps/100W cable.
Apple literally helped develop USB C and was one of the first companies to go all in on it with the 2015 12” MacBook.
Or if it’s plugged into something and your not Superman
I agree - but I think you may be underestimating the power of human stupidity. ;))

I've just read a post on reddit - 'what is this thing?'  
Answer: an ironing board.  
My faith in humanity is waning.
Unfortunately, it's way too complex to try précis in here, there's enough data to make your brain start to leak out of your ears ;)  
Have a look at these. Scroll to the Version number summary tables to get a broad view.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C)   
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI)
Good
I totally agree that devices you buy as that price point should "just work". That unfortunately isn't the case. I also get you blaming on the cable because of your experience, but it's better to understand about why things work (or not), so that you can figure out the solution, cuz it's usually not about the cable.

Now, about the TB hub, let's see what's wrong here. TB4 & USB4 uses the same underlaying protocol, however TB3 is different from "normal" USB. TB3 cables is made for thunderbolt protocol, not normal USB. For normal "passive" cable this is fine, but active cable won't work since it only made to work with Thunderbolt.

So, my guess is that the cause could be:

\- Your bad cable is active TB3 cable.

\- Your bad cable is USB 3 but claimed to be TB.

\- Your TB hub is TB3.

And yes, there are good amount of bad TB cables out there, but it's not because TB has loose requirements, it mostly because of sketchy manufacturers. Simplest advice is buy certificated TB4 cable (cuz TB3 also kinda a mess). You can check the thunderbolt certificated product here  
[https://www.thunderbolttechnology.net/products](https://www.thunderbolttechnology.net/products)
yea I definitely get the point, but we’ve been doing it like this for decades like this.

Whether it’s HDMI cables (1.1 or 2.1), Ethernet cables (CAT3, CAT4, CAT5, etc), USB cables (like USB-C that has different speeds), SATA, power cords, and ANY Apple cable (lighting/usb/watch), none of these cables in the last 30 years have been labeled.

That’s just the nature of the beast, that’s cables for you. Luckily there’s awesome companies that DO sometimes label cables, but just because a company doesn’t, doesn’t mean we’re entitled to demand it just because we paid more money for it?
Yours is a valid opinion.
or engrave the thunderbolt too
> But that still is no reason to not also put the number underneath the printed logo...

Contrast for people with shit vision, alone, should justify this. "Yeah grandma, use the one with the 5 on the metal piece itself" is going to be infinitely more difficult than a bright ass white on black cable with a large print of 5. Or *vaguely gestures around at tech incompetent users* this is unpleasant.

It seems strange to me.
Pfff that would cost like a whole 0.0001 cents extra per cable! Are you insane? How are they supposed to bleed us dry otherwise?
What a needlessly dramatic take that makes a shitload of assumptions about who I am, what I do, and where I work. 
Why don’t you use stickers?
It's just a tool like any other.

I personally color-code using tape, when needed.
You don't want aesthetics over functionality but you're using apple? OP even mentions wanting the apple logo on it..
> You don't have to be an Apple employee to be qualified to say "hey as a user, I would have really preferred seeing the TB5 number right next to the TB logo so that I can instantly tell what cable I'm grabbing".

I totally agree but thats not at all what happened here. /u/rayddit519 stated that it was objectively wrong while at the same time insulting a group of people.

A totally different way of stating something like you suggested.
And the last to do with phones. I don't see them as positive force, even in 2024 they sold mobile devices charging via some proprietary bullshit (I forgot how it's called).
Was it labeled, though? ;)
Yeah, I get where you're coming from. It would be nice if it were required to put the standard on. Some Ethernet cables used to do so on the jacket of the cable IIRC. Ethernet has got more complicated so may not be a thing anymore.
Happy cake day!
why would they need thunderbolt 5 lol
I insulted the hypothetical person that decided this. **IF** they did it for aesthetic reasons. If some explanation surfaces why this decision was made that is not "design", I would be proven wrong and happily concede.
That’s not the point. The person I was replying to said that Apple didn’t choose USB-C, it was forced on them by the EU. That’s very much not true, particularly in Macs. Apple is a founding member of the USB-IF, they’ve always been an early supporter.
They started using lightning when USB C didn’t exist yet and it was many miles better than micro USB. It was even better than early USBC, for that matter. And they got *immense* amounts of shit for “making people change all their cables” to do it. Of course they didn’t move to USB C four years later.

They stuck with lightning for only ten years. From a pure connector longevity viewpoint, they moved on too soon. From a USB C viewpoint, not soon enough.
Ah, you may have a point there. No it was an entirely unlabelled ironing board. Could easily have been mistaken for a car, a tennis racquet, or a dog.
Wait, wait, wait. You sincerely cannot imagine why someone might need to step someone else through getting a specific cable for a specific reason? You can't imagine *any* scenario* in which that's the case?

I'm so jealous.
I'm not an apple user, and for me they just created better screws incompatible with the rest of the world. They claim it's better, but refuse to share, therefore, intentionally breaking compatibility. They were at their rights to do so, but I'm also in my rights to berate them for this.

They did something a little nice to themselves at the expense of society. Like an SUV occupying more than a parking lot. Nice to the owner, not nice for everyone else.
I tried to iron my clothes once on a Bichon Frise.  Let me just say…there should be a law labeling dogs as dogs.
That's not an ironing board, that's a keyboard stand.
makes more sense when u put it like that, i was thinking of them needing to use TB5 specifically
With an additional sticker, "Feed this end, clean up after the other."
Ohhhhh, damn it, THAT’s why it wasn’t eating the food I was shoving in what I thought was its mouth
The film I edited last year 'Your Lucky Day' just came out on netflix!
I edited and co-produced this (VERY INDIE) film with my best friend and Director Daniel Brown and our super talented friends and collaborators. It had originally come out last year to a limited audience and OnDemand, but there aren't a ton of eyes when there is not a lot of money behind the marketing. 

It stars the late Angus Cloud who sadly passed last year. And the rest of our cast brought so much passion and dedication to their roles, well beyond what the late nights and limited catering deserved. 

I've never cut anything as personal and in the mud as this. We learned a ton and I hope our efforts are apparent on the screen. If you have a chance, give it a watch. I would LOVE to discuss anything about it! The journey of independent film and getting on your first feature is a treacherous one and i'm happy to give my experience.
I saw this at Fantastic Fest and it absolutely rules. An absolute highlight of the fest. Congrats on the pickup and amazing job on the movie. I hope a much wider audience gets to take a peek at it because of this.

Big congrats Pezzhead!
Just watched it. Sad about one of the actors death, had to look it up
And he died from an accidental overdose, he looks like Mac miller too and they both left us in the same way :(
Amazing film! Just stayed up way too late to watch it. Well done.
We absolutely loved it! The editing made it for me, both sound and visual. Nearly flawless! Great work ☺️
That is so awesome! I will definitely give it a watch. Congratulations!! I'm proud of you, baybeeeee!
Congrats Homie.
I’ll watch it!
Damn just watched the trailer it looks really good! I’ll check it out
Woah, I remember watching the short film years ago!

I'll definitely have to check this out soon.
I’ve been a fan of yours and Dan’s for a long time. Congrats to you both and I can’t wait for Butcher’s Crossing. 
Congrats! Putting it on my Netflix list!
[deleted]
I JUST watched it (99% of my reasoning was Elliot Knight being a major role) I didn’t really know what to except but I ABSOLUTELY loved it. I loved all the acting, the editing, the story, definitely the best movie I’ve seen in a few years (though I watch few movies and are really picky with them too) it was really good everyone who worked on it did a really fantastic job
Just saw it! Such a good movie and great acting, but the story 🤯 amazing. A refreshing movie not predictable and so different from everything that’s out there. Definitely needs more attention than it’s getting!
Awesome movie
I’m watching this NOW and like all good films, I start googling the script and info on the project. I was telling someone it’s a brilliant concept - single location, minimal cast, probably made for about 250k. Am I right? Can you give some details on locations and how you raised money and got the project made?! I’m loving it thus far.
THIS was SUCH a great film! Nice job editing! The acting was good all the way around.  Love the Boxer at the end telling the officer something was amiss in that Mercedes.  

A shame about young talented Angus. May he rest in peace.  🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I just finished watching it. I thought it was great! The color pallet used was amazing. Great storytelling as well. It puts the viewers in the shoes of the actors. A great "What would I do..." 🤔 type of vibe. Dope❤️😊 Love to see what else you have!
just finished this movie, actually was great, kept me engaged the whole time. one of those situations where you randomly pick something and its really good
Just watched the movie. It was a thrilling watch through and through, and so beautiful yet daunting. I will definitely be following your future works this is AWESOME!
I just watched it me and my boyfriend loved it!
Very cool! Huge achievement
Just saw this movie, didn’t see much on Reddit yet, but damn it was good way better then other stuff out there, to see how much work y’all put into it with as much as a budget is freaking insane, it would be crazy to see a sequel, can’t wait to see more out of you!!. Cheers!!
I just watched it and I couldn't take a break cuz I didn't want to stop watching! It shows what a person will do when under stress/pressure/ fright! When the young pregnant woman started coming up with scenarios...I thought she was a hard criminal in her past life! LoL
Just watched the film. Great job! I loved all the twists and the pregnant waitress character.
Just finished it.  I loved it.  I noticed the editing was well done even before I found this thread.  Congrats!
I’m so excited to watch this movie! I’ve been waiting for it to hit streaming networks since I saw the commercial. I’m only a few minutes in and love it already. Congratulations!!
Congratulations... I played Dawn In The Morning....So blink and you miss me...great job editing ... it really moves and it's very dynamic. Be very proud:).
This was an amazing movie and let me tell you. I did not know this was an indie film or made on a budget. You fooled me. All of the actor and actresses were spot on with their acting. Everything was well directed and the story line was solid.

I'm happy to watch more.of what you two edit. I know editing isn't a easy task but boy did you guys piece this together exceptional well.

I also like the end with the car and the dog.
I did wonder what came to that!! 

Say, in the credits. What song is that??
Just watched. Good flick!
The best film I’ve watched this year!
This is by far, easily, the worst fucking movie I’ve ever seen in my life. I am absolutely fucking miserable right now. I will never again be able to live the life I lived 2 hours ago. I hate everything. This movie had the shittiest and corniest plot of any movie in existence. I am absolutely livid. The people who made this movie deserved to be punished and should never be allowed to make a movie for the rest of their lives. This movie has instantly given be depression.
I'll be watching it in the morning. I'll come back after I watch it.
I am watching this movie right now. I love it!
The editing was top shelf, you should be very proud of your accomplishment.

It's a real testament in your editing that such a poorly written movie is getting this much praise lol
Watching now… 10 mins in I’m excited to see how this all plays out. It’s in the top 10 for the day. I saw angus was in and hit play, not reading the synopsis
Just watched the movie and really loved it.
Just finished watching! It was sooooooo good!
Really great movie that kept me entertained. Can you tell me anything more about the end credits song? “Bells of Saint Mary’s by Nasaya and Maro”Specifically if it is available anywhere outside of the movie? I’m having trouble finding anything about it. Great movie and great song! Thanks!
Just finished the movie a couple minutes ago and found this thread. This was such an amazing movie. Such a tense movie and felt longer than an hour-and-a-half in the best way possible. You and the team who worked on this did some great work.
Just finished. Great watch all around. Was not expecting something’s to turn out the way they did; definitely built up the suspense. Just bittersweet to see Angus as his potential was so amazing.
I wanted to ask why the confusion on location, and where is the audience supposed to think it is?

There are dozens of different shots of California, but no indication of any specific PD precinct, city, cross streets..

And to make it more confusing, at 1:18:44 a uniformed officer comes in pointing his gun (he was shot earlier in the film, I’m avoiding spoilers) well, he’s clearly wearing a City Of Miami looking police uniform, it also looks like a one of many Miami corner stores..

However the Wikipedia page says it takes place in LA? 

So, where is it?

Edit: I just noticed at the end, the officer is being interviewed on a non existent tv show called “DAWN on MIAMI”
Just finished watching this movie; one of the best movies I’ve seen since waves by A24. I initially clicked on this movie cuz I saw Angus Cloud (REST UP) but stayed because of the way this movie was filmed and cut up (crazy I stumbled on the very person who edited it lol) the color grading and grittiness of the film is like no other brotha. My favorite shot is one early on in the film where the g wagon is parked outside while the store just glows in the night. The grain/grittiness and halation fr captures the feel of the movie ion even know how to explain it but I love it bro lol. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat till the end because of all the twists and turns! Wonder how it all played out after they found the bodies with the gun tho 


Also if you ever need music, especially west coast/LA for any background sounds, I’d love to shoot you some work (Full songs and beats)! 
Just watched it. It was so good! It was nice to see Angus again. I’m still heartbroken that he passed ☹️ I was looking forward to seeing him do more in the future. RIP homie.
I just saw this, and can I just say, bravo. 

Honestly didn’t think I’d still have movie twists catch me off guard but here we are.
Just watched it on Netflix tonight. Seemed very fatalistic, sort of a sad commentary about greed and the human condition. Good watch though. Well done.
Great work! This is my favorite movie of 2024. It has a strong existential themed story. Love it. 
Hi! Just watched this movie w my partner and we loved it and thought it was entertaining! Very cool that you edited and co-produced this with your best friend. There were times when I was thought “wow that scene is rly cool.” For example, I loved the cinematography during the scene where Abraham was fighting the security guard and you could only see bits of what was going on through the train. Please tell your team we thought you all did an amazing job!! I wouldn’t have guessed this was an indie film with a low budget and knowing this now I’m even more amazed.

Also I noticed there is a 2010 short of Your Lucky Day. Did you also edit/co-produce that one?
Yo just saw it, it was pretty good I wish the gas station owner survived :(
I’m so confused on everyone calling this a great film. Most if not all was so farfetched from the guy getting the ticket and thinking he can cash it even after their halfcocked plan. The cop being alive after bleeding out for multiple hours after getting shot in the neck. The cops dad and his friends being some rag tag group of mercenary bad cops lol. The girl getting shot in the gut only to still have the baby. Everything seems so forced in here it was laughable. Different folks I guess.
Awesome movie 🍿
Just saw it, I love the movie! There’s so many layers relating to money and greed to peel back and the editing and shots are awesome. You all did a fantastic job congratulations
just finished it! definelty a top 5 watched of the year so far, just incredible! do you have a title for the song played during the end credits?? i know its the song the couple sang in the movie but the mix is great!
Hey I saw it! Very interesting film. The premise was really good.
Just saw this, fantastic !
Just saw this last night I was really impressed. I was telling a friend if i was a producer or studio this is the kind of director i’d be keeping my eye on - he’s very talented with tons of potential. Hope you guys do more and will definitely follow your work! So sorry about Angus Cloud. Cheers and good luck.
just finished the movie and i think i may have seen your name in the credits! (pezz) great movie!!! fantastic editing!
Great movie man. I hope to direct something like this in the future. Do you know what camera and lens that was used?
Came to say congrats, it's #1 on Netflix
Loved this movie! Congrats! RIP Angus… he was def one of my all time favs.
Congrats! Netflix tells me it's "Coming Friday" so I'll check it out this weekend! Intriguing premise. What inspiration did you have in mind for the edit? Did you have a particular movie or style you tried to emulate?
[deleted]
Did you edit the trailer on Youtube also?
I just watched the movie and I thought it was amazing, just wondered if you could tell me what song(I know it is a form of The bells of St Marys but by who) is played in the credits, I was a big fan of the soundtrack as well.
Was that not a shit ton of work???? Also post your luts. Looks awesome.
Just watched it and loved it! I am searching for that song at the very end with the girl singing “The Bells of St Mary” and then I guess it goes into “A New Day”. Any help with who is singing that at the end and how I can find it? It’s not on the soundtrack for some reason
I wish i knew what happened in the end
It was really good😭 I cried at “For Angus”. >! It never really showed his body. I wonder if that was because of his passing? !<
He smashed this film! I enjoyed it from start to finish! What are you guys doing next?
Just watched it! Really enjoyed it, and thought it was very Safdie-esque.
Just watched it and had one question where I feel like I’m missing something.

***SPOILER***

Didn’t Amir start recording again after deleting the footage? I thought that he did and was thinking it would be hinted at or brought up at the end of the film. That or I’m just crazy and he didn’t start recording again lol. Great movie!

***END SPOILER***
Amazing movie. Loved it
I have a weird question. It seemed like Angus’s character died so suddenly in the film, is it because of his actual death? was there a different ending supposed to be for the movie?
Would be cool is you shared a screenshot of the timeline.
Can anyone for the love of god help find the track ID for the closing credits
Can you explain more in depth as to why the cop steps on Ana's hand and goes to kick her belly? Is it pure cruelty and making sure she's dead or is it also backed by racism?
I couldn't watch this movie after the first ten minutes. I don't know what happened at the end..But there's no way the robber could cash that ticket. I would given him the ticket immediately because I know he couldn't cash it in. The guy had witnesses and he scanned the ticket and the store owner checked it. Maybe it was figured out at the end. But that bothered me to much to continue.
Great movie! I was wondering how you went about casting your protagonist and antagonist characters?
Good movie, until the part where a pregnant woman with one hand manages to out smart and out maneuver 3 highly trained swat officers, but it was great until then
It was an entertaining movie! I’m just wondering how the baby survived. Did I miss a scene where she put something under her dress to protect the baby?
What did you film it on?
amazing movie! what song did you use for the credits? i can’t find that version anywhere!
I didn’t enjoy it at all, the ending was such trash 
such a great film! just watched it. excellent work!
Let me tell you is one of the best film I watched lately. Congrats and let me know if you guys have another to see
Just curious, are there any plans for a sequel where we get to see the fallout of what happens once the car is discovered?
Sorry if this has been asked already but I’m watching the film now (loving it) and trying to understand why Abraham gets out of the car and starts asking for help at the train stop? It seemed like he was all for the plan and then the train scared him? I don’t understand why he started panicking though.
Just watched this tonight. Very well done. Great edits. Nicely filmed. A bit grainy but overall fantastic film, IMO. Truly hope you guys get to make another with a heavy bigger. Do good things, lad! Be very proud of this one. Super raw and stays on the rails!
Just watched on Netflix and must say, Bravo! 👏 
Very well written, made & directed, edited, acted, etc.etc!! Wow. Played it on a whim, like, let me check this out.. and totally enjoyed tf out of it!!! Can't get over how well EVERYONE performed! Just excellent, really. Great job!
Anyway, just wanted to give props! Everyone knew what they were doing in this one!😊
Hi, great work on the film, it was a very enjoyable ride (stressful rather haha)!

I actually stumbled upon your post while searching for the end credits song. Shazam doesn't find it and the tune is not on the OST... So I'm wondering if you'd know what the track is? Thank you :)
I just finished the movie and I loved it! Was super curious on what the last song was that was used in the end credits? I can’t seem to find it anywhere online
Looks like it's removed now :/
Just watched it. It was really good except (I'm sure you had little to do with this) the part where the unborn baby's father steps out the car at the railroad?! I felt like I couldn't breathe throughout the movie - it was captivating and the characters actually were intelligent and three dimensional except for that part, which made me yell at the screen lol

Great job!
I shut it off within the first 10 mins. Lots of anti-white, stereotypical rhetoric. This is what keeps people divided. Could have been a fun movie without the propaganda
I just turned this movie off after 22 minutes. I'm not here to blame the editing alone, because the acting was terrible, and the story was stupidly unbelievable even in such a short time. It opened decently, but as soon as you introduced the store characters it was over. The more the characters spoke the more the dialogue seemed like chat gpt wrote 5 stereotypes. Interracial pregnant couple, immigrant store owner, racist rich white guy. Add in the protagonist who's the least scary gangster you've ever seen, he acts like 1. 1/2 mile Eminem ...  I had to turn it off after they started dragging a dead cop around the store as a pregnant woman mopped blood ... Followed by 6 mm minutes of more terrible dialogue, who are you, what do you do for a living? And the guys brother shows up at midnight for a shift that he doesn't need to be there for 🤦🤦🤦🤦 No one on the street heard gunfire? The cops never check in on an officer that's been unresponsive on break for an hour ? Or how many bullets does the kid have left in his 6 shooter after the gunfight ... He also never picks up the officer's weapon, it's right there for the black pianist to grab...

Ridiculous. All around.
The song during the ending credits is amazing. Would be willing to share?
Will there be a sequel? The pit at the end staring at the Benz left me hanging.
Which NLE you guys used ? 
Congratulations! The storyline is so bad the writers should be jailed and it’s one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen by the way but u should still be proud , found it from Netflix
![gif](giphy|3o7TKqFZJpwL8Giz2E)

Man thank you so much for the kind words! FF was amazing. I had never been but can't wait to go back. Has to be my fav festival experience.

not a euphoria fan i guess- i have one real question about this movie i just watched and i’m thinking it's a spoiler so i can't ask it- damnit

also to op i am noticing comments about it being a low budget film and for what its worth i literally never thought that while watching it- usually i always pick up on that kind of thing and i never thought about it once- so tell your team great job
He was attached to play Mac in the movie, BLUE SLIDE PARK, which still hasn’t been made
Much appreciated! Hope you got some sleep!
That’s awesome! Thank you for taking the time!! 

Ok so seriously NEARLY flawless you say… what did I fuck up??? 🫣😅 I’m kidding.
Wow! Yeah the old short to feature story has taken a bit longer than planned. Haha. We made the short in 2011 and this was shot in 2021 so just 10 short years between them.
Thank you! The love is felt.
awesome! the beauty of the queue

Thank you!
What is the credit song? I’ve been trying to find it
This means so much. I’ll share your kind words with the team. Many many thanks!!
Thank you! That was the hope! For this little film any attention at all was kinda a long shot. There are 1000's of films made every year that never get seen. So for us the fact that we are on netflix now is like a crazy dream come true.
You're sooooo close to our budget number its just sad.... haha 

Let me just give you the the abridged bullet points cause the story behind the story is pretty fun; 

\- The director and I made the short film its based on 13 or so years ago.... 

\- In 2021 he had an opportunity to direct a different film which ended up falling apart at the last moment. He had quit his job and was ready to make his first feature. 

\- He decides in LATE October 2021 to instead try to make Your Lucky Day the feature which he had been writing over the last several years, never thinking it would be a real thing.

\- He got the casting agent from the film that fell apart to read the script. She liked it and came on board. She connected him with the cast he would eventually work with BUT they were only available before the end of the year. 

\- So by Mid November he had scraped together some funds from family and friends and small investors to make it happen and fist day of shooting was Dec. 1st 2021

\- The schedule was 15 1/2 days, mostly nights and all cold and hard. Minimum of 7 pages a day. We were cruising. 

\- Everyone brought their A game, the cast was amazing and were on board for the crazy schedule. The crew were all dedicated and sacrificed a lot to make it happen. 

\- I should also note it was shot in East LA, by city of commerce at an old Weed warehouse. The directors brother and the production designer did the build out during November for what you see on screen. NONE of the store was a store before they shot this movie. 

\- And once they wrapped we spent about the next 3 months really focussing on the edit and then had to break for other jobs and would intermittently come back to it and make changes until early 2023. The benefit of time allowing us to make it the best it could be. Not to mention the director did over 300 VFX shots himself of that time as well. All things you'd never see, extensions, paint outs, all the gunfire and blood, the train, the ferry.... too much. There were a couple other friend/vfx artists involved that really helped out but most of the work was on his back because of our small budget in post. 

So thats basically the film in a nutshell... many more stories in between the lines but very glad people are watching it and engaging. The director and I have been working in advertising for about 10+ years and there is never any REAL engagement or conversation being had with the people watching the work. I'm glad we could rip the bandaid off and make this and now on to the next projects whatever they may be! 

Cheers!

That was my dog "Stormy" :)
Great film. What would you imagine happened when those bodies are found with the officers weapon in that Mercedes??
Thank you! We can't wait to see what we do next as well haha 

As for color you can thank [Justin Henning](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4103850/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr) the DP and [Paulo Américo](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6639340/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr) the colorist!
Aww a perfect date night. 🙏🏼🫶🏼🔨😅
Dawn!!! I hope you liked the end result. Your scene was such a fun one to cut. Emulating daytime tv is never easy. Haha but you killed it!
That means a lot! Thank you. The artist for the song is Nasaya & Maro. I don’t think it’s released yet.
I found this thread but searching for the credit song!
Agreed. Stupidest plot ever. Like why would a criminal with a winning ticket not just split the joint after all that but wants to share it with a bunch of strangers? LOL and how are they going to cash it when that ticket is tied to that store and associated crimes?
I’m really sorry. [Maybe this can help?](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=X1tdsY7gUW52wNiE)
I agree 
So dope!!
Very glad you had fun with it! We are really blown away by the response.
🙏🏼That means a lot. I’ll pass your compliments along to the director and DP!
Yeah we all feel the same way. He was one of a kind.
Just here to keep you on your toes!
They did
We have noticed a lot of dynamically different experiences from people watching the film. Some people are on the ride and some people are not. Kinda crazy to see from a purely anthropologic level. Not sure why there are such drastic differences for the same story. But I will say as filmmakers and editors especially I am super interested because the experience of the movie is part of the job. Like for you you’re into the details and believability therein. We don’t explicitly explain every detail and choice to death, especially for all the lottery system inner workings, and some people are ok with that and some are not. I will say that it is a movie and a bit of a fable at that. It’s totally far fetched but that’s part of the fun for us.
Thank you! I’ll pass this on to the Director!
Alexa was the cam. And every shot was on the 35 Prime
Also thank you and I hope you do your own film someday! It’s daunting and scary but worth it every minute 🙌🏼🙌🏼
No way! Which country? Thanks for letting me know!
Hmmmm.... style... haha. No real style per se other than what was already baked into how any give scene or shot was filmed.  Dan has lots of style in all his work including this film. And as editor I definitely played into moments and leaned into his filmmaking where I could, but I wasn't thinking too hard about any overt editing style.  

One overall theme we were keeping in mind was 90s action films like Die Hard. Violence and christmas are kinda hand in hand with our film as well. And then of course just keeping it moving. We knew a movie like this would be on borrowed time with an audience because of its fairly unknown cast and budget constraints so making sure that the pacing and scenes played as tight and with as much tension as possible was always important.  Hope you dig it!
Luke is the best. And it’s super cliché, but without anyone on the team for this film, it wouldn’t have been the same. Everyone brought their best work and not always in the easiest of conditions. But that’s what makes the magic happen.
I did not. Whoever did absolutely killed it! I love the trailer.
That’s so great to hear. Really means a lot. That end credit song was something we were toying with for a while. Dan knew he wanted The Bells of St Mary but the version we had in the film for a very long time ended up being too expensive so he reached out to Nasaya & Maro to do a cover which ended up having the perfect blend of upbeat energy but with a bit of melancholy and uncertainness that we really liked. Really glad you liked it too! All the music elevated the film so much.
I came to reddit for this comment lol. I couldn't find it on Shazam
unreleased rendition of The bells of st Marys by Nasaya & Maro. Here's a link https://on.soundcloud.com/HLi4mDtDvL7UFigp6
I’ll try to post. Justin Henning the DP developed the look before shooting. Shot all on one lens - 35mm Prime. Then grained up and finessed in color. Glad you liked it!!
I will def put a request into the team to see if and when it will be released :) It might be a band question though. Their name is Nasaya & Maro
Here's a link to the song on soundcloud. They haven't officially released this version yet, but it's the audio straight from the end credits. https://soundcloud.com/blonde-hills/nasaya-maro-the-bells-of-st-marys-your-lucky-day?si=c5a7b778502f45a898f5e95957537dbd&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing
Capitalism wins.
Yeah, Angus. So heartbreaking. He was the genuine real deal and could have had a big future.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*SPOILERS \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

>!We had an alternate moment edited for his death that was a very clear death, and didn't leave anything to the imagination, but after he passed we just didn't feel it was in good taste anymore. I'm sure the audience wouldn't have known anything but for us it made a difference. And we do show his body, both in the security cam and at the end when Ana crawls over to him for the ticket. But thats it....!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*END SPOILERS \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Thanks for watching it! RIP Angus ❤️
Was it a body double? Why wouldn’t they show his body?
We’ve gotten that comparison a lot. They’ve done a great job of cornering the ‘nervously uncomfortable’ market 😅. But honestly it’s a huge compliment, their films are great!
That’s a good question. But if you watch that part again you’ll see he ‘stops’ the recording. Not starts it.
Thank you!
That moment was always meant to be a pretty hard stop. Take your breath away and make you lean in. There was an alternate edit, which I talked about in another comment, for that scene that adjusted after he passed in real life. But his character was always supposed to depart when he does.

This work?
You need to bug the artist! They have not released it yet I don’t think.
Anything that might be going on in a characters head that isn’t explained explicitly in the film is just meant to be interpreted by each individual. For this specific instance there was no clear motivation other than to make sure she was dead, as to why he is so cruel… I always thought it was payback for what they all did to his son… but that was me. Maybe he just hates hands??
I hate to break it to you but everything you didn’t watch would answer most of the questions you bring up with the lottery plot. And 99% of lottery transactions are still done in cash so it’s not really traceable other than having a ticket and what store you got the ticket from. But thanks for giving it a chance!
Quickly. The director Daniel Brown started the casting process in the beginning of November 2021 and first day of shooting was December 1st. Thankfully he had Jessica Sherman, the casting director, who liked to the script enough to help him. Angus was great as we all know but unproven as a lead at that point. This was before season 2 of euphoria so there was a question on how he would do with a really limited and fast production schedule. That said we all recognized how special he was and it was clear very quickly he was the guy. And then Jessica Garza was another amazing find. And her performance speaks for itself. She absolutely kills 🔨🫣  And as for the rest of the cast it came down to Dan and Jessica having really good instincts and taste. I will say I pushed for Jason O’Mara. I had seen him in tv shows before and really liked him. I think he really nailed the unhinged coldness that his character needed.
Don’t underestimate pregnant ladies. If this movie has taught you anything. 😂🔨
Yeah she was no normal pregnant woman she came up with the whole story herself and her bf and the robber were impressed. Something tells me she’s been in this situation before
My answer is, the baby survived in the script.

I went on a hunt for it after watching it a few months back. The best I could find is this rip on YouTube and a cleaner cut version on SoundCloud that's since been removed:



["The Bells of St.Mary's" – Nasaya and Maro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd91POT_NOU)

  
I have a few other previously saved songs from Nasaya that I like that vary quite a bit from the style of the one above:

[https://open.spotify.com/track/38JU2MaP2YlWfj9tPbEQ46?si=a7d076c684714b33](https://open.spotify.com/track/38JU2MaP2YlWfj9tPbEQ46?si=a7d076c684714b33)

What about the ending?
Thank you! 🙏🏼
Many many many thanks!! Really appreciate it!
Oh damn! From your Reddit comment to some studio execs eyes. 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼

BUT… that said. I don’t know if it needs it. Some stories are just good with an open ending. Makes room for the imagination
I think he gets out because he sees an opportunity to be a good guy and a hero. When he leaves Ana Marlene he’s definitely not 100% confident.

Did you ever find out? I'm in that same boat now and coming up empty lol
It’s still up. Depends on your country tho
You could have finished it with as long as it took you to write this novel of a review. Also the movie answers most of your questions after the first 22. Sorry the movie sucks though. We will do better. Or maybe not. But I’m glad we gave you something to hate, otherwise it would be hard to know what you really love. So we gave you some perspective.

Your comment had as many plot twists as our movie! So thank you and congrats!
Can you dm me the question lol
WELL since you asked (only because my fiance’s a sound editor and appreciates feedback 🤣😉☺️ )

Only thing that comes to mind: I’m personally sensitive when dialogue volume changes during conversation. I noticed once the volume abruptly jumped between characters. But I’m honestly sure if I watched it again I wouldn’t even notice though haha

I love it’s technically a Christmas movie. And that you saved the baby (miracle as it may have been.)

Thanks for the background!  Great flic!  Simple, effective , and characters making rational choices throughout. You all crushed it!
I just want to revive this old thread and commend you on such an amazing script. I'm a DP/Dir based in Australia, and movies like this give me hope that one day I can pull on board as many favours and collaborators as possible to get a feature film made. well done! Looking forward to seeing both of your next collaboration in due time
Best movie I’ve seen in a long time. Great acting, and the over all quality of the movie was very good. Great work! 
You're amazing. Thanks for the reply.
Sometimes I have to sit down and tell myself, you guys are normal people too. I just see people like you just on a different category, but again, you guys are normal people too. So actually it's really cool to be able to talk to you/get a reply from someone like you. Had a conversation at work about this movie today, no lie, with my coworkers and each of then loved the film. I told them it was actually made on a budget and they couldn't tell either. You've been praised for it before, but, I'll echo it in. The editing. Flipping amazing!

Question just popped in my head though. You don't have to answer—did you go to school to learn how to edit or was this something you picked up/fell in love with and just got really good at it?

I think for someone to be able to go to work and do a job that they love. Is amazing. I'm in IT and I feel almost that way. 😅

If you made youtube blogs. Man I can only imagine what those would look like with your skills.
Hey, great minds think alike.
Alright let’s dive in. If he had just grabbed the ticket and split then there would be a bunch of witnesses that saw him steal it if he tried to cash it. And the ticket is not TIED to the store. 99% of lotto tickets are paid for in cash. So there is a high possibility there is no record of it being sold. And the rest of the associated crimes are talked about and worked out by the characters to cover up what happened.
It’s kinda wild that the movie answers all of these questions yet you’re saying it’s horrendous
At least Rick was part of a better production than the monstrosity I watched 🤷
It’s honestly specifically the writing somebody should’ve challenged the writer directly (maybe even you) to make a lot of the decisions more believable. Maybe with less cliché tropes as well skipping the Dad and his friends gearing up like it was John Wick three would’ve done a lot to the believability of the story as well. At the end of the day these guys are just deadbeat cops, why do they have enough artillery to go to war?
Angus not willing to shot people threatening his life and belongings only to shoot and kill a cop and threaten to kill others was an inconsistency in character as well. The filming and editing was decent I feel like the set captured the mood well personally. Casting was good too although I think angus looks too much like Mac Miller to focus on the movie not being about Mac killing a dude to get more rich. 

      All in all I think you guys did good with the resources had available, the tone was set for the movie well. It had a bit of a budget Tarantino feel to it just couldn’t deliver that hard on the twist. I feel as if it could have benefited if the story made more sense from the get go. Explain some about the cop on patrol and who his family is and further the wrong place wrong time trope that was hit but for the whole film. The final scene would have been more powerful IMO as well this way.
I completely agree, the music really set each scene into their own, Matt Hutchinson was a great choice. I was curious if you ever released the cover of the song anywhere? I already have the entire playlist for the movie on Spotify but I could not find the cover anywhere, so was it never publicly released?
Thanks! At least I have the name of the band now! That’s helpful :)
Edited my post with a spoiler tag. Forgot this wasn’t a spoiler discussion! But you’re right! You all did a great job.
Hi! Just curious as to what the ending was with the dog looking at that car? Thank you!
thank you! You must be proud of your baby!
unreleased rendition of the song The Bells of St. Mary's by Nasaya & Maro. Here's a soundcloud link: https://on.soundcloud.com/HLi4mDtDvL7UFigp6
And pregnant bellys? Lol. Thank you for your reply. I was very thankful the movie ended with the baby alive. It was interesting how they went in there already assuming that the hostages had been compromised but I do think in the real world there's a chance someone could be locked in a room somewhere and not be told anything other than hearing the gunshots and still be innocent so to me it shows farther cruelty that they would just come in there knowing they are going to kill everyone without giving them a chance to explain.
You are right, I should have watched the whole thing. Thanks maybe I'll actually watch it 😂
I just watched and it was great. Sorry Im a itdot 
They didn’t deserve that money 
No I never did, seems like it’s still unreleased
i seriously can't remember what my question was- i have to try to think of it and then i will message you
Damn it where were you when we were mixing?? Haha 
The feedback is more than welcome. 

It's funny and not funny cause we are lucky for the sound to be even as good as it is. Lucky by way of the mixer Roland Vajs. We spend only two weeks with him mixing the entire film. And that is not enough time.
I'm sure you can imagine. The only reason it's as good as it is now is because we were clear about what we wanted and Roland is as pro as it gets.

And as for the Christmas baby. Trust me that wasn’t by chance. 🎅🏼👶🏽
Cheers mate! You should join reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue
TY. 🙏🏻😀
All your notes are great... BUT, the movie is already out in the world. We made peace with it all and are moving on to what ever we can do next, with all that we learned during the process. And a PERFECT film is a hard target, but doesn't stop us from trying. It seems like you're into filmmaking or maybe a filmmaker yourself. Put some of that story brain into your own script and if you have already send it to me! I'd love to read it. All we can do is make and keep moving. Gotta make that living too and hopefully no ONE project will be the aggregate of your career.
I know Matt (who is amazing) released the OST but I don't know if some of the licensed tracks got released unless by the artists separately.... thats a good question

Personally I took that “assumption” as more of a justification for going in there guns a blazing. Kinda like a “hey let’s just tell ourselves this so we don’t feel bad” 

OP, this was an amazing movie with amazing editing! Especially for one I randomly picked on Netflix tonight ha. Did a great job of making you empathize with each character and think about how small injustices really add up
I thought the same thing at first, they’l catch him when he goes to cash it but then saw the rest of the film and actually liked it
Well that sucks lol. I thought it was weird that two different apps couldn't figure out the song.
Two weeks is all to mix?? Hella props to Roland Vajs and the whole team!! You ALL deserve a standing applause 👏☺️ Thanks for helping make it so we can enjoy it!
If I could give you a Reddit gold for that reply I would.
Do you ever feel weird or a bit creepy because of how intimately you know an actor's face from editing, even though they have no idea you exist?
It has happened to me a couple of times that I encounter an actor in public and feel like I want to say hi, then remember its all one sided and they have no idea I exist. (Obviously with non famous actors).

It's like, I know every muscle of their face. I analyze them for hours and hours. Zooming in, zooming out. Listening, paying attention.

I know this is not something deep or anything, but I think its still fun to discuss this with fellow editors :)

Do you ever feel weird about it? Any thoughts or interesting experiences? I'd love to hear from you!
Feels even weirder when you’re a documentary editor! Lot of vulnerable moments
Yeah film premieres can be odd. 

Actor: Hey you’re the editor? Great job! So glad to finally meet you!

Editor: Yeah you too! Hope you get that weird mole on your arm that you kept picking at checked out soon. Also how’s that foundation repair on your house going? You know the one you called and checked every break while you were still mic’d?
Face? I work in reality tv. Some shows I’ve worked on, I’ve seen the entire cast having sex. You just don’t mention it at the after party.
So story time.  I made trailers for the Tomb Raider 2013 video game starring the voice talent of Camilla Luddington. And we were leaning into this one scene where Lara Croft is ice climbing up a sheer cliff face and there’s an avalanche. 

So we are cutting the trailer and we realize we need effort sounds for Lara Croft whacking her ice axe in and getting battered about by the avalanche. 

So the studio sends me what must have been the entire library of Camilla Luddington grunting, softly crying, moaning and yelping. I’m talking 100 sound files. 

Just… me and Camilla, in the edit bay, making selects, looking for that perfect grunt.
Not actors, but I've met folks before after having edited hours and hours of footage of them. I always need to remind myself to reel back my sense of familiarity with them.

Sometimes, if they're especially savvy to the process, I'll tell them that I might seem overly familiar because I've edited footage of them, and they catch on just fine.
Yeah, sometimes I’ll see someone I edited in public and have to hold myself back from going “I edited a video with you in it!”

I also find myself making the same expressions as the talent lol, if they are laughing I will have a smile on my face.
I worked on a show where a producer guest starred in one episode. So not only were we cutting his scenes, he was sitting in the edit bay for hours on end, and naturally I was pretty familiar with the sound of his voice.  

Months later I was watching an old episode of the X-Files and a scene came on where a character is breathing heavily off screen. Just from his breathing sounds I recognized my producer, and before I knew it, there he was on screen, some 20 years younger. Super weird!  

From experience, people don't often take too well to hearing that you feel like you know them intimately because you spent hours editing them :')
I had a similar moment. I cut a couples wedding but didn't film the event. Saw them on the street and said hello and they were nice but it wasn't until I was walking away I realised they would have absolutely no idea who I was haha
Yeah, I edit a show about a baseball team. Finally met all the players and coaches in person about a year into the project. I knew all their hopes and dreams, their inside jokes, etc. It was very weird for them to introduce themselves since I felt like I already knew them.
I feel trusted, almost like a doctor,  but I am worried about the freaks out there. I have seen nudity on more than one occasion and know that I can be trusted with these images that the actors and actresses have trusted me with, but what if they were in someone else’s hands on their editing timeline? Those are usually the first thoughts that enter my mind. I love our craft and on occasion have reached out to actors I have never met before to say things like “you have no idea how easy you’ve made my job” - just to have some sort of connection to someone I’ve been so connected to through the job we do.
I actually had a very big name actor freak out and not want to talk to me because he knew I was editing his movie and he was insanely creeped out by it. 

He specifically avoided editors for the reasons you’re stating. 
100%! I’ve had so many moments where I instinctively think I’ve spotted a friend, and kind of give them a look of recognition, only to quickly wind it back as I realise I actually don’t know them at all. I must seem insane…
Lol this thread came right in time.. 

I just came across a bunch of stock footage in Artlist of a girl who was in MY first ever music video when I was a wannabe artist 12 years ago; as in she acted in the video (one epic part was she lay across a white grand piano while I played it lol).

Fast forward 12 years later and here I am finding stock footage of her jogging in parks, industrial estates and looking at panoramic views of cities. I wouldn't say it's creepy as such, but more of a Black Mirror type of vibe.. kind of like how we converged again after all these years but under different circumstances, where I can now download her likeness (for several pennies or however much the royalties pay out) without her ever knowing of me again.
Colorist who does beauty work - yes.  “Hi, I smoothed out every pore on your face for tens of hours and contributed to the impossible beauty standards women (and men) face in society because a creative director was certain you’d want look “younger””.    It’s a great opener lol. /s
I’ve cut shows with celebs but, as you say yourself, that is different.  

With the less famous presenters, if I work on something long-term, these not-very-famous-people-at-all loom increasingly larger in my mind, so that meeting them at WRAP parties etc can feel like meeting Taylor Swift or someone, lol!

Amusing anecdote; I worked on a big car scrapping series once, with a team of five other editors (we made 3 ‘hours’ each, or something).
Me and a couple of the guys were sitting in a line in a pub, at the closing party, when we found ourselves opposite one of the mechanics featured in the show. We all behaved so oddly, waving hi, and trying to attract his attention (we’d had a few by this time) that, in the end he just leaned over and said…

“You’re the *editors* on this, aren’t you?”
This gets brought up at every premiere or cast/crew screening.  

Recently, I was at a premiere party, and had to find an actress to tell her that it was such a pleasure to edit her scenes.  She was a true pro.  She said that was just about the best compliment she could get.  

It’s also weird seeing cast in another show, and feeling like you’re seeing an old friend.  Sometimes I wonder how they got a big role.  Then I remember, we make them look their best.
100%. The people I make videos about are not famous, but I still have to stop myself from saying hi to them because I forget we didn't actually work together.
This has happened to me MANY times.
I directed & edited a longish short film, which went to be included in an anthology feature. I took forever to assemble. Seeing my main actress, I’d worked with her for a couple of weekends on set, and 3 years on my screen. Incredibly odd parasocial relationship.
I relate, we have to stare at the same images over and over and it does get ingrained. I have never felt creepier than when I was in a Sephora in LA and an employee who’d been in their holiday campaign I had cut the year before came out of nowhere asking if I needed assistance. Instead of explaining this to the very beautiful woman, I just stood there not speaking and staring at her blankly with my mouth in a weird oh face till she smiled and said she’d let me enjoy browsing. Then my dumb ass followed her around the store awhile because I couldn’t believe it was her (all while never saying a thing because I was in shock)- she’d been our favorite in the ad because we couldn’t believe she was a real employee her performance was so good.
When I started my career I found work cutting wedding videos on the side. I remember one of them featured a singer, who appeared to be friends with the groom. He seemed to be an amateur, as in, he wasn't a singer by trade, but could sing. He sang a few numbers, all of which were cut into the longer video. There were a few angles, so I spent a decent amount of time on those segments.

I saw the dude a year later at an event. It was bizarre. It honestly shook me more than some actual celebrity sightings I've been privy to.
I worked on a piece of crap show for Fox Nation last year with some high profile older actors. One of the was a total asshole to the makeup crew. Never will I look at them in the same light again. That’s weird I suppose.
My problem is I become too familiar with their face and how their mouth moves frame by frame that I stare at their mouths when I meet them irl
Wow, i really love hearing all these stories, i work as an offline and online editor, whenever i see some talent/actor in real life it felt weird that i used to spend hours touching-up their skin or even replacing their teeth because the client didn’t like the way her teeth look when she smile.
At the wrap party:

"Hi, you don't know me but I sit in a dark room watching you for hours"
When I was editing my first feature, I ran into the lead actor outside a theater.  I greeted them enthusiastically, only remembering much later that they had no goddamn idea who I am.  In my defense, I was pretty high.
Yes it’s a very common experience when an editor meets a cast member after the editing process. Happened to me several times.
Yes it happens to me constantly especially when working on long interviews. I know wayyy to much about people who don't even know I exist lmfao
yes. I used to edit weddings and it was so weird spending a week with them, seeing their sisters-brothers-parents cry and seeing their first looks and just getting to know them through all these really intimate, vulnerable moments. And then when they physically came to get their USB or DVD I'd have to stop myself being like "Omg, hows your grandma?" when i wasn't even at the wedding and they have no idea who I am.
I haven’t noticed this with editing, but whenever I DP, I’m often flattering how the actors look. I usually start noticing the nuanced beauty in how actresses look since I’m staring at them on set through a monitor a lot of the time, making sure the light falls off their face the way that i want. I wouldn’t say that i feel creepy though, especially since I introduce myself to them and crack jokes on set that make everyone laugh. I’m just another person in the crowd
All artists are perverts of some sort or another, and all people are voyeurs -- that's why we like films in the first place. Embrace your odd side, it's good :)
When I see a person in real life that I’ve been editing, I usually get excited and think, “SWEET, I’m seeing new content that isn’t the same shots I’ve been looking at for weeks over and over again!!! This is great!” 

Seriously though, watching a persons details closely on a screen and noticing how they emphasize words, their mannerisms, and everything about them almost feels more intimate than sex.
I work in a restaurant. There was a regular at the bar who would come and chat with the bartender about this movie he had produced 10 years previous, but they never finished post. The bartender finally told him he could edit it. The guy took him up on the offer. The bartender asked me to help with some VFX and putting a trailer together. Near the end of this process one of the stars came in to eat. I initially wanted to run over to her and talk to her about her performance and her life and how exciting it was that this movie was finally going to be released. Luckily I caught myself and realized she doesn’t know me, I don’t actually know her, and she probably gave up on this terrible movie ever seeing the light of day years ago.

More recently I was editing a trailer for a short film with another regular who I know pretty well and have worked with on various things in the past. Even actually knowing him I had to remind myself that he hasn’t been hanging out with me as much as I’ve been hanging out with him.
I embarrassed myself on my first wrap show as assistant editor by getting a little razzled, spotting one of the talent and going “hey, I see you everyday”. They’d never met me, hadn’t known about me, and it just looked like I was the creepiest fan ever haha.
All the time. And then when you meet them it’s really awkward.
I was working on a docuseries that featured one cornerstone interview in every episode. Six months after it wrapped, I'm at a comic con with my kids, and I hear a familiar voice wafting through the convention hall. Turns out, he's on stage nearby, participating in a panel about the same exact topic I was editing. Very strange feeling.
In film theory there is an idea that filming is voyeuristic and predatory by nature. Hitchcock was a good example.
I think about this idea all the time. I was editing a movie my friend directed and acted in, but he lives in Hawaii so I only see him like twice a year. But in editing this, I felt like I was spending every day for like a month with him. 
As a band photographer, I have said this to a musician I have shot a bunch, but never actually met until I decided to tell him I feel like I know him from editing. He didn't seem to take it well. I'll keep those feelings to myself now.
yeeeeaaaah I might have gone up to an actor (or three) at an after party and started with the words "nice to see you again" only to realise instantly they have never met me before.... definitely adding to the creepy....
I’ve worked with Will Arnett so many times and he’s never seen my face. 😁
Oh yeah. I used to edit videos for Radio Disney. Really upped the creepy feeling because they were all teenage stars I watched grow up from my edit bay. Then I’d meet them in real life and feel this intimate connection to their lives, but they don’t know me at all. Very strange feeling.
I was at a screening for a short film I’d edited when I ran into the lead actress. I said hello and chatted for about half a minute before I realized we’d never met in person.
Yes! I have made the mistake of saying hi to some actors in the momentary belief I knew them from school or something (because I was so intimate with their faces for months.)
I cut a few episodes of a web show for BET, and felt like I knew the hosts after a while. 

Like over the course of a few months I see them getting set up for the interview and see how they are when they aren’t fully “on,” and learn their idiosyncrasies and how you’ll likely have to cut for them (one host always had interesting facial expressions that made for great reaction shots for example). I guess it’s natural to feel like you know them. 

It might be a little awkward to bring up in the wrong way, but it’d be cool to actually meet them at some point
I've said "Hi!" to people I've stared at for hundreds of hours and then am startled when they don't react like I'm a family member. Then I remember. I don't actually know them.
This happened to me once with a student film (but an older, non-student actor) and I actually greeted the actor as if I knew her before I realized she wouldn’t know me. She was so confused, but then was extremely flattered, because being not famous she never got recognized. I think it was a really nice moment for her.
Living in a town with a small film community, I would often run into actors I’d edited at parties and other friends’ premieres. Usually they were talking to someone I know so it wasn’t super awkward. But always had to remind myself we’d never met when I see the look of unfamiliarity in their eyes.

On a similar note, it was always interesting being at parties and realizing people who had both worked on many of the same projects had never met. Usually other people in post and actors or crew. I once introduced an actor and composer who had probably five shared credits.
I once worked on an extensive ad campaign where the majority of footage was a few actors doing improv that went way off script.  I got to know them so well through the many hours of (hilarious) riffing, and running footage. The next week, one of the actors was playing on my team in a night league (friend of a friend apparently). Anyway, I was talking to him like we were old acquaintances  the entire night, starting with “Hey good to see you again”.  Eventually it clicked where I knew him from, and that he guy never seen me before. I tried to explain my weirdness after I realized my error, but then it felt even more awkward.
all the time. but i never meet them in the real world. i also have Borderline personality disorder which complicates a lot of things
I have, but I mainly edit archive footage, so most of the time these people are either dead, or really old, meaning there's a very slim chance I'd ever meet them in person. But yeah, it is an awkward perspective to some degree.
As an editor going through a lonely period of their life, I find this one way intimacy pretty cruel. It’s not just actors, directors/writers too.
That's why when I meet them I make sure to get a good sniff in as well to complete the circle of being a sick fuck
I used to work on a weekly segment for a show, always with the same presenter and I mostly worked remotely. 


I was in studio once and saw the presenter and we just started chatting - I completely forgot that we'd never actually met and she was very confused. I had to sheepishly explain I edited that segment and forgot we'd never actually met. 
It was during the pandemic too, so she actually was one of the only few faces I actually saw in a week! 


We ended up getting on quite well though, so that was nice! 
Big time. Especially when you also interact with them on occasion.
Yes!!! My first gigs were weddings and more than once I would see a bride or groom out in the world and go “hey it’s insert name here!” But realize they had no idea who I was.
I'm an actor and an editor, I know I exist :)
Have you seen Michael Mann’s “Manhunter” based on the novel “Red Dragon” by Thomas Harris? 

Set in the age of 8mm film, the theme is something along the line you allude to. It includes the first appearance of a certain Hannibal Lecter.

You won’t feel any less weird 😏
Got onto a plane one time and the guy sitting next to me looked super familiar. We chatted for a few minutes and he mentioned that his band was playing the grand old Opry. ‘Oh, that’s why I know you. I just finished editing your set on a different music show.’ whipped out my MacBook and showed him the edit. It was a funny moment.
I spent a few months editing some weddings that a friend of mine shot. There was one couple who had ordered the full package—full videos of the ceremony, toasts, everything. This was my first and only time editing a wedding, so it took me forever. I spent weeks rewatching deeply vulnerable moments as well as occasions where they said and did things that were totally bizarre and, honestly, annoying (they were, y'know, rich kids.) 

My feelings about these people went through a whole evolution. At first they were cute, then they were irritating, and by the end I had spent so much time with them that they lodged themselves deep in my heart. If I ever saw them in person I would feel like an absolute creep. Like I had directed of their version of the Truman Show or something. I would feel like the Elephant Man. Look past my creepy exterior, you finance weirdos, and see how much love I have for you.
No lol. But you should just grab the bull by the horns and say hi I know every inch of your face.
I used to edit a music tv show and went to go see one of the acts that I had been editing. Got to meet the lead singer and told him, “I’ve been staring at your face all week.” He got a really weird look on his face, until I explained I worked for XYZ. Then we talked about the show for a bit and he said “Make me look good!”
Haha.. All the time. They think you are a weird fanboy type or a stalker when you are starstruck after meeting them IRL for the first time.
Yessss! And imagine a nerdy editor sitting behind a desk all day turning around to see that celebrity when I turn around as they were walking around the office for a meet and greet. 

👀 ummmm hiiii - keep me behind the desk in a dungeon and take my stapler.
I was editing a network Christmas special many years ago. Many big country artists singing Christmas standards. One artist decided she wanted to rerecord her entire vocal take as well as all the lead guitar parts. Lead guitar was completely different from the filmed version and the vocals were no where near the live track in terms of sync. Deadline was looming and it took a full day to Frankenstein a cut back together that looked as good as possible sync wise. 
I was internally seething at everyone involved that knew better than to “fix” audio this way so close to broadcast. Anyway wrapped up around 11:30 that night and had to rush to the Kroger before midnight closing to get my dog some food. Standing in line with a huge bag of dog chow and who is right in front of me? Miss celebrity who I was fuming at all day for retracking an entire song. (Phrases here and there both musically and vocally are normal to fix and audio department lets us know what they’ve messed with so we can address it in video. but not the whole friggin song) 
Anyway, I had the thousand mile stare from shifting frames all day, and my brain to mouth filter wasn’t working well. First thing out of my mouth was “you know, I’ve been watching you all day”. She was by herself, and I could see the flash of terror in her eyes before I realized how creepy that sounded. I quickly recovered and explained what I meant. She was cool about it. We talked about the show and my dog. But the odds of the one person I was looking at all day being right in front of me at the grocery store was pretty wild.
Oh, it happened to me many years ago. I was living in NY and had been editing a documentary about drag queens for months. One day, I am walking on the street and I see one of the subjects walking towards me. Without even thinking I go "Hey, (name)!!! How are you!". And immediately I realize he has no idea who I am. I had to explain what was happening and we had a good laugh.
Yes with docs in particular because it’s weird that they are real lol
Yes omg. There was this girl 20 years ago in a music video I was editing and I pretty much fell in love with her while editing the video. She was sultry AF. I would see her occasionally at bars or whatever and had to work really hard not to stare at her. Found a girlfriend and got serious and then engaged and only then learned that the girl in the video had a crush on me the whole time.
Oh yessir. I’ve cut a lot of high-budget shorts and some with big Scandinavian actors. After a couple of beers it’s nearly impossible to remember that they have no idea who I am at the screening haha. Luckily this is something most people understand.
YES. I was working on a project and started feeling like I was going crazy because I thought my neighbor was one of the main characters in my show. I would avoid him at all cost because I genuinely thought I was losing my mind. Turns out he actually is the actor from my show, I introduced myself and now we give each other Christmas gifts!
Yeah, the worst is at wrap parties when you meet them. They have no idea who you are and you know every detail of their facial expressions and mannerisms. 
I've also experienced this as a VFX Compositor.   
Up close removing wig lines, harnesses (many a crotch on screen for long periods) and doing retouching/blemish removal.
Always awkward at the wrap parties.
welcome to the aww nope do not say a thing but nice to meet you and keep up the good work, and thats from porno editors, yes did some special effects for them and i was bug eyed for too longgggg, will not do that again, it does something to you and how you look at that actress or wanna laugh at the actor like really your barking at what you got??? dud shorty at the gym has you beat, you see what  i mean, its a keep your mouth shut and do your best for them in your work edits, and next time they ask for special efffects? i am too busy ,but bubba can do it...
"Nice to meet you, I know every single detail of your life including what everyone is saying about you behind your back as well as all your verbal and facial ticks and I have diagnosed you with a few psychological conditions, nothing to really worry about though. it was a pleasure to edit this film"
I’m editing a doc right now that’s about a guy with a mental disability and I’ve spent months watching interviews with him and his family/friends…and I’ve thought about how weird it is that I know so much about their personal life and they don’t even know who I am. If I met them in-person it would feel like we’re already friends. 
Yup, for a while I didn't know how to approach them the first time I met them. But now I always ask the director to introduce me first, and that breaks the ice nicely for me.
THIS! Been working a doc for a year and I’m so excited to meet the subject bc I know so much about her. But I also know that doesn’t know me at all and will be way less excited to meet me than I am to meet her.
100%
💀
Honestly that’s on Sound for not cutting when called for.
Like one of those Love Island type shows? They just go at it knowing there's cameras everywhere ?
Wait... the entire cast together? Like a big orgy? Think of the ratings!!
Okay that’s pretty funny.
Yup that sounds about right 😂 I kinda bounce between being laughing at how silly it is and being focused/desensitized to it.
Animation can be that way too. We need a lot of random efforts since there is no on set action. 

One show I was on Paget Brewster had to record a ton of efforts for a fight scene. John DiMaggio was on deck to record once she was done & heard the whole thing. Once we got in the booth he told the engineer to record & did a whole Barry White impression ad libbed type song in response to what he just heard. Allegedly they were gonna play it for her at her next record session (she was a darn good sport) but I never heard of they did or not. It was a funny song but pretty awkward to hear after chopping up her efforts.
Oh man, I have done this so much, acting like I am super familiar with the person and watching the look of confusion and discomfort on their face as I realise WE HAVE NEVER MET EVEN ONCE.
This happens to me all the time.

And not just with like CEOs or athletes or documentary participants either. I’m talking the time I went to a wedding recently where like half of my high school graduating class, most of whom I’ve not seen in almost 20 years, was in attendance. I felt so weird because I knew a lot of the people’s wives and husbands from their faces on social media. 

I find the latter a little creepier because they are essentially nobody and I knew some of them on sight.
Def gonna use this one
That happened to me putting together a slideshow for a coworker's son's wedding rehearsal. The son and his fiancé were roughly the same age as me and all their pictures growing up looked *just* like those of me and my sister. 

By the time I got done, I felt like we'd grown up together and were friends... it was *really* weird meeting them in person for the first time and reminding myself that they didn't know me at all, even though it felt like I knew them inside out.
I do the smile thing all the time. I catch myself and feel weird.
Last year I worked on some promo for a group of podcasters. I went and shot some footage for about 1-2 hours and then edited a bunch of promo videos based on that. A few months later, their producer wanted to try some other type of video content and sent me a link to a folder. They forgot to give me access, so I sent a permission request.

I was then added to this email chain and one of the podcast hosts was the owner of the folder. I thought it would be an automatic approval since I worked with them before and we were all familiar with each other. Instead, the podcast host replies something like, “there’s this guy who wants to access our folder - who is he?” And then it hit me that I was just familiar with them because of how much time I spent looking at their faces and interactions on the edit, but they just met me for an hour or two a few months back. Weird feeling.
I sometimes think about The Jinx and how they found that bit of cinema gold from listening to him while he went to the bathroom….. I respectfully skip ahead when people are going to the bathroom with their lav on but I’m sure there’s plenty of editors that listen and goddamn did it pay off
Name names! He doesn’t want to talk to you anyway
ME TOO!!!! I’m actually writing a short film about this that’s why I wanted to hear y’alls opinions
Me too!! It feels so weird editing myself, I get to sick of myself haha
I'm usually up front with it, "So, I'm in this weird situation where I know too much about you, so sorry if I'm too familiar I don't mean to be"
Well hopefully it wasn't Toddlers in Tiaras.
I'm sure that those people start with a pretty voyeuristic expectation of what's to be seen. I mean if they're putting themselves on "Farmer wants a wife" or something like that they probably don't care much.
lmao I cant possibly imagine thats the case.... or is it?
Like that, yeah.
Believe it or not, the networks want to protect their image as wholesome and family friendly while also cultivating their own “stars” so they won’t show orgies.
I went to a home auction and the real estate agent of a video I edited was facilitating.
It is
I've worked on some reality and there was one sexual moment that made air. It was mostly just "cuddling" under a blanket the internet insisted someone was getting a hand job, and they all turned rabid against the girl (but didn't seem to say anything about the guy). I totally get why shows want to keep things clean.
Mac mini power button
Found this on twitter. An easiest way to press the power button with a 3D print and some ideas.
Being sold by Belkin for 45€ in 3... 2... 1...
I, personally, think an easier way would be to, oh I don’t know, just put my finger where the power button is and then press the button. But that’s just me!
I Love the Internet.
I have a MacBook Air and barely use my power button at all. This will never be necessary.
At least the ac socket isn’t on the bottom
Idk who uses the power button so much that they need that. I find the change to be better because I find myself almost pressing the button trying to unplug something or moving it. But you know that no matter what they did, someone will complain about something that doesn’t matter.
Hey at least you can use it while it's plugged in lmao
How many times are we turning out Mac minis on and off? Mines been on for a year
It's just a joke that this has to exist. On the other hand, I only ~~turn off~~ **restart** my MacMini for OS updates.
Sounds like under desk mounting just makes even more sense now.  Maybe they will sell a remote for it
so you telling me, that a trillion dollar company decided to place the power button on the bottom?

but sure "innovation"
All these people saying they never turn off their computers lol. Why have a power button at all then
It's 2024. I won't buy a computer that I have to lift up to turn it on. What's wrong with these guys at Apple??
Apples bottom power concept is so dumb.

  
They didn't learn from the mouse screw up so they had to do it again.

  
idiots.
Enable wake on LAN, install a wake app on your phone. Easy peasy if you don't want to be bothered with the power button.
literaly, how often do you really turn mac mini off? Most of the people just logout and leave it running.
This is like the 3rd power-button-access design I've seen for this thing, and it's not even out yet. 

  
Apple really doubling down on the whole magic mouse thing, huh?
What a solution for a non-issue!
it's called over engineered
Remember that some opted to modify the Apple Magic Keyboard to maintain the TouchID functionality. Going as far as to put the extracted key/chip under the desk.

It also serves as the power button, no?
https://i.redd.it/y6kcumzrf4yd1.gif
Why not simply... Flip it?
And the market provides.
Make it look cuter and it’ll SELLLL
Just put a marble under the power button, rock the case back slightly with a push.
Gonna be a world of people using “ Old Tech” real quick with all this nonsense.
If only Apple had this level of ingenuity maybe they could figure out a way to put the fucking button on the top.
Yeah but that's supposed to be apples job
Why isn't the button on top or the side like normal ass computers or electronic devices tho
Woulda been cool to just make the Apple logo on top the power button, but noo
Goes to prove nerds have never slipped their fingers into a slot and reached upward to turn something on. Just saying.
I have a 2011 Mac mini.  The only two times I have ever used the power button were in 2011 when it arrived and in 2019 when I moved.  I’m moving again in 2 months.  Looking forward to looking up where the damn button is again.
Yall dont have regular fingers??? There is far enough space to press it with your index while pinching the Mac with the thumb.
Thinking of even making this is more exhausting than actually pressing the button.
I do not fucking understand why the uproar. Because its a social media trend?? But really though. Because its trendy. How many fucking times are you actually turning it on and off via the *power button". I frequently enough that I love maintaining the classic Apple aesthetic. I cab't stand hearing people whining about it.

Yes, the memes ARE kinda funny. But still
Apple cult will defend the button placement
Hear me, hear me now.

Put it ass-side up
I’d like to thank Apple for making it obvious who uses a power button, so I can check whether I have their fax number and fax them to ask if they’re running low on typewriter ribbons
Just 499 from you ever loving and innovating Apple!
Or, just use your finger to make approximately the same shape, and push the button.
I am baffled by the fact that apparently people turn off their Mac Minis. Mine has been powered on since 2020.
This is how I see the datacenter implementations functioning.
I'd turn mac upside down and put little rubber feet on it. My fingers are too big to fit in that gap. Doesnt matter anyway, I havent bought any apple stuff since they removed headphone jack.
This is a nonissue, and this is a solution looking for a problem
This is so dumb. It's no more difficult to press this power button than it is to press the ones on the last 14 years of Mac minis.
April is so far away
Big, if true!
I was hoping to make/print a mount for under my standing desk...
Edging Mac mini before GTA 6
Available in the Apple store, for only $199
Great. Another adapter we will have to buy.
this is the definition of modern problems needing modern solutions
can’t wait to see these on Etsy for $40
I'm guessing it was inevitable but the first time I saw this Mac I thought of this 3D printed gadget too.
What's next? Mac mouse charging stand that still let's you use the mouse?
I don’t even have one of these computers, but I’ve got to updoot this for awesomeness.
This reminds me of how awkward (but totally awesome looking) the G4 Cube was about twenty years back. I seem to recall that being a design where turning the device on could be difficult.
Imagine having to make something separate just to turn the thing on and off
Jony Ives: “I approve this reluctantly”
The apple version will cost $79.99 and won't work with the next model because the made the button a fingerprint sensor.
I need this for my Gigabyte KVM monitor
r/functionalprint has your interest
I had a iOs dev in office who didn’t had a MacBook due to lack of funds. He used to carry mac mini everyday in his laptop bag. He would get bothered by this.
You’re a genius!
Look what they have to do to mimic a fraction of our power.
I swear they did it for the memes. It worked.
Nice idea! ;)
Apple is incredibly professional at weird shit
I use a Mac regularly, own and use about 7 Mac Minis going back as far as 2009 (no joke), and also use the power button often on both my desktop and laptop Macs. This is so clearly a downgrade from having the button on the back that I can’t believe anyone is defending it. Even if you don’t use it personally, you should not be defending Apple’s boneheaded decision on this. This is the same sort of stupidity that they continue to pull with the Magic Mouse and its bottom-mounted charging port. I love Apple but they do make stupid decisions sometimes.
Yall know that you can click the little apple icon in the corner and hit shutdown, right?

I shutdown my computer like twice a year. It's not 1999. Shit is robust now.
Yo…. Can I get the STL? I need this
I might just put mine on a wooden coaster type deal to give it a few inches of clearance as a power button user.
It’s in a better location than the one on my 2013 Mac Pro. If the power button location is really that big of an issue … go to Home Depot, get some self stick rubber feet, put them on the right side of the mini, and make that the new bottom. This really isn’t a big deal.
Why putting power button at the bottom when they can just put at the top or front for conveniency, its not like people will keep staring at mac mini all the time just because of aesthetics, they just want to power on their computers!
I have m1 mini, left it on for almost a year before i have to turn it off.
radical idea here... hear me out, i know its gonna sound crazy but...
 
flip. it. over.
Just lift the goddamn thing.
J
But why?
wat 🤨
It’s a shame the new Mac mini weighs 75 pounds so lifting a little is very difficult one handed.
smart plug, end of.
why is this placement such a problem? No one really shuts these down and you wake it by hitting the keyboard.. And fwiw, I've seen a ton of AIO PCs with the power switch somewhere totally hidden and unintuitive.
My cat routinely walks across my computer’s power button, so this change helps
Squishy foam pad underneath the box, and an adhesive half-round rubber foot under the button. Push down on the corner to actuate.
lol the internet is undefeated
Hear me out for an alternative: wedge a marble in between the table and button - your whole mac is now your power switch! Stability be damned

Thank me later
People turn off their computers?
Just use your thumb to push up, jeez
Much better if you ask me : https://x.com/merocle/status/1851583379621228806?s=46&t=OpdKgo_ErGR32V8aLQnuqg
Hear me out…they could’ve made the apple logo the power button
Top tier satire, I hope.
Why would anyone want to power down the mini?
Give credits!!!
People who need this are the same people who unplug their TV when not using it…
Just a doubt : so i used to have 1 power switch below my desk, to which laptop and monitor used to be connected ( laptop lid off vertical stand )

So I don't use to shut down just used to press that button directly turn off...with Ubuntu faced no issues...

Now I have ordered mac mini and thus m4 one ..
So do I have need to shut down always or turn off that button or can I just press power off from switch ?
This is how you perpetuate a flaw.
Better put a metal piece below and just press the mac itself on the edge lol
But genuinely who turns off their computers. I actually don’t think I’ve turned off my phone or computers or even game consoles once since I’ve bought them excluding software updates
Once God gave me a very useful 3D printed tool himself. It's called a hand on the homeplanet of Homo sapiens
that's pretty smart ngl
$999
Maybe they invent rolls like for the standing mac and so you have a portable mac mini.
Wow, a solution for a non-issue
Should find a way to do it with lego
Do apple think people are stupid why did they change the power button location ? Or do they want to irritate us or they think they can do anything whatever they want and people will follow them ? Are they want us to forget apple products and buy other pc
How lazy are you? Well, let me show you:
Hear me out

Meh, I´m waiting for the Pro Version
Only $199.99. It is the best accessory we have ever made and we’re so proud.
Jokes on you I never turn my Mac on!
Dude, ENOUGH. 

The Touch ID on Magic Keyboard IS the power button. 

Just bite the bullet and buy it. It’s not that expensive.
It takes more effort to whine about the button placement online than it will take to actually hit the button. SMDH.
Ok I don’t really get the whole thing about this button. I got the previous Mac mini last year. I think I’ve pressed the power button like..  five times in that year? Surely this can’t be such a huge issue?
Pure cost cutting measure. It’s in the spot that uses the least amount of wiring it can.

Edit: never mind, I thought the power cable was on that side, like my 2018 mini. Maybe the power for all the ports flows through this wire.
this is so smart
Spend over an hour printing this to push the power button once? No thanks. 

I’ve had a Mac Studio for a year and I’ve all but forgotten which side the power button is even on.
are you all serious right now or is this genuinely a problem that some people have
I feel like if there's enough room to put a thingamajig in there then your finger tip has enough room too? I''m not going to lie. I have fattish fingers.
What’s a Mac mini
Please repost in r/DiWhy
Genius
Can you power on the mini with a Magic Keyboard?
Lmao. Overhead cam for the power button. 

But seriously, is it a big deal to lift it ever so slightly to hit the button for the amount of times one would normally turn it on and off?
Form over function, the Apple way.
🤣
I mean the thing is small and weighs very little.  Just lift the side with the button and press it
It's like, they do this shit on purpose. One day, we'll have apple computers with a literal turd inside, and a written note that just says "fuck you".
HOW IS ANYBODY DEFENDING THIS! I literally can't believe some of the insane justifications that I'm reading.

It doesn't matter how often you do or don't use the power button. This is dog shit design. I love all of my Apple products, some of my favorite professional years of my career were working at Apple, but you are fucking brainwashed if you are defending this nonsense.
Serious question: is there space for a finger to slide there without lifting the computer? If so, I think ppl are really overreacting
ITT: fanboys defending an obviously moronic design choice.

If you aren't powering off your PC and switching off the power strip, you are wasting electricity and creating carbon emissions for no reason.
The pcb for the mini is on the bottom of the computer. The USB ports are all designed to use a pcb that's on the bottom. A power button that faces the bottom fits right on the pcb. A power button that is on the side of the computer will need a daughter board, which increases costs. Apple doesn't do that, which is why the power button is on the main board, and upside down.

It's a money thing, nothing more.
Windows users when they can’t shut down their Mac
That's it..... I'm copying this to my 3d printer. Mooom buy me one!
Don't shut down using the button.
At this point just press the fucking button man
Dozens of Apple fans coming out of the woodwork to defend a trillion dollar company making a stupid decision
There's no way people bitching over this. You would use it literally couple times a year, it's not a windows PC where you need to shut off/on every time. Also it's not like it's a giant heavy brick that is hard to pick up, why are people complaining so much?
It just occurred to me that I have no idea where the power button is on my current Mac mini.
You guys turn off your Mac???
So silly, who even uses the power button these days except to turn the Mac on for the first time?
Oh my God, when will people learn that you don’t have to shut down your Mac. It’s completely unnecessary. And for the every once in a blue moon that you do, just use the Apple menu on the screen or, God forbid, lift up the Mac mini and press it
FFS this shit is stupid. If you don’t like its location, don’t buy
Rendered by PC
OK boomer, happy turning it on and off every day to you.
Internet of Shit!!
Isn’t it on the back

Apple Power Pro.

Just $99. And we think you’re gonna love it!
I’m betting you can just put your finger down on the table under the power button and press the corner of the mini.
lol. solving a non-problem.... noice!!
Nice, fixing non-existent problem.
1. Put computer to sleep instead of turning it off.
2. Tap literally any key on your keyboard to wake it.
3. ??????
4. PROFIT!!!
OMG you've been able to turn your mac on with Key commands on the keyboard since the IIgs.
I mean, this is nothing new. iMacs have had a back power button for like literally 2 decades at this point.
Just leave the computer in all the time. They use very little power when idling. That is better for the hardware and then the OS can dream (maintenance) at night.
I knew this exact design would happen. I thought about it earlier. It’s such a non issue.
I've probably pressed my MM's power button maybe 10 times in its decade of usage. This is SO minor and a lot of folks are being very performative on this issue
Can’t you just put the computer upside down?
Jeez it’s so light. Just lift it and press the button if you need to turn it off. 😂
That's a very high production value meme
This is funny. But maybe if you’re the type that really obsesses over the power button, Apple products may not be the best fit for you.
I don't think I ever turned off my Mac mini, I know this is a meme, but some people don't.
Aside from the security measures to the extent of not even letting the government have a back door, which why tf you even care about that so long as you're not doing anything illegal, I'll never understand why people still buy Apple products. Shit used to be kinda okay yeeeears ago.. buuut.. nah, it's all trash now.
Or just put your finger where the button is? Is it that hard?
Wait. People turn their Macs off? You only need to hit it once to turn it on.
this non-issue has reached meme status.

The only time i EVER have to touch the power button on my mini is when it crashes. (which is more often than it really should , but it runs 24/7 displaying remote video feeds, so chrome fills up and dies eventually)
A solution to a non existent problem.
from $359.99 in your apple store.
Really not necessary.
In Apple’s defense…are you really going to need to turn off the Mac that often? Most people leave their computers on indefinitely.
Imagine being so entitled, to think this is something to complain about.
Classic 1st world problem.

Just turn it over.

Or does the liquid come out?
People know that the button is on a lifted area right? Like, it’s not that hard to press it from the bottom up.
im a macbook user so i dont know about this because i dont turn off my pc often but does mac mini need to be turned off everyday?
Use a power strip, turn it off and on.. your computer will start.. or even better a smart plug…
Wait do people actually turn off their Mac’s?
I don’t remember when I ever turned my computer off. Restart yes. Off? Never.
Just flip the thing over.
This is the dumbest discourse.
Just use a finger if you have the strength to lift the thing?
I have to be late to the party here… like you can turn on your computer with the keyboard and off just as easily. Like, removing the power button all together is technically not a hindrance to functionality. Conceptually this design is silly but that’s just because we ain’t used to it yet
It needs a physical mod just to make it function at the bare minimum... My fucking god

r/applesucks
If you think the mini’s power button placement is a huge ordeal and that it’s going to make owning one a massive chore, I’m going to assume you’ve never lifted more than ten pounds in your life and need to experience some real hardship
Here comes the 'I can't be bothered to press the button underneath because I shutdown and start up my mac 50 times a day' comments.
The only reason my Mac has ever turned off is because the power went out.
Honestly, critics will complain. But I doubt the vast majority of Mac users will consistently power off their Macs every freaking time. Most will keep their Macs in sleep mode, as it's power efficient and has great standby time.
Or just buy a fucking windows pc instead of co-opting apples bullshit
Who turns off their computer?
People turn their macs off?
Dude it can be turned on by any button on your keyboard.
I heard Adobe is making one.  $5.99 monthly subscription fee.
MKBHD will sell a black/red one for 50 dollars.
I'll wait for the official Apple iButton Remote Presser Plus for $70. I heard it has AI built in.
LTTstore.com

In orange! 
No worries, I saw them on Aliexpress original made by Beklin for $0.98 and free shipping if you buy 50 of them.
🤣🤣🤣 Right?!
45??? Phhfffy 79$ only on Black Friday discount 😭😭😭
45€ actually isn’t half bad…
Or... just hit the one on the keyboard.
Some people need this power button only 1 time.. when turning the pc on for the first time
Some people are just built different.
And actually easier than being on the rear
Imagine not creating an imaginary issue over nothing!
I was literally thinking “why not just y’know pick up the base cuz it’s tiny as shit and hit the power button?”
Right? If the finger is to scale in this drawing there is PLENTY of space to tuck your finger under the edge to press the power button.
Or just put it on the front. They already have ports there. IT just makes sense to put the power button there. It’s like their design of the Magic Mouse. They dont want to admit they made a huge design mistake putting the charging USB C port at the bottom. Everyone universally pans them about it but they dont change it.
That’s because newer MacBook Air’s automatically power on whenever you open them.  I actually hate this feature but here we are.
Yes but you don't open a Mac Mini

I have a Mini and it's fantastic but I do power down after every use. That said - this wouldn't be a deal breaker. I'd just have to lift it a bit and slide my finger in there
Even though I agree, these are not comparable since the MB has an internal battery so there's no need to worry about whether it's plugged in or not, but with the mini you might need to turn it off and on for many domestic situations like cleaning your desktop, rearranging the cables, changing the outlet strip, taking it to another room or office, etc.
They have a power button?
With age growing of my mac, I, then, find the necessary of the power button. Yeah, I need to reboot mac to stop bug situation.
Don't give them ideas.
Funny you say that, but I've accidentally pushed the power button on my older Mini when trying to unplug it. Having it come on as I'm unplugging, then bricking the OS as a result.
At this point everyone can just SSH and run halt from their phone if the power button is somewhere weird so why do we need a power button anyways? Worst case scenario yank the cable /s
Why would you _not_ use the power button all the time? It's the thing that turns the machine on, that's kinda important.
Who uses the power button more than twice a day in a normal setting
Why keep your computer on and have badly coded apps steal your ram when you can restart which takes all of 5 seconds on a modern mac and have a fresh experience without all the bloatware that stayed open in the background?
> Idk who uses the power button so much that they need that.

Mostly people who complain aren't going to buy one anyway, wherever the power button was.
Do you just put it to sleep when not using it?
Regularly. My Mac mini is not my main machine, I only use it for xcode and see no need to keep it running for no reason.
We have one at the office that hasn't been turned off since before Covid.
Every time I use it. My wife doesn't like stuff being left on 🤷‍♂️

I'm sure I'd get used to the button location
Some viruses live in the RAM, which is why some people regularly restart their devices.
Y'all should really be turning your computers off to extend their lifespan. Honestly probably helps save a few bucks on your electric bills as well.
I guess you restart it after an update, no need to switch it off.

I switch it off only when I leave the house for more than a day.
It doesn't have to exist.

There's a power button on the keyboard.
Why would people turn off their computers when there is a rest mode
Think Different™️
Ok who genuinely turns off their computers. They have rest modes for a reason
Who actually turns their devices off. There is a restmode for a reason you aren’t supposed to turn them off
I mean it’s free marketing across the entire internet for something that wouldn’t really impact sales.
the best part are the droves of codependent apple customers making all sorts of excuses for plain bad design...
true, just put it on the table flipped over!
Overengineered solution for an underengineered Mac.
Yes it does for Apple keyboard
Cooling
There is literally no reason for a power button except for first set up and the occasional os crash. Otherwise people need to learn to leave their devices on like the engineers planed
You aren’t supposed to turn off your computer
Surely you'd just lift the corner and slip finger under? This thing won't be heavy, this is a non-issue.
Do you actually turn off your Mac 😭 you are supposed to leave it on indefinitely it has a rest mode for a reason
14 years of amazing innovation.
I think the problem isn't how hard it is to lift and power up, the problem is how easy it would have been to put it somewhere accessible.
Yes. No one wants their power button hidden
… and why do you care where the power button is? I do shutdown my computer every week or two, but just use the  Menu, and use the keyboard to turn it on (I’d say this is pretty common). Between this and people who never shutdown, few use the power button. So, no, not defending anything, I just don’t care where it is, doesn’t affect me.
They have front and back facing ports instead of bottom facing ports...
Stupid to you, irrelevant to most.
It’s not people are upset. A lot of people have lost the plot. The criticism was that it’s a design flaw. It was moved and offers no benefit, only a negative. 


Just like the Magic Mouse. It’s still perfectly functional but the bottom charger is silly. It doesn’t add to the design.
Yes, but not with the button.
5. Put duct tape over the always glowing status light while the Mac mini is sleeping
It probably wouldn’t cool as well.
Yeah, that's great man.
Or the Logitech CEO that wants a subscription service for a mouse lmao
For now…
you cant unsubscribe without solving a riddle.
I disagree with subscription, should have went with pay per use so you pay every time you press it.
And it will periodically ask for the keys to your house so Adobe can check that you’re using “Genuine” Adobe accessories
I heard he’s planning to include an HD wallpaper of this in his app.
A year
Apple tracking how many times you turn your machine on. 

Seems legit.
$70?! It will be $299 at least
"buzzfeed top 10 ways that you hate me"
im not paying more than 400 bucks unless it has weaponsgrade aluminum and nanotexture
$70 would be just for the felt pads that protect the Mac. The actual button pressy thingy is $199
No, Actually Apple will go the "you are holding it wrong" and tell you to not to power it off.
God damn those sponsors
How many people actually use an apple keyboard. As far as I know the MacMini does not come with one.

I don’t use one with mine.
Or tap the Apple icon in the menu then select shut down.
I think the people complaining about this are windows users that have to reboot manually all the time.
And any time the power goes out. I can see that being an issue too.
Yeah… seems like this new Mac Mini is a similar shape to the Apple TV. I couldn’t tell you where the power button is on my Apple TV. I plugged it in, it turned on, the end
It's intentionally on the bottom, you're not supposed to use it while it's plugged in.
Yeah, why just open and use your laptop when you can power on it every time and wait for 2-10 minutes
I hate this too
[deleted]
The one huge advantage of an M series chip is how fast it wakes up from sleep, and how low the power consumption is when it is “idle” (not sleep, sleep uses virtually no power at all).

If you turn it off, then turn it back on every time, you could be wasting a lot of time just staring at the Apple logo, even if it’s just 10 secs, and to reach for the power button behind the unit, man, it’s not even funny.
genuinely curious - why? I believe the M2 Mac mini draw about 0.5 watts on idle (sleep). I’m sure the M4 will be similarly efficient. 0.5 watts is less than almost everything else in your house. 

Are there other reasons to power it down daily?
Apple mouse?
Oof
Unless you did this during an OS update it's not possible to brick your OS simply by cutting power during boot.
Because low power standby means turning it off doesn't save much power, so why bother when it's then available instantly when you need it. 

If you do need to turn it off, click apple symbol and then shut down. 

If you need to turn it on, use the keyboard power button, or maybe, and this might sound crazy, just use your finger? I'm sure you're strong enough to lift it slightly if your finger doesn't fit under the gap.
More like twice a year
you have bloatware problems in 2024?
 
bruh.
Genuinely not sure what sort of Mac experience you’re talking about.
Yes
Yes
Yes
Same as me, my Mac mini comes on when I need to edit photos or make music. Which might be 2 days in a week. The rest of the time it's off. And it annoys the frig out of me that these new Minis were going to be my upgrade for it, but I'll have to faff about picking it up to turn it on when they could've just put the power button on the side or on the top. Hell, make the dirty big Apple logo the power button if they're that bothered by asthetics over function.
Who cleans the airflow path?

I'm a turn it off after I'm done kinda dude, keep a clean desk/house, and still find dust up in the Mini. Twice a year or so I pop off the bottom cover and vacuum her out. Granted, there's not the coating of crap like in the old Win7 desktop but there's still enough to make this effort worth it.
your wife gets after you for leaving your mac in sleep mode? that’s how they’re designed to be used.
If this were 2000, you’d be right. It’s designed to be left on and power draw is near 0 while it’s sleeping
Damn hahaha you're right, slow brain today and my second language …
It does have to exist.
Ahh, true! But does it work to turn on the Mini too?
Not on my keyboard.
I do when I'm done with it.

  
The power company doesn't need any help from me in money. They're doing fine.
I agree, but I don't think that's why Apple is doing it.
How is it bad design? Have you polled mac mini users all around the world so you know the user metrics on turn off cycles? Are you actually a heavy user of mac minis and this affects you personally? 
Yes, because you need to turn it on once every few years and reaching behind it is very hard
Who actually turns off their electrics
Is there not a fan inside that thing?
Fuck the disabled eh.
Front and back facing ports are parts that get mounted in a horizontal pcb board at a 90° angle.
There’s one
if they were to move to front, or anywhere in the aluminum case, it will hinder the cooling system, one of the reasons its so small and compact IS because of its all aluminum body. Of course they could move it to front, to make it more convenient when you would use it... like once every month if not years, but the cooling wouldn't be this good, or they could move it to top and make the apple logo a button... but you WILL turn it off accidentally when you don't want to. But the overall experience from this inconvenience is so small that I don't even see it as a negative. Also, Apple also has a perfect solution for it that just makes sense which is their keyword with power/finger scan button. you don't even need to reach the bottom, it is right next to you.

Also Magic Mouse while might be a bit inconvenient when charging, is not the problem people need to focusing on. It will tell you when its battery running out days before it will shut off, and after charging it you would use it for month and forget that you even need to charge this thing. Charging is not a problem, ergonomics are. I had most problems with its shape that is not comfortable.   
Also it does add to the design to make it more seamless and sleek. Random hole on overall solid body in my opinion is just bad design... but it just me lol
This is a reality that is scary af.
“You’ll love it, I promise”
I wonder what the monthly subscription fee will be for a mouse pad? Or can you get a reduced rate if you pay the fee for both a mouse and a mouse pad? LOL
Wait for Logitech to make another "universal" proprietary dongle for this too...
You can only use it under water too
No, they‘re using “on-device machine learning” to learn your habits and turn it on for you automatically.
They already been doing that for years lol you can see the data in the analytics file that uploads
Apple already tracks how many times you unlock your iPhone, they once bragged how much time you would save with faceid vs touch Id.
And why would you power it off?
> How many people actually use an apple keyboard.

Certainly more than use the power button.
I don’t think anyone should ever use the Apple mouse, but I do know a lot of people who use the Apple Keyboard, and I used one myself for several years. 

Unless you’re spending like $20 on a low end Logitech, the Apple Keyboard is priced right in line with the competition: anywhere between $100-180 depending on the model. It’s a decent keyboard, and the TouchID is a really nice addition that no one else has.
I dont but if I turned my computer off I would have a button assigned to it on the keyboard ... in fact I might add a combination to do it for shits and giggles. Right now I have one for sleep and lock screen.

I have used the shutdown command in terminal more than the power button on any of my macs.
I love my apple keyboard.
Well you DON’T need an apple keyboard for this. I used for long time with my macbook just normal usb keyboard plugged into the usb-c hub and waking with hitting space just worked (it was used as mac mini, as i don’t use internal monitor when i dock my laptop to docking station). 

Also right now i’m on logitech k380 - there are none issues with wake on bluetooth. And if your concern is putting mac to sleep mode - there is a power menu, keyboard shortcut and option to configure hot corner. Personally - i love the last one, just sliding mouse to the right corner and your mac goes to sleep.
Then use the power button provided in the OS. (Top left of the screen)
Ok ... so you would actually use the one on the mini ... once a year.
I did when I owned a Mac Mini. Used the Magic Mouse too.
I think they are talking about how you invariably need to turn it back on
The only time I seem to power mine off is when there’s a problem. Sometimes my M1 mini will freeze up or get stuck in someway and I need to press and hold the power button.
And then, after doing whatever you needed to do to the mini, you can again use your mouse and select power up!  Or maybe use terminal and the shutup command??

I haven't seen one of these yet. Can you reach the power button without lifting up the mini? My M1 mini sits too close to the desk to do this. If you have to lift the mini to reach the power button, this seems a really silly design.

You will have to use the power button eventually. If you have six stacked minis in a server farm, that's going to be a problem.
It's probable more the "press and hold" to force power down after a system freeze that they're still traumatized by.
No, the people complaining are the ones who now lost the "8GB base model" rant and are trying to find a new one.
A reboot doesn't use the power button on Windows or Mac.  Very long time Windows user that added a Mac for my primary workflow last year - my PC has no different uptime or reboot needs than my Mac.  I very often went months without a reboot on my PC.
LOL. The 90s called and want their joke back.
I have not had to reboot windows any more often than I do my mac.
Or is in video production that have to restart our Mac’s often, wether for software issues or because we just pulled out off a semi.
You can set them to reboot when power comes back
But most wireless mouses can be used while being charged. I do that for my Logitech MX mouse.
The very fact that powering on an Apple Silicon product could be considered as "2-10 minutes" in someone's head is mind-boggling.
sounds like someone has never considered other users have different needs.
There are plenty of circumstances where you’d want the device open but not turned on. Literally any sort of cleaning or repair.
Um, what?
Ive still worked at Apple when the Magic Mouse was introduced. He definitely approved of the design — he’s one of the most opinionated (and controversial) designers out there.
My wife doesn't like computers being left on. 🤷‍♂️

She unplugs her laptop every night and switches off the extension lead *even though nothing is drawing power*. I've given up trying to win the conversation. She is wonderful in every other way though
>I'm sure you're strong enough to lift it slightly if your finger doesn't fit under the gap.

Just because something _can_ be done doesn't mean it's a good idea. Making something deliberately inaccessible is stupid. Also, not everyone has baselevel strength. Disability is a thing that exists. A thing that Apple in their arrogance constantly forgets. 

>Because low power standby means turning it off doesn't save much power, so why bother when it's then available instantly when you need it. 

Because computers degrade when they're constantly in use. Your hardware will suffer.
Maybe twice since I’ve gotten it.
Most you would do is in an office setting when you clock in/out
Si
I don’t know your power costs or how much you care about environmental impact but current minis pull 6-7 watts when idle and still on. It’s about 1 when asleep.  I just leave mine in sleep mode and wake it with the mouse. That’s an M2 and the M4 is likely the same or more efficient
I meant more so as an occasional thing..I know people who never turn their Mac products off unless it either dies or their device gets buggy cuz they haven't updated in awhile. Once a week or once a month is probably fine.

But I still shut mine off pretty often to extend my usage for as long as possible. Even if it's very little drain.
No problem!
Yes.
Rest mode barely pulls any power though there is literally no point. It saves you so much time on device loading and loading the os
... case in point. LOL
Yes, but cooling is more complex than just a fan, the case itself is a heat sink, it’s designed to have heat move a specific way. I personally think this is a ridiculous topic fueled by a meme. From someone who’s owned minis over 15 years, getting to the power button is a rare need, and we’ll probably be able to slip out finger under and push it the way it is, but people like to make much ado about nothing.
Yes, that's exactly what I said, well done.
They could add a button to that existing PCB for like 5 cents per unit
So if I disagree with you, I’m doing it because I’m a fan, not because I think you’re wrong? That’s convenient.

Nah, you can literally create your own mouse, lots of open source software etc
You wouldn’t download a mouse..
You think more people use a mac keyboard than turn on their macs? Thats one hell of a take. Is there someone who goes around turning on peoples machines for them?
I love my Apple mouse. So much better for me ergonomically.
For that price you get much better keyboards. Sure, it might beat the low end Logitech keyboards, but that does not say much at a much higher price. 

I would not trade TouchID for a much worse typing experience.
The Apple mouse is the one thing I miss when using illustrator on a pc. For day to day it’s not great, but if you work as a graphic designer it’s really good.
Touch ID is good that’s true, however i don’t find the feeling very nice, so I replaced mine with a Logitech one, (MX keys iirc), it’s made for Mac and it’s really nice to use.
Right in line with the competition? Have you looked at keyboards on Amazon? You can get a Mac specific keyboard wired for $20-$30 and wireless for $40-$50. And TouchID is okay, but there are still plenty of times when you have to type in your password anyway so TouchID really isn't that useful on my Macbook that I've found.
Apple keyboard is not worth its price lol, you can get some really solid keyboards for that kind of money.
Some people prefer mechanical keyboards.
You can get *far* better keyboards in that price range.
Well, yeah, I know.

I use mine with a non Apple keyboard. As I said in the comment you replied to.
There’s a setting for it to turn itself back on after power failure.
That’s fair
The foot of the new M4 is taller than on the M1 machines, so there’s a lot more space under it. I’m still not sure if my sausage fingers could fit under it though until I see one in real life
>I haven't seen one of these yet.

no one has, so imaginations a free to run wild.
>my PC has no different uptime or reboot needs than my Mac

Interesting you say that, given that my Windows PC has been better than PC's in the past in this regard, but significantly worse than Macs I've owned in the same time. 

One particular issue I've seen across multiple installs / hardware is the Netflix app causing a black screen that can only be fixed through a reboot, which requires holding down the physical power button.
HARD disagree, Many driver installs REQUIRES a full reboot. 'oh I see you installed some software - it has a driver that needs you to reboot ... ' this happens far more often on PC than Mac
You’ve been incredibly lucky.
Apple > restart. I guess?
Anyone that plans on travelling to work with it, will use it every day.  
I use my power button every day on my mac to switch from and to my Fedora partition, i'd be printing that.
The Mac mini probably isn’t the best choice for those doing video production anyway. (The Mac Studio is aimed more for that sort of work.)
I didn’t know that but I’ve had PCs you could do that with and I’ve always decided not to in case there was some brown out condition with the power going in and out. I don’t want my devices being slam rebooted each time the power fluctuates. Though, a decent UPS would fix that.
I was trying to compare with the way you use other laptops. My laptop took a minute to wake up, 5 to boot
It’s on you. There’s a way to set up like you want it
You need your laptop to take longer to be ready to use?
Well, in that case you turn it off! Do you clean or repair your Mac every day?
I had a friend and she bought her first Mac. After a while she pings me and asks whether a new Mac should be this slow. Turns out she didn’t know she could just close it and leave it be and booted it every time.
[deleted]
haha fair enough! 😆 Luckily powering off is easy to do from the menu. Turning this little guy on may be a little tedious.
> Disability is a thing that exists. A thing that Apple in their arrogance constantly forgets. 

Aren't their airpods usable as hearing aids? The button may not be in the most convenient of spots but saying the Apple has forgotten about disabled people seems like hyperbole.
If a disability prevents the pressing of the button, then the button is no good. Obviously those people won't buy it but would they be able to press the button on the back of an iMac? I've always found that tricky myself.

Your computer will be a long time obsolete before any degradation from standby mode power usage has an impact on performance. This is as close to a literal non-issue as there can be.
This is an absurd thing to say. A Mac Mini is not degrading because you leave it sleeping in standby while not using it. People here acting like they haven’t used a Mac in 20 years.
Next time try:
CMD+q, then Esc.
Same, I usually turn it off. It loads up really fast anyway.
Oh, cool! So Bluetooth keeps active on the Mini when shut down, I guess. Nice feature!
Barely any is still some. I turn off devices when I'm done.

  
They don't need any extra of my money.
Just seconding here how awesome Affinity is. I snagged the whole suite for all devices (desktop & iPad) during a 50% off sale so was only like $80ish. And yeah, with their 6-month long trial, you can basically use it for free until they run another sale and then secure it for life. Love it!
Just swashbuckle everything my g
not sure if its like mine, but my M1 Mac mini boots when power is applied. so technically Ive never used the power button.

its just always asleep. reboots on power failures..
I suspect a large percentage of Mac users use their keyboards daily, but their power buttons *almost* never. They just close the laptop or let the iMac go to sleep.

I also suspect most Mac users use an Apple keyboard; even the little ones have a power button.
Who turns off their Mac? The only time I restarted was to install updates.
Why are you turning off your computer so much lol
I actually don’t think that’s a wild take. Most people almost never power down their Mac unless it completely crashes. Magic Keyboard is a very popular device for anyone buying a new iMac or Mac Mini.
Based on your comments it seems like you don’t have experience operating a Mac or at least don’t have a good understanding. It might be better to refrain from expressing opinions on topics you lack comprehension of. This power button thing is a non-issue and you’d know that if you used a Mac regularly. It’s almost comical how agitated people are getting about it.
I like the touch/swipe/scroll features. Nobody else makes a mouse like that AFAIK. Plus it connects without a dongle.
I actually really love the Mac Magic Keyboard and am typing this comment with it. I switched away from a mechanical keyboard with blue switches. I really love the low travel of this keyboard and how it doesn't require me to raise my hands above my desk. And touchID? Come on! It's just so perfect

  
I feel like I'm the 1% of people that like this keyboard, which is definitely a larger group than the 0.01% of people that like the Magic Mouse.
Keyboards I always find are such a personal thing. I love my Magic Keyboard. I also love my big clunky IBM buckling spring keyboard from the late 80’s I use with my vintage gear. You can’t get much more different than those

I hate the modern mechanical which got gifted to me (but that could be because it’s not exactly the most expensive keyboard)
I used one for years, and the guestures were interesting but it is the single most uncomfortable mouse I’ve ever used. Got a MX Master 3 and it’s worlds apart from the Apple mouse.
I use the MX Keys, too. I taped my Magic Keyboard (TKL) to the bottom of my desk shelf for Touch ID only.
I’m talking name-brand quality or premium keyboards. MX Master Keys is $100. Do you know how many Razer or other gaming brand keyboards are $200-300?

Sure you can always find a better bang-for-buck keyboard than any of those, but they’re also popular products because people are buying them even if they’re not the best deal.
I love my L+F Morandi Alice 98 w/ Drop MT3 Black Panther.

I also type the same 90wpm on my Apple keyboard, and it does not inhibit my job in any way.
Sure but not if you deliberately turn it off. They should allow people to do that via the keyboard again which might be part of the plan. Or you know, just simply dont shut down your computer and instead use sleep like everyone else
I don't think they can, but it's not hard to tilt it to fit. Even the finger in the diagram doesn't look like it would fit.

On the one hand, this makes it harder to turn on the computer, but on the other hand, it makes it harder to accidentally press while picking it up or trying to plug something in.
Yes software often requires a reboot. 

A) I don’t install new software all that often. 

B) The frequency may be a little different, but not crazy different between the two platforms.
When the entire system is frozen that’s not really an option
why not? for $599 there’s a lot of video production things to be done and savings to be had with the mac mini
If that’s a concern, you should look into an UPS. I think there’s some fairly reliable and inexpensive ones nowadays. I may be misremembering this, but coulda sworn I saw a power strip that had a minimal ups/line conditioner built in.

The peace of mind alone is worth it
Oh, fair enough. I suggest you install an SSD in your laptop if there isn't already one. They speed up computers tremendously.
i work with applications that require me to shut down my computer completely when i am done
That’s…the entire point. They turn back on when you open the lid or press a key. Even if you’ve shut it down. It’s a nonsensical way of functioning that literally no other computer does.
Ive was also responsible for the similarly terrible [hockey puck mouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck_mouse).
https://preview.redd.it/ajxtg81tx5yd1.jpeg?width=1144&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=433408096a5e05540551e58c96e2b87f38fff8e9
What, does Apple put in magic pixie dust that prevents entropy? Motherfuckers, why ain't they sharing that stuff?
No, you use the cord that comes with the keyboard to plug it into the Mini. Voila, functional, accessible power button!

(This is also useful if the Bluetooth handshake is ever problematic. It syncs that up nicely, too.)
I never turn off my devices because I can’t stand to wait for stuff to turn on and I want all my updates done without me having to press a button. I like just wiggling my mouse and my computer is instantly woken up waiting for me.
Do you by any chance remember what kind of sale it was? Black Friday, Christmas...?
Just like me. Not you, the Mac mini.
You can’t turn on Macs with external keyboard, Apple or not.
Lmao "u professional software devs just dont know about computers. Uve inly used pc, linux, and mac. How wud u have comparisons". 

Must be in an apple fan boy sub.
I’m with you. Mechanicals have too much travel and I have more typing errors on them. Looking for a quality non mechanical keyboard these days is actually challenging though.
I envy you, I try to love it. Every time I’m at the mall I walk through the Apple Store and try to type on it. I immediately hate life and run away back to my mechanical with Speed Silver switches lol. 

I sooo want to like it though because I love the slim profile and having Touch ID.

I wish they’d make an Apple Mechanical lol
I dont recall ever having to reboot to finish an install on Mac or linux
Using Adobe I'm assuming? I work in video production and can't remember the last time my system froze.
My macs haven't done that in 20 years. lol
You poor dear
The thermal design of the Studio is more geared towards sustained loads and has processors designed more for professional use, though the Studio is definitely due to get a bump up to M4 soon.

The mini is a great Mac for a lot of uses, but it’s not a professional video production tool.
Oops, autocorrected Lenovo to laptop, haha. It had ssd, wasn’t that old and kinda top of the line. Still, nothing compares to my MacBook Pro <3
And how does that relate to laptops powering on when you open them (the comment you replied to)?
sudo nvram AutoBoot=%00
If you’re working in repairs, ask for a customer to put it in his terminal, %03 to turn it back on
Ah ok … I only use it wirelessly because it's cleaner and works exactly as well. I just charge overnight every few weeks when it's needed. And since I never shut it down, it's also no problem.
So the power button on the wireless keyboard isnt the solution :(
I'm not changing you.

You're not changing me.

  
This is all just a moo point.

  
Just like a cow's opinion. It's doesn't matter. This is just moo.
They did a big Black Friday sale last year.
I think it was just some random mid-summer sale. I didn’t notice it till end of July to early August. Maybe it was a 4th of July sale that ran long?
If you don’t want to listen, learn, and contribute, why are you here? Your posts are beyond useless. You’re a software dev? So am I. What difference does that make? If you don’t know what you’re talking about it’s best to shut up and listen.
There's much better non mechanical and low profile keyboards available for the price as well. Really the only reason to get it might be TouchID.
I wish they’d make a Magic Trackpad with built in Touch ID. That would be killer and I can still use my keychron and mx master with it
Resolume on computers not powerful enough for what it’s running. Also propresenter being everything that it is. And yeah, Adobe
I’m half convinced the cooling solution on the studio is massively overkill for the normal Max chips anyway, perhaps not for the ultra. They don’t seem to have too much trouble in the MacBook Pro with sustained loads, at least not on the 16”. 

And the M4 pro is smashing the pants off the M2 Max anyway. The M2 Max studio is in a really weird boat right now…
Either it wasnt a top of the line or you had a tremendous amount of malware on it.  
My 800€ laptop with a SATA SSD bought in 2019 boots in 20-30 seconds nowadays and its been through a stupid amount of hours used under heavy load. Turned it off twice a week to take it to school (battery is gone due to me using it as a gaming "desktop" most of the time.  
Apple isnt magic, sure its great , but if you spend the same amount of money on most windows laptops they will perform similar and boot times will be super fast. 

Can't compare a 200€ android to the latest iPhone and say all android are crap.
My Lenovo laptop boots in 1 minute
I have a new, M series MacBook Pro for work. It does not boot any faster then my cheap Asus laptop did in 2016 with Windows 10, because that consistently booted within 30 seconds. It has Linux installed now, so still similar. So no, that is not how a "top of the line Lenovo" is supposed to work.
Sure it is. If you reboot so frequently that access to the power button is a problem, plug the keyboard in. It's a desktop device, not a laptop.
Thanks 🌻
Aluminum chassis 100% with a nice layout. Not as easy to find as you think
Uh I’m gonna need you to email Tim Cook like immediately lol. I would 1000% buy this. Great idea!
I see. I thought by video production you meant like video editing, motion graphics, etc.
I am comparing MacBook Air 2010 11’, a very underwhelming laptop, to my top-lvl Lenovo of the same time. Both had SSD’s
Or..........the power button could just be in a useful location! 

Shocking innovation I know.
There's nothing special about aluminium chassis, the Lofree Flow84 beats the hell out of it at a similar price point, and

> nice layout

Not with those arrow keys.
A little but I’m mostly in live conferences, music and LED walls
It's just a continuation of the "leave it on" trend they've been doing for quite some time.

I have to Google which buttons to press to restart my phone. The button on the iMacs is tough to find without going behind the device. They sleep in a very power-efficient fashion, and any corporate setup is likely to want them on for updates overnight anyways.
Tesla's engineers using Windows on Macbook
On Carwow's newest drag race with the Cybertruck you can zoom in and see one of Tesla engineer's laptop running Windows on a Macbook. Under the screen u can slightly see the upper text of the
"Macbook Pro".
I used to run Windows 10 on my Air, it was fast as heck.
I've been on the inside of SpaceX in multiple locations. Most engs. choose their laptop from an approved list and everyone regardless of their OS choice is assigned an intranet VM. That way they have access to windows no matter what to run their MES/QMS and design software.

I believe they are also allowed to use parallels on Mac to run those programs locally.
Windows used to run better on Mac hardware a few years ago tbh
The build quality on MacBooks is unrivaled. And sometimes you need Windows to do work in specific industries. I still dual boot mine, which is the last of the intel based MacBooks. I will be hanging on to it for a while because you can’t do this with the newer ARM based MacBooks yet.
[deleted]
Me reading this as a Tesla engineer currently running windows on my work MacBook lmao
May need windows only software. Probably a full screen vm running inside macOS
The 16" 2019 Macbook Pro is still a bit of a beast. I see no reason why not to run windows and macOS on it.
Or maybe this is an RDP session?
Could be just a Remote Desktop.
I’ve dual booted before on my personal 2019 16” Intel MacBook Pro. Might convert it over to be Windows only once I get an Apple Silicon MBP, rather than selling it. As I don’t think it’ll fetch for an amount I would find acceptable.
This is old intel version and they actually used to run Windows really well.
Switched from mbpro running windows bootcamp to dell xps and it’s the same price but worse in almost every way. Sound, trackpad, screen, cooling, performance, battery. I had to replace the battery on my own dime because it had degraded to 50% after one year.
The best Windoze computer has been a Mac from 2006-2020
Virtual machines like Parrells
Fun fact MacBooks run windows better than some computers
Because intel macs are the best windows laptops in terms of battery life, etc.
Windows on Mac runs better than any windows laptop tbh. Even on Parallels desktop.

Don't forget the battery life!
My M1 air + Parallels was probably the best Windows experience I've ever had
Automotive systems operate on canbus, usually over obdii or worse j1939. There are often encryption requirements or proprietary implementations of protocols that just don't quite work right unless you're using the driver's made by the can bus devices on the network, and sometimes the drivers only work on windows.  I don't know that this is the situation, but I struggled with this while learning how to integrate custom software on the device network of a Cummins diesel engine recently.  I haven't touched a windows machine in 20 years, but this engine wasn't cooperating on anything but the proprietary software made by Cummins that only works in a windows environment.   Wouldn't be surprised if there are regulated components on this truck that only responds to windows drivers
I mean windows does run better on a Mac
I run an instance of Windows through VMware Fusion when I need to. It's incredibly simple to setup.
whatever jtag debugger/tool they are using probably supports only windows.
I remember in 2012 when I bought my first MPB, it was then described as the best laptop and also as the best PC to run windows. It is still true 12 years later.
Probably for solidwords. That cursed software is used to make parts of all kinds.

I hate it but it's pretty much mandatory in any mechanical, aerospace, or automotive industry.

Imagine Adobe Photoshop, but locked to a single platform. 1000x worse and 10000x crashier.
This is pretty common for workplace Macs
It IS superior hardware…
I studied architecture with my pro for years and with CAD or BIM programs, unfortunately I had to rape my Mac with Windows 10, it worked like hell anyway
If you have a mid spec MBP, I guess parallels gives you the best of both worlds. macOS for work, efficiency and overall experience, while windows for compatibility (as most older and smaller software still can’t run on macOS)
It’s probably parallels when they need to execute windows applications or test
I mean yeah it‘s a 16“ i9 that thing is incredible on windows
A lot of canbus utils only run on Windows.
As a MBP 2019 16 owner I can tell that using Windows instead of MacOS provides better usage of the gpu when connecting to external displays and has better drivers support than MacOS IMHO
One of the reasons we left Apple is the death of Boot Camp. If it ever comes back we might consider switching back to
[Elon takes over Twitter]

“New policy as of tomorrow: All Mac users must run Windows as their primary OS, either via Bootcamp if using Intel Macs or via Parallels if using Apple Silicon.”

“We need you off OS X as we’re going to be using the X part of the OS fairly soon”
A MacBook is the best quality windows laptop
I spose they wanted reliable hardware but needed Windows for some reason
Ain’t bootcamp assistant beautiful?
I love Macbooks.

I absolutely fucking hate macOS.

I went back to Intel macs just to use Windows.
It’s a 16-inch Intel MBA, and Windows is stupidly fast on them. It’s almost unnecessary with Apple’s native silicon being so fast and optimised for macOS.
Can't blame him... Macos is bad
Tesla’s are programmed with C++, a language that needs to be compiled before it can be run. Windows is easier for C++ programming. 

If you wonder how to get Windows on your Mac, try a virtualization software such as VMWare Fusion, UTM, or Parallels. The first two are free, with UTM being open source and designed specifically for Apple silicon. Parallels is a bit better for gaming, but costs about $100/year.
I use windows parallels on my M1 to play portal and apart from being slower because of the seriously stunted limits on how much ram and stuff it can use I almost prefer it over MacOS.
So? Lots of people do that, especially in engineering where there's tons of software you need to use that only exists for windows.
They removed engine and put a motor with Duracell batteries and call it a space ship. What more can you expect from tesla.
Macbook hardware is pretty great, especially the battery life (on the newer Mx macs).... However the OS is absolute trash - why can I not even alt tab between multiple windows on the same app? 

I just end up RDPing into my actual work machine with win10, and life is wonderful.
Everything works faster on windows. Download speeds, transfer speeds, software. Why not?
That looks like an M1
Parallels or any free VM. Pretty simple
Likely due to some embedded IDEs.
makes sense. my main laptops a non retina 2012 mbp. have been considering swapping out the optical drive for a windows boot drive
Best laptop with best OS. I am using 7 on my Pro still. I will switch to 10, after month.
Could be a Windows virtual machine with Ethernet passthrough
2018 mbp here, dual boot win10 for games
I run windows on my Mac too when it's more convenient, for things such as Visual Studio, since VS is better on windows then on Mac, for example.
MacBook great for Windows is like IE is great for downloading Chrome
Build quality on MacBook is so good. And windows runs super fast on it.
Not surprising. I like to sometimes run Windows 11 ARM in UTM in fullscreen mode.
I had to go back to the MBP 2020 because I needed windows... so? :( (my bet is an Azure VM)
I run Win 10 in Parallels on my M1 Pro sometimes and it’s quick! I have some hardware that requires windows otherwise I wouldn’t.
Yes, lots of measurement software for cars is windows exclusive
A Mac is the only computer that can run both MacOS and Windows. I am 99% confident they are native Mac users, who in the scene debug the car with a Windows app on boot camp.
That happen if you give an engineer a mac for work.
So what? That’s the wonderful thing about dual boot /  boot camp.
Just so you know, this appears to be a 16” Intel MacBook Pro, you can tell based on the physical escape key (it’s hard to see) and the area around the keyboard is large enough that it definitely looks like a 16” Pro.
That’s og
I have Windows 11 running just fine on an Intel Macbook Pro not as a VM but using dual boot.
Linux
Boot camp was the nicest feature of the Intel era MacBooks, even remember the MacBook Air being considered the best computer to run Windows on. One of a few reasons I’m holding on to my Intel MacBook Pro as long as possible.
🤢
Honestly you would be shocked at how common this is. Apple really hurt their developers with the unapologetic shift to ARM.
I bet it is also modded both in the software and in thje hardware
This is a pro move for some types of controls and automation software engineers. Good battery life and keeping different projects separate.
There are people I’ve seen in Gangnam that wanted to look cool at the Starbucks with MBA running windows eesh. I know one lady that bought a MBP but never uses it. It’s just there as a display so she can look cool.
Probably running some sort of virtual machine. I know of a latest a couple developers at my company that do this rather than own windows hardware.
Or it’s VDI. Very common at my workplace too.
Yeah I worked with an older guy and he loved Mac’s quality but grew up using windows and he always had the newest MacBook Pro but only ever ran windows on it.
It's the best combination, honestly!
Says much.
Dude car is running on linux 
They are trying to make bingo
Windows is even better optimized on Macbooks rather than on windows laptop 😂
Surprisingly windows runs better on my Mac than Mac does
And running a shitty windows terminal (would be better to run linux)
No wonder the car is so trash!
Yup windows on Mac is sleek asf!
Could even be a RD session for what we know
Virtual machine, remote desktop, etc. can guarantee its not running natively
I’m not amazed 😂
It could also be a Remote Desktop
Easy peasy using Parallels Desktop https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/
RIP bootcamp
Of course they are, you expect them to be so successful on bleeding edge tech? Nope.
Times are tough at X, so Muskie has asked the IT dept to recycle old MBPs by installing Windows on them. Extends their life another 2 years before needing a replacement.
It’s the best windows laptop 🤷‍♂️
using vlc in windows which is running on a mac lol
That just looks sick, and its probably vertualized or using bootcamp.
I use bootcamp on my iMac 2012 too. Besides the lack of a proper graphics card, it still holds up pretty well for most simple tasks. Also it’s nice to switch from Mac and Windows whenever I want to
Looks like an Intel Mac(?) so Windows using Bootcamp is the norm. If it’s an ARM, possibilities are: remoting into a Windows workstation or a VM running Windows arm64 (UTM, parallel, etc). Could even emulate x64 Windows as well.
Best of the both worlds ! 
No other perfect way to use them together ! 
A windows on a mac 🫰🏻
That’s one advantage of intel Macs. You can just dual boot with windows and Linux if you want to. Idk if M1 can dual boot with windows rn
I used to run windows on my air 2017 through bootcamp, until I upgraded to a M2 Pro a year ago, but it ran windows better than all laptops specifically designed to run windows in my house lmao
I do this to my clients all the time. Most people in Croatia by Macs for “prestige” not OS, so I just slap a windows on them and they get their fancy hardware and I get none of the cross platform headaches, and it runs very well.
I do this for my school IT elective, gets a kick out of friends pulling out windows 11 on that thing. Same laptop too.
Might be wrong but it could just be a VM running off a server and they're remotely connected to it in fullscreen mode
There's a fairly decent chance that Tesla uses thin clients. You can connect to them with any type of computer but the thin client you'll be remotely using is whatever IT sets up, and it's probably going to be Windows. I worked at a company that did this once. You'd use your own device, but you'd be logging into your thin client for work. It's a way to help keep confidential work documents secure, because they never actually leave the remote server. So even if someone steals your laptop, they can't get into the system b/c there's usually 2FA.
I've have Windows on my MBP 2017 I7, on an external ssd for gaming. It runs smoother than any other pc I've worked on.
Probably some of their softwares only run on windows
That's called bootcamp. Only available for intel based chipset on Mac such has as t2 chip
Bootcamp on an intel based MAC.  I used to use it all the time.
Sometimes you need to test things on Windows, that's why we have parallels. Some software is Windows only so it makes sense.
I’m telling you, Windows on a Mac is amazing. I’ve been using my MacBook Pro (13”, 2015) with Windows 10 and it’s been hella smooth. Better battery life (in my experience, at least), better performance and better usability/stability.
I had a macbook pro 2013 that was fully spec'd and ran bootcamp and windows on that thing to run solidworks. It was the best windows machine I ever owned. It had a few quirks but still was awesome! Still runs great now with new windows updates. Kinda thinking about the M3 with parallels now but unsure how much of a performance hit parallels has on battery and speed. Anyone know? Anyone running solidworks on one of the new macbook pros?
All the benefits of the nice hardware, without an OS which weirdly lacks a load of basic functionality
I’m currently using an external ssd to run windows on my 2015 MacBook Air.  Does the Ssd have to remain plugged in?
Makes sense. Apple has been leading in making hardware for laptop last couple of years but MacOs has many limitations and has not changed much last 23 years. Windows in other hand has great support of external hardware and has one of the best window management.
It's very common in production
How? im new to mac, and i dont know how to run windows well
[removed]
macbook is looking so cheap with installed windows 10 😆
Which cpu do you have? I thought the arm stuff couldnt do bootcamp.
Do you mean on Intel Macs?
Which Air?
I’ll do this with my Intel iMac when Apple finally obsoletes it
The MacBook Air is the best Windows laptop.
Parallels on the M3 Pro is pretty good.
That’s mostly for hardware (mechanical/electrical/etc) engineers.

Software engineers all use Linux (since SpaceX rockets/satellites/etc run Linux), although you would usually just SSH into host machines so the laptops tend to be Windows. AFAIK that’s only because Windows laptops are easier to administer and cheaper, but some people also use MacBook’s as ultimately they just act as dumb terminals to some desktop somewhere. I still remember WFH being annoying because their crappy laptops couldn’t output 4K 60fps to my monitor lol.

Compared to what?

Intel Macs literally had the same hardware that you could get on a Windows PC, therefore windows used to run exactly the same 😅
That is highly relative considering how many different hardware options pc has.
They really care about design so, that the reason too why MacBook over xps for example
Lol so many upvotes 🤯🤣🤣🤣
Still does. I currently use Windows on my M2. Did for years on my 2015 Pro.
Windows 11 ARM is actually decent these days. I run it for free under vmware fusion personal license.
I bought my Intel MacBook Pro at the end of 2020 with this reason in mind. Now I often wonder if I should have just got an M1 so I could have had better battery life and less hand warmer functionality.
Completely agree. I just wish Apple put a bit more effort into the drivers. (More likely they know what they’re doing and make it a worse experience on purpose though)
Parallels is your friend
even tesla engineers care about build quality!
My job I use a Mac studio to edit video and other content on but there is a specific piece of software I need that only works on windows so I got parallels running it. It's not perfect but it gets the job done. Biggest issue is the software is old and not really designed for windows 11 let alone arm so it lags a bit.
ditto. dual booting has been around now since what, 2006? i did it then and i also have the last intel mbp before the m1 processors dropped. still dual boot. i use windows for steam gaming and max for everything else. maybe 8 years ago i used dual boot for work (solidworks/ansys on windows)
just out of curiosity: what macbook model are you dual booting on? one with a touch bar? asking because i don’t know if f keys are supported on a windows dual boot
> The build quality on MacBooks is unrivaled. And sometimes you need Windows to do work in specific industries. I still dual boot mine, which is the last of the intel based MacBooks. I will be hanging on to it for a while because you can’t do this with the newer ARM based MacBooks yet.

I ran out and bought the last Intel i9 MBPs too when they announced Apple Silicon. Glad I did!
But you can use Parallels, which I find even more convenient.
You’ve never tried a surface then. Build quality is superb and price to performance certainly better. Not saying that the new apple chips aren’t the best (which they are), but you pay the premium. Give it 1 year/ max 2 and windows on arm will (finally) be a thing.
The build quality on MacBooks is not ‘unrivaled’ lol. Did we just forget the Butterfly fiasco?

They’re nice laptops with a premium feel but their build quality is roughly on par with any other ultrabook.
They said they were updating the firmware of the truck so it’s probably some internal Tesla tool that only works on Windows
Any Linux ones?
yours 2019 macbook?
dual boot or vm? intel or apple silicon?
Uh Oh! You're caught in a temporal conundrum loop now.
[deleted]
Plausible but there's also a battery icon which suggests it's not a desktop or VM. The network icon being a computer instead of wifi signal implies it's on VPN or Ethernet.
Or VDI/Citrix.  That's what's going on with all the Macs in my office.
you can't ODB over RDP...?
Exactly. I have an M3 max but use Citrix to access my works environment which is Windows. At a glance it looks like I’m just running windows when I’m full screened into Citrix.
Not likely, this is a laptop for field work that's supposed to connect to the car via the diagnostics port. That's also almost certain to be the reason why it runs windows.

It's conceivable that it's possible to hook the port to an RDP machine or a VM, but a bitch to set up, when the easier path is right in front of you.
It’s an AS version
That was true in 2019, but not anymore.
Luckily serious engineering firms tend to use siemens NX these days which is far better than solidworks… pretty sure tesla does too
Absolutely no one in ME is using "macOS for work."  The only people that think that are MAC fan boys.
It hasn't been called OS X for almost a decade.
looks like an m2 air it doesn’t support bootcamp
Based. macOS is shit. Need to install a bunch of third party apps to get simple shit like aerosnap. Anyone saying random floating windows with wasted space is better is clearly a fanboy
Parallels is a one time purchase. You could get it for less than 100 bucks on Black Friday. There’s no need to buy the subscription if you just want to run Windows 11. Windows runs better on my M3 Pro than it does on my Surface Pro 8 i7 with it. There’s really no point in owning a Windows PC (EDIT: laptop!) if you own a Mac with Apple silicon. I’m going to sell my SP8.
How is C++ easier on Windows? Because of the IDEs available or something else?

What is the Tesla system/infotainment running on? Is it embedded Linux with all Tesla’s stuff on top?
MacOS isn't perfect, but honesltly, out of those two, Windows is the complete trash one.
Speed difference is negligible. Truest difference would be the Apple environment rarely caters to or have the infrastructure for techies. The brand is marketed primarily towards creatives,
It appears to be a 16" intel model. There was never a 16" M1 with the old chassis style.
No black anodizing beneath the keys (look at the arrow keys area) - it's a 2019 Intel 16". You can buy fleets of those with tons of RAM for dirt cheap so I'm assuming they're going to ride these as in-the-field beaters until they can no longer.
It seems to be the old 16" model, pre-M1 Pro. Take a look at the arrow keys, you'll see the silver color and not the new black one.

Greetings!

<\];{
A MacBook user that prefer Windows, you're rare, man. 😅
Bootcamp has been dead for years and completely impossible on apple silicon . It’s 99% parallels or another virtualization
I also happen to work for Parallels 🤘🏼
On on Intel Mac you can run Windows as a virtual machine inside Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or VirtualBox. Works great and you have access to both Windows and Mac environments at the same time. 

You can also set up a BootCamp partition and boot directly into Windows. You don't get access to both environments at once, but you can dedicate all of your CPU cores to windows. 

On an Apple Silicon Mac (ARM M1, M2, M3, etc) the only option I am aware of currently is to install Parallels Desktop. There is a free trial, and there's a setting in there to install a free trial version of Windows 11 for ARM. Runs great, in this environment you can even run Intel Windows software. The only limitation of which I'm aware is that you cannot install Intel Windows Device Drivers (ie .dll files).
Virtual Machine with Apple Silicon. On Intel Based, you could dual boot since it was the same x86 Architecture.
On an intel MacBook you can use windows Directly as long as you download the BootCamp drivers.. It is easiest to install a bootcamp partition and let apple guide you through install but you Actually can just format the Mac to a windows drive format and install windows and then the specific Bootcamp drivers to run Apple specific devices (Magic Mouse, Trackpad, etc...)

if you want to use NTFS for windows you sort of have to do the reformat and instal yourself which you can do after installing bootcamp if you wish..

Installing bootcamp sets up the Hardware to be able to access the Startup boot selection screen.

I have had one of my older intel MacBooks setup as a windows ONLY machine for quite sometime.  


My M1 however requires Parallels and Windows ARM of course.. the i7 Intel WMacbook windows runs about the same speed as the M1 VM.. The M1 VM however does have some compatibility issues at times that the direct loaded i7 did not
Run Bootcamp.
What were you using before Mac?
> So u can FINALLY! play fortnite on mac

Why make your Mac bad again?
Still runs smoother than on windows laptops
Hey, sometimes you just need to use an operating system that can do more than just edit your tik toks. 

I don't run windows on macbook because it looks nice. I run it because it can actually do things. And also I can't afford the laptop I wanted running windows so I had to buy the MacBook because it was cheaper.
You can use parallels or other virtualization software. Windows itself runs extremely well on my M2 air, not as good as boot camp as you can’t dedicate 100% of system resources to windows and most apps have to run through a compatibility layer that compromises functionality and performance that’s significantly worse than Rosetta 2.
I work in robotics and there are still random things you *need* windows for.  the rest (~80%) linux.  Almost nothing for macos, other than connecting directly to devices like you mentioned, via ssh, telnet, etc.
Makes sense as I am only experienced with EM engineers there and made a generalization.
My company whom is probably the top fintech allows developers to use Mac. They replaced my Intel MBP with an Apple Silicon MBP last year. We did have issues with Docker though.
Wow you seem to be making all of this up because what you’re saying is total BS.
Regardless of engineering and such, my work laptop doesn't support 4K60 either and that's exactly what I am struggling with in terms of WFH.
I mean you can still run windows in a VM it's just the arm verison
Used to boot in windows and play CS on the Mac…
Dual boot not allowed anymore?
Sure, and a corvette with an LT5 and a Honda civic both have engines so they are basically the same.  Apple has always gone over the top with hardware by default
Compared to Apple Silicon Macs. 


Dual booting vs. virtual machine
[https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/macbook-pro-declared-best-performing-windows-laptop/](https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/macbook-pro-declared-best-performing-windows-laptop/)
apple hardware quality has always been out of the park, especially compared to windows laptops
It’s quite a common saying in the tech world. Just means you haven’t heard it
UTM or nothing
Microsoft and Apple have both been guilty of this for years. Just like Microsoft making office for Mac super basic.
Gotta have a performance increase with the next version even when you have no ability to improve anything. Just remove the throttles.
Or UTM, which is completely free and open-source, Or VMWare Fusion which is also free (under personal license)
Surprisingly
They are. The Touch Bar turns into regular F row in windows
Surfaces have been around just as long as the MacBooks. Apples products just have better track records and support.
Up until like 3 years ago every Surface had an issue where the screen would progressively turn yellow. They also had serious issues with the batteries. They have horrible build quality.
On par with any other ultrabook? Lol from which company? There are decent contenders out there, but no true rival on build quality. Name a laptop that will consistently last longer & be supported longer than a MacBook & I’ll probably buy it. No other company comes close to the support Apple provides, when issues do occur. The butterfly key fiasco was resolved when they offered to service & replace those keyboards for free: https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks 

I can’t really think of a single other “ultrabook” company that hasn’t had worse issues with their laptops. And generally, they fail to address those issues in any meaningful way.
probably motor controller firmware
There are definitely some Android based ones that are popular
yes, used can-utils for my university research last year
is it possible to run mac natively on windows desktop?
VMs can show the battery status of the host, so that is still posible. A VM will show this network icon also because it is connected with a virtual network card to the virtual network by a virtual wire. (Some hypervisors allow you to ‘unplug the cable’ from the network adapter)
I dont know how these devices working, but possible to attach some devices to remote server.
Or it also can be a local vm with windows.
**It is not AS Version.** Apple Silicon Macbook Pro keyboard area is black, this is silver color.
Not sure why you’re saying that, clearly only only has usb c ports on the left, no notch, and you can see the aluminum frame between the arrow keys (unlike the black base on the AS).
Based on the spaces from the edges of the laptop to the keyboard, I guess that this is a MacBook Pro 15" model, so definitely this is an old Intel MacBook.

If the spaces in question were a bit smaller, it would be much harder to guess because then it could be the 13" Pro running the M1 chip.
Well, for casual things like browsing the web, editing pdfs, editing photos and videos I much prefer MacOS for things like excel, databases and so on, windows without a doubt.

It surely depends on what you intend as “work” (a builder for example doesn’t even need a computer to work).

I for example used windows at my workplace since all we did was excel, some word and most of the times we used a browser based software with Mozilla thunderbird. I’m sure if I was on MacOS I would have struggled a bit more but at home guess what I use 99% of the time? MacOS
Lol that reminds me of one of my engineering friends. He got a mbp from work. First thing his boss said was to put Linux on it so he can do some actual work
It’s not. No notch. Looks like an Intel 16”
I’m not so sure I agree with that last sentence. Windows has uses that Mac just can’t touch (gaming [no, GPTK doesn’t count], backwards support for legacy 32-bit applications, flexibility in hardware choice, etc.) however I’d compromise and say that if you have an Apple Silicon MacBook, there’s no point in owning a Windows laptop.
Really? I didn’t see that option. Oh well, I’m using UTM anyways. 

Totally agree as far as laptops go. MacBooks are superior in every way. But I do like having an AMD desktop.
It’s a pretty complicated question is what I’ve heard, but I think it comes down to available compilers and what not. I’m not a professional programmer by any means, so I don’t want to pull something out of my ass. 

I’m not gonna say I know this for sure, but I highly doubt Tesla would depend on anybody else’s OS. They’ve probably built their own, either using Linux as a foundation, or straight up done all the coding for it. They need to know every single in-and-out of the vehicle; software and hardware.
How so? MacOS does absolutely nothing good when it comes to power users. The window management is absolute garbage, the system settings are even worse than windows, compatibility with older apps is terrible, development tools are inferior to even Android studio, and even worse, dual boot is non existant for new Mx cpus. What is it actually good for, browsing on safari? lol.
> rarely caters to or have the infrastructure for techies

Turn up to a Python or Ruby conference and MacBooks will typically outnumber windows laptops.

Windows still dominates in corporates, but if you’re a startup or tech company with a SaaS or web product then you’re most likely targeting Linux as the deployment platform. The fact that Macs have Unix underpinnings makes them more convenient to work with than windows (even with WSL) or the slowly smouldering disaster that is desktop Linux.
What’s the battery life on them
Good eye there, it’s easier to spot the lack of MagSafe conector tho!
Nope. Black keyboard cutout stated with the AS version. 16” Intel MBP has silver base
No magsafe says it all.
This should be about any previous Windows user switching to macOS becuse he did not know how outdated macOS is.
but this is not an apple silicon machine
Please work on direct X 12 😭
device drivers are not dynamic link libraries.. Pretty much every program needs DLLs

Device Drivers are probably native to x86 and cannot be executed on ARM, so you'd need ARM Device drivers .. for everything. And that's the catch. With bootcamp, Apple provides windows device drivers for everything. Without bootcamp support, you're on your own to find device drivers for all Apple hardware that's on ARM Mx board.

Same thing happened with any 64-bit Windows. You could still run 32-bit programs, but all your device drivers have to be 64-bit.
On Apple Silicon you can use [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)
I run windows 11 ARM on my MBA M1 using VM Fusion. Runs really well
What kind of drivers are you talking about? The whole point of VMs is to virtualize the hardware anyway so it’s not common for one to install hardware drivers on them.
Vmware fusion now has the option to download Windows 11 ARM, plus VMware fusion player is free. Not like parallels which is $75 a year.
I used it on my base MBA M1 and it worked very nice.
user of m2 macbook air here: vmware fusion works too.
Happy Cake day! Also, thanks for the info.
The only issue I have with parallels is that it costs so much
I use UTM which is completely free (unlike parallels which is a free 14 day trial) and works quite well.
Happy cake day!
[deleted]
On Apple silicon, I use VMware Fusion. Windows 11 works pretty well.
Removing Boostcamp from the M machines was a HORRIBLE idea
You can run Parallels on Mac with MX (M1-M3) architecture as well. It works really well

You can also use UTM on Apple Silicon to load Windows
There’s also the VMware fusion tech preview for free for both prossesors
Lol, I expect folks feeling superior about "no video games" on the Mac sub.

Must be very exciting (for the others reading), to hear about M3
fact lol
I always hear people say this but other than more video game opinions I’m not sure what you are getting at.  I’m a software engineer and I would literally quit my job if they made be develop on a windows machine.
Mac is actually better for Software Development than Windows given its UNIX nature.
might as well get a pc at that point if an extremely long battery life isn't needed
Just wondering, what do you need Windows for? Most people that I know in robotics work in Linux.
Did you try the subsystem for Linux on Windows to see if it works there?

I like the combination, because it allows me to use continue using Windows, but then have access to Linux terminal apps. Best of both worlds. If it wasn't for that, I'd swap 100% over to MacOS.
Are you running Docker locally?
[removed]
wait you can’t run x86 windows on apple silicon in a vm?
I still do

I also play cyberpunk, lethal company, etc since I have a maxed out last gen Intel Mac haha
Nope ): 

Since moving to apple silicon they depreciated bootcamp and dual booting.
Sorry to break it to you, but that’s simply not true.

Let’s take a 2017 MacBook Pro, it shipped with a 128GB SSD, an i5 7360U (dual core 2.3Ghz), 8GB of Ram for 1299$ in the US.

In 2017 at the same price you could have bought a Windows Laptop with 16GB of Ram, 500GB SSD and an i7.
I don’t think that’s what he meant
A 400$ laptop was the best among the Windows laptop, with better performance than a 1000$ Windows laptop.

Very reliable I must say.
Again, this is simply a lie.

If we talk about the hardware that makes a laptop powerful, at MacBook prices, you were getting hardware well below the average. Certainly, the build quality was infinitely better than any other Windows laptop. But when it comes to pure hardware, with Intel, at the same price, you could get much better.

This doesn’t mean that overall windows laptops were better, cause with a MacBook you also get MacOS.
Some 17 year old who still thinks all Macs are overpriced garbage with no advantages, particularly in programming.
you study in utm?
And you can run SPARC OS!
so microsoft added this feature in their iso for people who dual boot? wow
The X1 Carbon line is generally considered very reliable and Lenovo’s warranty system is way better than apples. Very modular and repairable laptops, tbh you might not even need support to fix it.

Meanwhile, Apple was going to charge my fiancé the price of a brand new MacBook to replace a failed component in her 3 year old MBA. And the Butterfly keyboard was failing as well. 3 year old laptop btw, I can find 20 year old IBM Thinkpads that still work on eBay lol.

I’ve had some success with the Dell XPS line as well, along with the Precisions.

I can’t think of a time where a laptops keyboard failed as bad as Butterfly. Maybe you have some examples? It’s nice they provided extra warranty for it but reliability is generally considered just making a laptop that doesn’t break.
I'll agree.  Was in film production and used  MacOS for that.  It's not an manufacturing engineering thing, though.  The only ones using it in industry are execs.
wait you’re right there’s no magsafe either
Yes, I agree with you. That’s what I actually meant, should have worded it clearer.
As a power user (full stack developer), I kindly disagree with you. I cannot imagine myself using a windows machine. But everyone has different preferences and if you like Windows more – sure, use it. It doesn't mean that MacOS doesn't work for someone else though.
I have had both for years. Too many issues and random failures on a Mac. iCloud caused me to lose ALL data on my iPad, and the Mac 2 separate times while I was on the phone with support. Awesome for developers... don't care. The basic functions of windows cost money on Mac. Need a decent software? Easily found for free on windows. Mostly high one time cost, or subscriptions with mac. If I want to transfer 30 gbs of of movies or music, it can't be done much quicker on a PC with the "same transfer rate". PC isn't throttled like iOS. Apple has major syncing issues. The fact that Apple caters to the. "User experience" is laughable compared to PC. Custom builds, emulation, no weird display issues. I use Mac for work only because I'm required to. One thing aside from transfer speeds, is torrenting on Mac is pretty decent. Nothing on the Mac pops out as outstanding to me by any means.
Quite poor especially in Windows since the dedicated GPU doesn't switch off like it does in macOS - but probably comparable to most large screen Windows ultrabooks. I would guess like 3-5 hours.
Right, the one pictured has a silver base. Look at the arrow key area. The part where it begins to recess is black on Apple Silicon models.
I am MacOS user since my childhood. I switched to the windows after that. It feels way more relaxed. MacOS feels more good shape and user friendly but i choose one if it’s gonna be main pc of mine.
Well, let me clarify then. Device drivers are typically distributed as .dlls but you're right, not every .dll is a device driver. 

> Device Drivers are probably native to x86 and cannot be executed on ARM

Well, .exe files are also native to x86 and most definitely can be run on ARM under Parallels, as can non-driver .dlls. Device drivers are a special case though, and it doesn't appear there exists yet an emulation later to handle the types of system calls device drivers typically make.
Why won't Apple provide ARM device drivers for M series and give Bootcamp access? These new Macs would make insanely good Windows computers.
Never heard of it but thanks for the tip. I'm installing Windows 10 in emulation mode right now but it looks like it's gonna be painfully slow.

*ETA: and the windows installation failed after about a half hour*
Running x64 code on apple silicon is slow enough to be unusable.
how does it perform daily tasks, i was planning to get parallels but its way to expensive. main usage is coding and developing, could you please guide me. 

MBA M1 base spec.
Depends which hardware we're talking about. This is certainly true of, say, the network interface. In the case of USB devices, some can be handled by the host. But some USB devices can't be handled by the host and need to be passed through to the VM and let the VM's device drivers deal with them. In my specific use case, there are no MacOS drivers for the USB device in question. On my Intel Mac the USB port gets passed to Windows 10 and Windows device drivers handle this USB device. It's the only reason I keep that Intel Mac around. I currently can't do this on an ARM Mac.
Basically if the hardware you're trying to use isn't supported by the host OS (MacOS) it's not going to work in Parallels either.
SaaS welcomes you.. 😂 literally everything is heading in that direction, including Windows.
Or you could install Osx Sonoma on an external ssd drive.
Sonoma runs great on older Mac even thought they are not supported :-)
80% of users are using Windows for gaming only
Must be because you never were a Windows user. I have a mac now, and while the hardware is excelent, the OS is trash comparing it to Windows and Linux
Same
Not if you only need windows every now and then. I have it for the few programs that are windows only, I needed windows to flash firmware on a usb-c hub as the utility wasn’t offered on Mac, or if I need to work with an ntfs drive for example.
A lot of the mechanical and electrical robotic automation, things like ELMOs for fine motor control for movement of the robot. Things like solidworks and altium both want windows, aswell as their supporting server components. A lot of enterprise software was written for windows 10-20 years ago and no one has made the move. Think all the reasons windows maintains backwards compatibility and you’ll realize why; a huge amount of enterprise software sits on windows.
simulations game engines autocad
yep, I love WSL!  Can do GUI now too, as well as ML stuff.  Most of the time I need Linux these days I either use WSL or Docker to dev in, rest of the time I'm actually remoted in to something like a Jetson.

I use all 3 OSs daily... keeps me on my toes.
Yes.
I just run UTM it’s free runs windows arm fine I use it for some apps from work
UTM is a free and open-source software made for Apple silicon. It’s pretty nice.
VMWare has a free license for personal use, it's just buried on the site and you need to register to obtain it for free.

Ninja: I see someone mentioned this. Well, it being hard to find is why nobody knows, although I'm fairly sure it's mentioned somewhere on the download page.
VMWare Fusion for macOS is 100% free for personal use
Hehe nmac.to but remember. With a great power,  comes a great responsibility.

 But to be honest. It's a great site full of Torrents for Mac only. U have to be cautious ofc since it's torrents you download but it's a great place to put your hands on a software normally is out of your range. Don't use it for work, just for educational purposes as an advice.
You are aware it is available and free only requiring a email?
use parallels with pd runner. completely free
Sure but then your running Emulation not virtualization
Out of curiosity, how does this perform? Been considering picking up and Intel machine for this reason
I’ve seen a project on YT, which goal is to add ability to install Windows on Apple Silicon Mac. Windows already boots in his videos, but doesn’t work properly yet due to missing drivers for Apple Silicon. If it succeeds, it’d be really awesome, we will be able to play some high end games with great performance, currently M1 can barely run GTA 5
Dang it! I just upgraded
i’d still rather have the macbook. hell, i still daily drive a 2016 macbook pro. can’t think of a single windows laptop that is 7 years old that would have made it this long being used every day
Can you make a modern comparison.  I know my 2018 mbp had an i7 and 16 gb of ram.  I didn’t buy a 2017 and can’t verify the accuracy of that statement.
Please keep in mind that this was back in early 2010’s, at full height of the pc vs mac cost comparison war. 

From my humble personal experience and memory, the main point was that for PC laptops to have lower prices, they had to cut costs and roll back on components somewhere; didn’t matter much where, but they *had* to "cheap out" on something.  And the thing is, overall performance is only as strong as the weakest link.  Apple didn’t cheap out on hardware quality; they ensured to have every component equally performing across the board so to speak, down to the keyboard and trackpad. (Please ignore the smallish default amount of RAM they provided, it was still highly performing hardware-wise). 

Now, when considering for example Toshiba or HP laptops, they *had* to cut somewhere—sometimes it was the bus speed, sometimes the hard drive had a slower rpm, the video card was just awful if not absent, or the cpu was underperforming. And these were the only options available by "default", out of the box.  If you *had* to have "equally perfect" performance—on a laptop nonetheless, then you had to go custom—then again depending on which and wether brands offered, and then the price would severely jack up.

At the same time, Windows had started embedding full-depth analysis of hardware components within the system settings, indicating which systems were performing sub-par, which also led to some brands to get duly-shamed for cheaping out.

Also, Apple had finally shifted to Intel CPUs for a while, which led to better and easier analysis of the the "true" cost vs performance, to which some reviews started pointing at it, that, maybe, considering everything and all, Apple MacBooks weren’t ***that*** pricier after all.
Uhh go Skyhawks?
Ahahbahahahha nah Apple added it 

Microsoft don’t support their own hardware imagine doing this for MacBooks 😂😂😂😂

It gets installed when you first boot into windows together with all drivers that the MacBook needs. All is of course provided by Apple
Oof
You still didn't explain why windows is the trash one. Personal preference has little to do with it when comparing two operating systems. 
I'm a full stack developer, along with assembly, C++, graphics dev, UI, .NET, mobile, infra, sysadmin, and everything else in between. For the love of god, trying to do any work on a mac is a nightmare past having a couple of things open.
>Nothing on the Mac pops out as outstanding

Battery life?

I run both Mac (work) & Windows (home). I'm not suggesting that Macs are at all perfect: "it just works" is a lie if you do anything even vaguely non-standard (eg after 15 years and 5 macs *every single one* has been flaky when connecting dual external monitors)

Based on talking about movies/music/torrenting/syncing I'm guessing you don't use it for software development? I don't use/need any of the things you mentioned so I have no opinion on it.

I'm simply saying that if you develop software that is intended run on linux/unix Macs *are* outstanding. They're incomparably more convenient than Windows. For developers who care about this, the comparison is not against windows but against Linux.
Ah, I’ve got an m1 2020 MacBook Air I really want a 16inch Mac what do you recommend really I don’t really wanna be spending more than 1.2k
Device drivers usually end with .sys extension. However usually with driver installation you can get supporting software like libraries (DLL) and executables. Anything can be bundled with it. For example, if you have NVIDIA graphics card, it will install OpenGL libraries along with device drivers.

Executable are easier to port because machine code specific to one CPU can be emulated on a different CPU platform easily, and generally it doesn't require more than just a CPU. That's been done a lot.

Linux did emulate Windows device driver model when nobody wanted to make WiFi drivers on Linux (ndiswrapper)
[deleted]
Drivers are usually distributed as inf files bruh
MS has a deal with the competition.

Because ms hasn’t released a windows distribution than can run on Apple silicon bare metal (ARM) . No point.
Because they want people to buy Macs to use MacOS. They want to try and coerce an increase in MacOS market share
[removed]
It runs very smoothly. It’s a development version of ARM windows 11 as officially it isn’t available, but everything works (in my experience). To be fair I haven’t run anything too major on it, but it hasn’t skipped a beat. My MBA is 256gb 16gb.

I am pretty technically savvy, but just followed a YouTube video which explained everything. I’ll try find it and send it to you. 

The only caveat I would say is it does eat quite a bit of storage having two OS’s installed, so you may need to remove some things off it.
I used windows for years. Incredibly slow.  And the hardware in the laptops was awful.  About a decade ago the dev scene started going towards Apple.  Clean, fast and works better with Linux systems.  When I got my first company issues Mac I realized what I was missing.  I ended up replacing my personal machine shortly afterwards
yep, exactly.  CAD + a lot of enterprise stuff.  And my first robotics example was for motor controller software too, but there's also PLC software and tons of other configuration tools -- all of which was last updated in what feels like 1997.
Solidworks works solid on M3 Pro through parallels 🤷🏼‍♀️
I use mostly Windows and MacOS, but occasionally Linux on our jump servers and through WSL. Love WSL!
UTM doesn't support hw gpu acceleration.
I’ll take a look thank you!
It wasn’t the last time I was looking at it which was a while ago tbf
[deleted]
would that be an issue?
Well enough - don’t expect the same performance as a dedicated gaming laptop but I’m playing cyberpunk on low settings at 30-40 fps. The biggest downside is the battery life isn’t great, I’m getting 5 hours on macOS for day to day tasks like emails and browsing web. But it’s really nice to have just one Mac that can run even windows games alright
I have never duel booted, because I don’t want to pay for windows but I can run games natively like BG3 with maxed out settings on a 2020 MBP with an eGPU
>GTA 

Native windows will not change anything in terms of gaming performance of M1.
i think i found the video you're talking about, and it's most certainly fake. it would not get all the way to the desktop with missing drivers.
I can’t imagine a windows laptop making it to seven years.  I had 4 personal windows laptops before I switched to Mac.  Only one lasted to 3 years.
Yeah, your choice, but this has nothing to do with the statement that started this conversation.
I was trying to say that making a statement like OP, claiming that MacBooks used to run Windows better, doesn't make much sense.

It's not like MacBooks have some magical component; the smooth performance of Windows depends on how clean the installation is and the hardware used.

If you compare a $1500 MacBook to a $900 laptop, obviously, the MacBook will have better hardware, and therefore, it will run Windows better.
oh ok didn’t know this, thanks :)
My main issue with windows is that it introduces unnecessary annoying features in almost every update, which I have to go and turn off. Mac doesn't do that. Having mutliple things open isn't really an issue – some apps I put to fullscreen, some I leave windowed. The absence of alt-tab is annoying, but can be fixed by installing a simple app. Moreover, for me, the mac's terminal is far superior to window's shell or cmd. Maybe i didn't learn to use it properly, but it’s a pain whenever I have to. Plus, MacBooks' build quality, trackpad, etc. places Macs way above any Windows machine for me. And one more thing – I believe that personal preference does matter, MacOS is for me a lot easier to use and navigate through.
I really wouldn't get an Intel laptop at all, it will be a downgrade from your M1 even at high spec. They run hot, the fans are loud even doing basic tasks and the battery life is not great. 

I think if I were you I'd look for a used 2021 16" with the M1 Pro chip. That'd be a nice machine.
Yes drivers are .sys and .inf
Thank you. Yes, this is the most complete answer. I'd forgotten about .sys files - I'm not a Windows guy. Bottom line is I still need a way to run x86 Windows drivers within a VM hosted on an ARM Mac and currently there's no way to do that that I am aware of.

BTW, it's common to have to install third-party kext files if you do anything weird with networking - VPN, Little Snitch, macFUSE, etc.
.inf file is just [a text file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INF_file), bruh.
the inf file just contains info ABOUT the device and the driver, it is not the driver itself
So does Apple, Microsoft is just following Apple's lead.
But they have Windows 11 on ARM?
No the bootloader is unlocked, there just isn't much to run on an ARM-based laptop besides MacOS. Asahi Linux still isn't in a place where it's ready for real use afaik.
Mac OS is free. What gain is that for them?
Just to confirm: use native arm mode but install x86 windows?
You are right about Windows laptop hardware, hopefully we will get powerfull ARM Windows/Linux laptops next year. For me the UI on Mac feels slower than Windows, and Windows slower than Ubuntu. This is because the UI engine on mac is decades years old, and all they do is change how it looks, the codebase is too old. As for Dev, I believe Windows is better than Mac because Windows gets improved, we got WSL, now they added Dev Drives, the Terminal app is better than on Mac. MacOS is stale, and we can only blame Apple for it.

Windows laptops are bad, especially those from Dell, which I am forced to use at my workplace… I don’t know what dell did, but it’s worse than my Windows laptop from 10 years ago. I believe Dell is to blame, I get throtled to 400Mhz from time to time while the fan is barely spinning.
I’m not using some Mac to host enterprise software through virtualization/emulation.
There’s a world beyond games, hence why i said I use it for work :)
Not everyone needs windows for exclusively games.
Well that honesty sucks and to be fair it vmware has not been updated since July so I can see them charging for the full version when it's released for me only playing games it's fine but if you need work done yeah it's screwed up good luck finding something viable till 2024/25 whenever the license expires
lol so it’s bad for companies to require employees to show up now? 😂🤣
It’s DRASTICALLY slower like orders of magnitude because the cpu has to literally remap instructions from one architecture to another
You don’t have to pay for Windows and haven’t for years
Unnecessary, but doesn't take away from the value of the actual OS.  Installing an app to fix an inherently broken OS is a downside in any scenario. 

Windows terminal is far superior to the native terminal OSX has these days. 

I have nothing but good things to say about the MacBook hardware, it's the OS.
Ah I see yeah il take a look at that machine, thanks
It's still the most common form I see drivers distributed for windows
In fact
Driver files are quite literally just a fancy text file
Pre installed as OEM.  You can’t buy retail. VMware offer a single language download as part of the install.
But Asahi linux is going so slow because apple did not provide drivers, no?
Yeah true, but that wasn't my argument though....
Users -- which attracts developers. 

A lot of people don't use / like Macs because certain games and software aren't available. 

If there's more users, it's more lucrative to invest in supporting MacOS in development. 

A lot of games can run smoothly on the m1 and later. 

Albeit they really should develop support for pcie4x16 external GPUs.... 🤷‍♂️
no, use native ARM mode and install Windows 11 for ARM.

BTW, VMWare Fusion is free too and runs a lot better.
What????   WSL isn’t needed for Mac because Mac is natively compatible with Linux. The X server is slightly different but Apple supplies X Quartz free of charge to handle remote Linux gui’s. Not sure what your problem with the terminal app is but there are plenty of Linux terminals ported to mac. Personally I like the default one and have never found a windows terminal I like except minGW, but that is just windows running Linux.  As far as the speed of the UI I have never found it to be slow.  What operation exactly is slow?
well when that company’s only motivation is to pay off their office buildings then yeah
Thanks, if I only use it for very basic things on M2 will it still be an issue? (other than battery drain)
Yeah imagine giving Microsoft your money, couldn’t be me 😂
I installed it on my son’s machine about a year ago.  It nags you until you pay.
For me, having to hassle with all the annoying features does take away a lot of the OS's value. I want to work, not to fix-up all the things the last update messed up. And that never happens with MacOS, but somehow happens all the time on Windows.

I guess both of us have different terminal needs. I'm not saying the Windows one is bad, it just doesn't suit me.

 I agree with the alt-tab once again, but, I don't even use the app sice I rarely ever need to alt-tab, so it doesn't bother me.
Uh, no they're not. Stop. Just. Stop.
E-GPU’s are plug and play on Mac as long as it’s not NVIDIA. Conversely they suck on windows laptops.
Thats what im running currently and its fantastic!
Mac is not compatible with Linux, you can’t run apps compiled for Linux, Docker needs a Linux VM to run containers on mac which is a big letdown. Docker Desktop is slow, at least there is OrbStack but still you can’t run native containers…

As for being slow, open Chrome, you wait like 5 seconds with no idea what’s going on… Open Settings and start navigating, you also wait a lot, like they have no idea what to display next and start gathering settings from god knows where and after that they will navigate to the tab you clicked... The Finder app is also slow and outdated. Just try Ubuntu to compare, it’s blazing fast.

The terminal on Mac just looks old, I bet they did not improve much in it’s UI over a decade.
It’s the other way around, Sonoma broke File Sharing, Parsec and OrbStack. The 3 apps I use all the time on a mac mini. 

What annoying features did Windows introduce? We got dark mode in most microsoft apps, a better Terminal than on mac, tabs in Notepad, tabs in file explorer, layers in paint, copilot, wsl, dev drives, zip support and many more. 

Tell me what new features on macOS we got? The ability to disable mouse acceleration in 2023? This must be a joke!
Well, one last thing - I have rarely had a windows update actually break anything, and I have 6 PCs in my home alone I manage.

Mac OS managed to do that multiple times like requiring apps to be fully signed to work, breaking my dev env multiple times, not allowing older signed or unsigned apps (unless you find some obscure work around) , or even requiring xcode update after the osx update, which in turn requires me to update my ios devices to continue developing apps.

MacOS updates are FAR worse in that regard. Windows just either rolls back your installation, or makes edge your default browser. Takes a few seconds to fix. Heck, my build agents on my windows machines are still alive after many years, on mac, after every major update, it's a coin toss, and hours of wasted time trying to fix.

Linux servers just power through anything, don't want to update? cool, not gonna pressure you, i'll see you in a few months again.
What are they then
Since you know so well
The latest GPUs for and I believe are 6000 series. 

I think they are limited to pcie 3.0 x4 speeds though. 

Looking online, the 2000 series from Nvidia aren't bottlenecked, but 3080 loses around 20% afaik, and 4090 loses 70%. 

So there's a bottleneck in bandwidth. I wish they'd  make a new egpu standard for faster speeds, and then allow AMD, Nvidia, Intel, etc to make drivers for Mac.
Ah, thank you /u/leofravega and /u/daelsant but that doesn't help me. 

Further up the thread I mentioned I tried running Win 11 ARM under Parallels, and yes it did run great, except I was unable to load a necessary x86 Windows device driver to run the one program that was the whole point of installing Windows in the first place.

It works on an Intel Mac which I'd like to retire but can't quite yet. This is why I tried running UTM in emulation mode, and it was slow as molasses and the Windows install failed anyway.
What exactly are you trying to do? Mac cannot execute the ELF file format without emulation. Neither can windows.  WSL does this seemlessly but I really don’t understand the advantage. Either ssh into the Linux system you are working with and run it natively or recompile it on mac so it can be run natively.

Chrome is slow on any machine.  It more of a virus than a web browser.  I use safari or Firefox.

Finally, what is it that you don’t like about the Mac terminal? I honestly don’t understand what functionality is missing.  You say that the UI is old but it’s a black screen.  What do you expect? I’ve used a lot of different terminals, all which can be installed on a Mac, and I don’t see any advantages over the basic terminal.
Can't win against macos fans, even when you're a user lol.
What’s a film editing technique you never noticed before but once you saw it now you can’t unsee it?
I’ll start it first. I noticed that sometimes shows need a reaction from an actor that was never originally shot.

So they’ll take a clip, reverse it, intercut with an insert, the play it back normally.

There’s a clip in the first season of The Bear where Ritchie calls the cops on some mobsters.

They literally used a shot of him looking away, then reversed it so it looks like he’s turning his head towards camera.

It worked pretty good, except you can always tell when it’s reversed because the actor’s eyes follow their head movement which gives away that it’s unnatural.

And now I can’t believe how many films use this ALL THE TIME!
[deleted]
People/car/etc. passing in front of the lens, providing a good cut point

Didn't notice it til my editing mentor taught that trick. now i use it all the time too
When I used to do video production I would shoot and edit. I’d always hit record way before “action” and hit stop way after “cut”, those little moments of people before and after were always great reaction shots to use.
Dropped frames on fight impacts.
When there’s an over-the-shoulder close up reaction of someone, but you can tell it’s from a different moment, or they altered the timing of it because you can see the mouth moving on the character whose shoulder is in the foreground, but you don’t hear them.
the audio from the next scene starting just before the cut
Some of the proudest moments of my entire LIFE are sitting back by and marveling at my Frankenstein monsters.
The "multiple impact/explosion". It used to happen more frequently in the 80s-90s, but many films still do that today. Basically, when there is an explosion or something like someone being thrown out of a window shattering the glass, you would be shown the beginning of it, and then, instead of cutting on action, the editor would actually "replay" the beginning of said explosion or action from a different angle.
Music that goes from crappy speakers in a car to the full definition version (or the other way if it fits).
That warp stabiliser boat at sea.
i notice backwards clips really often too, because when i'm editing i think i'm going to be so sneaky and do that then it looks really bad. so I'm like yikes i guess not...

then i see it used in a big production and i'm thinking, huh... guess they were okay with that? (my only assumption is the producer REALLY wanted that reaction shot and they didn't have any alternative..)
here's a great technique for editors that needs to be done on set - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFuJp6oIMPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFuJp6oIMPk)
A couple tell-tale techniques:

First, the in-car shot right before the sudden collision is always a skosh too long, usually with the 'driver' not watching the road. So just as soon as you think "Hey, watch the road, dummy... BANG, T-boned by a red-light runner.

Next, in old-school film-only post production, you can often tell when a dissolve is about to take place because you can see the generation loss in the film grain at the match cut before the optical dissolve. Most visible on stuff originated on 16mm, or lower-budget 35.  Really telegraphs the upcoming dissolve. 

Last is the random isolated shot of some apparently minor piece of evidence or character action that will "turn out" to be key to the plot later on. Seen mostly in TV police procedurals. Around here, it elicits the cryptic comment, "Well, that's not there for no reason..." Lots of examples in the streamer "Will Trent".
[deleted]
This is more sound editing that anything else, but might still apply: how there seems to be only a few usable sounds in Hollywood for horses neighing or bears roaring and they are used every, damn, time. Maybe hearing those same animal sounds in World of Warcraft for years and years made them super recognizable to me, because I really can't unhear it haha.
Not really a technique, but morph cuts. Just watched To Kill a Tiger, and it's a powerful film, but man those morph cuts drove me crazy
I wouldn’t say that’s a technique, more that they didn’t get it while shooting and the editor had to save the scene. Sometimes there no other choice. 

A technique that (is a great technique but) is usually overdone is getting really loud, and cutting to silence. Or getting to silence and cutting to something really loud. I’ve seen some movies that have that almost every scene.
Ridley Scott's pointless stuttering post slo mo
When someone is talking and they cut to a shot from behind the speaker and their jaw movement isn’t synced with what they’re saying
When the music tells us how to feel before the scene does. Takes me out of the film each time.
When they cut to empty coffee cups
i do this all the time
The Texas Switch. The more obvious the better.
Pulling a frame out of a punch. To make the hit and reaction look more realistic.
I want to read a book on cutting on the closing of doors.
The cool as heck opening shots of the city that you just KNOW were bought from a stock footage supplier
>They literally used a shot of him looking away, then reversed it so it looks like he’s turning his head towards camera.

I noticed it as soon as it played and actually called it out to my girlfriend, then we rewinded and she was like YOU'RE RIGHT!!!!
Eye tracing match cuts
I don’t know the technical terminology for it - I believe it’s a split diopter shot but may have that mixed up with something else - but that shot usually found in thrillers/horrors when it shows somebody’s panicked face in a close-up, but the background is also in focus. Usually it shows the fear on somebody face when they’re hiding from someone or something in the background. There’s always that blurred seam where they’ve feathered and comped the two shots together. Every time I see it I think, it should be so easy to hide that seam, at least in the post After-Effects world. Wouldn’t take long to mask animate it. Or have the mask follow straight lines of the set. Maybe it’s for effect but it always pulls me straight out of the movie. 

Similarly, any time I watch a long ‘oner’, I’m more focused on finding the stitches than just enjoying the story. 1917 was awesome but the whole time I’m just thinking, ‘There! There! Maybe there too?’
This one’s more of a personal pet peeve. When music (usually more obnoxious when it’s diagetic) wraps up just as the scene wraps up - IE, a needledrop song plays it’s ending out as if the song ended perfectly in sync with the scene. it’s too pat, too synchronous for me. For reference: see any episode of Boardwalk Empire

edit to add: this is specifically for needle drop music in dramatic narrative.
The long, no-cut single shots, like the incredible ones in Children of Men.
Literally?
I love when the person being interviewed talks in past tense and needs to be in present. But honestly that’s the field producers fault. Now it’s a frankenbit nightmare.
Netflix docuseries are especially egregious in this area. I worked on a feature verite doc, and we did some stitching things together under broll, but we were constantly asking ourselves if we were honestly communicating the ideas portrayed by our characters, vs cutting things together to convey our own ideas. It’s can be a tricky balance. 

But man the Netflix docs, it sometimes seems like they’re creating sentences where every other word is an edit. It’s hard to believe there isn’t some creative editing to make things more entertaining, and that makes it easy to doubt the docs veracity.
The majority of my Frankenbites are due to the interviewee being unable to string a sentence together correctly. Mostly a grammar thing I find…
If you’re not concocting a cohesive soundbyte out of some poorly spoken train of thought, are you really editing?
If they're done smoothly, they should be invisible like everything else.

I've had producers tell me they don't remember that line read or bite being said. I say "yup."
I *always* try to explain to people what goes on when you're seeing b-roll. You've just put it perfectly:

>when an interviewee isn't on cam... its a madhouse under there
I’m an editor and I can tell you this is only getting worse as well - I’ve had clients Frankenbiting but supplementing it with A.I. audio of the interviewees voice to get them to say exactly what they need them to.
“Do we have b-roll to cover it?” Oh, it’s time to get nasty with this soundbite
 MasterChef Australia might as well just use AI voiced scripts at this point, it's gotten so bad.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ashO7GeFEE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ashO7GeFEE)
Every time my wife comments on something someone said in a reality show my question is always "Did you SEE them say it?"
It's so gross I hate doing them
Why is it called frankenbite?
Yup. Just had to cover a 45 second conversation all off camera. So many cut aways. “Can u make this feel more real” “can they be on camera for this line?” Fukin BRAVO.
Doing a bunch of brand film docs right now and dealing with this so much, it is what it is though.
I first noticed this from the [Left 4 Dead's main menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CGqSkckg_4) background video. I thought it was clean!
First noticed this in Scott Pilgrim, very stylistically done, and later in the first season of Sherlock, where it was done much more subtlety but also really cleanly and eye catching for me in a different way than Scott Pilgrim.
I'm consciously trying to stop pulling selects off this now. I include so much crap, if there's a nice wipe.
Of course!
I use these a lot in my films. It’s like you’re getting all kinds of alternate reaction takes that are always very natural and unburdened by there being no windup to hit a line or specific beat. 

My new feature has a few of these moments in use and they definitely helped in the edit as we mostly only did two takes per shot before moving on.
Yeah I did this when I used to make shorts. Been a very long time now though.
Along these lines, it's always entertaining to see when they "take" the scene too early -- so early you can see the talent reacting to "action".
I miss the heads and tails on 16/35mm film shots. You can emulate with some success by speed ramping and over exposing in post (or plugins), but it's never quite the same, takes more time, and you don't get the happy accidents. I liked my free, built in flash frame effects on every take.
Recently saved a scene with this. It wasn’t a fight, a mother pushes her daughter during an argument and she falls. The moment kept looking like the mother is not pushing her hard enough for her to fall down. Without that moment the scene wasn’t working. Dropped a frame, suddenly it was all very sad to watch the mother violently push her daughter.
oh i don’t actually understand this technique, would you mind explaining?
the old Monty Python slap. I love it. [I used it once](https://youtu.be/eVwJK986GxM?si=S2ZbyGq8JR-2MaTV&t=76) in a zombie short film where my mom got whacked with a frying pan
I'm not sure what you mean by this, can you link an example plz? Thx! 
Yes!
Can you explain what that means, any examples on YouTube?
Yeah, I remember the first time I saw this was way back when Braveheart was in theaters.
this one i’ve seen in every movie and series i’ve watched on the past 10 years
Was about to say this. You cannot unsee these moments and can really put you off when it’s in a movie or series.
Unless production wasn’t rushed and foreground and camera were stable enough to facilitate quick compositing.
i had to stop watching Billions on showtime because they did this so much that it drove me crazy
This is the worst.  "Nevermind that his mouth is moving but he's not talking.  Just use it!  Goooo!!"  Honestly this is probably at least 75% of the reverse dialogue shots.
I feel like this one has gotten excessive over the last few years. Seems like a lot more projects are getting heavily rewritten in post.
Good ol J cut
A part of my job is finding chapter points for dvd/blu-ray/digital. Dialogue bleeding between scenes = bane of my existence.
It’s amazing even how much game shows are edited down for time and messed with.
Same! The undetectable Frank’nEdit is my specialty!! And when I’ve done a good one, I will take a minute to replay/cycle around it and love my own work 🤣
when the producer says to just leave the clip on the interviewee over a really obvious frankenbite that they couldn't do without i'm like "i got some bad news.."
Right, really make it last longer - I think McGruber made fun of that.
Also often done for punches (with an even tighter timing of course) etc
Doesn’t it go back to Eisenstein? I remember a plate getting shattered again and again in the Battleship Potemkin
I call that a “double tap” or “triple tap” if you’re getting wild.
Definitely overused
Warp stabilizer on anything, really. I see so many shots that are poorly stabilized in post. If you can’t make it look natural, leave it shaky, please.
I try to do this on every setup.  Look left then center.  Look right then center.  Look left then right.  Smile, frown, you name it.  Saves my bacon (pun actually not intended but I'll keep it) every time.
Whoa, great idea for directors!
> the in-car shot right before the sudden collision is always a skosh too long, usually with the 'driver' not watching the road

the ones where it's truly sudden and there isn't this obvious "uh ohhhhhh they made a mistake" delay are very terrifying like an actual car accident and tbh i think that's a lot better anyway
ADR always seems quieter as if it was recorded in a studio.
This really sticks out like a sore thumb but sometimes it's necessary.
I've worked with ADR sessions that really focus on these. They called them Punch Ups.
I’m fairly amateur, so I just discovered morph cut in the last 6 months, and I really have to force myself not to use it unless I as the editor can’t even tell that I’ve used it.
I can’t stand morph cuts / fluidmorphs, they look so unnatural. So overused on TV, and I thought I caught one in Killers of the Flower Moon
JJ Abrams did that best in the first Star Trek reboot.  When they warp jump into the trap, there's a scene of crew rushing around until the hull is breached and they get sucked out into space. As the camera follows them, as soon as it goes outside into space, there's no noise and it's totally silent. It was the first time I had really seen it and it was so well done!
You’re right - maybe a tendency is a better word.
Can you provide an example?
Here's a good quote from Joe Walker on editing *Blade Runner 2049*:

*It’s odd how many scenes in films, not just Blade Runner, but all films, start with a door and end with a door. I don’t know whether that points to the theatrical origins of film, or whether it’s just a common way to shape a scene. In many cases, of course, doors can be phenomenally loaded symbols – of hidden secrets or paths disguised. I’m no door-ist, but if there are too many scenes bookended by them, the editor’s duty is to kick them down.*

[Check out the rest of the interview here](https://www.provideocoalition.com/aotc-bladerunner-2049/)
Soon to be replaced by an Ai-created stock footage supplier I should add
Haha that’s awesome
Example?
I thought that technique was done in camera
I spent Birdman looking for the stitches as well
[deleted]
Network executives constantly asking for a character to say xyz. Producer cobbles an unusable bite. I say that they don’t say xyz because it isn’t true. This is a detective that chose his words carefully. He cannot make an accusation. He’s hesitant to even theorize it. I’m ignored. Address note myself. Get over time later changing bite out when legal doesn’t approve it. It’s crazy how much money network execs burn.
I think Too Hot To Handle is a particularly good example where they frankenbite the interviews to make them sound even more incredibly dumb in the intro interviews.
Cough dts cough
Same, I recently edited something that needed extreme frankenbiting because the interviewee wasn’t articulate at all.  But problem now is I’m having trouble finding enough relevant B-rolls to cover it up.
This happens to me alot. Interviewee can't say anything concise and takes a long wild jumbled path to get to their point.
I blame producers who were interviewing the person in not asking follow ups to get more concise answers.
Broll is just hanging a nice picture over giant hole in the wall.
When a client is like "that bit's good, can we see his face while he says that instead of cutting away?" No, no you cannot, because I have painstakingly constructed that sentence out of isolated silables and it took me half a day 
I purposely cover non edits in interviews all the time too, though. A lot of the time what they’re saying isn’t about them, so it’s better for the story to be on viz. I’m just saying that it isn’t a **hard** rule that viz covering an interview means it’s _always_ covering edits…but often it definitely is.
Corporate work I don’t care. But when that happens in news, no bueno.
That’s terrifying. Better frankenbites
literally perfect
Sound bites you have to piece together to make the person articulate and make sense. Cutting out the uhs and ums and more.
Pretty sure 2 does the same, used to watch that shit when waiting for good versus lobbies lol
What is drop frame?
You simply edit out a frame right before the impact. Like a 1 frame jump cut.
I think this is an alternative to an original method. Which was called “undercranking”. Simply it is to capture with a frame-rate lower than your projection frame rate. When you play a 23fps footage on a 24fps sequence. It plays faster.

The term comes literally from the cranking arm at the side of the old cameras. Which would operate the film magazine and the shutter manually. And just turning that arm at a pace under the proper speed.

The proper thing to do would be to shoot an action shot at 22-23 fps so that it would look faster on 24fps. Because if you just drop a frame from a 24fps footage the jump is much bigger than a 23fps footage. Since the jump would be divided to 23. Another way to do this is to shoot higher frame rates then make it play faster. So that the jump isn’t obvious.

Jumping a frame is obvious %99,9 of the time. So, you just look out for those little possibilities where it can dissolve into the action.
You simply edit out a frame right before the impact. Like a 1 frame jump cut.

Can you explain the technique? I don’t understand it
It’s also relatively easy to make a split screen mask and use a portion of the OTS take when their mouth isn’t moving. Especially if the camera is locked off. I’m sure a lot of network tv shows are kind of rushed and lazy about this sort of thing but there’s no excuse for this when it’s an actual movie/series with a decent budget. I think I spotted this recently in a Hollywood movie and it really annoyed me.
j cut would refer to a shot yes; but if it’s a scene, this is generally called “prelap” which i think is what this person is referring to
How do you get such a job?
Oof that sounds like not fun.  Can just imagine some whiny producer blaming you, with them not understanding the situation
The 1 frame audio dissolve is the best invention ever.
I prefer the reverse. Kick ass needle drop hits. Character leaves the car and it becomes a part of the scene as a muffled far away song being left on somewhere.
Fucking A.
I'm glad to see someone else say this because I thought I imagined seeing a couple morph cuts in Killers of the Flower Moon
Battlestar Galáctica reboot did this a lot too.
Pretty much every scene in a tv show or movie where they have those takeout coffee cups you can always tell there’s nothing in them. You can hear they are hollow when they put them down and more obviously, the way they move them so quickly and carelessly. It’s the 1 thing I always look out for and yet to have seen anything placed in a cup.
Only place I've seen it (anecdotally because me) recently is in U.S. version of Shameless, nearly every time they have disposable coffee cups. Props, just put some fucking water in there and tape the hole closed if you are worried about wardrobe getting wet. It's so obvious because the physics and actor reactions are just wrong with empty cups.

Oh maybe it is. I totally assumed it was comped because of the blur. Do you know how it’s done?
Oh yeah totally! And, if you happen to have seen it, that episode of Always Sunny - Charlie Work I think it’s called.
Yes, let's all utter our final important line just as the last bars of the song we were listening to complete. You're right, it's 101. Basic. Film School starter pack. It's basically lifting the denouement of the music for your own purposes which, sure, can be powerful, but it is WAY overused, and it's melodramatic as heck.

And no, continuing to the next scene would obviously not make sense especially in the case of diagetic music. I'm a hard cut fan. But nothing wrong with being a bit Baroque here either; rip the record off the grammaphone. Close Out with a door slam. Cut and echo. just a bit of variety

edit to add: this is specifically for needle drop music in dramatic narrative.
We used our first AI bite last year (something the talent didn’t say), they couldn’t be bothered to come in and read a line and gave permission to do it
For sure. Though shows like this, and even Welcome to Wrexham, for me are on the borderline of docuseries and reality tv. It’s like they’re making reality tv out of real life athletes. They feel markedly different from something like I’ll be Gone in the Dark or the NXVIM docuseries.

For some reason the ‘creative editing’ is less bothersome to me in shows like dts and wtw. Maybe because I assume all reality tv has little interest in being truthful, rather just entertaining.
And if they can't mangle a quote together they'll just get their fake commentator to record it
I came here to see if this would get mentioned and I 100% agree.
Very much this. Producers thinking their job is done by asking a question and sitting there until the interviewee stops talking. That’s why the MIV comes out at 2 hours long. Really gets my goat
Ahh makes sense, thanks!
You simply edit out a frame right before the impact. Like a 1 frame jump cut.
thank you for the explanation! i’ll make some tests with old footage here
You just cut a frame at the point of impact (or just before) to make a punch or kick appear more intense.
Right?  Of course most shows have to be shot by a camera guy with one leg on a 3 day bender.  To keep it "interesting."  IMO cinematographers lock down so yes, this should be standard.
I was taught it as a "sound bridge."  Makes sense but may not be an industry term.
Random post-house work followed by a couple of decades of DVD/Blu-ray authoring. Now with more platform delivery work thrown in.
Recently watched 3 episodes of Chopped, I swear I was gonna get sick. It was so bad
Sorry, what am I looking for here?
What am I looking for here?
Split diopter lens. 

I think the halo effect is because the lens can hold two specific distances in focus, but everything else will still be out of focus.
If you watch Spartacus - in that I’m Spartacus! No I’m Spartacus! Scene there is a reaction shot of the two Romans watching this that is completely out of place. Sky is different. Lighting. Everything.
> it's melodramatic as heck

let's be honest, most 'editing techniques' are very melodramatic because our job is either to make something inherently uninteresting interesting, or to package up something that's been finely tuned for audience satisfaction in the most attention grabbing way possible
Buxton? Im pretty crofty doesn’t record new lines
Frankensteins soundbite
I’ve worked on a few lower budget indie features and short films recently that required splicing two takes together like this with a moving camera. A couple of them even involved panning which was a bitch. But it’s still possible it just requires some extra work. 

For a handheld shot, I made a clean plate of the left side of the shot where the over-the-shoulder actor was (Photoshop’s new generative fill makes this very easy), then I motion tracked the clean plate to the main shot of the person speaking, so the over-the-shoulder person was basically removed from the shot. And then I added them back into the left side of the shot with a rough roto mask and used the portion of their performance that we wanted.
yeah in tv & film editing & screenwriting, it’s called prelap. a j cut is if you want the sound from an incoming clip to precede the picture. prelap is when you want sound from the scene; this could be music, could be some sfx or foley like footsteps or waves crashing or thunder or a car driving down a gravel road or it could be dialogue. i’ve never heard of a sound bridge; people would most likely understand what you mean if you used the term, it’s just not quite as precise or technical as prelap
Eye tracing
Totally, in a lot of use cases! I guess I'm pretty specifically speaking about scripted drama here. This is a brilliant toolkit piece for reality or magazine format for sure. It's a go to when I want a stupid awards show submission video to pop.
And that, kids...is movie magic.
and i googled it after i commented. sound bridge is a thing and seems like its interchangeable with prelap. i guess its just a matter of who you picked shit up from and which bays you’ve been in. could be i heard it but it didn’t register
Nice!  My ancient education paying off :)
yes!
New UI, time to say bye bye desktop
The hell is this forcing of new UI??? So you are saying you can keep old reddit alive but cant keep up new old design and force this... what ever in my face? 

Man does any company know what they are doing as we go further in time?

HAHAH even as I write this this stupid website breaks on me, so much about new GUI: [https://i.imgur.com/4KG4KEd.png](https://i.imgur.com/4KG4KEd.png)

Reddit, I want old perfect UI back, not this wanna be on phone type of ugly all in my face GUI, I just open Reddit and instantly close it when I see new GUI, that is how much its not functional, it repels you away even before using it since its all in my face. 

How do I get old UI back?
I truly hate it. 

It's exhausting for my eyes and I don't want to see the recently visited communities on the forced column. And even though I opted out (on old reddit) on the recent posts I've clicked on, it still shows them. 

I tried to give it a chance when they first introduced it a while back and swiftly changed back to new reddit.
It's slow, it's buggy, it looks bad on desktop, and you can either chose a light mode that burns your eyes or a dark mode that tires your eyes...

This version has been live for 6 months... and they can't fix simple bugs or bad UI choices...

Seriously, fire whoever is in charge of making these design decisions and whoever approves the push to production because paying these guys is a huge waste of money.
Here to voice my displeasure with the change. I've read the threads for the past couple days and want to comment before yet another thread gets locked because developers are tired of hearing the criticism.  The interface looks good on a mobile device, but on desktop? It's frustrating. ... And I've tried to like it, but I don't.
Here before the 🔒
I'm just here to add to the comment count before this gets locked. Because in a short while, reddit will go "there were barely any complaints!".
The only thing left to do is to start complaining directly to the site's advertisers.  Tell them you won’t buy their products until they either pull their ads or reddit backs down.
Yes, please revert to [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com), and delete the current ugly mess while you're at it.
I agree. The newest layout is awful. This will truly drive me away from Reddit.
Its so bad. 

WE DON'T NEED 2 SIDE BARS AT ALL TIMES. There is nothing relevant there when you are in a post The only button anyone will ever use in a post is the home button. Which already existed. You just click the reddit logo, located AN INCH ABOVE HOME (assuming you have not accidentally scrolled the side bar, which is easy to do.)

Now, because of these two sidebars there is no way to click back to the feed from anywhere in the post. You must scroll back up (there is no more back to top button. Genius move) and click on a tiny arrow next to the post. Why. This doesn't make sense. It can't boost engagement. It literally makes it harder to view the next post. That is the opposite of engagement. You cant even "asshole design" correctly. Just give us a giant obnoxious arrow that goes to the next or previous post on both sides. Boom, instant engagement.

Its been 6 months. The users have told you repeatedly exactly the issues they have. This is objectively a terrible design. It is clearly designed to appeal to dumb users, but it sucks at even that. If they couldn't figure out that clicking the logo took them to home, then I don't think putting it on a bar that moves is helping the issue. 

Forcing your users onto this UI is a terrible decision which will absolutely lead to lower site engagement. It is objectively more difficult to navigate the site. I'd be willing to wait for improvements, but clearly reddit thinks it knows what is best for its users if it has not changed any of these things in the last 6 months.
Need a hero to fix this, it's so bad on desktop. I have to turn off and on dark mode just to make it work constantly
They are still catering to the users that prefer [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com), a UI that I never vibed with but good for them, so no reason to force us to make the switch.
absolutely horrible.  on the previous UI, the Close button was stationary. It didn't matter how much you scrolled the button was always there.  Now the close button is an arrow that moves with the content.  When you want to close you have to scroll back to the beginning to get to the button.  real dumb.
Yeah the new UI is garbage. I'm still on new.reddit for now, but I'm probably going to use addons to change the CSS when I do get stuck on the new UI.
The people who worked on this new UI are so bad at their job.
Everything looks green now, half of the screens is overused with nonsense it just hurts my eyes

I hate it who came up with this?
for me it doesnt work all my subs i am subscribed to keep getting sorted to "hot" over what my preferences are at being "new"
I see we have an expert helper here that must own stock in Reddit by the way he is plugging this new interface. If they actually fixed a few things to make it a little more user friendly like second version was then make we could use it since it was forced on us.

  
There is no reason why user preferences can't be changed to what we need but a lot of the changes don't make a difference. There have been many reports on r/bugs of not being able to sort subreddits by NEW instead of the HOT, including me 3 times in 6 months. I assume r/bugs subreddit is just like my recycle bin on my desktop and nobody at Reddit even see them or cares about it. 

  
The left column is now a crap show, why not have the ability to customize. A few reported we don't need recents and I am one. I was able to get rid if it using uBlock Origin on Chrome but sounds like Google might be dumping that extension.
Hopefully we're in the "deliberately release a bad product" phase of ~~new coke~~  Reddit and soon they'll bring back the old favourite.
I just created a subreddit and it works again! Simple fix!
Thank you, reddit, for forcing this terrible UI on me. Now that I'm stuck with this unusable, ugly thing, my time spent on reddit will naturally shrink; I think I should use it for exercising or maybe take up a new hobby.

This is the first time I see a big portal like this prioritizing its users' health and well-being over gains. Well done!
old.reddit.com is essential for moderators and moderator tools.

Without it, moderating a subreddit becomes infinitely more difficult, and reddit descents into an anarchistic mess.
Force to use old.reddit because new new UI suck...shameful
[deleted]
Try switching to compact view. I hear that's close to old reddit
Honestly I have to say I’ve been using this UI for ages and I really don’t get what all the fuss is about
You don’t get the ui you want back.  It is gone.  Try giving the current UI a chance. It is missing some pretty big things still, but it has advantages as well.  After a bit of time, you adapt to it
"tHeRe ArE oNlY cOmPlAiNtS. tHiS iS nOt ThE cOmPlAiNtS dEpArTmEnT"
it also changed in [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com), everything gets curved. I can't see the old new reddit. how do I get it back
With respect (and in agreement that the new new UI is anti-user), having worked on enterprise websites this smells so much like *management decisions* not designer incompetence. 

I assume that the new new UI somehow includes all of the execs' "great ideas" as well as increases ad feed and impression (at least in terms of some metric they can sell).
you can fix it to default to New by adding "/new" at the end of the web address.

Example: [https://new.reddit.com/r/yoursub/new](https://new.reddit.com/r/yoursub/new)
You know the world, less you can customize the better... I guess for them somehow Idk, I miss old internet where you could basically customize your whole pages (exmp: YouTube).
I am just reasonable in my approach to things.  I agree and have said that there are still some big issues on things that are missing or not working.

The thing with not following the sort preferences is probably hundreds of times between here and bugs and is just about a year, not 6 months.  In fact that was an issue since the first testing version was forced upon users.

The left column allows for faster navigation when you get used to using it.  Also, how much could you customize the pulldown menu or anything in the previous UI?
Simple fix but likely to be short lived I'm afraid.
lol
And lacks functionality. Gotta love opening posts in new tab rather then in a pop up windows and continue browsing where I stopped.
This is the OG Reddit experience, combined with RES. It might look ugly at first but once you get used to it, you won’t go back as I’ve never since I started using Reddit more than a decade ago.
Now that is too old reddit for my liking, I want new old reddit lol.
No dark mode is sadly a turn down for me
That fixes just one of the many issues with the new UI.
how to do?
Give this UI mess a chance? 3 scrollbars on one page? Opening posts in new pages instead of pop up window? Posts take 3 hours to load? Site crashing non stop while put in production? The ugly color x text combo that hurts my eyes? The 2 sidebars that I cant hide and put me in panic mode since too much text on screen?

No thanks, nice try reddit fed.

Its just all sensory overload and I am not new generation to suck it all up, sorry.
I actually did spend a couple of weeks with it and I agree, you can get used to it.  But it's still objectively worse and more mentally straining to use, which was always immediately noticeable whenever I switched to "new"... which I often had to do because the new design just keeps having issues.

It's just so ridiculously unstable.  Every day one has to keep refreshing over and over to load a feed, the comments, to deal with an "oops", the red bar always popping up, sometimes votes not registering with more "oops"... all that while both new (RIP) and old worked fine, so these issues are clearly not on the backend.

And yeah, that fact that basic features like that sorting or new comment highlighting still haven't been implemented even after months of complaints is beyond belief.
It's getting a chance from me looking at it. It's not food, it's not a pair of shoes, it's a visual change. I can tell it's bad because it looks bad, like right now my browser isn't even properly loading the left sidebar.
I just want to add

If you use it you will find ways around some of the missing features that should have been fixed or added by now.  Yes it is annoying having to change the subreddit sort to new but it takes like 2 seconds. Having to use the subreddit list to see followed is inefficient but it works.  Same with old Reddit and all the subreddits in a custom feed.

If you use it with a mindset of trying to make it work, you will be surprised what you can actually do with it.  If you approach it with the mindset to hate it, well then you will no matter what and it will frustrate you when it does not have to
I know, it's not available any more. We used to be able to use new.reddit.com to avoid the fugly theme, but that doesn't work any more, the shut it down, so new.reddit.com looks the same as www.reddit.com.

That's why everyone is complaining.
Ok.
Maybe I have just been lucky, but I have not had long load times or having to keep refreshing that I see mentioned.  I do regularly get the red bar but it does not do anything and I just ignore it unless I need something behind it.  I have seen talk of it crashing but have not experienced that unless Reddit was having issues.

I am not saying it is perfect by any means, and the fact some things have been identified as missing for almost a year and still are is ridiculous.  There is so much hate by people who won’t give it a chance.  The only ones that are affected by their ridiculousness is themselves.  “Rawr me hate” will lead to nothing.  Last year’s protests taught that lesson.
No, you can tell you prefer the previous one that you were used to.  Without talking the time with this one, and coming in with the attitude it is bad, you will always find fault with it.

I have never had any of these loading issues that people are claiming to have, and I have a very old desktop.

It’s kind of hard to not hate the new UI when it’s a downgrade in basically every quantifiable aspect.
New Reddit is still available to moderators. Just not everyone else.
...and not expect users to have to "work at it" to merely get used to it!
You see though, it is easy to use.  The left side bar as it is makes it even easier.  People being attracted in will only know what it is.  It also attracts people.  When they switched the logged out UI to the current one that this logged in one is designed from, people were disappointed that new.reddit UI was different and worse.

I wish more worked and they would move faster on the missing and broken parts, but this is what we have now.  Be constructive in your feedback.  Rawr me hate, doesn’t do anything to help improve what we have.
You see though.  It actually is not.  It has flaws.  I have never said it is perfect.  I have been trying to get things fixed for months with little to show for it.  But that attitude in your comment will lead to what you are saying being completely ignored.  Be constructive in your criticism, be rational.
I see, let me if any other method or extension comes out
You can fully use it as it is.  But yes, you will have to get used to it and how it functions.
[deleted]
If they wanted a new UI, the first obvious step would be: make sure every existing feature still works. A basic feature, like "selecting text and hitting reply gives you the selected text as a quote", isn't there anymore. Now you need to manually copy and paste text to quote it.
People are being constructive in their criticism; however, the people in charge have decided to ignore user feedback. This new UI is a downgrade in every way without a single positive. Stop being a meat rider.
No thanks.
You may need to get your devices checked because my 12 year old pc and iPhone 6s don’t have any of those issues except slow loading on mobile web and I do get a red banner that actually does nothing on desktop.  Try clearing cache and cookies.

You don’t like the look personally, fair.  Does not mean nobody likes it.
Not if you don’t intend to keep every feature.  Old Reddit has things new.reddit doesn’t.
Yes what you're describing is 'enshittification,' there's no reason to remove useful features from the platform just so that you can push an unfinished, buggy mess out the door. It's a website almost entirely based around discussion, why in the hell would they remove a feature that is essential for discussion? Obfuscate text formatting tools? Force algorithmically sorted content on you?

ETA, there has been and will continue to be plenty of constructive criticism, however, you're going to have to deal with people getting frustrated when that constructive criticism is ignored or when they attempt to siphon it off into a google sheet somewhere to be ignored forever (as they evidently have), the dude who writes the "weekly updates" here can be personally told about a bug multiple times and still say "wow i've never seen that before, can you give me some more information so I can get it to the right team?" for the third time before not actually ever "getting it to the right team."

They can't even attempt to push an update out to the new UI without breaking it so badly that they actually have to use their status page, something they actively avoid doing so that it's easier to manipulate their uptime SLA, because they want investors to be more interested in the platform. It's an objective downgrade, every single other UI version is a better, more feature complete version of reddit and that's why they had to disable the most popular one instead of allowing people to naturally move to the new one. If it was *actually* better, they wouldn't have to do that.
‘Enshitification’ though is just opinion.  Most of the comments in here are of the “I don’t like it” variety from users who have not actually put time into using it.  When you get used to it, it is not as bad as it is made out to be.  The T in comments is on my list of annoyances.  There are legitimate issues that need to be addressed.  I have a list I have provided to Reddit multiple times in multiple places of 6 major issues and 10-15 annoyances over the last 6 months ago and was told they would be given to the proper teams.  Which does not mean anything.

I have been fighting this fight for almost a year now and you better believe I am frustrated as well.  Every chance I get I try to bring some of the legitimate issues up with nothing to show for it.  Even here in both the weekly recap and in the pinned post announcing the shutdown of new.reddit.  It does frustrate me when I get those kinds of replies to my weekly recap comment.  Also when new UI issues I brought up are ignored in their reply.  But, they have to be one of the best admins I have seen because they actually interact with us users and there are times we have been able to get things fixed.  They respond to some negative comments as well unlike most admin interaction which is just on the overly positive comments.  This is their job though and have rules they need to follow.  

I also agree it is frustrating when they push out updates that were not properly tested and break other things.  I am here helping over 40 hours a week and see the issues and get some of the hate because of my flair.  I would like to think that may be changing though.  They had said they were pushing out an app update last week.  Well we still don’t have it and I would like to think they are getting it right before pushing it out.  I also concur that they manipulate down time on the status page.  No disagreement there.

Saying that the other 2 are better is a matter of opinion.  They all have things I like and don’t like, but because of the way I use Reddit, the newest UI is better than the previous for one thing.  It preserves formatting when pasting.  That saves me a ton of time cumulatively.  If they would fix the issue with r/ links disappearing when pasted unless clicked on, it would be even better.

If they didn’t shut down the previous some would never move to the new one.  For a user new.reddit is definitively better than old Reddit, but look at how many people use it to this day
It's not though, it's a quantifiable thing. It sounds silly, sure, but it's a term coined to refer to specific behavior, behavior reddit is engaging in. Your whole argument is that you like the new UI better in some cases, this is subjective. What's objective is that features are missing from the new UI. They've fixed some of the dumbest things, like pictures opening in a new tab and the general lack of any polishing when it comes to displaying media, but glaring issues like the quote feature missing and text formatting tools being obfuscated are deliberate design choices. If I'm being charitable, I would say they're doing this to make it easier to maintain a mobile app and a web app on a tight budget, however even then there's no actual material benefit to forcing users onto the new UI other than analytics to prove that all of this work wasn't completely useless and wasted, which since I'm not actually being charitable, I would say is probably the case. 

>Saying that the other 2 are better is a matter of opinion

It's not. There are less clicks required for me to write this same comment on old reddit than there would be on the new design. I have to move my hand from my keyboard to my mouse more often, which is worse user experience, which means the design is objectively worse. Again, this is a forum. This isn't tiktok or instagram or twitter, it's a forum meant for long form content and discussions. 

>If they didn’t shut down the previous some would never move to the new one. For a user new.reddit is definitively better than old Reddit, but look at how many people use it to this day

Of course. Some people would still be using Windows XP today if they could, but that group of users is very small compared to the rest of the people who use the platform and the new users of the platform. If the new UI was actually good, willing users would switch to it over time and new users wouldn't ever even consider going to an older version of the platform. There's virtually no maintenance cost here, it can almost entirely be automated. 

This is my job, by the way. I spend my time maintaining infrastructure and automating menial tasks that nobody wants to do so that users can have a good experience when they use the product I develop. There are standardized processes for all of the missteps reddit consistently takes at this point. The only excuse for this from reddit is poor communication (or rather, poor reception, the illusion of communication is strong here) and poor organization internally. Nobody would have an issue with a new UI if it was a natural continuation of the old one with the same features and functionality, without the giant performance hit that this tab takes in my browser when I'm using the new UI.

It doesn't matter how you slice it, this initiative is horribly executed and that's why people are upset with it. It would be one thing if they actually tried to work with the users of the platform to develop an attractive, functional UI that people want to use, but they won't. Instead we get forced into an objectively worse experience because internally, reddit needs to prove that this entire initiative wasn't a horrible investment.
I made the mistake of posting an unpopular opinion
So I have been a reddit lurker for a few years. in the last month I've tried to be more involved by posting more threads and comments. I made the mistake of making a post that was unpopular. Not trolling or being mean, just unpopular. I didn't realize that I should only post things that are popular rehashed opinions. Now my karma is shot and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to get it back up since everything I post will get no traffic and my comments are collapsed. 

I deleted just about everything I've posted for damage control. But I just don't see a way to get even on karma anytime soon. 

Do I just delete my account and start over?
Do I just not participate in reddit anymore?
Nobody is asking what the unpopular opinion is but I'm genuinely curious.
Take it as a badge of honour !
Ah, don’t let the capriciousness of Reddit get to you.
just sign out and start a new account.
Posting unpopular opinions is part of life.
[deleted]
I joined Reddit  a month  ago and  enjoy it .

 I made a straight forward reply to a post and was surprised to  get a response from someone saying I have zero karma  .  Don't  even know why karma is even important ?
Screw it. Sometimes you get up voted. Sometimes you don't. If a little inconsequential negative feedback has you this worried, you have bigger problems.
If you really need the karma for some reason, sure, you can start over. Otherwise... who cares? You know karma isn't worth anything, right?
You got there once, you’ll get there again.
delete account and start over. next time when starting one off and as soon as you get a post that is getting negative karma then delete comment to stop others from adding there vote to it ...

edit: nvm, don't delete. it's only -3, you will live till you find something intelligent to say that someone likes ...
It’s internet points, just move on and enjoy the website.
My biggest downvote ever was for the opinion that swallowing Drano is dangerous.  I have to think there is an element of random trolling in all of our karma scores.  Reddit is still useful and / or entertaining enough to keep playing.
Until you start receiving threats, then take action.
Reddit is basically just a bunch of cults, for the most part. There are only a handful of opinions that get repeated over and over again, the rest gets you downvoted to hell.
I find it pretty fickle and that there are periods of time that many of the younger members seem to be bored and tend to troll and downvote. This week it seems extended.
At the end of the day ‘This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.’  
I’m not sure I understand the point of Reddit karma, but at the end of the day would you rather be minimally popular but true to what you think/are, or having to be a fake persona to maintain Reddit points? Hugs, MLx
Reddit is just a lot of faceless internet trolls (like me and you). Why would posting your opinion be a mistake? Stick to your beliefs!
Relax and let it all out on r/unpopularopinion

Very entertaining! 👌
just enjoy being on reddit man, people have dumb arguments and block others or downvote the fourth post into absolute oblivion. Reddit has a karma begging board if yer that bad off just make sure to vote others up
"I didn't realize that I should only post things that are popular rehashed opinions."

"I deleted just about everything I've posted for damage control. But I just don't see a way to get even on karma anytime soon."

So you made an opinion but since it's not popular you don't want to own it too, right?

The right thing is to own it.

In the worst case scenario just delete your opinion altogether.
I always considered Reddit karma to be like the points in "Whose Line Is It Anyway?"

..."everything's made up and the points don't matter"

The system is a bit rigged against posting opinions that go against what the majority think. Please continue to participate. Other opinions are valid and should be healthy for the discussion.
It's a reddit score not a credit score sweetness... you can't please everyone everytime... plus some people have so little power in their actual lives that weilding their power on reddit gives them that sense of power they lack.... generally I only upvote and just skip over those with differing opinions because they're entitled to think for themselves... dont take it personally.... happy new year❤️
Don't delete unpopular opinion the moment people don't like it. Have some spine.

Reddit is a collection of echo chamber already. Don't contribute to that.
Reddit seems to prefer conforming and popular opinions. Those types get tons of karma. If you are a reasoned person and post logical and sensitive comments, those tend to get downvoted in droves. Not going into specifics, but Reddit population is heavily skewed towards this population. Unfortunately I am not hoping that this culture will change. As long as Reddit is getting traffic from confirming posts, they stand to gain.
Do you think online karma matters?

Ever heard this quote?

“You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.”

-Winston Churchill (possibly Victor Hugo).
Make another post just like the one you deleted. Your reign of terror has just begun. Let the haters know.
its a social credit system, join the echochamber or get punished  


this is why reddit is a bad thing
Don't give up. I also share my less popular ideas and I still have karma left.
Try not to take karma too seriously. Barring a few Austrian painteresque moderated r/ where you need some points to post, it’s just a game of who’s got the biggest. Win some lose some.
There's a special subreddit for that. It's called r/unpopularopinion.
If you start over with a new account, you will have zero karma and a zero-days-old account. It will be easier to rebuild this account than one with nothing. You're good, brah.
I was terrified to post my opinion on vaccines but I survived it.  Wont do it again tho.   Some subjects you know people's minds are closed so why bother.  Wondering if I'll get down voted here just for mentioning the V Word
Double down on it
karma doesn’t really matter except if it’s negative in which case some subs auto ban you. 

Being downvoted by the reddit herd is usually a badge of honor though, many subreddits are just echo chambers
So to be clear you don't gain or lose all the karma of a post. It does cap at some level (I'm not sure what) but regardless it says both your post and comment karma is positive
> I made the mistake of making a post that was unpopular. Not trolling or being mean, just unpopular. 

There's actually a whole sub dedicated to this. r/unpopularopinion

I won't comment on your post or the votes you got. I haven't read it and individual users are free to vote as they wish. 

In general I don't think users should worry about downvotes. It happens and its just pretend Internet points. But if one is consistently being dwonvoted, I'd encourage some self-reflection:

* is your content on-topic for the sub its being put on?
* is your content topical, insightful, funny, or helpful?
* does your content break the sub's rules?
* is your content in line with the sub's cultures or does it go against it?
* are you arguing or engaging in heated debate, or taking a controversial stance that you know most of the sub disagrees with?
The day that karma points can be traded in for cash and prizes is the day I’ll start worrying about being downvoted.
Claiming *anywhere* on line is about "discussion" is a joke. Only been on reddit for a cpl of wks & reckon it's even worse than comments on yt. Atrophying brains & atrocious all round.
Welcome to reddit.
Karma on reddit is like the points on Whose Line is it Anyway, it just doesn't matter. Be yourself, not what they want you to be.
Karma is not important. Just post if you want to.
People will downvote you for neutral statements on here too
Has this what life has become all about???
Who cares about Karma?:D
I experienced the same thing. I expressed a dissenting viewpoint without being impolite, yet I received downvoting. Currently, I am apprehensive about expressing any thoughts or opinions. I had contemplated the idea of departing as well. I understand the concept of Karma, but it is unjust towards individuals who have opposing views to the majority. Thank you for sharing this, I appreciate knowing that I am not the only one.
Be careful, swimming against the current of group think can also get you banned. Hence my new account and starting over.
Just comment in subreddits such as r/NoStupidQuestions to get your comment karma up.
Wait until you one day do it again and get banned from your favorite subreddit~
This happened to me! I advised the OP to communicate and seek therapy and got downvoted. Sometimes people want irrational responses vs logical responses.
Account karma affects how many people can see your new comments and posts? I thought it only affected downvoted posts, I didn’t realize it could potentially brick an account.
Best advice to help you, stop caring about fake internet points. It's like the show "who's line is it anyway" the points mean nothing
Oh yeah, that happens.  Take comfort in the thought that all karma does is tell you what you learned here.  Namely karma only measures your ability to tell people what they want to hear.


Reddit has even shifted from "It's to be used to measure how well you contribute to the discussion.  It's not an "I disagree button" to "it's meaningless."
Welcome to the 2020s. It's tragic that anyone can think this stuff matters. Even more tragically... It can do
Your comments are not collapsed for me it'd seem. And there is a limited amount of karma you can lose with one post. You didn't have much to begin with I guess. I have a lot of downvoted comments and I still get visibility. There is no such thing as being shadowbanned from Reddit globally for one unpopular post, idk what you're on about.
Redditors do not take kindly unpopular or opposite opinions . so I've learned myself . I sometimes fume fearing the trolling if I were to express myself truthfully . especially politically in these days of controversy and divisiveness .
Well I just saw this post, so maybe you’re okay ! I wouldn’t freak out about it
It's even better when you are recommended a post in a new subreddit which happens to be quite right-wing, submit what is an unpopular opinion in that subreddit (just links to facts they kept getting wrong), and get banned by the mods xD
Same thing happened to me, just be a little more active and you should be fine. You're already in the black again, so...
I would ask why does it bother you to have bad karma. I don't really care about downvotes at all.
Hi OP!  No, keep continuing engaging.  Your karma isn't too bad even after the few threads you said were bad.  If that's not your opinion about your Magic cards (sorry, I don't play that & have no idea) you could ask - hypothetical what is your opinion of...?

I wouldn't delete and start over because you'll start from zero.  You might have something similar happen again.  No, you don't have to only post popular opinions.
I have posted some voted to hell things But I have generated a lot of Karma 33,000 now so it does not harm me. 
Yes it a flaw of the system to some degree.
I preferred old decade plus boards where the mods removed the troll posts. And there were hate threads so you could post that type of opinion there. 
But not totally I remember old TV without pity boards were I got banned over posts that were not very offensive at all but rubbed the sections author the wrong way but that more a flaw of having section authors having to much control and no temp ban procedure. I quite certain with more mod and appeal that could be avoided.
I think expressing your own opinion and being true to yourself is more important than keeping karma or being popular. I didn’t even know karma was a thing and tbh I don’t care.
Reddit/internet/social media belongs to everybody. Post what you want and let people respond however. 

So don’t delete your account and don’t worry about karma.
Why do you care about karma points? You can still post and interact with negative bazillion karma.
Dude, you are way, way too invested in reddit (and possibly the whole social media thing).

You shouldn't care about "reddit karma". In all sincerity my friend, work on your real life and understand that reddit is meaningless and little in it is true or accurate.
That did happen to me, too - on each post getting a message that it's deleted (hidden?) due to "negative" karma. (eg. in r/linux)

Really no idea what that "karma" thing is all about. 
Seems to be a nice tool for some load "majority" (or just very active downvoters) to silence unwanted opinions.
Didn't you know you aren't allowed to have an opinion on Reddit?
There are more important things in life then worrying about your reddit karma wth, go touch some grass plz
I’m in the same boat. Can you help me out in return?
Who cares, speak your opinions. They are just like assholes, everyone has one. Some are nicer and cleaner than others.
Your opinions matter, right or wrong. 

Go through my post history, and you'll see a number of posts that I made unpopular opinions.


Stick to your guns.
lol, you hurt poor redditor feelings, good job.

Noted the post history, so... fandoms are weird, i'm part of a few video games subs and there are a few opinions I just don't share, for obvious reasons it would attract the chronically online no-lifes.

It just depends on what's "echoing" in the comment sections, I've said same thing twice in different threads and got completely different reactions, people are weird on here.
People are weird

Reddit is weird

People on Reddit are weird and finicky. 
And judgemental AF 

There’s a theory if you state in your post “bring on the downvotes” or “I know everyone’s gonna downvote me but…” it will keep people from downvoting your post.

Karma is just stupid. I wouldn’t even worry about that.
A wise man makes his own decisions, an ignorant man follows public opinion. Worry not!
The karma I lost for supporting Palestine and condemning Israel is unthinkable and tbh social media has generally become unwelcoming to Arabs if I speak one thing they have to misinterpret it in some way so that they give me a ban but people are free to insult me my country my religion with no consequences not even downvotes
>imagine caring about updoots
WTF’s Karma ???
Just spam r/pics with cat images.

Btw, does karma even affect your reach? I constantly see account with little to no karma getting upvotes on various subs.
Once got down voted to hell for saying I dislike a particularly gross vegetable.  Reddit is mad.
I'm new to reddit, but I just had a very similar experience. Lost my Social Credit score to a Lord of The Flies attack by a nest of Trolls.

Apparently, the suppression based on a low Karma score is at the discretion of the moderators of each subreddit. So theoretically, you can explain what happened, and ask the moderators to take you out or purgatory. I haven't tried that yet, but I plan to.

Giving downvote authority to Trolls, is like giving loaded guns to a bunch of drunken teenagers. Of course, it's possible that a lot of the Trolls ***are*** drunken teenagers, but I have no evidence either way on that question. 

But the real question is, what's to be done about it? One option I've thought about is to set up a Repair Squadron, a bunch of folks who will go around and upvote somebody who's been swarmed by Trolls.

Another option, which would require a system change, would be to only give the downvote power to non-anonymous people. Or alternatively, only give the downvote power to someone with a verified/not-free account.

Above all, I urge you not to roll over and give in! Rolling over and giving in is how bullies persists. We need to find a way to beat the Scourge of The Trolls!

TCS
I get banned constantly for not being a sheep. Used to let it bug me. Now I think it's a joke. Mods need to get a life.
>Now my karma is shot 

uh... who... cares?
Dog pics in the appropriate sub.  You'll get it back.
Lmao who cares, half the people on this site are brainlets, disagreement is a badge of honor
Oh no all my internet karma is gone, what ever shall I do....
Why does your karma matter so much?
You lost your karma? Real troble man, you made a real mess, I don't even know what to do now. 🤣
Be offended by EVERYTHING. You are morally superior to anyone who posts, and you need to take offense for anyone and everyone else. You'll get upvoted like crazy if you do that.
Karma farming is really easy
Bro it's really not that deep
Don't worry about it.
"I can't say what I want to, even if I'm not serious. "-Maynard James Keenan.
what are you getting out of the good karma?
I'm straight up new to Reddit, have only been on for a few months now, and this just happened to me as well.  I responded to a few comments but kept the interaction fairly minimal, then added an edit blurb within my original message acknowledging the feedback and admitting that I could very well have been misinformed on the subject by bad sources.  I decided to just own the message and my mistake, I left the post up.  The downvoting stopped after that.
Karma is fake points. Don't worry about them. Plus you really can't lose that much on a single post. 

Unless you're trying to make a living off Reddit your karma really doesn't matter.
Just start posting a lot. It’ll get to the point where you have so much karma that you can take anything. Karma only matters in subs that don’t let you post if you have negative karma.
Your karma is that important?
Welcome to the cool kids table.
Karma is just imaginary internet points, they don't mean anything in the real world. Gotta understand that a large part of redditors are in an echochamber that brings out the worst in people because its anonymous.

By posting unpopular opinions and stickin to your guns, it means you're not apart of the hivemind who's been brainwashed to tear down people for having differing opinions and you think for yourself.

I once got downvoted to oblivion by saying you shouldn't be sexual around children in the game I play. I learned a great lesson that day to not base the validity of your opinion on swarming redditors.
As soon as I read your title I was like "yup that'll do it"
Wait is comment/post visibility really dependant upon a user's karma?
They should make a shirt for this so you can wear it with pride
I was down voted because I didn't realize Ebay was still a thing. EBAY!
I’m going to get downvoted for this, but would you mind sharing what was said? 🙂
the reddit echo chamber attacks again, don't worry, in a few days they will all hate someone else I have gotten slammed for asking questions or posting art.  You will be ok
Welcome to reddit
The amount of arguments I’ve gotten into because I didn’t agree with what an op said I crazy. 🥴
If you’re gonna be posting on an interactive website be prepared to see people who don’t agree with you. While I know it’s your page, blog, etc, and you can post whatever you want, other people are allowed to disagree with it. if it’s REALLY that big of a deal to you then delete the comments or ignore them. (Not directed at you op just in general)
You can go on some subs and get hammered for not being positive enough.

It can be frustrating until you know how it works. And I'm far from an expert
If you go against tbe appro ed Group Think, you will be banned. So what?  To thine own self be true...
First, I would seriously reconsider how important karma is. It has zero affect on your life if your score is high or low. 

Second, I would continue to use your "ruined" account to continue to experiment with your Reddit usage. Feel free to push the limits of what you can and cannot get away with saying publicly, learn ways to voice your opinions more clearly, test your sense of humor, find topics to which you can make meaningful contributions. 

THEN delete your account and start over if you are still concerned about karma.

But I do recommend you just stop looking at it. Upvotes are one of the reasons people become addicted to social media, and if you can teach yourself to use it for other reasons, such as learning or understanding, you can avoid becoming addicted.
Haha welcome to Reddit. Everyone here is very opinionated and will destroy anyone who goes against the grain.
Post more until it goes back up

I think Reddit will give you upvotes for engagement too, even if you're downvoted you'll sometimes see the count go up
Hmm i didnt know downvoting affects their karma. Next time Ill just reply I disagree. I dont know why you would have to bend to the will of others when you didnt do anything wrong.
Nope you stand by your comment and defend it like a man. You’re entitled to whatever opinion it was and you’re not wrong for sharing it. Not all opinions are popular but all are valuable, including yours.
Gave you a couple of upvotes. Buy yourself some nice unpopular opinions.
Yeah I'm fairly new here too and made a bad joke and even got some hate messages after. I learned my lesson. Just move on. It's just Reddit.
r/unpopularopinion when you post an actual unpopular opinion.
As long as you are not deep in the negatives, it just doesn't matter that you lost karma, since the gating to post in some communities is there, but rarely a high Karma number.
Why do you need karma anyway
This sounds more like a jab at the content on r/unpopularopinion than a genuine request for help
What is low Karma ? I don’t know enough about this cite 😂.
My advice is to either delete the post/comment and block everyone who was negative to you about it. It socks cuz your opinion very well may be right (no idea what it was) and you definitely have a right to share it with like minded peers but that's reddit anymore tbh.
Happened to me so many times aswell. For example I did join an 'official' page (or it seemed official) of a country to participate in the political discussions. I saw a lot posts where they post a part of the newsletter and trying to manipulate the opinions of others by adding their own non-true comment to that part of the newsletter pretending that it does means this. 

When I tried to comment and post opposite things without non-fake comments and link to the original newsletter, they downvoted me really quickly and banned me every time while I was not breaking the rules. 

These kind of pages is nothing else then a silly attemp to take down the government by manipulating others minds. Probably this page is rules by a single person who spammed bots in it to make this page being trusted with 90k+ members (maybe way more but i dont remember the number as it was 1 year ago).
I have my real account and my experimental one. If I have a take on a subject that I know is not as *popular* I’ll comment from another account. My main account is protected at all costs. That way if I want to share my Reddit link with someone they see the side of me that’s *publicly accepted*.   

**I don’t need a future job or lover to know whether or not I enjoyed the Martyrs movie, for instance.**
What are the real consequences of losing karma anyway?
Some people definitely go way extreme when you don't see things their way. Happened to me about a week ago, over I can't even remember what. Wait I could look it up, y waste my time. I thought they were going to start throwing tomatoes at me! Skarooo then! Kick it out your mind! 🩷
I often get more karma from my replies to other people's posts and if you say funny or encouraging things to people you get more noticed.
If you have an opinion, it is as important as everyone else's... Stick to your feelings.
I totally feel you. I've been a dasher for FOUR YEARS. All I do is express my opinion and changes and I've been blocked saying I'm a TROLL! I'M NOT! IT'S FRUSTRATING! it's my platform. Zero karma is bs. It's called doordash is purposefully making sure what I have to say doesn't impact their dashers
Same, being new I really haven’t figured out this site well and how to post. I’m feeling confused and nothing words than me having bad karma for giving an opinion. I’m already considering closing my account as I’m having trouble understanding how this all works here. Oh well it was fun while it lasted for me, maybe I’m just too old or maybe I’ll figure it out eventually on how to use this platform…
Same here I not understand 100% English, don't know grammatical writing good,the translate tool can't help me because same have more than me grammatical errors and many times other mining of words.Next one I didn't on beginning see to must R/ write,post..... ,i just posted,and have same bad carma.But that's not big problem for me,the problem is because I want speak with people in many ways, thing's,but I m in depression and I lost hope to speak if I do wrong and nobody cares that, just come Boot's with Waring's write me, that's all what I got from here!
Hello
One thing more i forget,but i forget
LOL why was this in my notifications ?
Another victim of reddit group think.

Stand your ground.
I got banned from a community that is supposed to be “tolerant” of other opinions, despite not breaking any rules. It’s weird, but Reddit is not a place of common sense, especially if you upset the people with “small-man”-type complexes that have a little power.

That’s just Reddit and unless you happen to be in the good graces of an admin with common sense (few and far between) you might not have any recourse.
Sometimes you have one, that's ok. Don't worry about your karma, it means nothing
I think Reddit suggested this post to me for a reason 🤣🤣 the shade! 

I didn't know (or care) there is a whole strategy to this social media. I just b dropping random opinions n goin on about my day. Some days I have time for discourse, but most I don't. Not losing any sleep over it 🤷🏽‍♀️

My motto is "stay mad h03"
Wait, I did not know that karma here has an actual purpose.
I don't know what to say.  I, too, have had a Reddit account for many years but used it to get information that I could not find elsewhere. Within the past week, I became a more active poster, and to my surprise, many of my posts that I do not consider unpopular or that go against standards of decency have been rejected.
This my friend is where r/TrueUnpopularOpinion comes in :'3
H
I have unpopular all the time. so what. But you seem to take it waaaay too serious. Just don't mind. Prepare that for 50 haters will be one who understands. Even if that one didn't post a reply. 

It's a spectrum of every opinion and often the leading is not the best. And on Reddit it's even more distorted.

Use throwaway account if unsure?
oh boi do i have some unpopular opinions alright. i don't care for the downvotes but it does suck because you just want to see and share a different perspective and a different way of approaching a situation but they keep their circles close
Same happened to me in Yugioh MD, I didnt give up on my opinión tho, at the end of the day is not a competitive game and people shouldnt be so pressed about opinions, i dont get karma either, sounds like someone else said "a circle jerk of popular opinions" people only seek validation and belonging.
Yeah in this world u can’t have opinions and original thoughts . 😔
I think you care too much about Karma. It doesn't affect you that much in Reddit. If you're really upset about it, create a new account, it'll put your karma back at 0.
Who cares?
What is the big deal about karma points?
Please touch some grass.
Oh yea, it's Reddit. You get downvoted here for lots of reasons but only a fraction of downvotes actually make sense.

Reddit is the biggest fragile-wiseguy convention the internet has ever seen, since it stole the up and downvote idea from digg dot com.

In other words: My recommendation is to DGAF and leave these people alone with their opinion. Dont't care. There are so many more important things your life has to offer you.

However, wish you a great week OP! ❤️
I am a fan of Magic the gathering particularly the commander format and I made a post that I titled the case against proxy cards. And in the post I laid out all the different arguments as to why people don't like proxy cards. My intention was to have a discussion presenting that point of view to see how people would respond to each kind of argument. I figured it was an opportunity to learn, and engage with people of different perspectives. But it ended up just getting downvoted into Oblivion because it's very unpopular to have the opinion that you don't like proxy cards.
Been there done that
That’s what I do
that's what I do, I lost 2k karma for posting girls can wear what they want but guys can look wherever they want in a gym thread, reddit seems to strongly disagree with me, but whatever... it's just karma
Funny thing about unpopular opinions sometimes they can be popular just depends who is reading
Honestly originally I didn't care because I didn't realize what the impact of negative karma was so I just left the post up for too long. But then I realized there was an issue when I made a separate post about a day later and received no traffic. On that separate post I was trying to get feedback from the community and it's hard to get feedback when people don't see your post 🤷
You know what really grinds my gears tho? Whenever I see threads for unpopular opinions blowing up (often from the subreddit itself showing up as a recommendation for me) - it's the most toothless, milk-toast, office water-cooler chat ever.

Drake isn't even talented. Taylor swift is overrated. Mcdonalds isn't even good. Starbucks isn't really coffee.

Like FFS that's just *Nothing!* tomorrow, ask any middle age white guy his opinion on those four topics and I'm pretty certain that's the responses you'll get. and yet those posts often have thousands of upvotes.
They are equally as useful as Waze points!
It isn’t.
They probably didn't have a comeback. Kind of like someone in a heated internet argument would correct a grammatical or spelling mistake maybe
Right? Silly as high school. Now I will probably get banned for that too.
I don't think I'm worried. But it does impact my ability to participate in reddit. And I'm finding reddit can be fun 🤷
The health benefits of Drano have been suppressed by Big Pharma. I can provide some resources, if you’re ready for your eyes to be opened.
100% this.  It’s super weird.  The culture of each individual sub is so different but it always comes down to some kind of “us versus them”
Yeah, tell me about it. Saying anything "out of the norm" or "against the status quo"     
can dig a deep hole for oneself. Look, were all human at the end of the day and I can have my opinion and people can have theirs, but it is best to keep it to yourself if you feel that it can stir up the wrong recipe. Trust me, in this day of age where social media is primarily one of the dominant forms of communication, people are going react instinctively and emotionally rather than intellectually, no matter if you pertain good intentions and are honest and sincere, if it's gonna make someone's blood boil, than don't say it. Even if you try to explain yourself, it's very difficult to understand tone and whatnot.

Like you said, Reddit loves popular opinions (There's even a subreddit for it) and it's going stay that way because that's how it was designed. The infamous like/dislike or thumbs up/thumbs down mentality is a driving force for the inner workings of many of these big social media sites. The internet of full of differing opinions but whatever is the "loudest and proudest" is going to be spoon-fed to users. 

I've got opinions that I rather not share, but as I long as I don't open my mouth, nobody will ever know unless someone out there is a superhero that can read minds, so congratulations on that. 

It's not just how people would react, but the consequences of that. You could get hacked, doxxed, harassed, etc. and I've seen people threating to ruin each others lives because of their views, beliefs, etc. There's so much more to life out there than arguing with random strangers. So don't even bother, you'll end up wasting your own breath.
(I get the notion, but) counterpoint example: Putin and/or Hitler, etc.
I bet it had something to do with dangerous fantasies you think are reality.
Double it and give it to the next person.
There's a Black Mirror episode about this called Nosedive

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)

The episode is set in a world where people can rate each other from one to five stars for every interaction they have, which can impact their socioeconomic status.
I found the 'zero comments' thing below a post after knowing comments did come in. Touched 'zero comments' area and it opened to multiple comments. Is that some kind of censoring of dissenting opinions or what? Tried it with other posts with the same results.
Yeah if you post something in there bad about Trump you'll definitely get plenty of karma in there, just say bad Trump bad orange man and you'll probably get 2000 Karma within an hour
It can do? 🫣
Forget it. I read your response already. ;)
That is unfortunate but fear not. People with common sense do still exist. They just get drowned out.
I hope Palestinians will find peace someday, and that the more extreme Israelis will be horrified that they became what they sought to destroy
If you have negative karma you can't participate in some subreddits. Also your comments are automatically collapsed so people don't see them unless they click on it and any post that you make doesn't get traffic so people just don't see it.
Right. I don’t care about karma. Downvote me all you want. I said what I said.
I think he said he didn't like baked beans and marmite 😂😂😂
Ironically, you can't post unpopular opinions there. I tried and got suspended (or banned). I wasn't a jerk, I wasn't offensive. The mods are just power hungry.
Your posts don't get traffic and your comments are auto collapsed if you're in the negatives. Also some communities don't let you in at all if you have negative karma
I just deserve an opinion and a voice for my job!
I think it's probably because being anti-proxy cards comes across as incredibly elitist and gatekeepy. People most use proxy cards to have fun with friends or as a creative outlet, they're not tournament legal so it's not like they're affecting professional magic. 

Being against proxy cards is basically telling people they're not allowed to have fun in their personal time. I won't downvote you but I can see why you were downvoted, cause I genuinely can't think of a *good* reason to be against proxy cards outside of gatekeeping the community. You're literally not even allowed to use proxies in official commander format so how is it affecting you lmao.
I thought it was going to be something way worse than this. 😅
I was afraid you were gonna be like some massive bigot or something this actually seems like the most harmless thing that could destroy your karma and I'm sorry that happened to you
Ah, that's where you went wrong... You said an unbiased, unpopular opinion with the intention of discussion and learning. Reddit only likes yes or no and anyone on the other side is an enemy and it's war.

I've learnt this the hard way to but it's never tanked me like it has, you. I hope you get your updoots back my guy.
OOf no wonder you got downvoted hard.

Source: I remember Manaburn.
How DARE YOU?! lol

You're fine. Just keep posting and your karma will increase over time. 

That's not a crazy opinion you have, either. It actually makes sense. 

You are getting lots of sweet karma from this post alone!

Nerds unite!
You’ll be alright, people don’t like to hear some things and they would rather downvote than discuss. Carry on and don’t get caught up in fake internet points!
Yeah that'll do it. People get touchy about the topic.
I don’t know much about magic the gathering at all but that’s insane lol this is not where I thought this was going at all.  When you said you posted something unpopular I was thinking it was going to be related to politics, religion, etc.  but damn that’s nuts 😂
Some reasons why posts may get downvoted:

* Repost: Its a topic that has been discussed recently or been a consistent topic of discussion for months/years and has been done to death. at some point, people may be tired of hearing the same opinion over and over again, even if they agree with it
* The messenger: You don't have a lot of karma and may not be a familiar face in this specific community. So here comes this random person with this loud opinion, and maybe regular users of the community don't recognize you and don't understand why this stranger is barging in with this opinion.
* Phrasing: Even if your intent wasn't to troll or be in-your-face about your post, people may have taken it that way. Different communities can have a lot of different culture, and if you're going to push up against that culture, people may push back
I am a fan of Magic the Gathering - 

There's where the trouble started right there... I find MTG people... passionate about what they like & that is that
Wow, such cultural-marxist methods already used on discussions on card games. It's not unexpected on political topics, but also on card games ?
Lucky that you didn't made a post about k-pop
I get your point but the main reason for proxy support is not everyone can afford such expensive cards, thanks to sites like https://www.printingproxies.com people like me can enjoy the game in low budget. That’s why there’s Lot of support for proxies and people don’t like hearing against proxies because not everyone can afford such expensive cards. There mindset is we should play with player skills not their wallet.
I like you and I started playing magic when I was in elementary school or maybe 6th grade with my dad and his friend! Then I started playing with kids my own age at the local comic book shop when those used to exist. You should be able to speak and have CONVERSATIONS just like me in my doordash site. But the bots I'm SURE are owned by doordash themselves.
Looks like OP has recovered his karma now thanks to everyone voting him up, long live dissenting opinions, And the right to express them ! 
Happy New Year everyone hope you all have a good one even those that don't like me or agree with me ! 
Peace out.
Great profile name !
Girls can wear whatever they want I agree if you as a man disagree then find a type of girl that shares your opinion stop judging others for how they are and keep to your own
Lol imagine this got you downvoted again on here
So watching at them like preys is not a problem for you ? I m introverted and my body is not gender conforming enough not to be insulted if I did the same, so I would not. But I can see some people can doing that to sweat less for example. Issue is why feminine body is sexualized in most northern society yet has less issue with men doing the same ? In some cultures people are topless and bodies aren’t sexualized no matter the gender.

Unpopular opinions should be: I personally think this game is better than this one for x reasons, not sexism.
A few weeks ago I had an \~11 year old account with over 300k karma permanently suspended for a single, made-up word and they denied my appeal.

I was PO’d for a while as it was a paid premium account, but now I’m using other accounts and am in all the same subs (no banned ones).  Instead of their app and premium, I’m just using a browser with an ad blocker and Reddit cleanup extension. If that is how they treat their paying customers, I’m no longer willing to pay premium for any other accounts.

TL;DR don’t take Reddit too seriously. Create other accounts in other browsers or VMs and do what you want.
It’s just people giving opinions. I don’t know what Drake or Taylor Swift are like (I’m 60). You can make your own opinion on McDonalds and Starbucks. 

Maybe you need a break from Reddit?
I think maybe it was a bot saying they didn't have enough karma to comment, there are a decent chunk of subs that have minimum requirements, I get why they do it but still it can be annoying for newer users
Try this;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/wiki/index/newusersubs/#wiki\_low\_to\_no\_restriction\_subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/wiki/index/newusersubs/#wiki_low_to_no_restriction_subs)

pick some subs, sort by "new," post something positive early on in the discussion and see if you can ride a wave.

It's sometimes about luck and timing. I once posed a silly, one-off joke (I don't even remember where or what context anymore) a few yrs ago and got 20k in a day.
> But it does impact my ability to participate in reddit.

It really doesn’t. Most subs you can post just fine. Some will moderate users with low karma but your comments will be approved after not too long.
Reddit's majority of users is compiled of npc-people, no critical thinking whatsoever. 
There's also a subreddit called /unpopularopinion
Oh, if I could upvote you twice I would!
[deleted]
Big brain hours
Ya I liked that series. Such commentary on modern life
Facts don't count for much these days unfortunately
Thank you I appreciate that and I’m not afraid it’s just kinda funny how social media keeps talking about spreading love and accepting everyone so long as you’re following their policy as soon as you disagree with it they don’t even think you deserve to exist anymore and mods are just hypocrites the bans and warnings are very biased
don't they only collapse if you have negative upvotes on that specific comment?
Ahh okay so only if you go negative?
Honestly the post was not set up in a way that said people were bad for using proxies. It was an honest attempt to have a conversation about a different point of view by presenting the arguments from that point of view because I felt it was an opportunity to learn for myself and possibly others

At the end of the post I even presented some scenarios where I use proxies. 

Granted all I learned was don't try to have conversations about a commonly held position by the subreddit community unless you are on the popular side of the opinion

But I should stop now about this cuz I don't wanna risk getting downvoted into Oblivion 😂
Its ridiculously easy, intentional or otherwise, to mark cards using proxies (making it easier to draw the proxy cards). Also the reason I'm personally against them is depending on how they're proxied you have to google the card info over n over. It can be a big headache to play with someone who has 30 proxies and have to google each card then have to double check the wording again 5 minutes later, then check again 10 minutes later to see its cmc to see if its affected by something while it's in ther graveyard. It can cause games to take forever and just not be fun. I don't care if people wanna proxy, no complaints here, but im not gonna play with them if its gonna hinder my game/free time. But I'm not gonna hate on anyone that proxies with their friends. If they're cool with it that's all that matters.
>>Gatekeeping the community

Sounds like a good enough reason to me
Democracy is alive!
Can anybody do this upvoting ?

Maybe we should add a separate thread where everybody with similar problems can tell it, so others may come to help. The same thing happened to me in r/linux, because I don't like certain specific pieces of software, that seems to have some almost religious fanbase.

IMHO, it's a shame that this all becomes necessary in the first place.
I humbly disagree with you.
Hey thanks
Thanks
"But guys can look where ever they want" was probably the issue.
I've gotten used to it, reddit is a weird place with pockets full of opinionated people that gather in different groups, one wrong sentence with the wrong group and you get this.

it is what it is, still love reddit in a weird way though
Thought I read somewhere that it's a permanent site-wide account suspension offense (some kind of evasion, I think) if you create a new account after another account has been permanently suspended?
This person Reddits ⬆️
It's just that they get posted in r/unpopularopinion so they think it's a hot-take. And rather getting voted down, it's voted up. Doesn't make sense to me.
Oh lol 🤣 yeah bots don't have comebacks either
I meant that your grammar sucks
Yes this is true but also if you have negative karma your comments that are not downloaded into Oblivion are still collapsed. At least this was the information that I gathered when trying to figure out what was going on I'm not certain on this but it's the assumption I'm working under. 

And in terms of making a new thread if you have negative karma your thread doesn't receive traffic to almost any capacity
I believe so. Granted I'm new to this information myself so I don't know all the arbitrary lines drawn
reddits format of karma really sets up the perfect scenario for echo chambers. People don't oppose popular opinion for fear of being downvoted. The intent was probably to stop hate speech/phobias w/e but it has this catch 22 effect that was either intended, or wasn't. 

Reddit doesn't exactly foster discussion but rather circle jerking to popularly held opinions to farm karma.
Mtg reddit is as much of an echo chamber as political subs. I think proxy cards are lame and having to use the real cards adds to the deck building skill. Use what you have. Uh oh I only have 2 sheoldreds, guess I need to get creative instead of writing her name on a land. 
I got down voted like you did when I expressed that you don't need to net deck.
I think you've just found the place for what you were trying to make happen. The world works in mysterious ways!
Let's see the post then.  It's very possible what you meant and how it was perceived are very different.  And what I call "Biff's law" went into effect.  That is "Any statement on social media will be taken in the least flattering light possible every single time."
I find this interesting, because me personally, I’m not into magic the gathering, but on the subreddits I go on, I could see two posts with the exact opposite opinion, and still have tons of people agreeing with both. Maybe it’s just that a) have not seen enough of reddit or b) it’s just a ton more biased in said community.
Indeed!
No worries, happy new year !
Yeah I see that one oops
they said 'look' 

not 'stare/ogle/intimidate'

or are women *also* not allowed to look wherever they want if a strapping healthy man walks in with a bulge in all the right places?
Sub ban evasion can get your new account permabanned. Sub bans are when the sub mods ban your account from the sub. This was a site ban, I’m fine as I don’t bother with any subs that banned that other account. There were only 2 or 3 iirc.
You're free to disagree with them and to even leave that subreddit. It's up to you.
Haha, true
well, I was able to see your comments here and they weren't collapsed, not sure if this subreddit is an exception or something though
The original intent was that you were to be rewarded with karma for contributing to the discussion regardless if people agreed with you or not.  That's what it said in the "What is karma" section of the help subs.   Instead of that nowadays it literally says "It's meaningless."
In my opinion, your opinion regarding unpopular opinions is rather unpopular ;(
Yeah, and that whole echo chamber thing doesn't exactly vibe with "The Front Page of The Internet"... Maybe Reddit is aiming to be the Front Page of Facebook. ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
And then the person who can afford 2k+ on a CEDH deck will win 99% of the time.  Then only people who can afford to keep up will play with them.  And they'll likely wind up with no playgroup and nobody is having fun.
>having to use the real cards adds to the deck building skill

What skill? The only difference is if you can spend thousands of dollars or not
Totally agree, i want to play with the cards i have and can afford. Even for kitchen table magic it‘s annoying, if one of your friends shows up with a superpowerful with proxies. It‘s kindof like the prisoners dillemma: it leads to a situation where using proxies is best, so all will use proxies.
Forgot the '/s'. oops
Whoa, never said he was wrong or right. I was simply pointing out the part that may not have been well received by others. Of course people look, and thanks for acknowledging the distinction of looking at staring etc

Edit for clarity
Well, now I'm curious—for future reference. Where's that expert dude, u/jgoja?
[deleted]
Yep. Post about hamburgers saying you don’t like them in the replies? Supposed to upvote that because it’s on topic for the post. Famously that EA response about Battlefront that got downvoted to the abyss should in fact all be upvotes as it’s directly related to the post and contributes to discussion. Most subs have something about following reddiquette but no one ever enforces it.
Truth is the truth no matter how people feel about it.

I say what I say regardless.

;p
Thing is with casual commander : you kinda need to play decks that are roughly on the same power level in order for anyone to have fun imo.

So sure if someone comes with a 2k decks to a table of precons, they won't be invited a second time with that same deck. But they can bring another one more in line with the power level of that specific table.

I personally don't like to play with players using proxies or using proxies myself. That's only because, in my experience, they usually use those proxies to build high ends decks. So in order to have fun I have to either cough up the $ for a similar deck or play with proxies myself... Either way I'm losing out.
Possibly unpopular, but for the longest time I was against proxies \*because\* I was a new player up against people who had been playing since they were children. Forcing them to use the cards they already had was just about the only leveler I had for the playing field; they kept going through phases of selling off their cards then buying back in when they regained interest, so our collections were at least in the same stratosphere (theirs, obviously, still much better). If we allowed proxies, they would have their 20 years of experience to know exactly WHAT to proxy to build the strongest decks they could think of; I would be googling "strongest Magic cards in rakdos" or something to try to keep up.

We're moving into Canadian Highlander now, so I've embraced proxying slightly more, but I fully expect to lose horribly over and over now that restrictions are lifted. If I had that experience when I was learning, probably would not be playing Magic anymore.
While Reddit can impose a permeant user site wide suspension where every account you make gets suspended quickly, it usually takes multiple suspended accounts to get put in that jail.  You can have other accounts after you have one suspended, but you are on double secret probation. It is best to try to appeal your suspension before making a new one though.  And avoiding where or how you got your suspension is a good idea.

Like mentioned, subreddit bans are a different story.  You get banned in one and do not get it successfully appealed and removed, you as the user are banned on all accounts forever.  They have automated detection methods to know it is you.  That is why I would never delete an account while banned because it can never be changed after that because the banned account must appeal to the moderators to get it overturned.
As I said, they realized it was a joke, and 'Reddaquite" just means don't break TOS nowadays.
Then say hello to Hell Level 10 of Reddit’s inferno: Truth… and -100000000000000 karma
I don't see how you can claim that you're losing out if proxies are OK considering you're allowed to proxy, too.
Yeah if we both prroxing supernpowerful decks we may as well flip coins to see who won.
There is a really easy solution to this. Sit down with your group and determine how strong decks are allowed to be
For anyone wondering how to get around the fast bans on newly created accounts, just use incognito mode or the equivalent.
fool, that is my domain XD
I'm losing out because I really don't like playing with proxies in my deck. It's purely a matter of personal preference ofc.
Mind if I join you?

Let us together start an “Anti-Karma” group on Reddit.

My first post will be about the evils of masks: inhaling fibers, brain damage from 30% less oxygen, and the smiles are gone.

Lowest Karma wins.
Then it's not the proxy's fault you aren't having fun.  It's yours.
*puts restriction on themself*

Nice build man.

If you want to helldive together, msg me!
A fellow Nitro+ 7900 XTX enjoyer. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)
But is it cooled... with LIBER-TEA?!
Great build you’re gonna love it. I’m assuming you want to spread democracy but HD2 has some optimization issues especially with xtx cards. You might need to try a few fixes others have posted and see what works until the devs can fix.
DPS now stands for "Democracy Per Second"
Where is the PSU?
Beautiful build. Not getting Helldivers vibes from it at all though...wheres the yellow?
I upgraded to play helldivers at a better fps. No ragrets
I think you need more LED and fans sir.
Yo dawg, I heard you like exhaust fans
Helldivers 2 is awesome so glad I am rocking a 5950x and 6900xt toxic with it.
Ohhh( I have a good pc, and ps5, but I haven’t any friends to play it( for democracy)))
Pretty sure someone stole pictures of this and said it was their build, nice to see the real person who built it
[deleted]
heads up if you are getting any TDR's run helldivers II with --use-d3d11 launch option and set a profile to downclock the GPU to 2500mhz max boost clock. there's still some weird race condition going on at higher clocks. (it's not an unstable overclock) 

I have an asrock xtx aqua and it can do 3200mhz+ frontside clock all day long in alanwake II and midnight suns peaking at 3.4ghz. devs and amd are aware and are working on a fix
The best color combo
that is such a beautiful graphics card
Yeah buddy this is awesome
Best looking card. I have the same one✅
so you use corsair icue, L3 connect, and gigabyte software?
I know in the case of this post, the AIO on the CPU is for looks, but why do I always see people water cooling their 7700x/7800x3d chips. They use like no power and don't need such cooling. The only reason to do it would be for looks but that should be a hard sell with the cost it adds to the build for anyone that doesn't have a big budget.
Need one more fan lol
Beautiful PC!
O sweet liberty.
Those socialist bugs will never know what hit them.
Looks fantastic. I'm glad I'm not the only person who has more than 10 fans in their case lol.
Looks Gorgeous. What's the fan flow configuration. Bottom and side intake and top radiator exhaust?
For freedom 🔥💪🏼. insane build my guy!
Yet another lian li build😴
15 fans holy shit
I love the colour scheme. Planning on making my build white and purple
I love building PCs but these kinds of builds just seem nuts to me. There is no way in hell that is the optimal number of fans. I'd rather have 1/3 the number of fans and 1/3 the case volume for the same performance, less noise, less money and better sleep quality. There are much better ways to spend your money IMO. A custom cooling loop would probably cost the same, look just as good, cool better, and run quieter.
What are all the fans doing. Airflow must be a mess lol
Awesome machine 🤟
Aio looks nice but give it some time the hub and lcd will failbenn through 4 it 3 months
![gif](giphy|J2hEgxmYJ7kppqeTEl|downsized)
Dang! I got that same GPU in my O11 dynamic and it looks massive. In your case it makes the card look tiny!
If helldiver is your go-to then you should get a Nvidia GPU... Trust me I also have 7900xtx and it crashes way too often... Even after all the guides I followed.
Looks Insane, but wait for the crashes...
Running above 6000-6200mhz on the ram causes the memory controller frequency to cut in half, making it slower than 6000mhz cl30
🤣
AIO is overkill for that CPU, and I love it.
Hell yeah. Honestly i havent even got around to downloading it yet. Been watching alot of videos on it. Sure does look sick!
![gif](giphy|3osxYrgM8gi9CDjcPu)
I should've spent the extra $100 for one. The HellHound is great but it kinda seems like a budget xtx compared to the others. Two colors... come on man really?
Liberty for all!
Luckily im not ready to play yet, be a few more weeks. So hopefully by then it will be snuffed out. I appreciate the heads up!
Luckily im not ready to play yet, be a few more weeks. So hopefully by then it will be snuffed out. I appreciate the heads up!
Its behind the motherboard! This case features a dual chamber design behing the motherboard tray, where the psu is located and so much room for cables
I just stole the phrase. 🤣
Same. Just picked up a 6800 and the game looks amazing on 1440p max settings
There is 7 intake fans in there too. Lol
Yes, brother!
I havent even started
Feel free to PM me if you come across the post if this is true! Thank you!
So far i love it. Zero complaints!
I agree!
![gif](giphy|l1ughbsd9qXz2s9SE)
This is correct.
Understandable, the colder the better though has always been my thing.
The 3D cache is thick and insulates the die. They require a lot more cooling than most people think.



My 7800X3D with a 5% overclock draws only 90W, yet comes very close to thermal throttling on Cinebench with an EK-Nucleus 240mm.


Also, my EK-Nucleus was $90. That's a top tier AIO for less than a Noctua tower cooler.
Thank you!
Lmao
Why have the minimum when you can go maximum?
Bottom and side intake, top and back exhaust. Thank you!
Thank you sir!
Wake up!
![gif](giphy|3XrAfHxRxropW)
Its the best!
Maybe the loop is a future idea. Lol im happy with it though.
7 intake fans.
Is your case the XL? Lol
We will see soon enough!
🤷🏼‍♀️
No it doesn't. I'm running memclk=uclk at 6400mhz just fine
Its not set to that, thats just the spec on the box.
How much did you pay in fans?  
Edit: I'm not knocking him, I'm just curious of the price
Absolutely haha. I use a regular fan cooler and it doesn't go over 65C under load
Still have a custom 420mm watercooling coming with like 250ml reservoir and 1-1,5L coolant in total just for a non overclocked 6700K.
Overkill watercooling is top tier.
Cooling = Top
Tier = Dumb
💀😂
Such a great game. And check out the subreddit. Hilarious community. It's definitely a hard game, especially solo, but a lot of fun.
Owned it for a month and I have 180 hours. Its too good i can’t esccape
![gif](giphy|l0ExbnGIX9sMFS7PG)
before i have gskill ram but it got some issues, got corsair ram now, i thought this ram supports armory for rgb controll l, but it is not, need to install icue, cant find any thing to sync ot with my mobo, asus, i hate this bloatware,  wish i got msi or gigabyte as mobo.
Because at a certain point, adding fans *disturbs* airflow. You can put some smoke (a burning stick, absolutely not a vape or cigarette!) near your intake fans if you want to visualize it.



There have been a few different tests done on how many fans is optimal (though these were done on more traditional front to back cases). 3 fans is the point of seriously diminishing returns, from 4 to 5 was less than 1 degree of change, and beyond that things got worse.



It does look cool though.
I love how you wrote MEM instead of storage.
Roughly 450$ there not including the 3 that came with the AIO.
I cant wait to experience it. Lol
So, is this the Nitro+ 7900XTX meeting point? o7
Yeah signal and armor i was not happy with, so ill deal with all separate software, but atleast it controls it correctly. Signal was the worst for me
Ill have to test. But my thermals look good so far with it not breaking 70 on the cpu under heavy load.
Oops. Lol
Nice, wish I could afford to get nice fans 😀
WHAT THE HELL. MY WHOLE PC IS 1000$ and bro spends half if that in fans
Any hidden fans or the 15 visible? Idk 30 per fan today sounds expensive imo but that looks fuggin amazing and 2013-2018 i would have done it the exact same way🫶🏻 did spend useless amounts of cash on custom watercooling on my first 3 builds but never got nice fans in that time but hq pump/rad/res ect

Love that build of yours!
[removed]
Nitro+ BBC gang gang
same, i also tried signal was pain to set up, so i ended up using both L3 for fans and strimmer and armory for mobo, cooler and gpu rgb, but now icue for ram 

how did you sync your ram to your mobo?
You can!!
….. i can explain… 🤣
Thank you, no 15 fans plus the 3 on the GPU and the 1 on the PSU if you want to get technical. Lol
Cheaper if you dont go fancy.
Fancy fans can go $30 per fan and up

I didnt. The ram is controlled through iCue as its a corsair product. So just set the colors to what i want like normal. 

Signal completely made my RGB freak out. Instant delete. Lmao
Man give me like 200$ and i’d be happy as heck. Bro spent 500$ on fans lol 😭😭 If you’re interested in investing for my wallet, i’ll give you my paypal 😂😂
Kudos :D but i meant „external“ fans you had to install yourself. I am looking for led/infinity mirror + daisy chain or what the cableless ones are called for a justified price. Thats why i am asking. 450 with argb controller/hub or just the fans? Without that would be 30$ per
Ah forgot to ask if you can tell performance diff on aio with 3 compared to 6 fans since im awaiting what i think is the same aio or an older version of the galahad ii 360
Man if i had it like that, id help everyone i could bro.
I bought a couple 3 packs (comes with controller) and a few singles (the reverse fans) about 40$ for singles. Around 130-150 for the 3 packs.
I did not do testing before and after the AIO setup. When i built it i went straight for the push/pull setup. In theory, it should be better then not having the 3 extra fans.
Come to my country, if you can work your job from home and you’ll be rich as everything is cheaper
What country is that. Lol
Didn’t know Apple does that.
Just received this email, almost a week after placing my order. I never got that kind of email from Apple before. The new price is $230 cheaper. What could be the reason for lowering the price that much?  
Did you get the 16GB RAM variant? That would explain the price lowering, it was an upgrade before, now it’s the base model for the same price.
I haven’t seen them do that before, but I’ve definitely seen them upgrade existing orders when an updated model gets released. Makes sense from their perspective since you could just return the one you ordered within 14 days and buy the new one at the new price anyway. This way they aren’t dealing with a return and are also able to make a customer happier than expected.
I believe this is because they made the base model the one with 16 GB RAM, so if you ordered a 16 GB now it’s technically the base - they are refunding you the upgrade.
All retailers should do this. They’d save money and gain favour from customers that realise the price went down, return their order, and redo their order.
Former Apple, specifically worked for the online store, and yep, this is standard practice! When your order has yet to be fulfilled, you may benefit from a price change or model upgrade if applicable, when there's a new release. Older models tend to get a discounted rate if they're still sold.
Nice share. I like when companies show integrity, that's how you build brand loyalty.
I had something similar. I ordered a 15" Macbook Pro a fee days before the new/first 16" Macbook Pro was released and they emailed and said they canceled that order and automatically placed an order for the new, bigger one at the same price. Very end of 2019
Interesting to see. I’ve heard of this happening but this is the first actual evidence I’ve seen of it. 

Pretty awesome thing for any company to do.
Not relating to order but I did an iPhone battery replacement right before the batterygate price drop. I just accepted that it was my loss for not waiting a few more weeks. But months later, Apple emailed me saying that they will honour the new price and refund me the difference.
That's great service on behalf of Apple to honor and handle
Congratulations motherfucking congratulations
Sales? November seems to be all sales in the run-up to BF/CM
Not product related but I’ve cancelled apple care and they refunded the unused period
Did you order a 16GB ram variant? They lowered it to be the new base model so if you paid for the upgrade, you aren't needing it anymore and they refunded you. Hope this gives some explanation.
All variants went up $130 in Canada :(
As a former Apple Retail person, I’m super stoked for the store teams that Apple preemptively avoided that store visit to get a refund that the store team can’t easily do.
Very rare apple W
Apple doing something consumer friendly? Wow!
Huh. Nice.

Probably has something to do with the fact that they sneakily set the base ram for the air to 16gb. This is super cool though, I’ve come across some stores that offer to refund the difference within a short period of time if something goes on sale right after you buy it but they don’t really advertise it and they definitely don’t just reach out and hand you the refund.
I’m sure redditors will find something to hate Apple over this.
Rarest Apple email ever.
That is awesome. I half expected Apple to just try to gouge customers like yourself, happy to see they are proactively reducing the price.
Du j yeah free ram
Cool
Credit card processors usually charge business a fee of about 2.4 - 3.0% to run your credit card, and Apple doesn’t get that back if they have to refund your order. So it doesn’t make much difference in the cost to them whether they just give you the price difference back now, or wait for you to return the computer and buy a new one at the lower price. But the difference in goodwill you feel towards the company is substantial.
Apple win
They did that maybe because they don't manifacture your order and they upgraded
This is top tier service.

When I ordered an iMac back when it was only Bondi Blue, the original one, they did the same thing when the five colors came out a week after I ordered.
Pro tip, you can also get the 8GB models on the refurbished store at a discount.
Because companies aren't actually allowed to charge your card until the product ships, they just put a hold on the card. You hadn't even been charged yet so they just updated the hold.
They have done it for ages. 30 days before new release? You get a refund or upgrade.
“Dispatched”, so not a US thing?
New models are coming in November from what I’ve heard. Not a bad come up!
16gb of ram is the base sir, they didn’t do it out of the kindness of their heart, legally they have to give you the current price 🫡 enjoy it 🙏
Don’t worry, they’ll get you on the backend with some sort of adapter you now need to connect everyday devices.
I was 3 days outside the purchase protection window 😒 paid and extra $180 for the 16gb upgrade zzz
If I knew they would upgrade the whole macbook air lineup as well, I would've waited three months. Now I feel like I have wasted money \~300$. :(
It happened to me a while back when buying an iMac. They updated the machines between placing the order and shipping it so I got the equivalent machine from the new lineup.
They only do this to avoid getting sued and not from their goodwill. Some kind of advertising / pricing law.
Long time ago I ordered the iPod 4th gen (click wheel) right before the 5th gen came out and got a similar email that apple was sending me the 5th gen right before it was officially out.
That's so cool. Wish it happens often.
Also regardless of whether it was dispatched, I think you have a 2-week period to request a partial refund (if the price dropped within 2 weeks of purchase). That's how it was for me in New Zealand anyway.
What are they gonna do with all the 8 gig ones now?
Which MacBook Air did you order exactly? I wanna order one. PM me?
🐐!!!
I got the 16gb model in Augustus
I got something similar forever ago. I ordered a G5 iMac and they upgraded it to the newer model.
You purchased your Mac immediately before the new ones came out ( which one should never do )
Uh, maybe because they just released new computers
The new m4 chip.
You could send it back and order the cheaper one! that costs the company more in the end.
Yes I did. Cool!
Is the new base model the 8 CPU Cores, 10 GPU Cores though?

Or is it just 16 GB RAM on the base model with 256 GB Storage and 8 CPU Cores, 8 GPU Cores?
I wonder what they would do if you ordered the 8GB version
Didn’t know the 16GB RAM is base model now so it’s nice that they did that.
What would happen if someone ordered the 8GB version? Would they get a partial refund as well, or would they not assuming that they no longer offer it?
It's likely the law in some jurisdiction that was adopted as policy.

Some states/countries take consumer protections seriously.
Most likely due to the exchange rate with the US dollar. Our dollar has dropped in value so prices were raised to reflect that.
Sneakily? They announced it, in video and text.
I’m in the Middle East. How did you know from that one word though?
I guess [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/s/pNqz8Rqg6g).
https://preview.redd.it/8lknwz5o4pyd1.jpeg?width=1124&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79ab6c5fd4915486bbe906447886c83af7975978
You probably talking about the new MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini. I ordered a MacBook Air. The M4 MBA releases early next year. Also, the M3 is more than enough for me.
It’s because the 16GB RAM (the one I ordered) has now become base model for MacBook Air. Wouldn’t have known if it weren’t for the replies here.
Nice! If you ordered a week earlier you wouldn’t have gotten the discount! Lucky!
The new base model still only has the 8 core GPU
You could just check the website yourself but the 8/8 core is still the base model for the 13” M2 and M3, while the 8/10 core is the base model for the 15” air.

In testing it’s been shown that the 2 extra gpu cores really don’t contribute much of a performance uplift, however they have a major impact on battery life. Imo it’s not worth upgrading due to that.
Maybe just auto-upgrade it?
Yep, to support Apple Intelligence across the range, the base Macs are now all 16GB and iPhones 8GB.
They would probably get an automatic upgrade to 16GB with no additional charge.
Name one place that makes it the law to refund people when you release a new product sku upgrade.
For the MacBook Air models it was about seven seconds of a 10+ minute video on the MacBook Pro. Was an easy one to miss, but then again Reddit exploded about it…
👍
We don’t really use the word “dispatched” for anything here in the US (unless it’s related to the police or something). We typically use “shipped”.
thankssss! (in Parseltongue)
Exactly this. The base RAM increase came as a surprise to everyone.
I think most people would just leverage the returns window for this, so probably easier for Apple to be proactive on it.

They look like they’re doing people a favour, whilst actually just stopping them from getting a bunch of used devices back.
> Nice! If you ordered a week earlier you wouldn’t have gotten the discount! Lucky!

Regularly there are posts with people whining about "just buy it now! Don't worry about the money!" and... this is why people wait. If they had ordered a week ago they'd be right to just return it and re-order to save the money.

And this is why I generally recommend against buying a month or two before new stuff comes out.

Some folks are in the financial situation that a few hundred bucks is like $10 to me and you, sure, whatever, buy it whenever. For those of us living in reality and in a non-uber wealthy position... be intelligent with how you spend.
I remember there's still a 14 day policy for requesting Apple to refund the difference of the price if Apple has lowered it.
>however they have a major impact on battery life

I have a hard time believing that 2 GPU cores have that much of an impact on battery life, since the M4 ships with 10 GPU cores but provides better battery life than prior MacBook models
I had no idea. TIL.
You’re absolutely right. Return Windows and Consumer Price Protection (including concierge services for those that pay for the higher tier credit cards) would make this more of a hassle for Apple than it’s worth. Proactive, as you say, is the best course here
True, but I mean I wouldn’t be complaining, it’s a win-win!
I did exactly that, canceled the ordered and placed the order again for the 12/18 cores instead of 11/14 for the same price. Hadn’t picked mine up either yet but they didn’t update the price.
m4 has a smaller die size, that's why it's better on power.
Got tired of cutting myself 
…on the edge of my MacBook Air M2.
Cutting-edge technology.
I thought I was crazy. Nevermind.
Anyone else touch their edges right after this picture? They are kind of pointy but cutting yourself..seems like a stretch to me
Okayyyyh that’s enough Reddit for today.
What the fuck
If the edges are that sharp that you cut yourself, maybe see a doctor? No way you cut yourself that easily
I mean I hate it but I understand. They’re not that sharp but they do get uncomfortable
I should close the reddit for today
Someone please point me to the circlejerk sub this belongs in
Fuck yeah! Love when people do mods on the extreme side!
i mean... its your Mac, do what ya want mate, you paid for it

personally i wouldve tried a case or smth, before permanently altering the hardware, but its not my machine now, is it?
bros skin thinner than a toiler paper
Defiled.
This is refreshing after the countless tiny dent/minimal damage posts that people obsess over. Good job brother, can’t wait to see the people that use their obsessively pristine Mac’s for nothing noteworthy to seethe over this post lmao
Mans is too sawft
this is the type of posts reddit needs more of. and judging by the comments nice job.
No no I’m with you, those edges aren’t sharp but they’re not comfortable
Bruh a case for your macbook wouldve covered the edges…
You do you my friend! Very well done!
1) What the fuck

2) Looks **surprisingly** good
I agree with this guy, but the title could have been “I had enough of the sharp corners digging into my palms” 😂
r/DIWHY
Seeing some fanboys breaking down over this is so satisfying lol
You can do even better -- get 3000 grit sandpaper and then polishing compound and a drill polishing wheel. It'll look like a factory option.
the fact that you put nsfw on this post makes sense, cuz WTF.
Could have used a fine sand paper
I appreciate the NSFW tag 😂. I don’t get the hate, I wouldn’t have done this myself, but it’s your MacBook, you had an issue that bothered you and you solved it! As for the esthetics, I think it looks better than a case or than putting stickers on it.

You might want to do an extra pass with fine grit (wet) sandpaper though.
The result is straight fire bro, You sir are the first owner to have a macbook with a shamford edge. it reminds me back from 2013 with the iphone 5s.
Is your name Mr Burns, OP?
Not a bad idea those Macbook shells can be sharp never been cut by it but its hella uncomfortable to press against
Was that completely necessary to keep the mac on? With your last google search? Lmao
Anyone else run their fingers along the edges after taking this? They’re kinda sharp, but getting cut seems like a long shot to me.
there's a gasket around the screen that you want to make contact with the bottom part while it's closed.  You're going to get so much dust in there after this.
The silver lining on the black actually looks great as an accent
Apple probably taking notes rn 🤣
If those edges were cutting you I think you should go see a doctor
I feel you OP.
How did you cut yourself? I’m on my MacBook all day and I’m fine.
Wtf wrong with people
I literally just opened Reddit…😭
Where there's a will there's a way. I'd probably do the same in your position of irritability. I'd buff out and soften that grain too.
I did this when there was a chip in my laptop, much preferred it

Looks good OP
This actually feels like a good touch to the design
The title scared me 😭
soft hands brother
Bruh -_-

There are two sharp points in front of the track pad but the only way I see that cutting you is if your skin is made of paper
https://preview.redd.it/551k6tx99byd1.jpeg?width=320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e729909d342c2f6c8c7e79e02843b195aad03c3d
I’m picturing the driest and thinnest skin known to man
what tha actual fuc
I've been about to do this for a month now but I can't find my metal file, but when I do...
[deleted]
I mean, looks alright and you made your computer more comfortable for you, well done. Way better than using something you don't really enjoy only because it was intended so
I don't know how fragile your skin is, it's not such biggie for me. Even after I run my hand through the sharp edge vigorously it just give me a sharp sting, not cutting my skin off. lol.
😢
Ummm
Do you use your MacBook for edging or what? How the fuck do you use it to get yourself cut wtf. Enough reddit for a day. My fucking god. I shall meet you in the deepest pits of hell.
Some people,man…
It kinda looks cool though.
should have bought a silver model, then it would blend right in.
It hurts my whole body
I bet it looks awesome. Show us full pictures
Y’know what the second image freaked me the fuck out but on looking closer you clearly know what you’re doing and the end result looks pretty decent. Hope you cross-filed it smoother!
i mean it looks kinda nice
I think its looking better this way
The fact that it is the black model too, so it's even more visible what you have done, lmaoooo.
Nice work with the bag and masking tape. Would've been way too easy to get aluminum shavings inside and short circuit something.
lmao alr relatable, honestly that looks kinda scifily cool! Kinda like the texture of those newer ODM gears! Alternatively tho you could have gotten a plastic cover haha
Hmp, interrsting.. Apple could actually get inspiration from that for the future models
Is this humour ?
My boss wishes I would deburr my parts this well… very nicely done. I am quite impressed, and that’s coming from someone who files edges every day.
Going for those homemade chamfered edges lol I’m honestly surprised Apple hasn’t done this already. It was a nice design on the iPhone 5/s
Ya know, not bad
i honestly use those edges to scratch itches on my hand sometimes (i have eczema and i know i shouldnt but i cant help it :/ )
Yes, yes. This is the polish that they should have done already at the factory. I hate the sharp edges. It is supposed to be a user friendly computer after all!

Please Apple, take notes.
That looks cool!
Not bad I guess
Actually that don't look half bad
are you high?
Totally understandable (not that you were actually cutting yourself on this). The thing that truly disturbs me is that you left the machine running while doing it. That just feels so wrong.
Great mod! What would really bother me is if you didn’t grind all the edges evenly. Please make sure to check. /OCD OFF
After my Air M1 got dented in a fall, I filed down the corner just a bit to make it less noticeable and sharp. Since it was silver, I used a nail shaper, so it was only a slight adjustment and hot noticeable.

What you did is shockingly bad — especially with darker colors. You should find a matching color as soon as possible to make it less overwhelming.
Excellent! Well done
The last picture reminds me of an old Dell XPS for some reason. Overall it looks pretty slick!
valid
FUCK YEAH! Zoom out lets see how it looks
now you will grind yourself with that edge
Honestly looks good with the midnight and silver
I can’t even I had no idea what this post was going to be but damn that’s satisfying! Great job!
That aluminum isn’t anodized on the edge so it may oxidize and give you gray stains on your hands but it’s still better than cuts or chafe.
Dude files down his Macbook while it’s still powered on, wrapped in plastic.  Dude.
Polish it down with an angle grinder or dremel.
Apple will tell you that you are typing wrong.
I swear my Lenovo is gonna get this treatment as well. Why tf do they make em sharp, roll the fcking edges 🎃
OP, people who are complaining are clowns that just can’t see a word where form should follow function. To me it is reminiscent of an old, well worn camera, and kinda like it.
That’s metal af. Literally
A decade ago I worked at a job that switched out the desks for standing desks. I LOVED the standing desks - I have been lucky to always have one since - but I noticed my dress shirts kept ripping in a certain spot. Either at the elbow or slightly below it. Coworkers would make fun of me for buying cheap dress shirts until one day one person also had that same issue! 

WELL, the issue was that the edges were sharp. Sometimes you can FEEL a sharp edge but not really care but I guess me shifting around and moving my mouse was enough for it to create that tear. They reached out to the company that did the install but there wasn't a solution as of course desks are made of cheap wood so if you filed it down....you're going to just break that shit. 

SO, the solution really was "don't wear long dress shirts"
Brilliant. 
Here’s to the crazy ones… 
🍻cheers.
RIP warranty ... cause they ain't gonna touch that, as it has obviously been altered.
Reminds me of that post of the guy that dinged his MacBook and posted here asking if it’s be a good idea to dremel the ding away lmao
Is this what the kids mean with edging?
I'm kind of surprised reading the comments actually. I get that it's an expensive laptop or whatever, but coming from the guitar world I was looking at this post thinking "wow that's so smart"

It's pretty much the same thing that you'd do to sharp uncomfortable fret ends on a guitar. Makes sense to me.
Are you this guy irl?

Straight to jail
Why didn’t the file cut their hands?🙌
Tbh pretty neatly done
Watch wearer here. Same. Though, not as big of a bevel. 
This reminds me of the mid 2000s dell Inspiron design language
I love how OP hasn’t said a damn thing in the comments lol
The way I heard the filing in my head left me incredibly uncomfortable 🥴
Is your skin made of paper?
I will never understand people.
Now alodine it.  It will make that bare aluminum look sweet
Gee! I thought it was just me! I hate my Mac Air because of this cutting edge, glitch touchpad and the keyboard just sucks. I will never buy another computer without a mechanical keyboard. They work so much better, I love the sound and feel and they work 100% better than Mac’s keyboards.
Looks better
How tf you can cut yourself on the edge of mba?
This is insanity at its finest.
https://i.redd.it/d1p1242ddcyd1.gif
Congratulations your MacBook warranty just expired!🎉
I tried cutting myself on the edges of my MacBook. Doesn’t cut.
You uh, you could have gotten a case.
Bro said fuck the google results and got in the lab 😂
I love how you had “macbook air too sharp” googled up as you were doing this, makes it seem like a spur of the moment thing like fuck it I’m gonna file down my Mac
Can’t even lie. I don’t hate it.
That actually looks so sick dude
That title had a different meaning until I clicked on the post
Bro has glass bones and paper skin
What the fuck
Tbh this looks dope. Any chance to get a picture of the whole laptop?
Happy Halloween
But like why not get peripherals that are actually comfortable😐
Lmao dude is insane but I totally get it. Not everyone rests their hands the same while using the trackpad & those edges are far from smooth.
Idk if I love the look of it, but regardless, you did a clean job. So for that, nice work.
https://preview.redd.it/od92jwtig9yd1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b199d057a6a4a72bd7d22509732e6dc1f7fdbbaa
that... is... genius and stupid at the same time. RESPECT
Okay I kinda fw it though
There it is. The dumbest shit I’ve seen this year.
look how they massacred my boy, the corners aren't even that sharp
I’ve shaved the corners of tables with my 2019 MacBook. Accidentally too. The edges are so sharp.
I have a clear protective case on mine. If anything the case itself is sharper than the edges
And I’m tired of getting electrocuted by any computer I touch. No seriously whether it’s a Dell monitor or a Mac I shock myself somehow
How many grits?  That would be dope tinted now.
Why u didn't use adhesive strips for that?
Cutting yourself, what are you made out of?
Wtf
I thought I was a raving lunatic but you man beat me
If the edges were hurting your forearms that much, you are probably sitting too low relative to your computer. Your elbows shouldn't be lower than the keyboard, and you probably could have just bought a wrist rest to go in front.
What model are people cutting themselves on?
Put some Paint or a sharpie so that the metal part isnt visible
Bro is the one who knocks the door
Zoom out a little would ya ?
Prolly would have gone with a finer file, that’s a pretty coarse file…
Good, now color match it.
Who what when  why and how
Get ready to be stung by…
Wait that’s illegal
NGL, people have done a lot stupider things with technology before. Just hit it with some 320 or 400 sandpaper, and then maybe a polishing wheel and it would make it look a lot more finished.
„Cutting“ yeah sure… sure…
Probably has sensitive skin that cuts easy and now Apple must follow up and bring back snow white plastic MacBook.
Really? You know insanity comes in all shapes and sizes. If you are filing on your Mac, there’s a problem but it ain’t the computer.
r/DiWHY
Is your skin made of rolling paper?
👀
what in the fuck..
Cutting yourself?  You're holding it wrong.
You could use your MacBook as a weapon, frisbee it! 😂
\*Gasps\*
Hell no
I have thought about this but this guy really got it done. r/madlads
How the hell are you cutting yourself on the edges? Is your skin tissue paper?
Nah dude lol
lol what??
Have you considered positioning yourself higher relative to the laptop so that your arms aren't pressing down on the edges?
That looks like straight-up ass.
Good luck with that resale value.
Thats why y like the wedge design better
Of course no one in the history of computers has ever cut themselves on anything like this. You might have gotten more traction if you were just honest and said “hey, check out this DIY hack I did to smooth out the edge for fun.”

I mean the majority of the comments here are about the “cut myself” part and not the actual mod.
No way 😨
Had to affirmingly comfort the aluminium edges of my phone after seeing this atrocity. May God have mercy, OP
Can we get a full image of the final result? This is a really cool mod!
Cutting yourself ? You have a lot of problems my friend 😂😂😂
What the fuck
What in the dexter are you doing to that macbook?
Cutting edge technology for ya! I may need to do this too, but got a workaround with microfiber cloth to rest between my palms and laptop edges.
[removed]
I have an m1 macbook air, the first and maybe the last mac I have and will have. I love windows, I prefer mac just because of the portability, battery life, and the fact that there is no central manufacturer of quality windows laptops, that being said, I would never do anything so stupid to my macbook.
The Cardinal Sin
Looks clean… if I tried something like that I’d mess it all up
Turned out better than I expected 👌🏾
What?? How exactly are you cutting yourself with the edges of a MacBook? If it was a 2010 Mac Pro or even a 2020 iMac I would get it, but a MacBook Air? How???
Hmmm... Looks like you are some kind of machinist based on the single cut file without a handle. Also, a machinist can put chamfers on sharp edges of metal for protection against cuts. Otherwise, a machinist wouldn't be bothered by such details on a laptop. I am somehow confused...
Are bevels the new sharp edges?
Cutting edge MacBook. Install Fedora on it and it will be truly Cutting-edge!🤣🤣🤣
End product looks decent tbh. Nice job OP hope you’re happy.
wont it shock you?
Honestly it's not a bad idea, you should sell it as a service
How do you manage to cut urself on the edges? Are u made of rough playdough
Can that be patented ?
Apple might need that
Edgebook > Chromebook
This just sounds like one of those things people sue over rather than file down.
You’re fucking gentle!
Looks cool for me. I don’t have the balls to do it.
Cuts? Really? The only thing this could cut would be wet toilet paper lol.
..
Loving the safety glasses
I approve this.
So well done! Good job
Love it, mad man
I agree with OP .. i hate how sharp the edges are
I thought you got tired of cutting yourself and instead decided to choke your laptop to death by wrapping in that cover.
You need to see a dermatologist… and a psychiatrist.
Bro I just opened reddit...
Absolutely crazy
Hey that actually looks pretty cool.. copyright it or something lol
What the fuck but seems like you did a good job
Good job man, fuck the haters. The edges do feel sharp and uncomfortable.
Are your fingers made out of cake?
I like it
I like it.
Haha, this is honestly a pretty cool mod! Apple should totally steel your idea and give the mac a little bit of a curved bevel, it would look so cool and feel amazing.
Over the top but I appreciate it since the edge is bothering me as well. The simple minded me thought of a cover 😹
Jesus, you’ve all lost the plot. Who files down their laptop?
LOL love it
There were way better ways to go about this if it really is an issue...
Resell value drop 80%
Dumbest person award goes to you
The edges are cutting you? Weak skinned. But the horror I have seen in this post. Cannot be unseen.
Wow what a great product Apple created, as always
Imagine working so hard for a tool that enables careers and creativity and destroying it like that
this is some ragebait right here

edit: i think this post was supposed to be on another thread.  oh well.

Yep. I’m going to file this away for later.
this comment upset me more than the post​
Grr take my upvote.
You said that in a raspy voice yeah?
Crazy? I was crazy once
I'm not crazy.  My mom had me tested.
Here's to the crazy ones
What in the meth
Whew… back on the ‘not crazy’ side of the fence!
Here’s to the crazy ones…
Yeah the OP is definitely cray-cray!
You touched your edges?
lol i cut myself on a rubber spatula by trying to cut myself with a rubber spatula to prove a point that you can't cut yourself with a rubber spatula....
Bro's been rubbing cortisone on his wrists for the past 10 years and has thin skin obviously
My previous laptop had a barb on the edge after something fell on it. I had to do that.
Stop edging….
It hurts my hands for sure.
Thats edgy
> seems like a scratch to me

Missed opportunity
They’re fine
I shaved off skin before with them. They are definitely sharp enough
Bruh this is the first post I see when I open reddit :(
It's actually nicely done, clean and unique, and the corners are uncomfortable. Still I wouldn't do that
And I think we can all agree, fuck cancer
Why did this generic comment got so many upvotes? Reddit bots are crazy
Bros skin is like wet Charmin toilet paper for real.
Bro is like 90 or something
I don't cut myself on my mbp but I do get a tiny sharp scratch   when my arm rests on the corner sometimes, which is annoying and indicates a poor finish on a supposedly premium product.

I've considered a much scaled down version of what op has done here just to dull the sharp edge ever so slightly but never really worked how to do it safely without damaging the machine
Why I miss my old M1 MBA. The wedge was just perfect
On my sharp edges.

I have a nice leather case for my M1 MacBook Pro that makes it look nice and makes it feel so good when I carry it. I paid a few extra bucks for it, but damn, it makes a huge difference.

I've never had a problem with the edges. Maybe I'm just not sensitive enough.
would have looked better on a silver one
A bit?
I do that too 🤤
No
That’s what I thought :( don’t know what Apple service would say if he took it in on warranty for a problem. And, a hefty chunk out of the resale value too.

This looks “dope” to you? It’s horrible!
I quite like it too, reminds of the black trimmed armour in classic RuneScape

Here ya go.
Buying a laptop for 2k just to buy a keyboard and a mouse and use the screen is also dumb
it looks like shit
90%
It's hand crafted in the USA.
Thank you OP for making this little boy cry lol
It takes some grit to do this to your MacBook!
The way OP filed it away, or a different way?
They locked me in a room
Here's to the crazy ones.
Time, it’s a magazine! Used to cost a quarter. 

Quarter? I lost my quarter! Rats! 

Rats? I hate rats! They make me crazy!

Crazy? People used to think I was crazy, so they locked me in my room for a long time…

I edged while touching myself.
Not anymore, gotta stay strong on the NNN
You just reminded me of this time I was little and making pancakes in the kitchen with my sister. She dropped a bottle of caramel sauce and momentarily panicked, thinking it would break. I picked it up, said something along the lines of “it’s plastic, it can’t break. Look.” Before proceeding to confidently drop the bottle causing it to burst and spread caramel sauce everywhere.
Back off of it you go XD
I just got here.
You summed it up perfectly.
I'm tempted to do it.
I would have just added a skin myself. This is reckless.
Lol no it isn’t, it looks like shit. That’s way too much material removal he just intended to break the edge.
Shoutout lil boosie
Huh
Um, yeah?
What?
Fuck cancer.
Sorry 🤷‍♂️
And crafted what he wanted.
A lion.
That’s what I say too. The wedge was the best form factor.
It looks like you wrapped your arm with press n’ seal?
They are not, but this is worse
Maybe. I think the aluminum will get less shiny when it oxidizes. I’d like to see a picture after a couple of months.
You can’t trade that in. It’s trashed.
Now those edges are gonna get you hurt
Yes it does
How do you like the results? If it were me, I’d probably go over it with sandpaper working up to 800-1000grit to make sure it’s soft and uniform
Based
You did a good job this comment section full of haters
Can’t argue with that.
$3K+ if you want four monitors. 😵
That’s a very fine statement!!
The dad joke shavings coming out on this thread are horrible.
Oh, definitely this a-way. I think it will take a little more grit and determination to do it right though.

Edging is fine during NNN, but don't give in just yet
I myselfed while edging touch
This is also the first damn post I saw
Cancer is a horrible disease. That's why u/M3MacbookAir is saying "fuck cancer."
The wedge is what made it a MacBook Air. The last laptop design while Jobs was around, iirc.
If the wedge hadn't existed and was now introduced people would call it a great form factor upgrade. Not fond of the squared-off design. The wedge was also nicer to pick up and carry around the house/office, with a nice low approach angle for your wrist to land on that keyboard runaway 🛬
I think it's wet toilet paper or a kleenex, note that the hand has water drops. Also looks like the pattern on some toilet paper. 

hm....
It does but it oxidises grey and generally not a flat consistent grey but a patchy patina
Also for consistency (otherwise it would drive me mad) I probably would have got someone with a laser bevel cutter to do it rather than hitting it with a file by hand
Now, now, no need for course language!
Rats. They make me crazy
My edges are touched
Sorry, the captain has a sharp tongue.
Crazy? I was crazy once.
But rubber rats make me angry!
Please don't speak to us in that rasping voice.

Quick tests on 7800X3D with Windows 11 24H2 - Impressive!
I run lots of benchmarks, capture stats on games, etc., and decided to see what 24H2 might do for my 7800X3D/7900XTX/X670E system. All results are based on the most recent runs on 23H2, and on 24H2 runs today (August 26, 2024) using the preview release. The BIOS settings, Adrenaline version/settings, system software, etc. are all the same, the only difference being the OS version. Most benchmarks were run/captured once, so this is not exhaustive or scientific.

Results:

|Benchmark|23H2|24H2|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Geekbench 6 Single|2389|2660|11.5%|
|Geekbench 6 Multi|14104|14824|5.1%|
|Cinebench 24 Single|97|115|18.5%|
|Cinebench 24 Multi|1018|1061|4.2%|
|Time Spy (CPU)|12239|12990|6.1%|
|BM: W bench FPS|96.6|113.6|17.6%|
|BM: W bench 1%|83.4|98.2|17.7%|
|Fortnite FPS|193.9|248.6|28.2%|
|Fortnite 1%|138.2|195.8|41.7%|

Notes:

* BM: W is Black Myth: Wukong. This is the benchmark version at 2560x1440 Cinematic, RT off. Stats are captured at the section starting after going over the fallen tree.
* Fortnite uses in-game captures at 2560x1440 using DX12, with Frame Rate Limit off and Vsync off. All settings Epic except for Medium Shadows. TSR is Medium with Native resolution, 100% 3D Resolution, Dynamic 3D Resolution off, Nanite Virtualized Geometry off, Global Illumination off, Reflections off, etc.
* Captures and stats are from CapFrameX with 60 second captures.
* Other software running in the background includes HWiNFO64, Chrome, Razer Synapse, Adrenaline, OpenRGB, and any necessary launchers such as Steam or Epic Games. 
* Power Plans is Balanced and set to Best Performance.
* Benchmarks are run in normal mode, not as Admin, special Admin, etc.
* System is a ASRock X670E Taichi, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, ASRock PG 7900XTX, 32GB Team Group 6000CL30 with EXPO  (30-36-36-76-112), 2TB WD SN850X, 420mm Arctic LFII AIO, etc.

More official testing is needed, but I'm impressed with what I've seen so far. I was not expecting to see such gains in the games, and at least on my system, single core performance is much better. It's not often a performance boost like this comes along with so little effort, and I can only wonder why this wasn't discovered and released sooner.


This is like the real life downloading more RAM
The Fortnite results. Holy shit. 👀
I'm very happy to see the 7800x3d performing so well on the 24h2 preview. I expected it to do well being an x3d chip but confirmation is always nice. This does make me more excited for the 9800x3d though. I know people are being doomers about it but I'm actually quite excited for it, especially with the windows update.
Holy fuck, those Fortnite results are amazing. That's practically two+ generations worth of CPU in just one update.
An 18.5% increase on the Cinebench single core?  
What?  
*What?*
How long does it take to get 24h2 once you sign up for windows insider?
and older CPUs like Ryzen 9 5900x?
Would love to see an updated windows 10 vs windows 11 comparison with 24H2.
There's no way you only get 97 points in single threaded Cinebench 2024 on 23H2, it's way below what the average should be which you should get at least 110ish. Double check your score because it doesn't make any sense why that score is so low.
Great! Very curious to see how the performance jump if any on devices such as my Rog Ally or Mini PC as any performance boost is a bonus!
Can someone do 5800x3d
Thats awesome. So when does this roll out for everyone? (24h2 that is)
Somebody test zen 3
Nice. But i ll better wait for official update, stable system is prio fir me
Some great gains you’ve had there, but your 23H2 single threaded benchmarks seem off. They should have always been closer to your 24H2 results, so I’m not sure what is going on there.
I think you need to do a clean run with 23H2 again.
your cpu is massively underperforming dude
It’s more performance than a new CPU generation. Why don’t developers make super tight good code and refine it for more and more for performance and stability rather than keep releasing buggy bloated software with more and more features.
Thank you for this!


I might just try that insider build after all.
Strange about those results.

BM:W did not change a thing in my case. 1440p, dlss/fg, no RT, cinematic.

7800x3d, rtx 4080.
These 1% low improvements have me doing the Vince McMahon chair gif
the moment i saw Zen4 X3D results are increased very well i'm like yoo bro nice one!!!!! 

anyway nice results OP
Thanks for this! Gonna upgrade my Win 11 tonight.
Great news!
Nice results. Too bad 24H2 is removing WMR which will essentially brick my perfectly working HP Reverb G2 so I’m stuck on 23H2 for the foreseeable future… ugh. Also have a 7800X3d/7900XTX setup.
Can you share the exact OS build number you are using?
Any news on this 24H2 update helping AM4 CPUs as well as AM5?
Buddy your x3d was literally just underperforming check the normal results for the cpu first. Your geekbench 6 result is still below the average on the site and I know with certainty the 7800x3d should be in the triple digits easily in cinebench 2024 ST
>Time Spy (CPU) 	12239 	12990

I gotta feeling that something else was wrong as the avg 7800x3d time spy cpu score is 13200. Sure ppl Curve optimize or ECLK OC and tune ram on a competitive benchmark more upping the avg, but still a 12239 is near the bottom. Or maybe win 11 just sucks and win 10 is what boosted the avg up, who knows at this point.

Also you have a taichi board, but haven't eclk oc:d the cpu? Or did you just run it stock for the test.
[removed]
Nice.

I recorded a 2 minute fight in pecado from a replay using nvidia statistics (5:00 to 7:00 aprox)
so we return all nerfed by vindows performance, great anyway
I wonder if we would see this kind of improvement on older gen(zen 3, 2)
Impressive
Can you please precise the build number?
Dammit, ive been staying with LTSC builds.
I have a 5950X and I am hoping this update will net me a decent performance boost. Not that I am not happy since everything performs really well, but I can always use the extra performance since I intend to keep it for at least another 4 years.
Your cinebench numbers are off. You should be seeing 120-125 for single core and 1115-1180 for multicore for the 7800X3D.
Can you test if this is better than using 10?
Is there a boost for 5800x3d performance?
9800x3d and youtube reviewers will go bananas suddenly
When will be global release? Im so unpatient
good luclk bro. for some reason when i downloaded the iso from ms. and installed windows. it was 24h2. really slow and crashy. had to get the stable rings iso of 23h2. just saying.
Why is the timespy result so low on both 23h2 and 24h2? It should be between 13500/14500 score.
Ok but… will these OS performance improvements be coming to Windows 10 by any chance?
Wow, those gains are impressive! It looks like 24H2 is giving your setup quite a boost, especially in gaming performance. The jump in Fortnite FPS is particularly noteworthy—28.2% is no small margin! It's cool to see how an OS update can lead to such significant improvements with minimal effort on your part. Your setup also seems top-notch, so it’s great to see it performing even better. I wonder if others with similar hardware are experiencing the same gains. Have you considered sharing your findings with the community for more feedback or comparisons?
It seems like Windows 10 is still GOAT.

Even with these fixes, Windows 10 is faster.

Take a look here, this guy tested on Windows 10:

I reinstall windows quite frequently to keep my games running as smoothly as possible. I also slim it down after install to optimize it for gaming. I went ahead and ran some benchmarks of my own on a pretty fresh install of current windows with minimal things running in background and then installed and optimized 24H2 to repeat the benchmarks and add to this thread. 

I'm running 7800x3d, 32GB 6000mhz ram, Nvidia 4090 FE, NVME SSD

Here are my before and after results.

I also have cinebench and 3dmark but I don't want to spend anymore time right now doing the "after" benchmarks. I'll stick them in later.
[deleted]
Why is anyone taking this seriously?  Hyping up the increase and taking these numbers as fact when OPs initial numbers are complete dogshit for that CPU, is insane...
Ran a Lightroom test with Pugetbench. 11.2% gain on a 5800x. Nice.
UPDATE: I had cloned my main drive and had 23H2 on one, 24H2 on another so that I could switch for testing. Based on suggestions for testing from folks here, I was updating 23H2 yesterday, DDUing, etc., trying to ensure both were as close as possible. When running various tests I was getting almost identical results on both, which was baffling given the earlier results. My first thought was that in fact my 23H2 had been "fixed" during the updates, and that the only gains on 24H2 had been due to it being a fresh install.

But after looking at other results, I was confused as to how 23H2 was outperforming almost everything from before, and I began to suspect something must be going on. I reverted back to the non-preview version of 23H2, and the results were more in-line with what I expected. I had a serious WTF moment, and it was at around that time the Reddit posts, YT videos, etc. announcing the backport to 23H2 began to break. On one hand I was a bit miffed at the effort spent trying to confirm the results, but on the other I was happy that it was being fast-tracked.

I'm now updating to 23H2 cumulative preview again, and will likely not bother with 24H2 again. Thanks to all for the suggestions on clean installs, etc. It's great that Microsoft & AMD are working to get this into the hands of more folks.
I’m seeing big improvements in VR on a 7800X3d (mainly iRacing and DCS).
I just briefly tested it in two locations in Cyberpunk at Dogtown. I have a 7600x that is heavily power limited (sff) with pbo -20 and tuned memory. I used performance FSR and the heaviest crowd density areas to push the cpu. 

Location 1: 120 to 138

Location 2: 118 to 127

Pretty accurate to the hardware unboxed results for this game. 👍

I also tried HD2. Less scientific and repeatable, but  the heavy action dips were about 10% higher.
This is INSANE. These are generational gains from an OS patch. I don't care that we're only getting them now, I'm just happy we're getting them. 

Yeah dad, I'm winning. Thanks for asking.
Installed it aswell, identical performance in Hunt Showdown and a bit boost in EA WRC.  
Didn't have to DDU or re-install AMD drivers, it kept the latest drivers and worked fine.  
OCCT CPU benchmark results quite the same, slight(about 2%) increase in multicore.  
EDIT: Improvement in EA WRC CPU heavy stage:  
[https://ibb.co/vZyX4RL](https://ibb.co/vZyX4RL)
why is nobody testing 24h2 against windows 10?
Edit: They made an update using the new Windows Update for 23H2 and now the 7800X3D doesn’t lose performance in the games below anymore (just a bit in the lows for some games)



OP: Sadly it's not universal. While HWUnboxed saw no change in performance at worst for the 7700X, here are some tests that see the 7800X3D actually losing 10-15% average FPS and 50+% 1% lows in some games.

[https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/prozessoren/64313-optimierte-sprungvorhersage-zen-5-mit-windows-11-24h2-getestet.html](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/artikel/hardware/prozessoren/64313-optimierte-sprungvorhersage-zen-5-mit-windows-11-24h2-getestet.html)

Examples (avg/1%):

Control: 23H2(226/133), 24H2(208/50) -> -8%/-63%

F1 2024: 23H2(436/279), 24H2(376/275) -> -14%/-2%

Ratchet & Clank: 23H2(178/120), 24H2(177/103) -> 0%/-14%

Baldurs Gate 3: 23H2(376/263), 24H2(344/236) -> -9%/-10%
Does this performance improvement through Windows modifications, due to the AMD/AM5 Zen4 performance issue, also benefit Intel processors?
This is more than a generational uplift from upgrading to a new cpu. This is kinda nuts.
when does this update come and how do we get it
Those Fortnite 1% low uplifts are absolutely absurd.
These are some nice performance gains. Would like to see these replicated
Has anyone tried this with zen 3? Im curious to see the uplift there
Has anyone tested Zen3 since they said it's gonna get a boost preformance on 24H2?
Dude that´s insane!!!
Would be similar for 5800x3d?
Insane, windows 11 has been out for ages how has it taken this long to identify and fix?
Somebody now if this apply to 5800x3d as well?
What about 5800X3D?
I would like to see how the dual ccds like the 7900x3d and the 7950x3d are affected by this update.
Thanks for testing. It's amazing how much single core performance is increased. It's like an entirely new CPU generation.
How much gain with Highest setting and RT on at 1440p? Will it be in the single digit?
Does this update give NVIDIA game customisation support?
Damn wtf, how hard and safe is it to get the update early?
So wait a fucking moment.   
Will this affect mobile CPU's? Like 7840hs?
AMD Fine Wine™
Hey can you test less coi intensive games like cyberpunk so that we can figure out if there is an improvement (looking at black wukong it’s an amazing improvement for a xtx- a card that should cause gpu limits to kick in at that res and settings before cpu is the factor)

We need to investigate how much the performance of the xtx is increasing with this new update alongside the 7800x3d improving
Does anyone know, if you install 24H2 from the preview ISO, are you on a normal updates channel or does it stay on the insider channel? I'm looking to do a fresh install with this but don't want to be on insider permanently or deal with potential problems switching update channels causing breakage.
So windows 11 24H2 is best if you want every bit of performance out of your CPU for gaming? I wonder if per chance this applies to perhaps your GPU or RAM as well
Please share your full OS version. It is 26100.XXX.
Are you thermally constrained by any chance? Both your Geekbench 6 scores are lower than [average](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d). Even in my Fractal Terra I'm getting higher scores than you.
Your old scores seems low on Cinebench 2024. Most people had Single 105 and Multi 1100 in 23H2.
My 7800x3D makes my computer restart randomly at low loads. Been trying to figure it out for 8 months now. Full rebuild, only the cpu is the same. faulty CPU or another problem? No BSOD, just lags, then freezes, then restarts. Happens couple times a day, never while gaming.
Can people compare this to current Windows 10?
Thank you for doing this, very hopeful for good increases with my 5800X3D as well 🤞
I dont want to believe people used rigged systems that forces to buy intel/nvidia until today
Please compare W10 results
Hmm, i updated via ISO AND my performance is really bad atm. 

 Im on the AMD drivers  and virtualization is off too. Afew things i noticed - i dont see memory integrity in Settings.

Also shoud hyper-v be disabled?
The strongest gaming performer just got stronger
How do you do benchmark
Does anyone have data/comparison with windows 10?
Hmm I wonder how this fades for CS2...
Jesus H. Christ. +28% fps in Fortnite? What a time to be alive.
Has anyone run tests with Zen 3 CPUs?
So what your saying is. Windows 11 I should upgrade? I got a 7800X3D 🤔
https://youtu.be/rlfTHCzBnnQ?si=wWQ89phTof6NBB-k  Same was seen by HUB
Will the 5800x3d be affected by this?
Yo, can you test dawntrail benchmark and report back (on the lowest settings/resolution)
I'd love to see what fight SIM 2020 can give using the new windows update.
How to install this update?
Would this apply to Win 10 as well or is this "bug" exclusive to people who have Win 11?
How is the increase with a 3600?
I despise windows AND windows 11 but for once I'll have to eat my words
Woah that's a considerable jump! There definitely was some performance left on the table.
So don't buy amd if you plan to stay on w10?
Are people using Windows 10 have results similar to 24H2 or 23H2? Should i upgrade to Win 11 24H2 from Win 10
That's a very similar system to mine,.. X670, 7800X3D, 7900XTX, I don't think I've ever been excited for a windows update before.. I just hope in finding these performance gains they've improved the overall system stability.
The update is now available for 23H2. I tested the changes in framerates with my RTX4090 undervolted and 7800x3d:

**BM:W** benchmark 4k DLSS ultra perf mix cinematic/high  
With PT: no improvement (minimal fps 75, avg 95, max 110)  
Without Raytracing: no improvement (minimal fps 95, avg 132, max 156)

**Cyberpunk** benchmark 4k DLSS Ultra perf, max settings  
With PT: no improvement (minimal 93 fps, avg 101, max 110)  
Without PT: 6.5% improvement in avg (new is min 147.33, avg 187.60, max 221.69)

**Calisto protocol** benchmark 4k TSR 50% max settings  
With RT: 7% improvement in avg (new is 119 avg)  
Without RT: 13% improvement in avg (new is 190 avg)

Hardware unboxed has seen a difference of 10% average on 1080p for the 7700x. It highly depends on the game, however, i think this can also be seen on the 7800x3d.
Not seeing any single core Cinebench R23 improvements on AMD ZEN4 7 7700.
How can I get my hands on this? Also with your testing do you have game mode on or off? And HAGS on or off? Thanks
So what is this?

Core scheduling. Hypervisor overhead reduction, what?
Didn’t they update 23h2 today to have the new fixes too
When will Linux improve to a point where I can switch? It seems that Microsoft is trying it's best to change as little as possible every year in order to work on projects that try to either milk the customers or mine our data one way or another. If they spent 1/100 the amount they used in running Xbox, we wouldn't have to deal with scheduler issues and half baked updates that may or may not brick your machine.
And they beat Intel with this disadvantage, kudos to the engineer ls at AMD! ... not the driver team tho ... I'm kidding 🤣
Two questions. Have a 5700x so will I see an increase? Also, is this a sign to switch from windows 10 to 11?
Can you test out rocket league and apex legends for me?


RL - DX11
Apex legends has DX11 & DX12
I wonder if it will make much difference to my 5700x.
Making me wanna upgrade to W11 lol. But I don't have my backups in order, I wonder if I can get away with just doing the upgrade instead of a clean install. My rig is only a year old, and from what I've heard the upgrade process is much much better at not leaving older OS junk files that could impact performance around, not to mention it would make a big difference in redoing any settings, as most will carry over. What are your guys's thoughts on this?
bro just downloaded more fps
7950x3d gains? :DD
7800x3d here, I got 2% improvement to 3017 in Cinebench R15

Didn't test Geekbench 6 prior to the update, but post update I got 2777 single and 15747 multi. Anecdotally, the multi score is about 4% higher than Geekbench's public numbers for 7800x3d.
This is so insanely cool. Too bad it wont do anything for my 13900k 😥
I got Single core 2790 and Multicore 15795 with 24H2 with 7950X. Noice!
Sorry but if your system wasn‘t clean enough and poluted by other apps and tasks, then the numbers aren’t meaningful. Even if you had them running before an after the test.
How do you download 24h2?
I do not understand the Cinebench results: I benched it before and after the release of latest Win23H2 which should fix this issue before the release of 24H2 and I got +0% in both single and multicore...
113.6 fps on Wukong. I wonder how many people that actually own x3ds, play with such low graphics settings that they are playing at max CPU providing potential. Anyone running Wukong at 120fps and having a good time with the visuals?


Fortnite is more believable with the 1080p, high refresh monitors. How many still stick to 1080p displays to utilize their 7800x3d and actually benefit from it? Seemed like the 4k 240hz monitors were quite popular this year.
I saw 0 difference in Wukong and Cyberpunk
I tried everything but I just keep getting green screen on 24h2 with my 7800x3d and 4070ti super. Reinstalled windows 11 23h2 and running perfectly smooth again, pretty lame.
Can anyone test the difference in rocket league and apex legends both dx11 and dx12 for apex.
So I did a BIOS update, and installed a clean install of 24H2.  Updated chipset drivers etc.  

Coming from 22H2, my Timespy results are about 15% lower in 24H2 than they were previously.

Here are the results when I first built my system on AM5.  This is 22H2.
https://www.3dmark.com/spy/36502917

One year later.  Several driver(graphics and chipset) updates along with UEFI updates.
https://www.3dmark.com/spy/46670776

Then, another round of UEFI and driver updates, along with the upgrade to 24H2
https://www.3dmark.com/spy/51141282

Probably time to go back to 22H2.
Would love to see how this compares to well optimised Linux distro
honestly i dont get it.

why should Black myth wukong, a GPU heavy game should have \~18% more performance because of a CPU boost? especially on 1440p with highest settings.
Still slower than my 14900k and DDR5 8200 CL36 tweaked sub timings.
Dayum, what a HUGE performance! When the 24H2 drops are we going to have to download a new AGESA chipset?
We all install the 24h2 update guys lets go tabarnack!!
Anyone know if 7900X3D are benefitting from 24H2?
I've been on insider preview for over a week and haven't been offered 24H2.

Just refreshed and it's offering me 23H2 build that released a few hours ago today.
So should we upgrade from Windows 10?
Would Windows 10 also have this issue?
Sooo Google gets really confused with what I'm asking when I try to figure this out... but is Windows 10 performance *worse* than this new Windows 11 version then? Or has windows 10 performance always been just fine, and/or behind what 7000 series and later AMD CPUs can do on Windows 11?
Does anyone here know/has seens something about how it compares to Windows 10?

Is this a bug that has been fixed in Windows 11 or is it a straight performance uplift across the board even compared to Windows 10?
HOLY SHIEET.   
I'm glad my 7800x3d is waiting to be picked up already. (the damn Noctua AM4/5 kit will take the longest, so cant assemble a build until Sept. 3rd or so).

Feels like I did the right fucking choice going for 7800x3d. Wonder if **Star Citizen** gets an improvement?

Why are there people reporting no difference with hardware the same as yours? Does it have to be a specific build of Windows?

U just made up numbers lol this is so silly. Anyone with a 7800x3d can test this themselves and see it is completely false

Windows 11 24H2 was released a couple months ago.

Question is your 23h2 fresh install or 10 years old installation with tons of junk installed over the years? Cause your 23h2 results are super low
TechTubers vs Enthusiasts..


Huge gains vs no gains.


I wonder what's going on.
It still hasn't shown on my windows update yet, RIP
Any other 5800x3d(x570) users getting BSODs with 24h2? The OS boots and then completely freezes up with giving me a "critical process died".

Was able to rollback thankfully.
There’s Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 released to oems on 22 may 24 which is not beta. It has updates and I can confirm you need tweak to clear ram on restart. Getting 3% cinebench r23. If you really really want something this is not beta.
Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 Upgraded from win10 home then chipset drivers for 5700x3d and x570. No bsos or whatever since is not beta.R23 +3% which is something but not 18% like op. Curious, person responsible on amd blog said no cinebench scores. Also curious, its really nead clear ram on restart tweak.
Windows is trash if just a patch can unlock this amount of performance 
Something was definitely wrong with your OS setup on 23H2. From my tests most games get only \~5% profit over update. We can compare our results, if you tell what game to test (preferably with in-game benchmark).
Any chance benchmarking on a win 10 system?  Some of us stubborn people are still on 10 and not planning on upgrading any time soon just to see a performance diff
On one hand, it's really amazing... On the other, AMD really needs to beef up their QA/testing, it's crazy that so much performance loss went unnoticed by them for 2 years.
You actually can download a ksm module to do memory deduplication to have more ram
Nobody else has been able to prove HUB's numbers though.
Wait till OP finds out how much faster Windows 10 was all this time, haha.
That’s the main game I play, so I was surprised at the results. I normally see -190 FPS on the in-game display, and on the overlay. I did several captures at various points to better compare with other captures.

FWIW, the 99% and max FPS values are also much higher now. The CPU still averages less than 50% utilization while the GPU averages 99-100%, so something has clearly been uncorked.
Agreed. I'm on a 4090/7800X3D and was only going to wait for the 9xxx 3D parts. If those somehow don't own out then we have at least another cycle we will be treated to on AM5. 

The newer parts that just came out were never going to be for me as I want the best gaming perf.
Given that 9800x3d offers same amount of cache as 7800x3d, and looking at differences between 9700x vs 7700x, there's no reason to believe it'll be noticeably better outside of potentially higher clocks - 9800x3d will be "overclockable", while 7800x3d is not.

  
What "overclockable" means in this case, remains to be seen. But I woudnt bet on high gains, definitely not worth waiting half a year for it, imho.
Well, at the very least we'll see a 2 to 5% overall gaming improvement, the same as the non-X3D parts.


Would be nice if there were more, but I'm not that optimistic with the internal latency being higher on Zen 5 for some reason.


Time will tell!
it's almost like winblows had some kind of bug they fixed now. Also wonder how much of said bug was intel funded.
Wtf happened in this comment thread xD  
Such a purge with -200 downvotes on top of it is rare to see.
Just wait for other sources to confirm HUB's numbers. 2 other reliable people have within 1% (margin of error) between all the Windows versions, Admin accounts etc.
[removed]
i guess branch predictor improvements let cores do extra instructions per clock which speeds up render times with same cache hit ratio % as before

and of course a obligatory demand to microsoft regarding task scheduler because it being worked on and it being fixed would help both intel and AMD performance wise
Yea I think this is more like clean install gains rather than Windows version gains sadly.
I was able to start the install immediately after signing up. It downloaded, started installation, the rebooted to finish the installation. The only thing I had to do manually was DDU and reinstall Adrenaline, as Windows installed their stock drivers.
enabled insider preview, for some reason got 23h2 and not 24h2
I suggest not to do it because after that you can't go back to stable, you will also get nags about installing other previews (many in a year)
you don't even need to get 24H2 it's been released on 23H2 as well.
Just install 24h2 via an ISO Image from the site deskmodder.
It supposedly applies to zen 3 CPUs as well but no one has tested yet as far as I can tell.
I got a %20 fps boost on valorant with a zen 2 Apu.
OP does have a bunch of background apps running it seems which might explain the performance penalty. but yeah, some of those scores are quite low. My 7800X3D on 23H2 scored comfortably over 13000 on Time Spy and easily pushed 14000 with tighter RAM timings.
I’m not running this in a clean or benchmark optimized environment, but this applies to both OS versions. I can get higher scores by booting into safe mode, killing apps and services, etc. But this is apples-to-apples.
Do those devices run windows or steam OS?
Yeah I'm also wondering if upgrading to win 11 is worth it now
Was planning to do the test on 23H2 while installing the KB5041587 but my cat ruined it by turning off my PC during the 'before' benchmark.

I only ran one benchmark and it was Super Position on 1080p High. I had a 1% performance gain. Looks similar to iinlane's.
3% on r23 multi with 5700x3 Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024. Clear cache on restart tweak needed. A lot of power saving s*.
september/oct
It is in release preview so basically the same build will drop in September/October
I hear you. I cloned my drive just in case of catastrophe, so I could switch back if necessary.
They installed the batch patch in the latest windows update that’s out now u don’t need to waut
This, I've been using 24H2 since day 1 it came out, don't think it actually does any improvement since I always turns off useless security craps whenever I update.
Because we keep releasing better and better hardware that is good at making up for inefficient code. Same reason most new AAA games use some sort of upsampling/generative rendering just to run acceptably.

Back when carmack was making doom he had to be a coding god because the hardware sucked ass and you had to do literal wizardry to make things run well.
ask microsoft
What is BM:W?
1440P is a lot less CPU bound, and that can vary game to game (and what settings are used).


FWIW, that's why reviewers will complete CPU testing at 1080P and/or 720P to see the difference.
1440p with a 4080 in a very GPU bound game. OP has a 7900XTX which is behind the 4080 in the game, he had performance to gain.
what's wmr?
I'm in the same boat. Hoping it gets a community solution
would like that aswell  please
24H2 build number is 26100
i did quick test on ff14 benchmark and gain 9.56% at 720p.  I did not do any more tests but it is clear that something has improved.

Upgrading to W11 shaves about 500pts off my Timespy CPU score, down from [15000](https://www.3dmark.com/spy/47984397) to around [14500](https://www.3dmark.com/3dm/116515945).

Pure anecdote and maybe I need to do a clean W11 install or something but I keep my OS pretty tidy.

If my results echo OPs then adding ~600 pts would put me back where I was on W10.
I ran these benchmarks on both versions of the OS with the same apps, utilities, etc. I can kill Razer Synapse, kill most of Adrenaline, and so on, and the scores go up. I don't know for sure which is the worst offender, but I suspect the Adrenaline replay capture feature may be it.
the fact that you dont remember that it took 2 days for ms to fix the e-cores isa yet (what we thought back then) the scheduler for zen since 2 was broken should tell you a lot
Nobody has been able to replicate HUB's numbers. I would wait for more sources.
What is your hardware conf?
how r u getting that many frames in pubg jesus
Means nothing without testing methodology.
LTSC 24H2 is rolling out together with normal 24H2 :)
suckaaaaaaaa
Same CPU and I noticed a much snappier experience overall, the difference felt like you installed a brand new CPU.. weird. I noticed chrome becoming faster (the render part, a website renders much faster), opening things from start menu ...
Thanks. I can get higher numbers when I run the standalone version with nothing else running, but the goal here was to compare similar systems.
sep/oct
Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 is Release to manuf. not beta. Still needs clear cache ram on restart tweak. 3% r23 multi.
same system. same everything. 24h2. cd23 was around 30k with power plan. no parked cores. and expo 2. xbar and game mode off. 23h2 its 36.5.
op said its not on clean test.
No. Win 10 is EOL
So it got worse? I have same build.
I switched to PTM7950 and it dropped my temps quite a bit. I also set the max speed, max VRAM speed, max GPU voltage, and max GPU power in Adrenaline, which also helps. My max temps are:

* GPU - 56C
* Memory Junction - 79C
* Hot Spot - 67C

Every GPU is different, but you can get some ideas for settings by using the Undervolt, Overclock GPU, and Overclock VRAM settings in Adrenaline. Set each, noting what the values are, then use those as a baseline for custom settings. I also set a fairly conservative fan curve, as my case has good airflow.
I think you need to do a fresh and clean install. It is known that the chipset driver and the new algorithm works best if its a fresh windows install.
Yep, I'd love to see this
In this case we should test 24H2 against Windows 7
Someone actully did higher up in the thread. 24h2 almost as fast as windows 10.
Because Windows 10 is essentially EoL.
I had to translate, but the translation leads me to believe that they did the upgrade and not a fresh install. It would be good to know if they did a true fresh install or not.
I think Gears 5 is the only game so far that gives benefits with Intel. IIRC it was like 30% better FPS.
You can get it now on the Windows Insider program
get it now through windows insider or wait for rollout in sep/oct
i did quick test on ff14 benchmark and gain 9.56% at 720p. I did not do any more tests but it is clear that something has improved.

[https://imgur.com/a/Aaa5Njw](https://imgur.com/a/Aaa5Njw)
it should, i tried but playing on 4k made no difference for me (i'm not cpu bound)
Win 11 enterprise iot is rtm. Backup. Download iso, mount. Setup exe, restarts and done. Better wait 2 months
totally stock? no undervolt / curve optimizer on bios?
I had a similar problem that I managed to solve by updating the bios
This sounds like a curve optimizer issue or undervolt issue. if you have undervolted or used curve optimizer you need to back off a bit.
I don't play CS2 much, but will see if I can get some quick stats.
3% on 5700x3d r23. Amd said no cinebench gains. Enterprise iot rtm upgrade from w10.
yes, on w11 at least
You should get the KB5041587 update, which is now available for 23H2. They pushed the changes into the current release, so you don't need to move to 24H2, which may be unstable.
Apparently I (and others) got caught out by other changes that impacted performance, for example virtualization being off by default in 24H2.
yea, this is what I'm thinking, does it close the gap or is there still something significant
Yeah I'm running some benchmark of my own to compare and I set wukong to 1080p RT off and cinematic preset and got an avg 80 fps on a 4090 lol
Because OP might be lying. Wait for more trusted sources.
it was on optional updates for me
It looks like.
No. Unless you wanna trade CPU performance for the features it has.
you will have to do a fresh install most likely for it to work properly
Yes and it won't get a fix
Windows 10 has the same issue and won't get an update unfortunately
Yep best choice at the moment 
Because 1usmus is a liar. Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 is Release to manuf. not beta. Still needs clear cache ram on restart tweak. 3% r23 multi.
Did they do a full fresh install of windows 11 24h2 or an upgrade. The upgrade doesn't seem to work. There is a video i watched that explained it. Unfortunately i can't remember which video discussed it.
You should have tried with some of the most affected games.
Yeah this is not a highly controlled test environment. Literally too good to be true.
What are you on about? Who said no gains?
I'm on a 5800x3d (B550) and the Win11 24h2 update preview build is working fine for me?
If I understand it correctly, it was the fault of Microsoft with the Windows Version.
They already were beating intel
Do you mean besides OP?
As much as I hate to admit it you will likely see a performance regression over 24H2
Windows 10 isn’t faster than Windows 11.
It wasn't by that much and it was just few etra bloat that you could remove.
How is your performance like on a processor heavy game like the finals or CS?
If you get one core fully (90% or higher) utilized, while the rest of the cores loaf by comparison with other duties, and your GPU is not 100% used but more like 50~80% used, there is usually one thing.
DirectX 11 or older, with single-threaded draw calls causing a bottleneck.
Too much diversity in the scene, too many different models, too many unsewn model UV's (textured surfaces not joined) from hastily made models (usually bought in a pack), or way too many state-changes in the render engine, engine may not support batching on LOD's or there are too many different LOD's on too many different objects (different LOD - level of detail - levels won't usually batch-render, which means they won't all render at pretty much the cost of 1 surface(s) vs having to render them all each on different draw calls).
There's a lot of games that did this.  First thing to look for is DX11 or older rendering engine.  While there is a multi-threaded mode for DX11 it's seldom ever used and it's not very easy to work with nor very good.  Older Nvidia drivers actually used to use some secret sauce diverting some draw calls to a second core at the driver level, but this was removed around 2~3 years ago or so in favor of DX12/Vulkan rendering performance improvements.
Cities Skylines 1 and 2, FALLOUT 4 (especially with scrap mods disabled pre-combines, this spikes draw calls like nuts, causing performance issues down-town, near heavily-modded built-up settlements, and at the Corvega factory mostly on the roof), early versions of MS Flight Sim... etc.  There's others, but if you see DirectX11 on a recent game - or often the Unity engine itself - expect SLOW.  Use DX12 or Vulkan to avoid this issue or lessen it to a point as well as the engine is coded on the render back-end.
If you're dead-set on running a DX11 or older single-threaded render-engine type game, the best thing you can do is jack up performance on a single core as high as it can go - ghz is your friend but AMD ghz speed is not the same as the Intel ghz speed, and ghz speed is not equal between differing processor generations in most cases (barring renames/refreshes which don't really improve things).
Render-engine wrappers (think glide wrappers in the 90's or early 00's) don't help things.
You don't track lows at all do you? I play ff14 and while performance was always fine I'd hit really bad spikes with it where I'd drop fps bad. Same in fortnite. I just upgraded to a 7800x3d though so it's a whole beast entirely but I'm also interested in not just raw performance but also impacts on lows.
Finally someone with sense.   So many complaining about a part that they were never going to get is astonishing.
there should be zero reason to upgrade a zen 4 to zen 5 there is 0 performance increase.
AMD was talking about some other tricks they were going to try with the 9000 series x3d.
Wasn't there a thing about them using 2nd gen 3D cache that has a large increase in bandwidth?  If so that could provide a nice uplift, particularly if Zen 5 is as bandwidth starved as people claim.
There are indications (like bizarrely bad inner CCX and inter CCD latency, abnormally large performance discrepancies between Windows/Linux, and a substantial increase in cache misses) that AMD's branch prediction optimizations are absolutely hammering L3, which may mean that too much time sensitive data is spilling into DRAM resulting in Zen5 having an exaggerated IF/IMC bottleneck.

So there are at least a few reasons to remain optimistic about 9000X3D, as Zen5 appears to be leaning on it's cache pool even harder than prior Zen iterations already were. 

If this isn't just microcode shenanigans that can be further patched, there is potential that Zen5 will have an even larger uplift from v-cache than even Zen3 did.
Im just excited because I have a small case which limits cooling. Getting 10% bump at way less heat generation is an awesome deal to me whenever the x3ds launch
hard to say what the X3D will do with the new architecture. where the 9000 chips themself saw little improvement, the extra cache might make it fly. the overclocking headroom that the 9800X3D is supposed to have might also push it further along. because they lose so much clock speed, i'd have to imagine extra frequency would help it too. suppose we'll have to see, though. memory overclocking doesn't do as much for the X3D. doesn't mean that 6400 at lower CL won't help uplift either

im just excited to get a 9800X3D assuming its worth the time because i have a 13900K and i want to drop intel ASAP
They're fixing the latency issue between the two CCD chips on dual-CCD 9000 series chips (9900x/9950x), there's a bug that's getting fixed - may have a fix already out but I think it's still in QC/QA.
Give it a few days to a week at most, the latency is not intentional.
You forgot to mention that there are games where Zen 5 runs slower, so the X3D part would inherit that too. So it's not a simple 2-5% gain, it's a -10% to +15% change or something like that, really NOT compelling, especially since that's without improving efficiency.

there are no improvements, his cpu was simply underperforming by a lot before he updated (and even after the update some of the results are rather mediocre, like geekbench 6)
I don't think it's just that. I installed a week ago windows 11 23h2 and bazzite from 0 and today I installed the preview of 24h2. I gained 10% on a 5900x over installing 23h2. A 1 week installation with practically the minimum to work.  To clarify that I only did a test out of curiosity and that it is Zen 3 but 10% is out of the margin of error.
Or Windows 11 finally catching up to Windows 10 on performance.
This is tempting my local account using ass to consider using my MS account.

MUST. RESIST. UNTIL. OCTOBER.
Hmm. Must just be luck of the draw.
Lmao I heard the news earlier today of the new performance boost in a windows update and my mind immediately went to fucked up gpu drivers
Any idea if Adrenaline is required or just updated drivers?  I just updated my AMD drivers and then signed up for the preview release.  My update now says “24H2 is preparing for your system, nothing you can do now.”  Been like that for the last 24 hours.
Same
I didnt realize you cant go back to stable. I thought it was as simple as upgrading the stable release when it comes out. Am I wrong about that
It's not recommended to install an OS from a random 3rd party... Especially since you can freely download directly from Microsoft:  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso

Note: May need to sign in first and/or join Insider Program.
Not much of a test as it's a single data point - didn't bother to benchmark a whole bunch before/after. 5900x, game's shapez2. Same scene, before and after: 72fps to 86fps.
[deleted]
idk what my ram timings are but my 7800x3d scores 13544 on 24h2
They run Windows 11
I'm going to order a 5700x3D tonight, if someone can post some results.
Yes, but if you install the release preview you can't go back in case of problem, or at least it happened to me 2 years ago.
yes but you cant get out of insider after.
What sucks is that you can’t unroll, once u go dev mode ur stuck, even if its out via the public channel, ur stuck in preview builds
Did you run into any issues when you updated to 24H2?

Tempted, and was going to image my boot drive prior to doing so. Even with that in mind, I'm still apprehensive.
my windows fkd after 22h2 to 23h2 update,  0x80004005 error, can't rename any folder, as always windows fked with ownership in windows. So be prepared for a clean os with 24h2. microsoft is a poor company without good programmers so this is fine to have this issue error  almost 20 years exist
I too decided to install the 26100 Release Preview build too and tested a few fully CPU bound scenarios in four games so far (The Witcher 3 (RT), Dragon’s Dogma 2 (RT), Dungeons 4 and AC: Odyssey) on my 7950X. 

I have yet to see any improvements either, and I never used the admin mode on previous Windows versions. I have always kept VBS off however.
as a software developer i can say about 100% of whole software market today. They don't care about quality or optimization because it's more work/money. Software developers 20 -30 y ago did software better because they can't fix it later( games for example). but now you literally can buy 40% ( it's like post alpha product, even not beta) finished product for full price which they abandon or fix later. people will buy even not designed games in few years i think, stop spending on unfinished products now and they will have no choice to finish software before production
black myth wukong
Yes, but OP said he had a big change with the same in-game settings as me.
That.... is the exact opposite?
Shouldn't the 7900XTX being behind make it more GPU-bound
Windows Mixed Reality, which is required for certain VR headsets.
That means nothing the exact build number has an additional decimal.  Some versions of 26100 are over 4 months old.
Yes sounds like they fixesd Windows :)
I saw a video (wish i could remember which one) explain that it has to be a fresh install. Apparently something is chosen during the install and isn't corrected during an upgrade. I also lost cpu performance just doing the upgrade.
Windows is pretty much the last place any new joinee wants to work at microsoft. No one wants to join that dumpster fire
mine was just win 11 home. somehow from my past. and using beta build and even dev when they were stable. maybe it gave me the iso for the insiders ring i was in.
how exactly do you do a clear cache ram? meaning reset the bios. or is this some tool/setting in windows?
Well i have also stuff runing for my headset/keyboard/mouse and other stuff and still get 13600, thats why i ask why so low, i dont say he just put random numbers i just ask to OP why so low timespy. As in me with stuff running on 23h2 got a higher score than OP in 24h2. So maybe he scewed up some bios settings for his cpu
I know that but Microsoft is still pushing out security updates and I hate W11 with a fiery passion
My TimeSpy CPU score improved from 13100 to 13700, quite the same boost as OP had... so i think it's working fine.
[removed]
Windows 10 end of service is end of 2025
They made an update today using the new windows update for 23H2(the link is the same) and now the 7800X3D looks much better, even gaining performance in games he lost before. So whatever happened there, now it seems to be correct
They used a new windows installation with the 24H2 version
That's something at least since my 5700x3d is being delivered
Ok i will give it a go at home on 1440p. Is this preview driver or?
Stock. Everything is default. No XPO, no over clocks.
I have updated the BIOS a few months back and still had the issue. I see there is another new one so I'll add that one as well. Thanks.
I have not done anything like that to it. I try not to mess with bios stuff, only RAM timings, which are not even maximum. I have 6000hz ram running at 4800 due to this issue. All my voltage is default. I built this PC with these specs so I wouldnt have to overclock anything. When its running its fantastic, its just when Im doing low loads like Remoting into work or just on the internet or even it sitting idle overnight it happens..

I am not familiar with curve optimizer. Cant you explain that one a little more? Ive been fighting this for so long that I'll test anything.

Here is a link from a previous post so I dont have to copy it all here. Ive done so much to investigate and change. Ive basically swapped out an entire system minus the CPU. So im leaning to a compatibility issue somewhere, something Im missing.

I appreciate you even commenting. Thank you.
I am seeing very little gain on r24 with a 5900X system, 1.5% on single-core and 1.3% on multi-core, so margin-of-error.
Can’t see that update unfortunately, it may be because I am already in the windows insider program but the beta channel not the release preview one. I’ve tried switching channels to release preview but it seems to default back to beta constantly and doesn’t give me the update.
But the mistery is: how did I (and others, I read recently) get high performance even before updating with the kb5041587?
You can search for 7800X3D on Geekbench for one comparison point. It looks like there are systems running Windows that get close to Linux, but the average looks lower. The top Windows scores for single core are over 2900, but on Linux they are over 3000. On multicore the top Windows scores are over 16000, while on Linux they are over 17000.

I'd guess it's unlikely Windows would ever be better, but it's good that it can get a bit closer.
Linux is even better.. The best part is that this Linux distro  was optimised by iNTEL

Linux do not have this issues but not all games working.

I'm almost tempted to test this Windows 11 build on a new SSD, Even though I don't play Fortnite, a 28% boost is hard to ignore lol
1usmus is one of the most reliable insiders/leakers out there. Even GamersNexus quotes him.
People testing it for themselves? HUB's numbers lately are way off, especially his 9950X review.


https://github.com/fr33thytweaks/W10-W11-Admin-Benchmarks
Fair enough, then it's a personal issue. Time to do a fresh windows install :P
Probably yes, but it's AMD that has a big stake in this, so it's still on AMD to make sure everything is working. Microsoft screwing things up should be a given and planned for.
Yes 11 24H2 is likely now faster than Windows 10....and how many years has that taken?
you most likely won’t :)
It never was, you just had to disable some of the background apps and telemetry (gamers should look into AtlasOS)
It was untill 24h2
cinebench and Geekbench single core went up 12 and 18% respectively, so I imagine these will run pretty well too
CS2 absolutely no difference 23H2 -> 24H2, but a \~3-4% boost using Administrator account. 1920x1440 High Settings with Low Particles.

[https://imgur.com/a/rt7OjXu](https://imgur.com/a/rt7OjXu)
I believe that's the 1% FPS line.
If you have an AMD GPU disable ulps in regedit to stop it being jittery
He’s talking about 9000x3D, which should have some bump over 7000x3D
At this point, I also wouldn’t rely that much on what AMD said before the release
Well put together reasoning....
Makes sense that there is a bottleneck.  Stock 9700x runs 4.5 GHz all core and has same gaming performance as PBO with 5.3 GHz all core.  Games should love those extra frequencies but no benefit therefore bottleneck.
So you're saying there's massive L3 cache bottleneck going in non-x3d Zen5's right now? Where are you getting above information from?
I thought since Zen 4 the CCX size went from 4 to 8 cores there's now a single one on 6 & 8-core 7000 & 9000 CPUs, therefore no latency penalty for those.
Its possible, but I wouldnt hold my breath on that.  Gains in non memory intensive workloads are still rather mild from Zen 4 to Zen 5.  I wouldnt expect more than 5-10% increase over 7800X3D unless clocks are also significantly higher.
There's been many times here as I develop Los Injurus City for BeamNG Drive (driving/crashing simulator), where it got despicably HOT in here with my 3950x.  Wish I had a 7800x3D/7900x3D or 7950x3D / or even 9950x/9900x in it's place, but those cost money and this 5 years old AM4 system does just fine (aside of the heat now and then, but there's a 3090 in here too, and it also throws a TON of heat if you make it do RTx).
To keep the same 16 cores and 64gb RAM I'd have to spend at-least 1000$ and not about to do that.
So lowering TDP will mean higher clocks within said TDP restrains of a smaller case thus better performance, and in my case a toasty environment sometimes; so both instances benefit, and we're far from alone.
AMD is more guilty of throwing an X on the end when there should NOT have been one, but the BIOS update with the TDP increase to 105w for the lesser parts will help things to the tune of 10~12%.
AMD is making this 105w option mode available to system integraters and motherboard vendors should they want to feature it, MSI for one has already released this option for their BIOS through a BIOS update on their website.
Last I heard the new X3D's aren't coming until next year now.
The extra cache might make a big difference and if it overclocks well, it could be even better. Faster memory might help a bit too.
if your current Intel chip is running fine it should be fine tbh

it doesn't matter because nothing besides OS changes so even if OP's setup underperformed there is still consistency in benchmarks

ill test this preview build in couple of weeks on my 5800X3D which sees 15.2k in CB R20 to see how zen 3 looks post branch predictor fixes
That's fine, I'm only commenting on the OP's numbers :) 

I am not refuting the existence of 24h2 gains in general.
Did you benchmark any games ,any gains there?
The difference between windows 10 and 11 it's a few fps in favour to windos 10, the improvement in this preview version 24h2 it's amazing.
Edit: The Branch Predictions patch is now available on 23h2 KB5041587.

You can use "OfflineInsiderEnroll" for local account tho
You can also just download the ISO manually and upgrade (no need to clean install Windows if you don't want to).
I've used both the drivers installed by Windows and two versions of Adrenaline. The one that Windows installs is 24.10, but not sure if it's the most recent. I don't think is should be stuck like that. Have you tried rebooting, etc.?
Install it upgrading via iso
Deskmodder is a trusted site and has been for years. Its also a news magazine and the people behind this site are registered individuals in germany/austria.
thats a good improvement . many other are suggesting the improvemnt on zen 3 is mostly nil. quite confusing.
14300pts here. 23h2 with Update, but no gains.
Then fuck yeah!
You can once the channel above you reaches the same level, for example I moved from dev to release preview last month when release preview got 261xxx build
You can unenroll I went from dev 261xxto release preview 261xx when both the builds match each other. You just gotta wait for the insider builds to match the slower update rings to unenroll
Most software doesn't merit being carefully crafted. At the onset of a product, no one knows if it's going to be a success or a total flop, so you need to quickly iterate and provide features and functionality so you can test the idea. 

By the time you have found out your product is a success, you're then way too far into the process that you're unable to make the products more performant.

Take Jira for example. It's a steaming pile of garbage and spaghetti that is disgustingly slow, but almost every company uses it. Very few customers will be drawn in by it being more performant. By the time they knew they had something successful they'd already built a monstrosity.
I wonder if Star Citizen is out yet
I really don't know, but the upgrade may have killed a bunch of background tasks that had previously been running. Lots of variables, which is why I like to see reviewers with more rigorous testing methodology. One off experiences are nice to just see, but there are a ton of variables (including driver versions, which GPU is used, RAM speeds/timings, etc.)

For example, you're using a 4080. They used a 7900XTX.
oh, oof.
It feels like it for sure I went from consistently touching a 15k score to consistently hitting 14.5k and if anything my OS is cleaner now with W11 than it was with 10.
 
I have like half the background processes and tsks and apps running, if even that.

I'm all for a boost in numbers, it's crippling my overclock submissions 🤣🤣

FYI We're currently in 2024
Ya, i didn't get a performance improvement just doing the upgrade and actually had some cpu benchmarks lose peformance. I tried things like removing the cpu from device manager and rebooting as well as uninstalling the chipset drivers and reinstalling them using revo uninstaller which cleans up remnants and that didn't work either. I'll have to do a fresh install.
using 24.5.1 i would advise you to install the update using this website

[https://uupdump.net](https://uupdump.net)
Preview update*
I would definitely upgrade your bios. Depending on how old it might be, there could definitely be ram compatibility fixes. You should be able to run expo/xmp settings easily. If you only have two sticks of ram, they should be in slots 2 and 4 typically. Reference your manual to validate, but i haven't seen a motherboard in years where you put a memory module in the closest slot to the cpu.
Download benchmate, change priority to high or download r23, r20, r15, r11, y-cruncher
Here is the solution to your mystery: HVCI was disabled. Performance gains are "fake". Microsoft didn't fix their code. HVCI was disabled and performance went up.
geekbench is irrelevant to me, don't get me started on how shitty it is
Check this out . Here's one dude who's slowly building AMD optimised distro ..

We told him to put it up on GitHub.  Who knows , AMD might even like this and open source it .
https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxfromscratch/s/P8TK4DzpnI
Download ISO and upgrade through there
yeah and also some other issues that makes gaming experience worse overall
It doesn't work like that, you can't compare your numbers with ones from the op since his system was obviously bloated and his before numbers are not very relevant. Also we know for a fact that win10 doesn't have these new optimizations that bring imporovements, it is not a "bug"
If you want a specific test which is repetable but not fortnite lemme know. Rtx 3060 12 gb ram 16gb 3200 hw unboxed subtimings.
Oh please, this guy is using a heavily tuned windows that runs everything as admin by default. OFC he sees no gains, he was already avoiding the problem with his scripts.
I think it was this bad for many users, because the problem was that windows somehow limited the Performance for non-Administrators on Windows. And because AMD probably Tests the cpu's with Administrator Priviliges/Administrator, they couln't detect the Problem or were too stupid to think of this. If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me!
Be AMD, 
See that X3D CPUs are performing very well and switch blows with Intel's expensive chip
Knows about missing performance but keeps quiet about it
Chills back until new gen CPUs are out 
9000 series releases and AMD lets us download more ram...


Now their new lineup seems more appealing and if you can't afford it yet the 7800X3D went from being the king to the Queen 😎
Nobody said they were running 11 this whole time or anything. Could've upgraded relatively recently and then downgrading ends up being a pain.
Id like to see some benchmarks then
I mean the 9700x had no bump vs a 7700x
Same as with previous zen generations then. Probably needs RAM subtimings optimization with minimum tFAW and the like, along with synced IF. 
I remember 2700X gaining like 1fps in tomb raider with 300mhz oc, but 20% uplift with just RAM tuning to the max with b-die after that.
> Makes sense that there is a bottleneck.

No kidding. If nothing was bottlenecking the thing would run at infinite speed. Which clearly couldn't be real.
He’s drawing conclusions from data. It seems valid. Also AMD did say they’re trying some new things for x3d and its probably to compensate for the new branch predictions.
While I agree that Zen5 is usually underwhelming when DRAM is not the limiting factor, I think we should also consider what Zen5 is doing in workloads where v-cache is most beneficial, because it's a lot more interesting.

One result that continually stands out to me is Zen5's numbers in Assetto Corsa Competizione. ACC's physics run on complex lookup tables, and when it comes to performance gains from v-cache, ACC is almost always at or near the top of the stack, likely due to those lookup tables residing entirely in L3. The game absolutely loves v-cache, and yet, ACC is also one of the few games where Zen5 has a significant lead over all the non-X3D chips, even managing to eek ahead of the 5800X3D, and does a good job closing the gap to 7000X3D chips.

However, while there are other games which respond very well to v-cache, Zen5 doesn't always have results in them like it does in ACC, which I think is fair reason to suspect that an L3 occupancy issue is the bottleneck.
yeah. january or february probably
well, not necessarily. ive had it since 2023. my first chip was shooting whea errors every second. even with the fix, there was likely still damage done that will shorten the lifespan of the chip itself. more importantly, i want to get away from this inefficient piece of shit. and from intel after their godawful response
Depends if the new BIOS Update fixed the issue entirely or just slowers the „degradation“ process.

Eitherway. A 13900K costs like 700$/€ and in the EU I would send it back immediately. Personally I will never trust Intel. Same company throwing out 15k employees hell nah.

And if I can’t….

I will pray to god that he harms the management.

https://i.redd.it/d9b19hsvy5ld1.gif

(and not buy intel for atleast 10 years)
It may still be damaged already and likely is. Just not enough to crash. That still cannot be fixed at all and WILL FAIL. It’s better to RMA or switch to AMD before problems happen.
That's not my point. 

My point is that Zen 5 brings both improvements AND measurable regressions. Upgrading to a new gen of CPU/GPU is supposed to bring pure improvements in performance, otherwise it's a side grade.
that looks more like he had some crap installed that was crippling his performance, I had over 115 myself in CB24 single core with 23H2 and around 2850 single core in GB6.
I played more stuff but I have an office monitor and I usually play limited to 60 fps. In the real world I haven't noticed any improvement, but no worsening either. I only did the ff14 benchmark before and after to see if there was a difference but I didn't get into deep testing.
Yeah I guess it's not really comparable.
Waaaah! Fine, I guess I will submit and risk it on the gaming rig.

(and thank you very much)
doing god's work
Results ???? Before and after the branch patch
Ya, tried a few times.  Restarted, did a bios update, and all other windows 11 updates.  No idea, maybe it’s something particular with one of my components.  I have the below.

MSI Tomahawk B650,
AMD 7700X,
4090 FE,
32GB DDR5

I might just try the ISO method, but I need to research it more.  Not certain if it completely wipes my drive or not.  If not, I’ll just be patient for the full release.
If I install it , do I lose everything? Or keep my games, data, etc
So it’s a temporary dev mode??? Last time I did dev mode I was stuck for years
if we are talking about business, if users are quiet issues will not be fixed, to make some bugs high priority in the to-do list consumers need to say it and very often. Another reason even qa say "this is sht" but the company just ignores them. You talking about how  it was 10-15  years ago, when designers, qa, programmers really care about product they was involved in it, like Blizzard for example, but now in IT much cheaper changing workers that rising salary, because it's business. Only few companies left who actually love their own product
it will, but no one said how much devs will maintain this product, maybe after 1 month they close project
Yeah shouldn’t be allowed considering they are still selling HP VR headsets….“Windows Mixed Reality is deprecated and will be removed in Windows 11, version 24H2. This deprecation includes the Mixed Reality Portal app, Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR, and Steam VR Beta. Existing Windows Mixed Reality devices will continue to work with Steam through November 2026, if users remain on their current released version of Windows 11, version 23H2. After November 2026, Windows Mixed Reality will no longer receive security updates, nonsecurity updates, bug fixes, technical support, or online technical content updates.

This deprecation doesn’t affect HoloLens. We remain committed to HoloLens and our enterprise customers.”
To be exact, there's more than an year before support ends.
Thanks. I've got it installed, but was trying R24 standalone to see if that was any better. I'll try the other benchmarks as well.
Sorry for bothering, I'm not English motherthongue: you are saying that performance enhancements in some case are just because MS's upgrades just disable HVCI instead of modifying the branch prediction code? Tnx
What's wrong with GreekBench.?
Well thank you throwawayerectpenis. I think I will!
Hence the tentative conclusion.

And you have to agree the numbers are very far above 23H2 and still above 24H2 for the most part.

If Win 10 is affected, it doesn't look like the performance is.

Hence the conclusion is reasonable until further more definitive testing is conducted by experienced parties.
The only gains you see is from disabling security things.


https://github.com/fr33thytweaks/Debunking-Custom-ISOS-And-Windows-Optimizations
What a fail if this is true
test it yourself, don’t believe anybody on reddit. Just dual boot it and you’ll see how much faster windows 10 is.
What I'm asking is where can I see the data.
Try May for x800 SKU
yeah I get it now, I thought it was running fine the entire time but it *may* just be a ticking time bomb if it was previously unstable and now feels stable
I meant that if it's been running stable it's entire life span it'll likely continue to run stable, but if it previously had issues it'd be worth getting rid of
Yes.


You, I, and a ton of reviewers already get it.
check notes section to realize OP does have background stuff running
+0% here. I might have done some mistakes
keep it all
Technically yeah, but it’s only temporary until the other channels catch up to the dev build
i wonder if someone will be able to mod it back in
Correct. I meant to reply to the above commenter but apparently misclicked, pardon me.
It is, and amd said no gains
Yes, the latest Windows version has HVCI disabled by default. They will turn it back on once they officially release it.
For one there is no way to verify result correctness, there's a lot of bogus stuff in there and unless there's hundreds of benchmarks for a specific setup it's hard to draw conclusions.

They don't test continuous workloads. They just a have an ensemble for minor "productivity" tasks, half of which are irrelevant. In fact they even advertise this in their whitepaper

> Geekbench inserts a pause (or gap) between each workload to minimize the effect thermal
issues have on workload performance.

This also interferes with CPU boosting algorithms btw.



Their multithreading results are useless for anyone who understands how to utilize multicore CPUs.
>Hence the conclusions are reasonable until further more definitive testing is conducted by more experienced parties. 

yeah I would wait to see it compared on the same system by pros.
Yes, we know. The new patch massively reduces the cost of the 'security things' he has manually disabled - so there's no need to disable them anymore.

> 'Let's clear up the confusion around the 24H2 update: there is no performance difference when running games or benchmarks on Windows 10 or Windows 11/Admin or Local Account across all versions, **as long as you're running the game as an administrator.**'
you are the one making the counterclaim. I'm not going to test something I know to be true based on the information I have
The core-to-core latency measurements are here: [https://chipsandcheese.com/2024/08/14/amds-ryzen-9950x-zen-5-on-desktop/](https://chipsandcheese.com/2024/08/14/amds-ryzen-9950x-zen-5-on-desktop/)

It may just be a coincidence, but if you add Zen4's worst core-to-core latency results to the roundtrip time from a DRAM/IMC loop, you're right in the ballpark of Zen5's worst latency results. Some of the core-to-core numbers are so poor that it's approaching dual socket systems, which doesn't make ANY sense, and it's hard to imagine anything that could produce numbers like that in a single socket other than if the cores are being forced to share data in DRAM instead of L3.

Here's the tests for Linux vs. Windows.: [https://www.phoronix.com/review/ryzen-9950x-windows11-ubuntu](https://www.phoronix.com/review/ryzen-9950x-windows11-ubuntu)

There is a trend that Zen5 has a larger uplift in Linux than Zen4 does in many scenarios, and abnormal performance results in the Windows vs. Linux testing. This could be caused by whatever is slowing Ryzen down in Windows builds prior to 24H2, but another explanation could be that Linux simply has less background noise occupying L3, as it's pretty well established that the Linux kernel has less bloat and is better at managing resources. I also find it interesting that these large discrepancies were measured in Ubuntu, which almost always falls behind the performance in lighter Fedora and Arch based distros, often putting Ubuntu near parity with Windows.

As for the increase in cache misses versus Zen4, that comes from Wendell's (Level1techs on YouTube) Zen 5 review. While cache misses don't tell you anything on their own, when correlated with the impossibly bad core-to-core latency and the aberrations in the Linux results, it starts to paint a picture of a bottleneck and hints that it may be L3 occupancy related.
is that when the new motherboards are dropping? or, the X3Ds?
Just relax most people don’t know what they’re talking about thanks to Intel being intentionally vague. Stable has nothing to do with it, it’s damaged or not and tons are damaged. So no, just because the PC has been stable doesn’t mean it’s fine. In fact it’s a good chance that it’s not fine. Everyone with a 13900K should RMA them or just get rid of them since intel won’t say or doesn’t know how many are bad.
and that background stuff was making his 7800X3D perform like zen 3
thank you for the quick reply, do you perhaps have a link to the ISO?
Ah, so is there a way to get it to make it a temporary build? Like maybe opting out of the insider builds maybe?
no worries
Tnx
Your loss. 24H2 is only faster when compared to 23H2, miles slower than W10 22H2. All it does is make W11 less shit
Was an interesting piece, thank you. 

Core-to-core latency increase, especially nearby parked cores, is a "wtf?" tier indeed, while 1st to 8th doesnt seem as much.

  
CCD to CCD is an extreme increase across the board, but won't matter in case of x3d anyway, though also brings questions.
New mobos drop next month(technically). Until and officially say something about x3d release date in going to continue to assume a similar time frame to zen4s x3d... which should put it at some time in 4th quarter of this year.
what the *HELL* did he install
you need a dev account to download the iso, use this [https://uupdump.net/](https://uupdump.net/)
"miles slower"  
[WINDOWS 10 (22H2) vs WINDOWS 11 (23H2) || RX 7900XTX // which is better for Gaming? (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e-KW33Ao6E)

  
W11 23H2 looks to be faster than W10 22H2  
I understand you might just hate Windows 11 and that's fine but performance is not as drastic as you say it is.
Thank you, I'll give it a try. Must admit though, I'm still a bit nervous about the whole thing lol, this being my work (and only) PC.
Breaking: Dumbest Girl Alive Buys 2019 a Mac Pro
So, I decided to buy a 2019 Mac Pro… I’ve been enamoured work these machines for a *long* time and have wanted one since launch. Obviously the prices they were selling for new and used was obscene though and I could never justify it. However, when this one popped up for £950 I bit the bullet and decided to go for it. 

It’s a 16 core model with 96gb of memory, a 2tb SSD and the Radeon Pro 580X GPU. The only upgrade I’m going to be doing is swapping out that 580X for a better card because the 580X is ancient and should never have been an option in a machine of this price. 

Here in the UK, these machines typically sell for £2000 at a minimum. Which was a large part of why I felt like I should get this one, I finally get the opportunity to own my dream Mac, and if I regret it, making some profit off it doesn’t sound too bad.

So far though I’ve been delighted with it. It runs like a dream and is built better than any computer I’ve ever felt. It’s a shame technology becomes obsolete because this is a machine which is still going to feel premium as hell 50 years from now. 

Also, what’s Apple Silicon? Is that some sort of rubber kitchen utensil? Please rush to the comments to tell me all about it and why it’s better than this computer /s.
you got a super steal imo
You still have a chance to go dumber, and get the wheels!
But what about the egg crates?
I’m working on a loaded 8 core trashcan right now and it is seriously amazing at running Photoshop with huge 6-10 gig files.
why are you dumb? looks like you found a nice deal
Hello Dumb girl, I am dumb man, I have multiple 2019 Mac Pros because I love the design, and always wanted one.

What GPU do you plan on upgrading to?
100 gecs reference??
Buy what you can afford, milk it on MacOS as long as it's supported, then install Linux and give it an extra ten years of life. Reduce e-waste!
I don’t know, looks like you had a perfectly good machine on the other side of the room.  I bet that beauty runs Super Munchers all day.
I don't blame you, 2019 Mac Pros are still the best Mac Pros specifically for overall usage. You can have windows, linux, and macos natively all on one machine that is decently upgradable.

Even if the M2 Ultra Mac Pros are insane because of how much storage and ram you can fit in it as you don't need to use bandwidth for a gpu(and the gpu can have allll the vram it wants) 2019s have more utility.
i see fancier stuff in the reflection... drool
Okay but why is this kind of a sick setup lol. 

I miss how those Thunderbolt/cinema displays had the Apple logo at the bottom. It’s one of the few things missing from the studio display imo. 

I NEED TO KNOW THAT ITS FROM APPLE /s
Can we please talk about the Macintosh SE in the reflection?
I support people with Apple products all day. I can tell you that Mac is phenomenal. You got a great deal. I work with folks who are still using 2010 Mac Pro towers everyday. And even when you stop getting updates OCLP will get you right. Congrats on the Mac!!  Oh the Radeon W5700x is a little older too but an excellent card if you haven’t decided on one yet.
96GB of memory 😳
You bought the last upgradable desktop Mac used and for cheap. That's not dumb.
Dumber is me buying a used 2017 12-inch MacBook last year and then thermal modded it.
It gets cold in the UK and this will keep you much warmer than the AS version. Not dumb at all. 

Have fun owning something you wanted that makes you happy!!
£950 is an insane bargain! Cheapest on eBay atm is 2k. 
Honestly, you did fine. The intel models are the last real upgradable versions of the Mac Pro’s.  Apple silicon is nice and is perfect for laptops, minis and the studios. But it makes zero sense for a Mac Pro where you can’t even upgrade the cpu or the memory. And you’ll be hard pressed to find any 3rd party cards that can be used in the silicon Mac Pro.
I’d snag one for that.  It’s a good deal
Your poor electricity bill. I have a maxed 2019 Mac Pro and I feel like I can see the meter go up. They are great machines though.
Nothing dumb about this at all, you got an awesome deal! Should last you for many years to come.
Why have you referred to yourself as “Dumbest Girl Alive”? Especially if you’re happy with your purchase
It’s definitely an upgrade over the Mac behind you.
Wow great setup and super deal.
The egg crate wall thing is pure genius. +10
Dumbest I'll say a genius.... That's an incredible machine hell even the 2013 it is an incredible machine...this one I can't only imagine...enjoy it and use it...I might track one down
I love having my Bootcamp still!
*reads title* well did 2021 get anything?
I feel this way about the Pro Display XDR. I just love the aesthetic. Need to find a good deal.
I see an elderly Mac in the reflection ❤️
Those monitors are the real stars here. It's insane how well they still hold up.

grats on the super deal & cool egg crates xD
So why are you calling yourself dumb?
For 950 pounds thats a damn steal lol
Eh, tbh if you're happy with it and it works well enough for you, I see no problem. It'll still work fine for a long time yet I'm sure, and you can actually change stuff in it
I am *not* jealous. No, not at all. Not in the slightest. Not one bit.  Well…..
For £950 it’s a great deal, even with the old processor.
this is good. but prob will become obsolete by 2027ish
I hope purely as a collectors item? That things gonna be a boat anchor in 2 years.
Nah at that price its a good idea at much more? Not so much.
Is this a troll?
100 gecs reference?
From the random egg crates to the Mac, the the vintage Apple in the background,  another tower or computer parts further in, the serial port keyboard peaking in on the left, the this feels genuine. Good for you. Computer has found its home.

edit: Glad to see we all keep our apple boxes (I see yours under the desk)
>Also, what’s Apple Silicon? Is that some sort of rubber kitchen utensil? Please rush to the comments to tell me all about it and why it’s better than this computer /s.

I got a good chuckle out of this! 

Hmm let's see, my M1 Air is uh, um, easy to carry and stuff?/s
Now you saved to get real noise panels and not something that was in touch with something that comes off an animal butt
My eyes when I saw 96gb of memory👁️👄👁️
She bought a computer to give to a year?
be glad u didn't spend $699 USD (534.85 pounds) on wheels, I wouldn't consider this dumb due to the upgradability that is on the 2019 Mac Pro

#
96gb RAM. For God Sake! That’s an awesome machine. Mine is a MacBook Pro 2012 I wish one of these
so here's what you do right. sell that, get a mac mini, and a cheese grater case, and put the mac mini in the cheese grater case
Damn, that's a great deal
So jealous
Respect
Good. For. You!
Super setup, it will serve you well for years to come, the peripherals even longer, if open core and maybe a Linux at the end I can easily see this lasting 10 years or more if there is not something unexpected like a sponantious harddrive fail or something like this but even then it is properly repairable. And if you save a little bit starting now you can properly get yourself a refesh ARM Mac (that's the archticial basis for the M chips).
Very nice machine I have to say. Flipping disgusting bargain too! I got a new Mac this year and did think of this machine, or the old cheese grater model. But I wanted those updates and I had a very old MacBook Pro, so I got a refurb 14” M3 Max MB Pro and I’m stoked with it. With my desk it fits in there perfectly, I’d have to place a Mac Pro to the floor. 

Still can’t get over the price you paid, seriously good find. And you can dual boot Windows too.
That's a kick ass machine for the price!! I see them in Canada for 2k.
I used one for a number of years. Great machine. Only complaint got too hot.
Are those Thunderbolt Displays? Fantastic monitor. Still use mine from 2012.
Hey, kind of matches your wall coverings there. Nothing wrong with buying for aesthetics, if that’s your thing.
Sweet deal on a powerful Mac that can actually play games with boot camp.
Daaaamn, if I had one of these at work I would super motivated/productive.... at least for one day or two because ADHD.

Seriously though, what a gorgeous setup you have there. I *love Mac Pros* congrats on the find!
I mean I see the machines that were 10k-55k 4 years ago on eBay for 1500. Tons of PCIe expansion, solid processors, etc. you may only get a few more years of software updates but at that price, still a great machine for editing and you can always install Linux or windows down the line.
I bought a 2017 iMac Pro a few months ago and I love it. After support ends, it will serve duty as a 5k monitor with speakers. The Mac Pro is an iconic look and it's nice that you have matching Apple monitors to go with it.

A friend of mine back in 2020 was looking for a new Mac and decided on a Mac Pro and he asked for my help in configuring it and he's happy with the result. He spent $6k+ on it for his real estate business and has no regrets, even after Apple Silicon came out.
It's a bargain and then some for that cash. Congrats!
It's crazy how cheap polaris GPUs are, you can pick up 580s for like 40 cad
I really love the design of this Mac. Feels brand new! Even IF it gets unsupported after many years - I would put a new Mac inside of the case. It is too iconic!
Nice setup. If you're happy, even better.  I'd be very happy with it too. Great specs!
Honestly £1k for that is amazing even if it’s Intel
Sheeeeeeshhhh
Those egg cartons do nothing except create the most flammable room in the house.
Don’t remind me these exist, I don’t need another orphan
Nice vintage Mac on the dresser 😁
Just picked one up myself. I’d honestly pay too much for just the case. The machine is outdated and slow compared to the studio, but damn does it look good. I’m going to figure out how to build a normal PC inside so I can enjoy the case far into the future.
for that price it’s honestly a pretty compelling workstation platform. i buy all my computers used, and i’d be hard pressed to find a windows workstation with comparable specs for that price (including the insane amount of PCIe lanes, thunderbolt ports, etc).

especially since there’s the opencore legacy patcher to keep it receiving new macos builds, and then you can run windows/linux once mac intel support is officially gone.
This seems like it’ll last ya’ for a long time. And when new updates aren’t supported anymore, aqauaint yourself with https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenCoreLegacyPatcher/s/ZGeISbRXYo .
I hope you enjoy it!  I just bought the same config for a similar price in the US and have added some NVME drives, a 6800xt, and a 3d printed drive caddy for my 2x8tb raid 0 array.  

It’s not the most cost effective purchase for the performance, but I like the design and enjoy tinkering.  I ran a 5,1 for a decade and loved it. 

I use mine for basic personal use, financial modeling on large data sets, light gaming/photo/video work. 

I have bootcamp installed with Windows 11 as well.  Native Windows is a great feature for some programs that just work better. 

I bet that Open Core will keep these things going for some time.
Great. What do you plan to do with all that RAM?
If you think I’m stupid now. 
You should see me when I’m high. 
And I’m smarter than I look. 
I’m the dumbest girl alive.
If I liked it so much, I'd have bought a dead machine for like 150e, gutted it, and just put a new Mac mini in it or something.  
But hope you're happy - that's all that matters.
So happy for you, I love these machiners as well, but they are so out of reach.
Good choice!! Really, I love that Machine...hellyeah!!
Looks neat. Very good buy. I myself am lurking at the monitors … got a 49uw but the sharpness of these has something that the uw does not
Uuuh, dual oldschool cinema/thunderbolt display, nice. Couldn’t afford a Pro Display XDR, that costs 5 times the price of your Mac, heh? /s
Honestly, for £950 that’s not the worst deal. The GPU is a little on the weaker side, but the 580X isn’t awful, and you were going to upgrade it either way. The CPU and RAM were good for the price.
Drop a new GPU in there and enjoy having a really reliable and good-looking, if pricey, Windows computer/Linux server/legacy macOS hybrid!

You’re not dumb, you’re just eccentric.
As a MacBook user, which means I have nothing to do with Desktops, I have always been curious to own a desktop Mac. What a machine you got there! Congrats!
I go to this “small” design firm owned by a trust fund baby that has two of these that were turned into a bench for guests. The crazy thing is that the hardware is all still inside and they (supposedly according to the receptionist) still work.
What a steal. As soon as I saw this I went onto eBay, you could probably sell this for enough to get the same thing with Apple silicon, the computer no the line of spatulas, but either way, great find, hope it gives you many years of service, congrats on the purchase!
now invest in an actual acoustic treatment.
Holy crap, if only there were such deals around here... I've still got my 5,1 Mac Pro and 6,1 Mac Pro... love these. It's sad the newer revisions are completely dumb :( Non-expandable RAM.... WHAT? :D
For £950 it is that bad of a deal
Yoo im more interested about the computer in the reflection… is that for real?
Nothing wrong with it. You're not dumb. You do you! Apple Silicon is just the epitome of soldering eveything together. It sacrifices upgradeability for speed (and temp) gains basically. 

May the downvoting begin!
Cool!
Considering you clearly know the inside of these machine, and can do your own upgrades, I would hardly call that dumb. It sets you apart from the vast majority of the population, male and female. I have machines from various era's, from PowerPC to Intel to Apple Silicon. Native hardware is always better than emulation.  I have an older Mac Pro 5.1, and would trade it in for a more powerful Intel machine if the chance presented itself.
To be honest if I saw a 2019 Mac Pro for ~$1000 I would buy the hell out of it.
My 2019 iMac (not even a pro) has the 580x gpu in it. It blew my mind when I saw that the Mac Pro could be configured with the same GPU and it was three times the cost (granted that come with a better processor, but still!)
Lol nice karma bait and nice setup
Nice! Always wanted one of these. Had to settle for an iMac 27” instead.
900 is a steal, even inevitably when Mac OS drops intel support, you can still run it for a long time to come, and/or install Linux or Windows.
I feel you. I bought myself and my wife an Intel Macbook Pro months before the M1 came out. No idea what I did there. The performance is so damn bad. Offered my wife to explace hers but she said, she will ride it out till it dies. But I doubt it will ever die lol
What a steal!
every damn time i see someone use the phrase "dumbest girl alive" i think the person is trans and i have no idea why i don't even listen to 100gecs
Did you take 10 advils today and perhaps have bruises on your thighs?
TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT LIKE YOU TRYNA START A FIGHT
How/where did you find that for £950 😱😱🤯
That’s awesome!
Oh my God this pc is so beautiful I want it but don’t have the money for it. Atleast the case would be amazing but the only aftermarket Dune Case was just a scam :( 
Congrats! I love the aesthetics
You should run Geek Bench and see how it fares against the latest crop of Macs, just or perspective.  But if you're happy with it, good for you!
Seems like quite an upgrade compared to the one in the reflection!
wtf, that is a steal!
https://youtu.be/oXrbMDww9ss?si=6jJcFx2oY4V3izXh
Did you just make the change from Appe II?
I felt this way about the PowerMac G5 Towers. Fortunately I did scrape enough together to buy one new and enjoyed it for several years before selling it on.

It’s sad to see them not really having any current purpose or the liquid cooling system all rotted out.
Awesome setup! Enjoy
I feel you. I recently purchased one about a year ago but didn’t open it till last month. Along with that I got an XDR display and the stand. Also a nice W6800X Duo MPX module. Yes, they are going to reach their end of life soon, but I absolutely love it. (Also I paid retail for that display so trust I am not the smartest tool in the shed…)
That's awesome. What's the cpu?
Yea its a nice machine. Just keep in mind its based on 2015-2016 tech (intel 14nm, amd polaris), so expect to pay the energy bills accordingly and dont expect above average performance
They are beautiful machines.
Just curious, what’s the typical usage for someone to need so much RAM?
steal in my book. When it gets too old to use daily i would just drill a few holes and use the case for a nice looking ATX Windows PC.
oh i also want one so bad but
You need more egg crates.
For 950 it's a lovely machine and a lovely setup with the twin Cinema Displays and because it's Intel you can lash Windows onto an external SSD and now you can play plenty of PC games like Battlefield etc. I know your graphics card is probably mid-tier by today's standards but you'll still get 1080p gaming for lots of games with it I think.

Enjoy!
You’ll be running your entire compute session in RAM so it should be quick.

(For real you got a steal, nice snag.)
It’s still a very nice machine, enjoy it.
🎵If you think I’m stupid now, you should see me when I‘m high🎵
Nothing dumb here at all if know what you buy it for. 😊

I got myself one last year, the same week they introduced the new model with Apple Silicon I bought the last Intel model with a W6800X from Apple refurbished, it’s a beast running both Sonoma and Windows 10 and will definitely serve me well like this for another few years.
Haha love it. But seriously, I'd rather have a second hand original M1 mac mini than that thing. Why did you do it? Just because you like what they look like or something? I know you joke about silicon but like, have you actually tried a silicon computer? If I had to go back to anything less I'd probably cry for an hour every day when I finished using it. But, I guess you can't miss what you never had.
I bought [mine](https://imgur.com/afdIESh) in May 2020 a month before Apple announced the ARM transition. Definitely not the most financially sound decision, but like you I really aspired to own it. Definitely the most well built desktop tower ever made. I'm bummed I'm probably not going to see much more software support in the future, but I'm gonna try and get as much use out of it as I can regardless.
Honestly, still one of the best Mac made
I bought a 2015 11 inch MacBook Air a couple months ago just because I always wanted one.  Upgraded the SSD and put a new battery in it.  Not sure what to do with it now, but I really like having it right next to my Newton.
Can I ask where you found it, please?
It might benefit from a new GPU, depending on your needs. Other than that, it's still a beast.
I'm still running a 2007 Mac Pro as a media server, I don't ask much of it these days, but it's still going strong.
Great deal there. I have a 2019 regular iMac.🖥️ With all these AI features coming they require Apple Silicon so if you don’t have it (me) then upgrading will do the trick if want all the latest and greatest. I will say though my 19 has performed flawless since day number one. I can feel it’s age though 😢
gecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgec
Good deal!
Marry me.
The 580X was fine, but it's definitely out dated by far now. What are you going to replace it with?
I was about to agree with the title until I saw the price and I think that was a smart decision! Hope you enjoy it.
I like the last paragraph.
Is jealous
Beautiful
I mean, the Thunderbolt Displays are great. I don't know that I'd spend money on Intel hardware these days. But especially if you plan on gaming in a Windows virtual machine or something I guess it could be good?

Honestly it really depends on your work flow. If you do video, this was a bad buy over even a new Mac mini. If you do other stuff, you're probably fine.
I spy some previous dumb purchases.
Which mouse is that?
I wouldn’t call you stupid, you know not bought it knowing its days of updates are numbed.

I’m guessing you do audio work? Lots of pros I’ve seen don’t update their software every year due to risk of something breaking.

If you are worried for security updates just use something else for web browsing etc later on and leave this off the network/Internet.

I personally bought a Mac mini 2018 a few years ago because I worked with a lot of Intel code. It’s still useful but I use my M1 Pro  MacBook Pro from work more
I’m more excited about the Mac Plus in the reflection!
Nah, you got a good deal, even though Intel isn’t a good idea in 2024.

Apple Silicon is way more efficient, produces less heat, is way more powerful and more compact.
It looks gorgeous. It's a great computer. But if it's not Apple Silicon, you may be unable to update it to the latest macOS versions.
At first I though the word “dumb” in the title stands for the fact iMacs are used as displays, but then I saw the stickers being on different levels.
you could install opencaore and than add the latest macos system [https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/START.html](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/START.html)
this is sick and you ate
Thank you for buying the year 2019 a Mac Pro!
im using a 2016 imac. still runs great on 24gb ram and a 256 gb ssd lol. thank god i didnt pick the hdd that would have sucked
I'm more concerned about your choice to use the 'magic' key board. Try a mechanical some time with real keys. It feels amazing.
awesome. i'm a fan of buying slightly older gear that gets everything done for a small fraction of the price.
are they egg cartons?
Buying Mac Pro is dumb, but buying Mac Pro of 96GB mem + 2TB SSD with $1k is so smart.

Yes, you can get Mac Studio with M2 Max for a much faster CPU speed, but the prices will be 3x at least.
Seems like a good lot of computer for 1k! You are only in MacBook Air territory, so as long as you can use the ram and storage it was probably the best decision you could’ve made for the price.
Mac Studio makes it look like an Atari 2600 HAHAHA
Love how these look. I made my PC look like that era Mac pro with an ITX case, 3d printed feet, and a printed handle. Personally, I like my version better haha but that's probably just cuz I put a ton of work into it
Congratulations！I bought the Mac Pro 2019 around one month ago, "upgraded" from my M1 Max Mac Studio.
…making some.. profit? 🤦

Dream Mac?..🤦
It's still a perfectly good computer
Sounds like a good deal! The Bad Rep that these MacBooks get (from me as well) comes largely from the smaller models. Mine was not getting super hot and loud but I guess with these specs that’s not gonna happen soon. Also, I honestly liked the Touch Bar etc. 
I now have an Apple Silicon Mac and I think it’s great but honestly, the „pure“ Apple Silicon features I regularly use I could easily count on one hand (the only one I could think of on the spot is the stem decomposition in Logic but I guess that’s pretty niche outside my bubble). The rest can easily be countered by throwing sheer power at it I think
Apple silicon helps you go from A to DD in a retina smooth transition, so you can have those luscious, sun-kissed beach cleavage or enchant audience with your sway on the ramp or just relax your chest while you read on the couch. For the first time, they are try tone color matched and can match your tan. As always, they are lead free.
Nice monitors bro, how much did you snag those for? 1440p I guess?

Ive been scouring eBay for a trash can < £100 lost a few just above that. I’m in no rush for it so I’m happy to wait.
Since these are likely to only get another 3-5 years of software updates (counting security patches), most folks on this reddit seem to count them out and say buying any Intel Mac is pointless
to start off with i’m gonna fit my radeon vii which is currently in my 2010 mac pro (see bottom left), but when i find a decent deal/prices drop i’m gonna get a radeon rx 6800/6900xt

I had to zoom in to see that treasure
There's a classic Mac in the reflection!
OCLP won’t help you once this looses support, Mac OS itself will drop Intel support entirely once this becomes obsolete
These Mac pros can equip up to 1.5TB of ram.  96GB seems small in comparison to its full potential.
lowkey considering selling off some of it, it’s kinda funny to have that much memory. but i am NOT a person who needs that much, when i built my pc i thought i was really splashing out and being overkill by getting 32gb
Apple silicon mac pro is niche product for video and sound studios. 
It is not that hard to be honest. PCIe m.2 adapters, fiberchannel cards, blackmagic decklinks and you pretty much quite easily get use of all that pcie slots
led cinema displays! aka literally the exact same thing but minus the ethernet/firewire ports and with mini displayport instead of thunderbolt 2
That won’t help.  That basically extends macOS driver support to old Intel models, to run current Intel MacOS.  When Apple stops releasing Intel MacOS, there will be no path to run new ARM MacOS on old Intel hardware.
OpenCore won’t help 

OpenCore just lets a Mac that otherwise has lost support run the latest Intel-based MacOS. 

When Apple drops all Intel MacOS support (likely this current macOS is the last for Intel, if rumors are to be believed) then no more MacOS will run on Intel, OpenCore or not.
they’re decent monitors, although very overpriced for what they are imo. i only have my two because i bought three broken ones and used the parts from the spare one to make two good ones
i have a 13” m1 mbp and it’s an amazing laptop, but i’ve always been a bigger desktop user. admittedly the things i do could be 100% done on the m1, but sitting down at a proper desk with big monitors and a keyboard and mouse always feels so much more in depth
on the laptops yeah the m1/2/3’s are miles better than the intels and it isn’t even close (i own a 13” m1 mbp), on the desktops however since they don’t have the same thermal limitations it’s not anywhere near as bad. plus this machine allows me to install a beefy gpu and essentially replace my gaming pc. it’s a gorgeous machine which is built like art, but there was more behind why i bought it lol
i bought three of them for a total of £190, one had no front glass, one had a broken hardwired cable, and the third didn’t work at all, but had its glass and a good cable. so i took those parts from it and sold the rest of it on for spares for £40, so £75 each, but with an asterisk after it
no one cares what you think stop pretending like they do
Spoiler: It is not. At all.

Apple MFs when they see what RAM really costs outside their MBP upsell.
thats honestly a great way to price one of these... im going to try and use that to my advantage, thank you
The point is that Apple can and will charge people a thousand dollars for something like 4 roller wheels, or a monitor stand. It's a show of marketing strength ;-)
i wheel mine around the studio it's very useful.
Welcome to the club, I'll be your guide:  
[https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2021/12/19/definitive-mac-pro-2019-upgrade-guide.html](https://blog.greggant.com/posts/2021/12/19/definitive-mac-pro-2019-upgrade-guide.html)

Jokes aside, the Mac Pro 2019 an incredible machine. I have mine kitted out with 192 GB of RAM, a Radeon 6900 XT, a lowly 8-Core CPU, and five NVMe drives (three 2 TB, two 4 TB), two Sata Drives, and a secondary USB card. It's a beast.

It's sad Apple doesn't believe in modularity anymore. I (mostly)love the computer.
That is… bizarre. But do you! 

Definitely feels like you’ve been influenced by photos you’ve seen online from novice sound engineers but I’m sure you’re not thinking of it that way.
And I came here to ask what recording work you do with all the egg crates on the wall 
But I guess never mind lol
It‘s a weird choice but you do you if it fits your eggsthetic.
lmao the egg crate aesthetic
It looks terrible tbf. Really cheapens the look with the expensive Apple products
I mean hey, if they’re there, might as well use them for acoustic treatment. Haha
Are you a chicken farmer?
Common misconception, they do next to nothing for sound treatment.
More like protects walls from Mac Pro during earthquake
Monterey 17.7.6 

Running photoshop 25.12.0. It gives me a warning when opening it that I should upgrade to the latest os to work optimally with photoshop but it’s fine.
Clean it out really good they are like air filters and can get packed with dust.
Good luck. Hey are great little computers. Make sure you get good working gpus. I have d700s in this work machine and it’s great. I have d500s in my personal one and I did have to get one replaced by Apple a few years ago.
Looks like a decently long-lasting windows gaming machine if they pull the plug on Intel updates...
As a Mac, it's a dead platform.  As a PC, it's a real nice machine.  I'm jealous.  The high end GPUs they came with are still pretty beefy. It's a lot more Mac Pro than the Apple silicon one that followed it.
When Apple stops supporting this, you can load up Linux and keep on using this BEAST of a machine. Congratulations!
intel mac/macbook are still better as they offer native windows virtualization

apple silicon if you want to run windows you'll use the inferior arm version

you got a steal btw!!

i wish the macbook pro from 2019 had similar price here in canada but they are massively overpriced.
No need to worry. Your macs aint going anywhere. A few days ago my mom had a disk failure in her 11 year old mbp. I bought her a replacement disk for like $15 or so and it works again.
No worries. I have a 2012 CMP (12 cores) and it is stuck on High Sierra. Really solid machine. I use it in order to backup all my devices and those of my family. I have a MacBook, iPhone and iPad - that’s a lot of backups. 
You can host all your stuff on that thing. And it’s still good enough for windows gaming at 1440p
You can get the latest patches for unsupported machines using the [Open Core Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/).  It won't help you when Apple stops supporting Intel platforms in (guess) 2027 or so.
Well, when they come out with a 2048gb 64core M17 with 1240 graphics cores, the size of a pencil, you can always scoop out the insides and have a beautiful case to put it in!  Meanwhile, nice look, nice machine!  Congrats!
Check out opencore software and get a longer life for your Mac
Open core legacy for Mac will keep your Mac Pro updated with more current OS. I have a 2009 iMac running Ventura right now. It’s not 100% perfect but it works.
Pretty sure you can install Linux on it, which will make it a really good steal
You can always put windows or Linux on it anyway so it's not like the thing will become a paperweight when that happens. I got an Intel Mac for a good deal with that in mind.
When software updates end, just install OpenCore. It will allow you to run the newest releases of Mac OS and their updates without issue on older Macs. I have an 4th gen intel iMac running Sequoia with no problems.
just because it doesn't get updates does't make it less useful (if you know what you need it for). My 5,1 is still going as strong as it was and i still use it regularly.
nah, people want the latest and greatest, in this sub they will also say 8gb ram is shit, which is laughable.

different people have different usages and different needs.

this is an amazing machine and you may be able to use Open Core once it reaches EOL.
Opencore!
It depends on your use case and whether you have another machine. If you’re running heavier apps that need better software support and better hardware, buying newer is probably advisable. If you’re basically just doing word docs and surfing the web, if it runs it runs. That’s all that really matters. 

I’d shy away from doing sensitive work or online banking on a super old device but it’s not like you’re guaranteed to be hit. The risk is still minimal.
Nice! I have a 6900xt on one of mine and a nvidia 4090 + amd 6600 in another.
YEAAAAAH 🔥🔥🔥
I completely disagree ... my main gaming machine is Linux, and i work on it a little when i need the extra screens and can't be bothered to connect my Mac to them .. every thing runs better on Linux
I can assure you Linux isn’t useless. If it doesn’t suit your needs then cool but that doesn’t make it useless
I guess the Steam deck doesn’t play games.
linux runs countries my guy
true
What would a user use that for ? I’m curious 🧐 

Rendering huge video files ?
You can run a bunch of VMs with that much RAM
Agreed
I get what you’re saying, but the upgradability is what’s supposed to set the pro apart from the rest. You should have infinite (to a point) upgradable paths. When I buy a pc tower, I expect to upgrade:
1. CPU
2. GPU
3. Ram
4. Storage
5. Any pcie adapter compatible with my machine. 

You cannot do 1, 2 or 3 with the Mac Pro. It’s a glorified Mac mini with pcie. The new Apple silicon Mac Pro  is not a pro machine.
I love that there are people here who still mentally differentiate between the two! Dumb girl, you are not.
I see ! Nowadays I see them going at 250€, not too bad of a deal for the design + the resolution imo …
Got myself a decent monitor, the most hated keyboard & mouse (Apple’s lol) to always have the option to be of maximum productivity. I just enjoy the liberty of carrying a lightweight machine or move around the house that can almost do it all without worrying about battery/performance. Bless Apple silicon for what it achieved in that regard.
Not bad at all. Kudos for the quick hacks.
Error correcting ram or ECC ram is primarily used in mass servers or super powerful work stations, will gaming benefit from ECC? barely or not at all. And that is why ECC is so expensive.
ya.. 128gb can be had for <200 quid easily.
Spoiler, ECC ram is triple or 5x regular ram prices
Im pretty sure they mean the upgrade on apple store side
Lmao 🤣 mad cause Apple doesn’t depreciate as much as everything else?
ECC ram is $2000-$4000 for 128gb, NOT SOLD BY APPLE
already a big reader of all your guides! my cmp in the bottom left is specced like crazy, but it’s gonna be used more for legacy applications going forward
Jesus Christ dude you can probably walk on water with those specs
can you run windows via parallels or something else for PC VR?!?!?! with a Quest 3?!?!!??!
They're also incredibly flammable, as I learned from a FDNY captain. Way back when, I shared a rehearsal studio in an industrial building on Mercer Street in Soho with a drummer friend. He found several cases of unused cardboard egg cartons in a dumpster and covered the walls of our studio with them. It attenuated some high mids but did nothing for bass. I learned later that you need a resonator or a bass trap for that, but I digress.

A few weeks later while both of us were getting loaded, the super let fire inspectors into our loft from the freight elevator. When the captain saw the drummer's handiwork he yelled, "Get that shit off the walls right now!" And he meant right now. It was an easy job insofar as the drummer had only stapled them to the drywall. While we were working the captain asked, "Are you boys practicing to be arsonists?" I thought he was being overly-dramatic but I didn't want to fail fire inspection because we were already in trouble with the landlord because of the drummer's redneck plumbing skills that dumped about a thousand gallons of water on the floor below.

Before the rubber coats left, the captain summoned us to the "kitchen", held up one of the egg crates over the sink and lit the edge with his lighter. It burst into flames in about three seconds. "See?  I use these things to start my charcoal grill at home."
They actually break up echo significantly, they however do almost nothing for sound dampening. Source: dude I knew did this to a room and I heard the before and after.
12.7.6
Is there any way to check from a screen on the Mac that they work? EBay is tough to return afterwards.
I would make a Linux box
> Linux

Linux on T2 chips is kinda underwhelming. Will have to make do with Windows for a while. Once these 2019s become even cheaper maybe the development will speed up
https://wiki.t2linux.org/state/
I’m not sure what the import taxes are like for Canada, but maybe look at eBay UK? Here I routinely see those 16” 2019’s sell for under 400. Me personally I’d still rather get an M1 Air over one of those, but I can’t pretend the 16” isn’t way cooler
Minor correction, they offer native Windows support on the hardware directly. Any computer can virtualise Windows, provided they share CPU architecture. M1 Macs can natively virtualise ARM-based versions of Windows
Can’t you emulate x86 Windows now?
And the ability to run windows natively. Idk if TPM 2.0 works though 🤷‍♂️
Not only virtualization but Bootcamp
8GB of RAM *IS* shit, but otherwise totally agree
I’m not positive on Opencore. It relies on having *some* version of Intel Mac supported. If macOS drops the last non M series, she’d be toast.
It will be among the last supported Intel Mac.  OC won't make any difference for this machine; once Apple pulls the plug on Intel, that's it, OC won't help at that point.
8 gigs of ram isn’t bad but given apple silicon can use the SSD as ram which kills it quickly that is the main reason why most people say to go 16 thankfully it seems like the M4 Mac’s will finally feature 16 as a base meaning that buying a base spec Mac should be a much better deal
Is there properly supported drivers for the 4090?!
100 Gecs mentioned!! 🦎🦎
I have 1.5TB memory on mine (I maxed out all the specs) and use it for animation and video editing. That being said, it’s still slow af and when I asked apple for a trade in they offered me $1k for it. Total joke.
That and also machine learning workloads can consume a lot of ram.  For certain types of development these are / were decent workstations.
I don't know, but it would definitely make a fun project to upgrade the CPU and ram on your pro 5-10 years from now when ram prices are more affordable.
maybe running huge databases or multiple virtual machines. server role.
It eliminates the need for an SSD. You can keep all your files in volatile RAM, just be careful to never reboot.
Or like 9 chrome tabs
Spoiler: It is not anymore. Specifically last gen RAM.
This was pre-ddr5 and I remember a ram shortage when they released the previous Mac Pro. But an eccram 128gb is still around $2k in 2024
Spoiler: 99€ for 128gig on ebay.
If you find 128gb of ECC ram for less than $950 on eBay, you are the luckiest guy out in the world of technology.
No its not, its also used.
Drop a w6900x maybe into the 2019 Mac pro
It's super cool how many people have seen the Classic Mac Pro Upgrade Guide. I went all in on my 5,1. I kinda wish I still had it but I still have my Mac Pro 2008.
In the world of Mac Pros, I have a poverty set up, as evidenced by my 8 Core CPU. I bought the absolute base model new out of happenstance of the GPU crisis and having two classic Mac Pros and a few GPUs for them.

Over time I upgraded it. RAM was about $400 all said done, the 6900 XT was the one major splurge but I had to wait until the GPU prices came back down to earth, I paid $800 for it. Made a [video about gaming with the Mac Pro 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah69sbogFx4).

The SATA SSDs + two of the SSDs came from Mac Pro 5,1  over the past 4+ years owning one, I bought the 4 TB drives much later. Sonnet did send me their[ 4x4 Silent to review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwUc2LRoUyQ), and holy hell it is a beast.

OP's box has a lot more CPU than me, mildly envious.
A few things to unpack

* Parallels doesn't support USBc displays and the sort of functionality for a VR headset, or hasn't as of a year or two ago (whenever I last paid for it)
* Mac Pro 2019s can boot Windows natively, thus can support whatever devices Windows supports
* I even have an old[ video where I used a Quest 2 with a Mac Pro 2010](https://youtu.be/8RnAPiC3uNs) (5,1). If you haven't tried it VR is trash but tethered VR manages to make it much worse. I tried Skyrim VR and it was a vomit comet. There still aren't any really killer games, and you have to make a lot of accommodations for tethered VR. Unless you're a rich turbovirgin who can dedicate an entire room to PC VR experience, it's going to suck.
* You're best off just buying a Quest 2 used, to experience its mediocrity. You'll only  only be out the $200\~ as inevitability it'll end up unused and unloved. Long term VR stats are abysmal.  I sold mine and got most of my money back. I seem to recall after a year only 1-2% of users still use their VR unit once a week.
* You're much better off buying a dedicated PC for gaming. I have a [vid of benchmarks](https://youtu.be/Ah69sbogFx4) and while it does alright, Apple refuses to add support for the AMD 7xxx series let alone nVidia, so if you're dual booting, limited to the 6000 series AMD GPUs. At the price point of used Mac Pros, you'd probably get a PC that you could later buy a high end GPU for and run circles around it. Xeons do not have the higher clock speeds of consumer CPUs. Also, even jumping roughly to about 2022 means the Ryzen 5000 series which is oodles faster as a platform for gaming, let alone the latest and greatest

TLDR, VR still sucks. If you want VR just buy a Quest and skip the gaming PC as tethered VR is a pain and there's few killer apps. If you want gaming, get a dedicated PC.
Wish I could give you 100 upvotes!  The only thing worse would be to put an old electronic device next to it.  Lose the crates.
They are worse because they only diffuse audio in high frequencies and so do nothing to audio below those frequencies which hurts more than helps.
Linux ftw!!!
Or you could plant some flowers in it. That would be a more dignified use.
I have Fedora running well on my 2018 Macbook Air.
I love the touch bar on mine. Forget the haters, embrace what you like!
What was the ram spec Emma?
Windows on ARM is still pretty shit. Better but still shit
No just the arm version which has Microsoft shitty windows version of Rosetta lol
No Windows 11 on the 2020 iMac. Mine is a beast spec wise and could easily run 11 if not for that one requirement.
Plenty of people work just fine on 8gb ram. I do work on 8gb as a sysadmin and it’s gold for me. The shit part is that it’s $200 to upgrade to 16gb if you want to.
Eh, it's mostly fine, as long as you have enough disk space to swap, and nothing requires all the RAM.
Correct.
Not Toast … when Apple drop the non silicon in the next (macOS 16 or 17) there will be still Security Updates for 4 years … and I use a 5K iMac with 64GB an a 4TB SSD with macOS 13.9 …

I tried OpenCoreLegacyPatcher with macOS 14.5 but the Performance is much better with macOS 13. The iMac is a workhorse … runs 2 VmWare simultaneous plus (after work) a Plex video Server. The 5K 27” screen is great …

The new M iMacs are more like the old original iMacs … cute ;)

On the other side … for private use I would like to get a M1 Max MacBookPro as my 2017 is taken over by my wife.
For now. It might change in 3, 4 years
No not in macOS, the 4090 is for use with Bootcamp in Windows/Linux
Don’t forget the incredible value they provide by recycling your obsolete computer with its ten grand of RAM for you. You’d be silly to pass it up!
errr you should have a cpu with alot of cores also memory wise i feel like 512gb would be more than enough for everything but in the cpu department would want a 64 core epyc at 5ghz.
Is the memory operating occurs all channels? I know with the 2012 Mac Pros, they had tri-channel memory, but they would run either single or dual channel with the max 128 GB installed, so 96 GB was recommended instead.

Of course, that’s a 2012 Mac Pro, I have absolutely no clue if that also applies with these
😆👏
Its a used computer, it does not matter in the slightest what replacable RAM cost back in that exact day. There is 128GB DDR4 ECC for 99€ on ebay.
Spoiler: fake stuff is everywhere.
OWC sells 128GB of ddr4 ecc registered memory for $329. CDW sells ddr4 ecc registered 32GB module for ~ $110 (made for HP servers), which is gonna be ~$450 for 128GB. So it is anyway at least twice cheaper that $950
I just found 128GB DDR4 ECC for 99 bucks on ebay lol
Apple is only selling those for more than a Mac Studio costs. Seems reasonable... or you could buy a regular 6900 XT for 1/8 the cost  ;)
What in the actual hell? **No.**

You do realize higher frequencies shortwave length and energy dissipation. The object isn't to create sound dampening but diffusion: it literally reduce reverb, thus sounds  better. Again, I've heard this tested in a very makeshift studio and it was night and day.

Ever go to bare empty room with hard floors or worse, cement? The reverb often is unbearable and makes conversing annoying. This is because of Surface flection.  Smooth and hard surfaces reflect high frequencies.  this why even hanging pictures and shelving  and tossing an area rug in bare room radically reduces it. 

It will not stop muddiness which I think is what you're getting at but that'd be a problem in a small space (Recording booth) as opposed to larger one. There are much better things to use instead of egg cartons. Thick blankets or heavy curtains or rugs are classic (many older movie theaters used curtains along the walls) or for the classic makeshift booth, old foam mattresses. OP has appears to have a larger space, so if simply listening to music, probably helps although I'd suggest other materials.
or a apple tree!
Haven’t tried it myself yet: https://youtu.be/psJeU3AQXHY?si=Sf5EggMsM7ZLZ0EY
It's not the amount of memory that upsets people, it's the amount of memory for the price.  Most $500 dollar Windows notebooks come with 16GB these days and while I'm not suggesting these cheap Windows laptops are as good as Macbook Air or Macbook Pro only 8GB of RAM for $1300-1500 dollar laptops AND charging $200 dollars if you dare have a use case for more is ridiculous. NAND costs next to nothing, no excuse for it at the price point despite it being enough for some users.
Totally - and even more expensive if you go with 32 or 64. It’s almost enough to make you get a Windows machine …I’ll let myself out now 🤣
It might change. That’s why I said “may be able”
My bad, I should’ve said new.
Buy it and tell me if it works 😂😂
Brodie recycling centers probably pay the same.
And I found a Lamborghini on temu for the same price.
Oh yeah, was just unsure if it has full compatibility haha
thats emulation right?? its gonna have perf cost i believe
It won't.  OpenCore isn't an emulation layer.  Sure, an entirely new product could come along that will let your old Intel Mac run ARM instructions (at a significant drop in speed) ala QEMU, but that fundamentally is completely different from what OpenCore does, which is simply to set up a EFI-like environment that MacOS (Intel) knows how to boot from (and does exactly zero emulation).
By new you mean ddr5? This machine is ddr4 and your comment would irrelevant. If you meant that what I said were prices for used memory - you are definitely wrong, not sure about OWC, but CDW is definitely new.
Yea okay, lets guide it ad absurdum so we can act like 96GB of DDR4 ECC is something incredible in 2024.
just need to compile something and gtfo of there 😂
I just went on CDW, the memories you were talking about were most likely not ddr4 2933mhz nor were they the correct latency. if you were to purchase the right ones on CDW, they would be $346.99 for 64gb ddr4 ECC ram. Granted I was exaggerating, but my point still stands. Just the ram prices would be 2/3 of the computer
Still holds up very well, especially when ddr5 ECC for the same capacity is over thousands of dollars
wouldn't be an issue if prism was good, loser microsoft

win 11 is also trash
https://www.cdw.com/product/edge-32gb-ddr4-sdram-memory-module/6032456

https://www.cdw.com/product/proline-64gb-ddr4-2933mhz-ecc-rdimm/5845285

Even $350 per 64GB module is cheaper than $950, which contradicts your original claim. And down below you even make some delusional claim that 128GB ECC memory is around 2000-4000. Even DDR5 is cheaper than that.
Lowest paying clients ask for the MOST
I'm an experienced freelance editor. I work 100% remote and this past year I've found a wide-variety of new clients -- many who found me via the internet somehow. One of these new clients booked me on a flat project fee (my preferred method... if the fee is high. It's a slippery slope, but if you play it JUST right everyone is usually happy. You knock it out of the park quickly, you feel amazing you got paid a high hourly. Project drags on and on... well at least the fee is high and maybe you charge more next time or never work with that client again). However this new client's project fee was SUPER low. I took it on thinking this would be quick and easy project and maybe just a good way to start a recurring client relationship. And now we're in that not-good place of them asking for A LOT MORE than my highest paying clients. Graphics, endless revisions, meetings, etc. I should have set more boundaries when we made the deal -- you live and you learn. Just came here to vent. The lowest paying clients will always ask for the most. High paying clients asking for more shit.... well in the words of Don Draper "that's what the money is for!"
This has been my exact experience in the 20 years that I’ve been editing with a few exceptions like doing work for friends of mine (at a bargain) that actually respect the fact that they are getting what they pay for (or better since we are friends). But yeah, aside from those few instances, every client I’ve had that is low paying expects the world, and the project always drags on and on and on and on with endless revisions. When things are slow I’ve had people ask me “why don’t you just pick up small jobs here and there? There’s gotta be some local places that need some video work done”. And I always respond saying that the time I put into those projects always outweighs what I get paid by a large margin so I’m basically losing money, especially if those projects that I commit to get in the way of better work that comes along. It sounds crazy, but when things are slow sometimes I’ll just quit working entirely and pursue other things like working on my car or house or doing an inexpensive hobby until work picks up again. Of course if things get really rough and it looks like I won’t be able to pay the bills then I’ll start picking up cheaper work even though I don’t want to.
I never do flat fee. BBBUUUTTT if I did, you'd bet that I would have a limited number of revisions. 
“No,” is a complete sentence. And we’ve all forgotten to use it with clients before. After 5 years as a freelancer, I’m starting to learn the difference between a cheap client and a respectful low-budget client. The cheap client will never be happy and always complaining about how much it costs, and it’s never worth working for them.

But I have found a few low-budget clients that are worth working with, because they respect me and my time.

But even with them, I clearly outline the scope and time requirements before I start work. I’ve been through enough situations like yours to get some form of contract for every gig, because it makes a good weapon against the cheap clients.
Usually my projects include 2 rounds of revisions in the flat fee then go to a HIGH hourly rate for changes beyond that which discourages indecision and asking for changes they aren't sure about, or not compiling all changes at once when asking for a revision.
This is why you need to set up a contract with a clear definition of your deliverables

IMO if a new client doesn't have a lot of money, then you need to be dominant with them. "Oh, this is all you can afford? Then let me explain what you can get for that" And then stick to that plan
Yup. This is 100% on you, but we’ve all made that mistake.  Now you’ve learned, and won’t make it again.  If you’re going to do flat rate jobs, you need very clearly defined terms and expectations.
It's often solo-preneurs with low budgets who are spending their own limited budget who are going to nitpick and work to get as close to exactly what they think they want.  It's a lot more impactful/personal for them when it comes out of their money that, even if coming from a business account, is basically 1 to 1 money they could personally have had for food, vacation, videogames, etc.  It's going to cost $400 more?  "I could have bought a PS5 with that money!"  

Whereas someone in a larger org just makes sure it fits inside a maximum budget alotted, and if so, they spend it.  Means very little difference to them.  It's not their money.  It's also more work for them to nitpick.
👏👏👏👏This is the edit that never ends👏👏👏👏
Cheap clients cause 80% of the headache and make up 20% of the revenue
I’ve heard the expression that you’re lowest price is someone’s highest budget

so to them and their budget they’re paying a lot so they expect a lot. 

It sucks because you want to help everyone but it’s just not worth helping people who barley have the money to afford help.  
Wait til that friend making the zero budget indie asks you to do it for free
Exactly why I always charge by the hour.
Yep. The clients with a lot of money to throw around aren't going to scoff at a high fee. The ones who need to nickel & dime are going to squeeze as much value as they can out of every penny.
Of course. On unprofessional jobs, as the the pay diminishes the amount of work increases by the inverse square.
Remember, clients are paying for your experience, not your time. 

And yes, lowest paying and even pro bono are absolutely our least efficient jobs. Our $75k+ jobs will usually get approved on the first pass. They tend to defer to us on creative and really only care about the content.
The low paying clients (usually) are paying low because that's all the money they can spend, which means they feel like they need to get the most out of their investment. If you think from their perspective they feel like they're really maxing themselves out to get this project so they are very critical with how it turns out. It's a mindset that to us doesn't make sense because we see it as low paying... but to them they're stretching themselves. 

But, sounds like you learned the lesson. Define a scope of work up front. Lay out something like 3 revision rounds etc etc.
To add to that: Every time I had a potential client ask me to come visit their facilities and meet them and tour the place, I would go. Not one time did those meetings result in work. Just a waste of my time and gas. If I could go back I would never ever go visit a potential client. Maybe they met me and thought I was a jerk, who knows.
That's the case for so many businesses/industries. 
I believe it was 4 HOUR WORK WEEK that suggested it's okay to fire problematic clients; and the customer is not always right.
The premise is that 20% of your clients bring in 80% of your revenues when you average out for time spent on their projects. 
So, firing your client is actually helping your business.
This is a great thread. Composers go through *exactly* the same issues. More and more I've leaned towards flat fee with limited number of revisions.
This is slightly topic divergent, but I think this can have bearing on how to deal with clients, whether it's the "cheap"  or the "Those that try and Cheap Out" on us. That and it's just good solid advice for those that are Freelance!

So true very true.
The people willing to pay more usually have a better idea of what they want and what's required to accomplish that.  The also realize the value of getting out of the way of the professionals they hire instead of meddling too much undermining their efforts.
"That is not within the scope of the current budget"

😀

Its hard man but just cos you did a buy out (as we sometimes call it), doesn't mean sell out !

"That's beyond reasonable scope for this type of project". Bit harsher but oh well
One hundred perfect truth
Yep. I found this out a few years ago, and it's not always about the money. The most untalented actor or singer will have the most demands and will be the hardest to work for/with. Returning to money, I even understood the logic behind the problem. The high paying customer has money and thinks that if he pays enough you know your job and what you have to do and he's not stressed about the money. The low paying customer pays so low because he actually can't afford it. Those money are all he has so he is desperate to make the most of it. I won't work with this kind anymore. I prefer to do nothing or exercise than to have a headache.
Sorry to hear your ordeal, but Freelance editing is unfortunately not a respected profession since people think it’s as easy as clicking a clips here and there to get Steven Spielberg quality. 

Plus, 90% of clients are egoistic small business owners only wanting to pay $10(or even nothing) for $100 quality work. 

I’ve been freelance for sometime and almost every inquirer ask if I can charge less than $30 for professional work, lol. 

Worst one was a musician who tried tricking me into editing his music video for free, as he always ignored my reminders to pay a depot fee for starting his project. 

He just bragged about his hundreds of YouTube subscribers whenever I asked, like saying I can just work for an achievement of working for a “big” YouTuber.

But, he eventually ghosted me since I didn’t stop asking for my fee. 😂
I’ve worked for a non-profit before and because I have experience in the media industry, my role required me to be the liaison for media vendors, such as editors. 

Unfortunately I realised very early on that my non-profit always expected so much from the editor even though we paid very little.  

The reason was because for a non-profit, that very tiny amount is actually A LOT of money for us. And when we decide to spend that money on services such as video production, we are essentially investing in something that we hope to be a huge return in value and therefore we’re overly anxious about it.

It wasn’t a good position for me because I understand how shitty it is for the editor, but I also empathised with how much that little money means to my company.

In the context of outputting a social media video for example, for a bigger paying client, this is probably just 5% of their campaign budget and is one of the many outputs they have lined up.

For the smaller companies, they’re probably stretching it to 70% of their overall campaign budget and it’s that same social media video is their main campaign item so the expectations is very different. 

This doesn’t make things any less shittier for editors such as yourself, but that experience definitely made me understand why clients can act this way.
Haha.  When I started in post 24 years ago that's exactly what my boss told me: "The less money they have, they bigger pain in the ass they are."   And it's SO true.    

When the big budgets come in, those are usually seasoned clients who have been put in charge, and things tend to go much easier.  They know what they want, what it will take, and how to budget for it.
If the project balloons on you because the client starts asking for more and more, it’s time to say, “This isn’t the project I originally agreed to. We need to start over and negotiate a new deal.” I learned this one the hard way. Also, if a client wants to bargain you down from your normal rate, you can always offer fewer services in return - fewer revisions, simpler graphics, stock instead of original, whatever. This respects your rate, so you’re not just doing everything you normally do, but for less money. (If they want to / have to pay less, they’ll get less.) Last, consider putting together a standard “bargain package” to offer low-budget clients. Defined limits to TRT, editing time, graphics and animation, and a hard deadline for delivery. Just some ideas.
I can't see how a flat rate could ever be beneficial. Please switch to day rates, charging overtime after 10 hours and double on weekends. Stop working for free.

For projects you can complete quickly, slow down and take your time, even if it doesn't actually take that long. If you work too fast, you'll be taken advantage of. Your top speed will become the expectation, and anything less may be seen as disappointing. You don't want to be working at 100% everyday.
Couldn’t agree more. Small budgets aren’t worth the time, although there are plenty of exceptions to this rule. Small projects typically come through people who have little experience hiring out video production, and a lot of the inefficiency comes from this. 

This exact idea has me thinking about a small 2nd stream of income that can be easily turned on or off in between projects. Something that has nothing to do with sitting in front of a computer.
Low flat fee = 1 round of revisions.... I always look at the experience level of the client and the back end, where the revisions hit the fan! 🤣
That's because to the client, their spend is a lot of money, so they're super high touch. Think about it on their end and you'll understand the behavior. But please realize I'm not excusing it - merely explaining it.
I recently went tbrough the exact same story as OP's, but it was the respectful type you mention. At some point I mentioned that the project has gone a bit beyond the original scope (a hyperbole) and if it's OK, I will ask for an additional amount. They not only agreed, but were so appreciative that they even added a bonus on top of that when it came time to pay 
Usually doesn’t stop them from asking for more though. But it _does_ mean you have something to point to when you decline to do it, without charging more.
I mean, that’s the old model when an agency or production company is paying you. That’s not the YouTube/Riktok model.
Funny, I just said the same thing before scrolling down. I agree. Think about where they're coming from.
I feel the same way about most meetings. 
So much of the stuff you could cover in a quick zoom call or an email.
Actually, I prefer in person meetings or anything where I could talk to them face-to-face or via telephone. I feel it’s easier to relate to people this way, plus visiting their facilities gives you a good idea of their own level of experience, expectations of quality, etc. Before a meeting, I’ve had prospective clients and colleagues take me for a tour of their facilities, and they’ve introduced me to other people working for them. Try to make a good impression and this gives you even more contacts if you want to pursue work with the prospective client.
This 100%. They are paying for your experience, not time and materials. 

Similar to a plumber who charges you $250 for something that took 15 minutes. It’s all about knowing what valve to turn.
This take is highly dependent on what market you work in. I do a lot of indies because that's what's available where I live. Most producers will only deal in flat rates. Set boundaries and stick to them. I quietly track time as if I'm being paid hourly and I have asked for overages before, although I am careful to tie it to changes in the scope of the project. On some projects I've worked slightly cheaper than I'd like, but on others I've made more than the market day rate. When I do work on a day rate, it's almost always based on a time estimate which is in practice very similar to working on a flat rate.
>I can't see how a flat rate could ever be beneficial. 

This reallllyyyy depends. 

What a flat rate ultimately does is shift complexity AND risk away from your client and on to you. Effectively, that turns you into a post producer, not an editor. 

If you don't want to handle that, certainly don't try. And it takes a lot of experience to accurately quantify the risk and read the client correctly. 

BUT it can be extremely lucrative if you know what you are doing with it. So many clients would much rather not have the complexity OR take the risk. Let's say you are doing a monthly sales video for a large client, you are a really fast cutter, have their style down pat and 11 times a year it takes you 2 days, there's essentially one revision, it goes smoothly. But about once a year their CMO decides to get involved and blows up a video and it takes you a week. 

One way to do it would be to just charge whatever time you have into it... but it essentially penalizes you for being fast, and the sales team doesn't know really how to budget that expense for the year. The other way to do it is to flat rate them at like 4x your day rate. You will be making double what you would have on 11 videos a year, and perhaps coming out a little behind on that 1 video a year, but that's why you charge what you charge on the other 11. 

This sounds like what u/DD_Editor is doing with most of their work. This was just a play that didn't work out for them. Super frustrating, but that's the deal when working with flat rates. I think their point was more that low rate clients regardless of pay type can be the most pain in the ass. Which, ya know, preach.
Whenever I give anyone a bargain rate, because I like the project or it’s a new director I’m working with I’ll make a typical estimate in full price and add a discount to make it within their budget for 3 rounds of revisions. I explain that if it goes beyond the revisions quoted I have to charge my full day rate for any additional rounds. 

One, they see that they are getting a deal and you are helping them not the other way around. Two, if they truly don’t have the money they will damn well make sure it’s locked by round three
That's great advice. I'm just now getting into editing for people other than myself. 
I'm working with a team of partners right now and they're driving me crazy with edits.
I understand that explanation just fine. But I think that the neediness has nothing to do with how much money is being spent. It’s about them wanting to feel ownership over every aspect of their lives, and needing to have power over people they hire. I’ve watched people in $250k cars complain to me about costing them “$1 a minute!” also berate a cashier over not having enough onion on their $5 fast food burger.

Counterpoint, when I bought my house I wasn’t as needy with my realtor as cheap clients are with me. I didn’t check in every hour to see whether the HOA had approved us yet. I was told it could take 5 days, and I waited for my realtor to tell me it was all good. She’s the professional, I’m paying her to worry about it so I don’t have to.
Yeah, I’ve got a few clients like that. One will give me projects with budgets as small as $100. It’s easy stuff I can turn super fast, and he knows I’m doing it between other jobs. He’s just thankful to have someone who can get it done quickly instead of fumbling through it himself. And if I ever tell him I’m too busy, it’s not an issue.

That’s why I’ve started separating them in my thinking. Low-budget means they don’t have much money. They’re willing to spend what it costs, but their reality doesn’t allow them to do that. So they spend what they can and are thankful to have professional help.

Then there’s cheap. The ones who probably could afford real rates, but want to haggle just to exert power. And then complain about everything every step of the way. And then dominate your time like giving you a rate for a day means they own you for the whole month. I don’t work with cheap clients. And the couple times I thought someone was low budget and turned out to cheap, I left the project as quickly as I could.
Exactly

It's normal for a client to ask for more. That isn't a bad thing, that's how you make a good product. Sometimes you get the perfect idea partway through the project. The problem is when they don't respect your time and effort

Good clients ask for new things all the time, they just don't complain if it costs more and/or requires a delivery extension
Like  I said, it’s probably me. But I work for an institution now doing video and I don’t have to worry about that stuff anymore.
I've had those sessions... Editing by committee never ends well. The only real one way I've ever heard of, to stop it dead in its tracks.... Find the Boss, or figure out who is in charge of this edit. Trust me, it will come down to falling in one person's lap if the project goes down the shitter.... Find that person and corner them for the answers you need to get the job done. This is a last ditch effort to get ahold of your runaway train so to speak of. Good luck and hold on tight. I've had to actually lock them in the room with me alone and everyone else outside.
Agreed about the neediness. 
It permeates their entire lives.
Well there are Karen clients too...
I've been stuck in the past with recurring work for a cheap client as my only source of income, so I know the type all too well. Not. Fun.
Yes, I understand.  When I was on staff I never had to deal directly with meeting prospective clients myself.  Only maybe sometimes after the business relationship was already established by the sales team and/or business development people.
They use Windows 7 in Apple Labs.

Look at the 45th second of this video.

Yeah imagine Apple not having Apple branded x-ray machines.
PCs set up specifically to control industrial equipment will very frequently never be changed or updated their entire life.  Frequently they’re also air-gapped too.
Interestingly enough I was at a major Microsoft office a few months back and the amount of macs they use is surprising… most of their devs and researchers use macs and not surfaces. Only the public facing staff are forced to have surfaces
That's a workstation for a specific machine running very specific code.  Since most X-Rays are done in the medical or engineering sectors (which are traditionally heavily windows), it makes sense that the proprietary software would be bundled only as .exe

Same things happens if you try to run hardcore business simulation code.  It's all from the early 00's and only runs on windows.
This is “Chinese brand” manufacturing plant or lab, they work for Apple
It’s almost as if Apple’s smart enough to use all the tools available to them.
Eye laser in clinics are powered by win xp.
Embedded machines have the worst OS support. I bet the vendor either charges $5000 to upgrade Windows, or wants you to buy a whole new machine for $50,000 to get a newer version of Windows.
I was at an on-the-job training at a company and when I used one of their computers, they were still using Windows 7 along with a 2016 version of Firefox that... somehow can't be updated.

When I secretly installed chrome, I figured out why: it's just not optimized and updated for a modern browser to run it.
I work for a company that manufactures Xray equipment, all of our equipment works on windows. We are up to Win 10, the customers decide if they want to upgrade. If it ain’t broke…
Windows 7 was a fantastic OS so makes sense
That is the result of the equipment vendor only running the software on 32-bit Windows and locking it on their equipment to Windows 7.

I've seen brand new hardware ship and get set up in clean rooms that run XP still.

As long as you keep it off the network and don't let it go online, you have a very small window for exploitation.

And that ancient OS runs equipment worth several tens of thousands of dollars.
That's why when students in Engineering especially those targeting embedded systems ask for laptops, I usually suggest Windows. You will target lots of devices for debugging. toolchains for the chips, jtag devices. You'll do it in Windows because those tools are only in Windows, or Linux but mostly Windows.
It’s a ct scanner. They always use windows (along with xray machines) because it is a well(ish) supported os that is easy to license for FDA approval (any change in software has to be reapproved, it’s easier to use a common os). 
Industry stuff is usually real old because it just works

Imagine trying to get the software sorted for windows 11
I can tell you with almost 100% certainty that they are running some software application that is no longer supported and can’t run on newer OS so they are stuck kicking the can down the road until something big happens and change is needed. This happens literally everywhere in manufacturing and it’s horrible.
This may be shocking to some people, but most engineering tools and software are made for solely for Windows. Especially when it has to do with mechanical, electrical engineering use cases. The only real places macs have in the workplaces are for creatives and in some cases, for software development.
For a long time, the entire Genius Bar diagnostic suite ran on 1 eMac under someone’s desk. The entire Genius Bar globally went offline when a cleaner accidentally unplugged it. 

In this instance, guaranteed it’s a niche industrial software package meant to run and be supported/most stabile on Win7. 

Alternatively, many MS employees use Mac 🫢
And Microsoft has all sorts of Macs being used on campus. What’s your point?
Well that’s the best windows ever or should I say the least awful windows ever.
Because since Windows 8, Microsoft being Microsoft and changed the device driver model. Again. And they changed it again on Windows 10 too!

Their drivers doesn't work so they are stuck back in Win7.

 - Basically same thing that prevents people from upgrading in macOS.
The past year i went to an Apple Store to buy my Mac Studio ( they were way cheaper than in my country). But I asked them if i could do the initial setup in the store ( iCloud setup so if i was stopped at my country customs I could say it was a working machine, and not have to pay taxes there ). 

They told me it was OK. We connected the machine to a apple monitor ( can’t remember which one ) and they gave me a couple of horrible and nearly destroyed Logitech mouse and keyboard. I sure was surprised.
Apple had an iMac with Windows 8 a while back. So Apple using bootcamp or pcs isn't surprising today. Since not all software Apple uses internally has a Macos version.
A LOT of industrial and commercial machines have specific software that hasn't been updated in decades, so they need an old PC with legacy versions of Windows to run the software.
Fun thing I worked for a company that made a test system for the iPhone for Apple, and those systems ran Windows 7, but Apple insisted and stipulated that the computer on board must be a Mac mini even though it’s running windows lmfao
Most likely some bullshit requirement for the equipment they have on hand. Some govt agencies are still running Windows XP.
probably because that machine isn't created for them nor by them but by a brand that make those for different companies.
This falls in that “Special Use” category of hardware. This is a supported configuration attached to what is likely an extremely expensive machine and it will stay that way for the next twenty years until it’s unrepairable or no longer useful.

You’d be amazed at how much of this kind of thing is out there, and this is on the way newer end of the spectrum.
I remember see someone using Xp and windows 7 for cut CNC,some people say why people using legacy windows on this ?, because they easily use with COM Port like CNC Cutting or X-ray with old hardware, the old Windows Easy compatible with COM Port driver than new windows
This is in no way notable, or even funny.
Interesting video but I wanted to see the laboratory and not her face every few seconds.
I'm pretty sure they use a bunch of linux distros too.
I work for a big four company. One of our client still uses windows 98 for internal systems. And we still maintain that shit xd
Just speaks volumes to the stability of older operating systems when bloat was not the defacto standard and was generally looked down on...
and of course what’s missing is all the Apple products at MS
Fucking legends.
It would make sense to write the software for windows. Cheaper machines and still gets the job done.
And it seems they have the same trackball as me.
I work for a medical device company. We have a laser etching machine that uses Windows XP. I thought it was weird but I guess it’s actually pretty common.
My sister works for a leading biomedicine research lab. One of their machines to test samples runs on some kind of old school analogue contraption that is powered by MS DOS. Billion dollar company and 40 year old technology.
Does the testing include making sure the phone/MacBook doesn’t work whatsoever whenever it comes touch with very little water?
[deleted]
Bro that makes me chuckle
I miss windows 7
Well, some apps are not made for macOS
Caught in 4k apple
Apple would never let a selfie cringe face clown in their office . This must be another factory inside
What did Arnold Schwarzenegger say when someone told him to upgrade to Windows 7?

I still love Vista, baby

submitted 12 years ago by /u/dastevonader
I guarantee their PCB design and simulation software runs on Windows too.
Because it doesn't need upgrades.... It just works.
greatest windows version, aesthetically and technically. if it could run valorant i would still be using it, i don’t even care about the security risks. worms > 8, 10, 11
They also mostly exclusively use Windows in the manufacturing plants that make the iPhones, this means nothing.
I believe it's vista in the picture
Meanwhile in Japan our high tech digital vending machines run XP, Win7, or 10 if you're lucky. It's absolutely hilarious to see them reboot on the train station platform
When we were doing mock exams the computer for the timer was running windows 2000
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This shows just how good windows 7 is, or used to be.
As an engineer I’d bet almost all of their test equipment uses windows. It’s not like Apple has an open OS that they can easily get working with proprietary hardware.
Windows seven was one of the most stable systems ever invented
Until last very recently Samsung used Windows 7 in their Korean home office. Only switching out of security necessity
I bet the HQ of macro hard aren’t using Macs.
"Our new MacBook Air is 2000% faster than Windows PCs"

The PCs in question:
Looks like they don't trust the new Windows...
Imagine VW uses desktops with Vista to run some fancy factory lines 😱
Lmao that’s not windows 7, that’s vista
so what’s your point? you think a trillion dollar company doesn’t know what it’s doing or doesn’t wanna spend a few hundred bucks on a new license? 

from your ridiculous comment you literally have zero clues as to why they have this setup, more hilarious is you’re there suggesting this machine is even connected to the internet lmao. they have some of the most highly controlled labs by far, each thing is calibrated and dedicated to one task, often using proprietary software and settings that aren’t supposed to be changed

the level of ignorance is strong with this one..

I work for a surgeon and our laser is controlled by a windows XP machine.
I mean, that's why they can't kill Internet Explorer. There are many companies, which rely heavily on Internet Explorer for their ancient internal software (just two days ago I was at a hospital and their entire patient data system seemed to run in IE)
I’m mostly surprised it’s not XP. I remember around 2010 I went to the bank to get some money and the computer they used to get it from the back was running either Windows 3.11 or NT 3.x
Look up what happens when someone wants to service a McLaren F1. Interesting what hardware they rely on
Not to talk about CNC and other manufacturing industries. Those machines have 30+ year lifespan and even then they are shipped into cheaper countries for 20+ more years. So it's not uncommon to see Windows 2000 or DOS based large CNC routers and lathes. OTOH the device does its job just fine, even when the OS is 30 years old.
I remember once I worked for a print shop with an ancient plotter that had a software that only ran in Windows XP and a technician will charge $300 to re-install the software if something went wrong with that machine.
Not just that industry. I work in broadcasting and the amount of windows XP/2000 or earlier PCs would surprise you because they don't want to spend money or simply can't replace it without breaking something else.
I have seen the machine still running on Windows 95!
Majority of engineering software, old and recent, are on Windows.
I worked in a semiconductor plant over Covid, and most of the tools ran on Windows 95, some on ME, some on 3.1, and some on MS DOS

(This was a plant manufacturing FaceID chips)
Airports are a text book example.
And people keep wondering why there are so many ransomware attacks against hospitals…
They're still working on it - it'll be the thinnest x-ray machine they've ever made.
Yeah, this is an appliance, not a general purpose computer. I guarantee they also have 1000s of instances of Linux running on embedded devices. And that their cloud infrastructure is not built on macOS. 
Imagine your Dr. airdropping your xrays to ya for you too look at.
Also Microsoft help Apple back in the days.
😅
What does air-gapped mean? I know what it means in plumbing but not computing.
I’ll never forget about 4 years ago I went fruit picking and the farmer we worked for had an old ass pc with a crt monitor running windows xp which he was still using.
Right. Turns out only people care about brands. Brands don't care about brands. They care about profit.
The XBOX 360 used a PowerPC architecture, coincidentally at the same time Apple was switching away from PowerPC. So while Apple was showing off the new Intel gains with the Intel Core and justifying their switch, Microsoft was buying up all the PowerMac G5’s they could get their hands on.

Just an interesting part of history.
That’s mostly because MacOS is a lot more software-developer friendly due to being Unix-like, unless you need specific programs
I’m an industrial designer, I remember my college professor who was the design manager for Google, and my mentor who worked at Google, was the manager for their wearables.

Neither of them used Google products, they used Apple.


When your OWN DESIGNERS who designed the products out on the market don’t use your products, you know they’re shit:
That's just.. sad. Last Good windows I feel was Windows 7. It was so beautiful. What happened after this
No this is not chinese OEM company. This is a screenshot from a video of a youtuber given a tour by Apple inside of their lab.
Haha if you only you were right in your assumption, this comment wouldn't be so funny.
Embedded software is what you meant.  And, embedded software doesn't have "OS support".  It has an operating system.  And you should think of it as a monolith of app + OS.  And, yes, it's not a consumer PC where you replace a GPU or upgrade the OS.  If you do, you're getting a whole new thing sometimes.

So, nothing to see here.
> a whole new machine for $50,000

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaha
Yeah, I work daily on hardware that uses Windows Embedded. Well, actually the hardware has 4 computers total, technically. Their version of WinEmbed is basically 7 sp1 with 32 bit. Because the main app needs so much memory, there’s a 130 gb partition on the 2 main computers just for a page file.
I have an M1 Mac and while it’s fairly engineering-friendly through Rosetta and Linux/Windows VMs, I always get stuck when there’s a proprietary Linux tool that requires an x86 machine… So I inevitably end up crawling back to the Intel-based machine at some point!
Our local Apple Store (one of those that’s actually a separate provider but looks and feels just like Apple - premium reseller I think is the term) still uses 2012 iMacs for their tills. They’ve not sold an Intel iMac in years at this point, and even when they were they were old models. I asked why when I bought my iPhone 15, they just said they still work and the POS software doesn’t run on apple silicon lol
Even more common for these kind of machines
Hyperbole isn’t reality.
It is not a matter of trust. Most probably these machines are in a lab and not connected to the internet. They are only using these machines because the software would not run on a newer machine.
That’s 7. Vista did not have icons in the taskbar like that.
Classic Average Redditor response lmao
chill
god damn bro take a shower
bro’s shitting the pants over random reddit post
I think they knew that and don’t connect it to internet without heavy firewall
Machines like this run on XP or older pretty frequently. You can’t really upgrade them because drivers & software aren’t compatible with newer versions.

Also it’s just not necessary, they don’t get to connect to the internet. There is no attack vector besides physical access to the machine (and then it doesn’t really matter what OS you have, if somebody has access to a computer for an extended period of time, they will probably get into it)
I love how people think some industrial machine like that is just connected to the outside internet, lol
It’s as vulnerable as any OS could be. In fact, for enterprise users, there is still officially the possibility to receive security updates under the ESU program.
It’s also possible to install those updates as home user
Atleast it’s not on vista
I work for a med device company and our laser etching machine uses XP too.
Please keep that away from any network connections.
I saw two doctors of mine use Windows XP.
Please tell me the machine has internet connectivity too? If yes could you share the public IP adress :)))?
There was a vid someone put out where just connecting to the internet on windows XP will give you viruses 💀
Because switching to something modern would cost money and they probably wont make any money by doing so
That explains why my local medical conglomerate was crippled by a ransomware attack for two weeks recently…
Hell, I noticed that when you enter Korea and do your entrance exam and scan your fingerprints, they use Internet Explorer still
yep, I used to work for EY as a student for a bit in backoffice and their whole internal database was only working in freaking internet explorer. was in 2017/2018.
Our customer facing product still requires internet explorer. We had to create an Edge Compatibility Mode Doc to our customers so that they can continue using it. It's wild.
Looking at you, Hikvision.
A bank in the UK I use still uses MS-DOS in a little virtual machine on each PC for its back end. It’s literally just a terminal into the “mainframe” shit they have - which cost a fucking bomb back in the 80’s, still works, and migrating to something newer would inevitably cause carnage. And they’d again be in the same position in 20 years time using something that in 20 years time looks just as old hat.

Ironically, because the IBM mainframe stuff is so backwards compatible, they’re probably using much newer hardware, probably from the last few years, but keeping the ancient software around on it, as it’s that that would cause the carnage. 

Every little tiny system from every ATM, cashier machine, website, banking app, all the connections to all the other institutions- everything - would need to be migrated almost instantly and simultaneously in order for carnage not to happen. They know that won’t work…
Windows is extremely stable doesnt need to be updated .
At it wasn't windows CE
Indeed it is a smart choice. 10-20-30 years old OS and apps, that had a barely acceptable speed back in the day will run like a supercar on todays hardware!
Because you open fishy links or use pirated software.
We think you'll love it.
But if you fix it or don't use apple X-ray fuel, warranty and applecare voids and it goes "kaput"
Steve Jobs reportedly refused to use a lot of medical equipment in the hospital because he hated their designs. Eventually he conceded because he was dying but that’s really the only reason

Not connected to a network. No wifi, no ethernet, no other technology network.
Others explained what it means. I’ll cover why. 

First off, ignore this comment and read the compelling story of what can happen when an air gap fails: [the most sophisticated piece of software ever written.](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-sophisticated-piece-of-software-ever-written-1/answer/John-Byrd-2)

___

Let’s say you oversee the IT department of an old, secure hospital. In the surgery wing, you have six surgical machines. Literal lives depend on these machines. They’re all powered by Windows XP, and 20 years ago these machines were cutting edge. (Pun intended.) Upgrading is expensive, you see, and very often industrial and healthcare organizations will not, under any circumstances, update the equipment even when [cyber-attacks can often kill people.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/02/two-years-later-windows-xp-devices-can-still-make-the-health-care-industry-wannacry/?sh=7b31be83f046)

So, here are your two failure states for the software:

1.	Software patches break the system. 

2.	Exploits (viruses, etc.) compromise the system.

Other people are in charge of keeping the lights on, the building cooled, and so on. Among your 999 other duties, you need the coding on these machines to *never, ever* break. 

**Enter: the simple air-gap.** Nothing in. Nothing out. No Wi-Fi connection. Touching these machines requires physically interacting with them—fucking with any of these surgical machines requires, at minimum, bypassing everyone in the building between you and that room, physically entering said room, and laying your hands directly on the machine.

No firmware patches will break it. No forced Windows updates will screw with it. No zero-day exploits or month-old clandestine viruses to shut off any functions during a surgery. Every shift, the surgeons and their teams can rely on it to function exactly as intended, with technicians replacing bits as needed.
Not connected to any network of any kind.
Isolated. Cant access data without physical  devices.
In the top security companies like RSA you get the software in dvd and an employee put the disk in your hands.
The [Stuxnet story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) is a great read and is a real world example of the lengths state actors will go to to infiltrate systems, even ones that are air gapped.
No connection to internet and/or intranet.
Yeah, the original xbox 360 dev units were Powermac G5's, and they were even using them at E3 on the xbox 360 demo kiosks https://www.anandtech.com/show/1686/5

One reason Apple was moving away from them was the thermal issues with the PowerPC chips(one reason there was never a G5 laptop), so probably not a huge surprise that the 360s were having the thermal issues
Zero of the five Google employees I know use Androids
Yeah, I was kind of going generic with the numbers. My one client had an $80,000 CNC wood cutter, running Windows XP. The vender has no upgrade path for the OS, and wants them to buy a whole new machine in order to get a new version of Windows. You can’t upgrade it yourself either, it’s locked down, and you’d need the newer, proprietary CNC software anyway.   
And what kind of software would that be?
if i see it correctly it‘s only connected to a network without internet.
“We’re all going to die!”
Wow I had forgot about Vista. Thanks for the reminder.
I think it is actually Windows Vista on the picture. The bottom bar wasn't black in Windows 7, but in Vista.
It would still run better on vista
Vista would absolutely run it better than XP
Or like… confine it in a virtual machine.
It's definitely not connected to any network and only receives occasional software updates from a representative that works for the company that made it. It's so locked down you can't access anything other than the proprietary software it uses for our procedures. I'm sure there's ways but simply trying to go to the desktop or hitting the windows button on the keyboard does nothing.
Lol to be serious, it probably doesn't.

Usually ransomware attacks on businesses don't even rely on any sophisticated software exploits etc. They are almost entirely conducted via gathering info about important targets and then socially engineering them into literally inputting their credentials and installing the ransomware themselves or doing something that grants the attacker access to just go ahead and do it.

To be clear this doesn't mean that IE isn't riddled with security holes that could be exploited: that is a given. 

But it's just that even those levels of technical sophistication are not required. By far the biggest security threat for these types of attacks is someone getting a list of your locations and their phone trees, access to your training materials etc.
You’ll be even more mortified when you find out how many critical infrastructures, banks, etc are still running on old OSes that are very risky to use in today’s cybersecurity nightmare world
I love that three different people responded with the name of a hospital system, thinking they knew which one you were talking about, and that they’re all different
Ardent?
Indiana?
Ascension St John? 🫣
Lmao. Is it DOS or perhaps something like AS/400? I know at least one major Canadian bank (TD) still uses AS/400 extensively
And it'll only cost you half the bones in your body to buy it.
X Ray Vision Pro
It will be remarkable.
Really?
Because OP’s question was  useless about Apple’s labs using Windows 7. It’s obvious that there is no company that starts with computers by their own company.
No emojis on reddit, are you from twitter or something?!
That was a great read! Thanks for that
I think air gapped can include devices on a disconnected network right?
So what you’re telling me is that if i go on eBay and drop $150 on an old G5 i can *theoretically* emulate an Xbox 360 library with little to no hitches /s
Although funnily enough 2 of the 30 or so iOS developers use android.

But then again 3 of the 10 android developers I know use iPhones, soon to be 5
Medical imaging equipment that is stationnary (eg not ultrasound) typically start at 1-3 million. 50,000 would be the annual maintenance fee with the vendor
Software for controlling their X-ray machine, for example
Maybe the kind that is in the picture?

I’ll never forget vista- was awesome. Made me give up on windows and buy my first Mac.
Nah it’s 7; the Vista start button protruded over the top of the taskbar, and 7 introduced the square icons for running apps you see here. You could customise the overall UI colour in 7, so it could easily be black.
It’s 7. Vista still has xp style collapsable system try icon like XP on the right whereas 7 changed to an arrow up button that expand the system tray. Also the collapsable application list in taskbar is 7.
Yes that's vista I never forgot the horror...
It’s 7
*would absolutely not
It was definitely DOS. This would be in 2019. Went into branch to sort out my savings accounts, as the rates blah blah, so sit down meeting in the little office rooms. Long story short, the lady needed to move funds from one account to a new one. Everything she used to set up the new account etc was basically a web app in a browser. But it refused to transfer the funds. 

She sighed, and said “the old way of doing things it is then”. She jumped to the desktop, clicked an icon, up popped a window and booted ms-dos 6.0!!!! She did some keyboard-fu and logged into the same system in text format. More keyboard-fu and the funds were transferred. She said she’d been with the bank since 1995, and the only difference is the stuff in a browser looks better- but it’s essentially just the same thing talking to the same back end - it just breaks sometimes but the old terminal route always works. It just doesn’t look as slick! There were a few IBM logos thrown in there for good measure lol. 

All the hardware is much newer, but the software behind it still works. Still in use in banks all over the world from when it was first set up. I doubt any one institution dare move away from what they’ve got currently. 

The guys that wrote that code probably retired or died years ago. Even the guys who were apprentices back then are probably in their 50-60s by now. The reality is, there’s probably no one who really remembers exactly how the deep level stuff works to get it all to move over to something newer - just reinstall it on new hardware - which IBM are amazing at maintaining compatibility with.
A lot of companies still use AS/400 for their financial departments. It is disconcerting when you see it.
AS/400 is the underbelly of so many things people have no idea about. IIRC some COBOL programmers make a decent living supporting these systems.

One of my buddies has the actual dev unit machine(he's not a Mac collector, but he his a video game dev kit collector), been wanting to get him to bring it over to mess with it and see how well it actually works
And they’re probably running Windows XP and being a danger to the network.
Never seen this sub, thanks!
Actually, it was also the exact same thing for me. My last Windows PC was with Vista.
Good catch
Nope
Would absofuckinglutely
You’re basing that on no research or testing or observation. Vista is streets ahead of XP. I have experienced it for a decade in the industry.

Edit : Your downvotes show how silly you are
Lmaoooo. That’s awesome!!
What a life!! The toilet looks ugly I m gonna hold the sht and get a prettier one.
i know its windows 7, but windows 7 is vista lol i mean they are basically the same system like windows 8 and 8.1

I purchased a "spares and repairs" 16" i9 for £300
I purchased this MacBook Pro 16″ 2019 2.4Ghz i9 1TB 32GB RAM 8GB Graphics listed as faulty "spares and repairs" for £300.

Great cosmetic condition but it wouldn't boot. 

Reset SMC failed. 
Reset PRAM failed. 
Boot into recovery mode failed. 
Boot from external drive failed. 
Internet recovery failed. 
Firmware revive failed.
Firmware restore success!
Internet recovery success!
Update to Sonoma success!

It works without issue now. I'm elated with the result, all it took was a bit of time to do some problem solving with the software. This is my first experience with a T2 mac so I was unaware that restoring the firmware was even a thing. I suspect that the mac crashed during an OS update and it messed it up and whoever had it before me didn't know about restoring the firmware either. 

It's not a M chip but it's the most powerful Mac I've ever owned. The speakers are a real treat.
Surprised the computer didn't have iCloud Lock. Great find without the lock!
Ol mate Cashies!
Come on down to cashies mate where you can find your dreams…
Nice one man! I have the same model but 16GB RAM and I love it.
Enjoy that heat 

These i9s ran damn hot
This? https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213662 so you used another mac?
Decent Job Pal 👌
I’ll give you £350 for it! 😁
Score! Thats an awesome MacBook. Don’t listen to the haters. Just because Apple silicon exists doesn’t mean that those 2019 Macs are not awesome computers. They were the highest rated/reviewed laptops until 2020. These people who complain about the heat and the fans must never have used a high end windows gaming/workstation laptop ever before. The MacBook is cooler, faster, and have less fan noise than the majority of those laptops. Congrats!
I recently bought an android phone off eBay titled “corrupt os” and the description said it booted fine. I turned it on, check for updates, after the first one the boot message went away. Easy flip lol
Nice find OP! That model & config had a retail price of ~$3,500 in its prime - ask me how I know! 😆
I had a similar experience about 6 years ago when I bought a spares & repair Mac Mini 2014 for about £150 to use as a Plex server.   It would just display a ? on the bootloader which I assume led them to believe it was faulty.   Now as someone who knows my way around Macs reasonably well,  it was relatively simple to resolve in much the same way you did.
Cashies
Beautiful! Such a sweet deal! I’m happy for you! Enjoy!
It sounds like you bought the exact same system I have (cept mine is 2tb). Now I wanna cry cause I paid almost 4k for this...
Do some video editing on it, the keyboard heats up to unbearable temperatures in no time.

Sell it and get an M1 Pro, you’ll be shocked at the difference.
Wow. Pretty good deal!
Nice find!
Brilliant! That’s a great fine for you and a very good price. Enjoy.
It says “noot working” not “not working” so maybe there’s an issue. Either way congrats on your new computer.
Damn bro I'd love to have one of these for 300$. Hell of a find.
I’m sorry that you wasted your money on that. I’m feeling generous and will buy it off of you for 300 you paid.
Not a problem.
It will die, like all of them. Voltage regulator will pop the soldered SSD.
I wish I could find an offer like that here and be able to fix it. Looks like you found a great bargain
This is great, for a 5 year old machine, it isn’t bad. You were lucky though. It must have worked at a point in time when they checked it for trade. But you’re lucky that t wasn’t a hardware issue.
Did you do anything to fix it or was someone too lazy to see if it was working?
Holy shit 32GB and 1TB🤯
I had the exact same experience with a Mac mini! Tech must not have bench tested it further than plugging power in hitting the button and listing it as scrap when the power light didn’t come on. Turns out, only the power light doesn’t work. Everything else was fine
I bought an iBook on eBay marked as non functional. Turns out the hdd was formatted with a non-APM format
Deal of the year for you, these laptops are still pushing $1,200-1,500 where I live

you have around 5-6 more years of life in it, and when its time to upgrade whatever apple has out then will (and already is) be way faster than m1
Amazing! Stories like this are underrated
How exactly did you manage to flash firmware?
How were you able to restore the firmware? Using apple configurator?
Awesome find!! I was lucky to pick up a 15" i9 with 16gb ram and 512 tb ssd for £50 from a Facebook seller who initially wanted £250. The touchbar firmware failed and it stopped booting. It only took a few hours to get it up and running and now it runs like a dream.
I have the same one at home and it works at the same level as my M2 PRO. It is better than the air M1 and M1 PRO, it is universal and will last for a long time. The touch bar is better than buttons and is easily customizable.
Wow, you really took a risk on that. I’m glad it worked out, but you way overpaid for a dead machine.
What a crime using sonoma on this old ass MacBook
sell it now. this is a horrible computer unfortunately even compared to a air m1
What’s with everyone posting serial numbers?
(cries about you getting M1)
damn I need to visit some pawn shops
£300 for spares and repairs, not so good.  £300 for that Mac, great!  Congrats on the find!
How do you do a firmware update? Curious to know as I have an MBP with same symptoms!
What's the GPU?
Amazing! Such a good deal at the end for you!
Great find! I still use this model as my primary, only difference is it has 64gb ram. It’s been a workhorse for me. I’d love to get an M3, but hard to justify while this one is still getting the job done, running multiple docker containers, databases, a few vms, phpstorm and more chrome tabs than is healthy.
Solid machine! It just runs super hot, so get used to that
What a steal
Wow good job
It should have a dgpu? Is it showing up?
Not a bad price for that. You can actually make money by trading it in with Apple in the US at least.
Great cosmetic condition ? I can see a dent and a nick in this picture.
Damm I was hoping it was locked, I need a screen for my 16” i9 really badly (horizontal lines when tilting)
DO THE NUGGET DIP
Wild how quickly the price dropped. I have this almost same spec from a few years ago and it was..a lot more. I still use it and enjoy it because it dual boots
Is £300 a good deal? The second hand m1s aren’t that much more expensive, are they?
Thats honestly a steal
it’s a great machine and good deal with that price 👍🏻 but it’s super loud and hot though 😗
I got rid of my working MB Pro 16 2019, i7, 32GB, with external graphics at the beginning of 22, it got terribly hot and was impossible to use without charging, it sat down in 2-3 hours. I switched to Pro 13 M1 16, I’m very pleased with its performance and battery life, it copes well with tasks in Figma
If you need windows support keep it, maybe repaste it with some top quality thermal goop (since you seem savvy enough) to lower thermals a bit.

If you just need MacOS sell it asap and buy an M series, Intel Macs are losing value very fast
Great find! And unlike the Ms you can actually game on them. The gaming landscape on Apple silicon is pitiful
Nice one, even if you can't upgrade to latest OS, you'd still be able to dual boot to Windows/Linux. It's a solid machine.
Enjoy it, I had the same model before moving to M2 Max. It’s a great machine. Disable turbo boost and put custom fan rules if you want it to run cold
CASHIES!!!
Persistence pays off! Good deal!
*32/1TB?!?* I faint in your general direction
Cashies
Nice…nice
I’ll be jealous only if it has 5600M graphics…
A cashies special
Congratz! :D
Cashieeeees
Hell yeah! I got a £90 Logitech steering wheel for £7 at Cash Converters. It was so cheap because the wheel was upside down. All I had to do was force it past its rotational limit and it snapped back into the correct orientation!
My only worry on the 2016-2019’s are the keyboards that break. Everyone I know that had one, has the keyboards break… they went back to the old design that was bulletproof but that was in 2020? Or 2021. I can’t remember when they switched.
Such a good deal. congrats!
Dope💯
Deal of the century holy shit
Touch bar looks cool, i wish my mbp had one
Bet it works for a day then dies on you
I have one of these and boy is it a hot, loud, glitchy mess. Firmware fan control was horrible. Just honestly a bad design, I wouldn’t have paid $300 for it.
I love the Intel 16in. All the benefits of modern mbp (mic, keyboard, and I think that's it, soo I guess not a lot) without the drawback of the butterfly keyboard. Plus the upgrades, so quite a high end model too. Also, which dGPU does it have?
Computer would make a great aluminium club to use as a home protection device
Congratulations. You’re going to love it.
It's quite risky because most of these laptops are activation locked. For 2018+ machines I'm never offering more than what I can sell the LCD for (if it's OK) if I don't know activation lock/MDM status.
I’ve purchased MacBooks from CashConverters before and trust me, they are NO GOOD, EVER
I think it was unlocked because it came from a pawn shop that wouldn't have taken it in if it was locked. It had a "data wiped" sticker on it too so I presume it was working at some point for them and then it was 'bricked' whilst in their possession and they decided to list it cheaply to recoup some of the cost.
Can’t you override it by just wiping the hard drive out?
Some guy who likes old iPods should review this

r/unexpecteddankpods
They’ve got wares and chairs…
I've not thrown anything challenging at it yet but I'm looking forward to seeing how it performs
It's still winter here so I could do with the warmth. Maybe I'll sell it and buy an M chip when summer comes around
yeah, he should throw it out now /s
I had to try hard with maxing out with yes > /dev/null. Created a massive amount of these and waited a long time to finally see minor throttling.
Hot garbage
Don’t waste money on heating. Just switch to your dedicated GPU
I have the i7 right now and it definitely gets toasty.
Yeah that's the procedure I followed. I did need another mac to do it but it wasn't difficult.
Thanks! I'm just pleased that it was only a software issue. I'm no technician and I don't think I would have gone to the effort of opening up and investigating any hardware faults. 

It was still covered by the return policy of the store so I figured if I was unable to get it running I could get my money back, so no risk really.
The ones with the dedicated gpu most definitely do have an issue and they do throttle when an external monitor is plugged in. When I unplug it the throttling stops and power usage goes up and laptop becomes fast again. My windows gaming laptop works fine with the same monitor but can’t bring myself to work on windows and I’m too tight to upgrade.
Great result! I'm shocked that the previous owner seemingly didn't bother troubleshooting the issue at all. I don't want to know how much tech has been scrapped for reasons like that.
How do you know????
I didn't do anything most people wouldn't be able to do. No use of tools, just lots of Google searches and following guides. However, the procedure that seemed to fix it did require another mac.
That is brilliant! Doesn't really get much better than that!
Yeah, that's right. I followed this guide

[https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-configurator-mac/apdebea5be51/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/apple-configurator-mac/apdebea5be51/mac)
Yeah, I'm confused how one could claim that 300 quid for a dead intel mac in any shape approaches a good deal.
The device is still covered by the store's return policy so I could return it for a full refund if it wasn't a simple software fault. The assistant I spoke to said that as long as I didn't take it apart I could return it. 

So that mitigated a lot of the risk in this case. I wouldn't have purchased it if I didn't have the option of a refund. If it was a hardware-related fault it wouldn't have been worth it.
OOoooooooOOOOooO I’m gonna check your warrantyyyyy
What is the problem?
Hi - Have a look at this article:  [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213662](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213662).  I had success with a 13" 2019 MBP which had similar issues.  Love it and typing from it now
> It's not a M chip but it's the most powerful Mac I've ever owned. The speakers are a real treat.

It's £300 for a 4yo MBP 16" Core i9 32GB 1TB. You can easily flip it for 2-3x that.
If it wouldn’t boot, they couldn’t check.
Your description of the fix sounds a LOT like Rocky from Hail Mary. Gave me a smile Iykyk

All the cashies near me price their stuff really high 😢
Did you find any others? I look often in Cashies, but never have any success, or I am genuinely afraid to “pull the trigger” there is a pawn shop near me, with a 2019 iMac. It has been on the shelf for months now and I am desperate but not for $795.
Our local one has just had a refit, halved the floor space of the shop front. They don’t take the garage sale stuff any more, they’re only interested in computers, phones, valuables. They don’t have the space for the “cheap junk” any more. 

Which is a shame.
Sell it now, while it’s still working.
oh just shut up….its just some fan noise…im tired of people reacting like its a jackhammer next to you
Superb, great job mate! Enjoy your new-to-you MacBook pro!! It's a great machine. The only thing I don't like about that model is the SSD chips location near the air intake, making them prone to anything that gets sucked by the fans to stick to them making a short that can fey your board. I will suggest, if you have the skills, cover them with uv glue, at least the bottom part of it.

I do t know why apple didn't cover them with an aluminum case as they did to the 15" model. 

Who knows...

Cheers!
If they are a parts seller I’m sure you can get 300 quid for it. Hell the 16” LCD would get you almost that much just by itself.
Ew yo cheap ass aint got applecare
Why would anyone spend 600 to 900 GBP for this mac that is 4 years old when they could get literally any newer model of mac for about the same price?
Not true, you can check it through the Web (via serial number)
This is weird. Because every time I wipe my drive to install an OS I never get the iCloud check I use to get on iPhone.
You could get a m1 Macbook for that price used/refurbished...
And while it still have some value. The prices on those Intel Macs are dropping hard and when the next OS releases and drops support for Intel CPUs, it'll completely crater.
I know it’s throttling because it tells you dumbass, the fan noise isn’t the problem. It’s reducing the processor to 800MHz that makes it slow.
High risk, given that you have no way of confirming that the LCD even works. Especially given that they are pretty prone to failure.
There are many users that want Intel chips in their Macs.

There aren't any MBP 16" with Apple Silicon selling for £600-900.

It's cold in the winter... they want a cheap heater.
Intel macs still make very good windows laptops. There are videos of Tesla engineers using them for work on Windows.
M1 aren‘t good at emulating X86. They suck to be precise. So if someone wants to virtualise X86 VMs this thing could come in handy. Especially with that amount of RAM and number of cores. 

In fact I‘m thinking about getting a used Thinkpad to do just that. No need for a Mac. A nice and clean Linux distribution like LMDE will do.
Intel Macs make great windows machine, it got great battery life, better trackpad than anything you could get in a windows machine, fantastic display and speakers.
16in, 32GB of RAM and 1TB SSD doesn't come cheap.

Not sure the Apple Silicon have dropped down on price so much second hand. If they have, well I will totally grab one for 600 GBP even with major cosmetic damages.
I don't get it as well but this actually seems to be what they go for. I think that people who buy them for these prices are stupid but good for OP if he wants to sell.
The newer one they'd get for the same price would have 8GB RAM and a 13" display. This computer has 32GB RAM and discrete video RAM. For the right person, this is a much more capable computer than the lowest-end M-series machines.
Ah okay, that’s good to know
It has to be a new enough Mac. 2018 or newer I believe
[deleted]
Maybe not brand new, but this is more than second hand, so why should a newer model mac that someone wants cheap also not be second hand?

For anyone wanting to use virtual machines, it's a lot easier/cheaper using INTEL versions.
A windows laptop would always be more powerful an cheaper than a mac with windows though.. 

And no offence to Tesla engineers but it's not much of a statement to brag about it with.
Again with the track pad thing. They're pretty much all the same. 

Mac users saying "Windows machine" like there isn't literally a hundred different relevant brands on the market at any given time that have higher ratings and reviews than any given mac model is a troubling common theme, troubling because it's just not a factual statement. I know for sure not one person yet has presented any actual evidence for that statement either...

Out of the tech in a mac, iPhone or iPad except maybe the M2 chips currently (solely in an iPad form factor, there is nothing that exists outside of windows based laptops in any way shape or form.
On 2014. This explain that.
This. I actually want an Intel Mac just because of dual boot
Yeah, I waited too long so I'll wait longer and try to catch the bell curve on the upswing. lol
Invest in r/intelmac now
But there are so many of them

13" model... not 16"

There are many users who prefer Intel because they want to Bootcamp to Windows.

Neither of us are in the position to dictate to Intel users what they should or should not buy.
It's not always about raw power or cost. You need to consider the build quality too. Anyone who used a macbook won't be able to go back to using Windows laptop trackpad or keyboards, those absolutly suck in comparison.
Dumb response
I would agree with you if you ask me 2 years ago, when I was still daily driving a windows laptop

Every single one I’ve touched from a cheap laptop to a enterprise grade laptop, has a trackpad that either is too small or doesn’t feel good enough, now laptop manufacturers have catch on making their plastic trackpad as close as possible to what Apple is doing, but it’s still plastic,

You’re saying it’s the same, I doubt you tried enough laptops to be making that statement, because I haven’t touched that many laptop and I can say they’re not the same.
By the way, any fair deal like less than $300 for 2015 15inch screen? Is that possible?
Bought a 2020 i9 iMac last year specifically for Bootcamp.

Love it!
I mean, I am. 


When an intel laptop that already comes with windows always comes cheaper in every way than a mac with intel so they can... use windows..


That's.. wow.
Because some security systems don't supports to arm architecture 😞 and don't works right with VM network devices ( I have experienced with artnet hi possibilities lisance protection ). M series laptops are not faster not stable and don't supports (maybe just in short time) industrial 3d visual programs...
They vary brand to brand, sure, but there is zero chance mac is objectively better in any instance of being a computer.

An there is no way that a keyboard and track pad should be the reason to spend several hundred more in any given instance.

I guess this is why Mac subs are not frequently on the front page. It is just like people say it is.
Coming from a mac user, that's a compliment.

No brand new mac is cheaper or more powerful than a windows laptop. Objective fact.
Yeah, on Ebay you can get lucky with your parameters
Yeah, I used to have rEFIt on my 2012 MacBook and installed Ubuntu on it too. That MacBook finally broke last year so I had to get a PC. Might have to look into making a Hackintosh lol
I wish I did not buy my 2019 MBP 16" Core i7 14nm.

Wish I stuck to my 2011 MBP 13" Core i7 22nm and bought into a 2021 MBP 16" M1 Pro 5nm.

Will replace that with a 2031 MBP 16" M11 Pro 0.7nm
I didn't say they were objectively better but people often don't buy things purely because they are objectively better but subjective feel is often just as important. You asked why would somone want a 4 year old intel Mac? Well becuase they percive it to be subjectively better expirience and that isn't some unpopular opinion. There's a reason why used mac hold their value so well, there is a thriving market for them. Compare what OP got to another windows laptop you can buy for £300 and see if that will be objectively better too
>there is no way that a keyboard and track pad should be the reason to spend several hundred more in any given instance.

Yeah sure. The thing that you have to physically interact with anytime you have to use the computer is not a reason to pay more.    


Never mind that there are mice that cost over $100. The MX Master 3 is pretty common, and frequently costs more than $100. Likewise decent keyboards can run 100-250 depending on what you want. Sure, you can buy a cheaper mouse and keyboard, but they usually suck and if your spending hours daily on computer you probably want something that is comfortable and provides features you want.

If the computer is being used for work (and we're talking about a "Pro" laptop) spending 8-10 hours, even more, a day on it wouldn't be unusual. It's easily worth it to spend a few hundred extra for the comfort they provide.
Hopefully at that point, they’re in picometers…
A built in keyboard and trackpad is not remotely the same as a full keyboard and mouse though.
Reddit admins changed my username and now won’t respond
My account isn’t bnned or shadowbnned. My username was forcefully changed from /u/NikonUSA to my current username (which has an asterisk in it, rendering my profile unusable). I have made multiple Reddit support tickets ranging from 8 months ago and haven’t gotten any sort of response. Reddit is ignoring my case and I cannot properly use Reddit or enjoy the normal experience because of their decision to steal my username from me. My username was then given to Nikon (camera company). Issue persists on web, iOS anything
As OP's problem has been [resolved by admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ex1j1w/reddit_admins_changed_my_username_and_now_wont/lj45yc2/) and new comments coming in are either not helpful, derailing, or otherwise break our rules, this post is locked.
/u/redbull made a post a while back about getting a message about his username was going to be taken. Was some months ago, but seems he’s still kicking. No idea how they just did it to you if they didn’t to him.

Btw, NSFW warning. Visit their profile and you’ll see some wicked nice jewels.

Edit:
[Found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/s/safEMXPDBK)
We helpers cannot revert the changes to your username, we just give ideas and recommendations on what you can do.

  
In this case, there is nothing you can do.

  
If you have the same name as a company, and a company wants it - they will get it. Getting ignored by reddit is Reddit's choice, not ours.
You do know any business with a Trademark will protect it aggressively.  I've only known Nikon as the Camera company.  I know of no other name using Nikon.  Which means anyone that knows cameras thinks of Nikon and it's synonymous with Cameras.  So this can't possibly come as a surprise.  It's not like you bought the Nikon URL domain name and they can't do anything about it.  Reddit is not going to battle a Trademark infringement on any users behalf, lol.

Do you work for Canon?
Hmm what is the purpose of them adding the asterisk, I wonder?
If you selected a well known company for your username and the company then comes and asks for it.....you're likely going to lose it like you did. Same thing happened with the redbull guy. Not sure what other recourse you have unfortunately
You had the name NikonUSA and didn't think Nikon would want it at some point?  One of the biggest and most well known camera companies? Wild.
Im confused. I went to look at the profile and it looks like the company has post and comment history that is several years old,
Hey, there! I asked around about this. Four years ago, Nikon filed a legal trademark claim for that username. You were contacted when Reddit received that claim and since there was not a response, the claim went through at that time. 

Unfortunately, you are unable to reclaim NikonUSA as a username as you requested when you replied to the initial message seven months ago. I'm sorry about that. However, we are able to update your account to a new username that is not currently in use. You have been sent a message on Reddit and replying to that message with the username that you wish to use will get that process started. 

Hope this helps clear things up a bit!
OP posted this comment in a prior Help post:

“A request was made a few years back while I wasn’t logged into the app to change my profile picture. As I wasn’t logged in I didn’t see the request and couldn’t change the profile picture. Instead of just removing the profile picture, my username was changed and the profile picture was unchanged. This is extremely unfair and should have never happened. The profile picture should have been changed to default instead of my username being changed for no reason.”

Reddit gave you an opportunity to keep your username, but you didn’t act on it. C’est dommage. 

What did you use as your profile picture, anyway?
You won’t get it back, what did you think would happen 😹
This sub is not being paid by reddit and has no power to change anything 

We are just a bunch of people with time and the good will to help, **when it's possible**.

There is nothing to do when you use famous brands or artist's names.

They can demand to have it's u
NikonUSA is trademarked as it’s owned by Nikon themselves and is the direct link to their website. You will not get that username back as it would be illegal for you to present yourself using and would be seen as impersonation of the company. 

Reddit’s lawyers absolutely are not going to allow them as a company to be sued by Nikon because they’re allowing a random user to present themselves with a trademarked name on their site.
you might just have to delete this account and make a new one with a different username
Can you change the temporary username?  It seems they gave you a random username with the asterisk to indicate they forced a name change.
I suspect your username has been set due to a policy hold of some kind.  A little bit of research on Google suggests that this happens when accounts are forcefully renamed for Impersonation.  Your best bet at this point, is to simply let it go.  Accounts have been permanently suspended for this...
This might just be the biggest first world problem ever.
You know that Nikon could very well have sued you for brand impersonation, right? Nikon is a VERY well known company that has been around for over a century. If all that happened is Reddit forcing a username change on you, you got off light and should pat yourself on the back.

That being said, I do agree that Reddit should assist you in getting you a new username, without the asterisk, so you can get back to posting again.
I think the account from which you have made this post is shadowbanned. I can't able to view your profile.
But did you die?
[deleted]
I made a previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/s/HBGs5sBgo3) but nothing is being done about my situation
NikonUSA already exists and I'm pretty sure it's trademarked.
That's not right. If Nikon was late to create a reddit account, that's on them . Get a better social department.  
 

So if I go out and create a company with a username that I want, reddit will steal it from someone else and give it to me .that's stupid. 

It should be like a website . If you want the name bad enough, you should have to pay .
That's interesting... didn't know usernames could be that way
Somehow I'm not surprised. It's one thing to take the username but then to make your account not function correctly? That's ridiculous and they should fix that. And you shouldn't need to message anyone to do it either.
Odd they'd add a special character to a username when that renders the account unusable.

Afraid idk how to help. Reddit makes it pretty much impossible for users to change their usernames.

It seems to be be a copyright issue. You might need a lawyer to talk to the Reddit team.
If they want it so bad, they should be forced to buy it.
That's kinda messed up. Copyright, trademark or not, usernames are supposed to be first-come, first-serve. Nikon should be forced to buy it from you.

Bad Reddit.
[deleted]
Why does a company automatically get the right to a social media name, no questions asked? They should be forced to pay for it, at the least. A company with any name can pop up at any time and be successful enough to warrant a social media account take over. There needs to be a monetary compensation, period.
Keep on submitting support tickets via https://www.reddit.com/report - you’re bound to get a response eventually, imo.
Nikon most certainly offered an incentive for this to happen. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. 

Fear not, for this is a failure in the making.

Alright, here's what you do. 
Send a hateful, vulgar message telling the admins exactly what you think of them. 
Get banned. Make a new account. Get banned again. Buy a vpn, stop using the app, change ip, make a new account. Bam. Good to go.
I clicked on the it said Mike like cause of volcanoes and other question that I will click the again if need be.  Seemed like it was the company was saying he did this he’ll answer these questions he went here.  Because that’s what the posts u/nikkonusa say.  If was you not the company why wasn’t it I can answer these questions.  Or he will explain the Nikon z 7111.  Nice try but fact are facts but your claims are not facts.
That’s not fair. If Nikon wanted the username they should have to talk to you about that not Reddit just saying “get f**ked”
reddit can steal karma from the Hindus but that's just a stupid religion. you can't do stuff like that to a big corporation!
[deleted]
It's weird, but you shouldn't have had the account to begin with, because Reddit normally doesn't recycle usernames and that name was allready used by Nikon in Mid 2020.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20201029160534/https://www.reddit.com/user/NikonUSA/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201029160534/https://www.reddit.com/user/NikonUSA/)
Yo that’s kinda cool at least
You're missing an opportunity to really bone them.  You're not getting the name back but it doesn't stop you from going with Nikon and being satirical with it.

Make it a joke/insult against Nikon.  Hurt their brand image... Which to be honest they don't really have one as they're not industry leaders yet they're not bottom of the barrel so good luck.
The warnings always get me curious, but the curiosity always turns into regrets :(
That’s the oldest account I’ve seen, so cool.
Hi, I see you are a Reddit helper. I need help r e my username. Today and fo rthe last 2 months or so I have Old Lady Kick Butt. One night i posted as Enjoyweights70-- you can find it- with 20,xxx karma credit- the next morning my profile changed to this old one. I spent over 45 minutes trying to sign in on old name & password - it would not work.

How can I have the old profile/name/karma/reputation back?
Companies have to aggressively protect their trademarks or they risk losing them. That said, trademarks also only protect from similar types of products/businesses. You could use the name Nikon for a business/product as long as it was in a completely different industry and didn’t overlap with anything Nikon has registered their trademark for. You might still get a letter from Nikon’s lawyers because they want to make sure their trademark is safe.
haha its not even just the name Nikon its the fact that he put USA. Lil dude probably thought he would sell the username when Nikon came begging and he would earn his first million like that...
No
Makes the profile null and void or allows the user to create another name.
That’s the real question here lol
+1
Same thing happened with the Instagram guy, he had his username changed and was very upset about it
I didn’t copy a well known company. They also didn’t inform me that it would be changed or anything like that
 Probably thought they would pay him for it.
That’s when it was taken
Hi u/TheOpusCroakus \- I am concerned that the user states that their profile is unusable - would that mean that they're also unable to access their messages?  I've tried looking at their profile, and it appears in the same way you would see a shadowbanned account.
Don’t think so, can’t even get to my profile. I also want my original username back
Not only could Nikon have sued the user, they could have sued Reddit as well from trademark violations.
Hi, I’ve been over this with many other people. My account isn’t shadowbanned, the issue is there is an asterisk in my username now (which is not allowed) which makes my profile unable to view
I had the username almost 7 years ago
Assuming your company was around longer than the Reddit account and was fairly well known, they don’t want you impersonating or being mistaken for the company. Why would someone choose u/NikonUSA? The USA makes it even worse as that is a common addition used by companies to separate their U.S. and EU or Canadian, etc…operations. I could understand if it was their name but at this point they should just force OP to pick a new name.
That's very cute. This has happened dozens of time before on a multitude of platforms and in real life. Legal challenges were made in some cases and except for some edge cases, the trademark owner wins every time. Companies are allowed the use of their trademark. Anyways, creating an account on reddit gives you no right over it. They can do whatever they want with it. An admin could take it from you and give it to their friend and they don't even owe you an explanation. It's in the TOS.  

Also, whatever you post can be used by reddit for basically anything, forever and you can't sue them. They could take a post from someone who wrote an idea for a movie and sell it for millions to a movie studio and they don't owe you a penny.
I don't get u/kiwihuman even though I use that name on every other site, own the kiwihuman.uk domain name and have @kiwihuman on YouTube. Why should nikkon get any better treatment than the rest of us.
No. People shouldn't be allowed to build their own brands off of other peoples brands.
There probably was, to Reddit. You agree to certain terms when you sign up and this is probably covered by those terms
3 so far with no response
Yeah, most certainly, they emailed the official reddit email from their official nikon email and offered a bribe. Obviously. Or maybe, Reddit wants a 10billion dollar company to use their site with their official username. It's 100% obvious that OP here purposely took NikonUSA to impersonate the camera company as that is the exact domain of their website.
I think it’s just that you can’t access my profile
Ok?
Then make a separate post and don't hijack someone else's. That's poor reddiquette.
Its not a bug. Its a username that legally belongs to Nikon
This was impossible to read
That's not how it works with trademarked company names
Admins don't respond to modmail here. Please don't direct people to r/help modmail for anything other than r/help moderation questions.
I was the original owner of the account. Nikon shouldn’t have the username because it was recycled and given to them. You are viewing it after it was given to Nikon
Are you saying that you no longer want to use OldLadyKickButt and would prefer to use Enjoyweights70?

Enjoyweights70 is a separate account, so if you go to sign into Enjoyweights70 and click "forgot password", it should send a password reset email to the email account you used to sign up for that specific account.
No one here is a Reddit Admin. You need to contact Reddit admins. https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/p/redditor_help_center


If ur trolling then keep on keeping on 👍
You'll need to log out of this account and log back into the other account. If you don't remember the password, you'll need to have a password reset sent to the email on the account.
" I didn't copy a well known company."  
Well I hate to break the news to you - but you did in fact use the name of a very well known company.
Nikon is, in fact, a well-known company.
Unfortunately you signed T&Cs which let Reddit do this and almost anything else it wants to in relation to your account. Reddit's playground, Reddit's rules.
> I didn’t copy a well known company. 

What did you intend the username to mean?

Were you unaware of Nikon USA's existence?  They've used the Web address *nikonusa.com* since 1996 and the Twitter handle *NikonUSA* since 2010.
If you selected NikonUSA as your username then it was a poor choice. Are you saying you didn't select that name?
Company is even named in a Paul Simon song, "Kodachrome". The song is also pretty well known, most people could sing bits of it.
Nikon is not a well-known company? Lol
How old are you? Everyone has heard of Nikon, have you heard of Kodak, Olympus, Polorid?
Its exactly this. That's why he's still fighting it 7 yrs later lol
OP's had an easy time replying to comments, I don't think their inbox  is having any trouble.
I don’t foresee you getting it back. Nikon is a well known camera brand and you’re a regular joe. Best bet is to request the name be changed to something you’d be happy with [and doesn’t use the name of  a well known company or personality.]
~~You can try to modmail help.~~ And I don't think you'll regain access to your old username so I suggest you to request some other nice username from admins if possible.

Edit: looks like reddit won't care for ordinary users. Sorry mate.
Then just delete this account and make a new Reddit?
So your user name is an American writer name . Say that American writer wants to use your name for their profile and reddit changes your name . I think that's a problem. 
 
I really think it should be on a first come basis . 🤔
Because they probably pay for it.
money, because they have money to fight with and a longstanding reputation that means their good will has social value in circles that deal in money.
Wrong. Reddit could get sued if they use trademarked names without authorization.

JUST. DON'T. USE. TRADEMARKS.
Hey genius. Those terms aren’t enforceable. At all.
Just cut your losses and make a new account, you're only digging yourself deeper in this hunt to get your original username back, it won't happen.
Likely no money was given. Reddit likely would be liable if they allowed trademarked names to be used without authorization, so they would have to give it up if a cease-and-desist letter came from Nikon.
Are you shadow banned?  Have you tried filling out the form on www.reddit.com/appeals ?
I have no idea what you’re talking about lol… I made a comment so he can go back to this post by going through my profile since he can’t go through his
Ok I went to the post from 2020 because a doubtful redditor posted the link to the 2020 account.  Why is it w I want to those the post he can answer all those questions.  They say he can explain the Nikon z 711.  If it was truly your account wouldn’t you say I can answer these question.  If I’m claiming to be representing myself I don’t comment he thinks thinks the this or he likes that.  What impossible to understand are your claims that this is your account.  Because it’s not nice try
That capture is from 2020. Are you saying that your username was changed four years ago? I’m just trying to understand a bit more. NikonUSA has been active for more than four years and the Wayback machine here shows they haven’t changed their username in that time. This is strange.
thank you.
I selected the name without the intention of impersonating or copying any company. Once I found out it was somewhat related (it’s not like I had /u/nikon ) I made sure to put in my bio that I am not affiliated with Nikon. Funny how Nikon username is still taken by someone but mine has been forcefully removed and changed
Not sure who that is but I’m gen Z if that helps
Eh yeah it is
I only recognize kodak and polorid 🤣 and just barely

That's nice but this is a trademark. Don't use trademarked names.
Is the guy going to sue reddit over it probably not, but if he did would the tos automatically make him lose, who knows but I'd want a front row seat in that court room
They are enforceable when a company with an established trademarked name and high priced lawyers come knocking at your door.
Not shadowbanned but I messaged support 3 times in the last 8 months
I can’t tell if you’re high or not but you’re still not making sense. I have explained like 20 times that I made this account 7 years ago with the username /u/NikonUSA . I provided a ton of proof in the last thread that I did have that username. It was forcefully taken from me in June of 2020
The kicker is that OP already had the chance to change their username. From what I understand in instances this happens, reddit offers the user a chance to change their username to something they want if reddit is taking theirs. OP missed that chance and there's nothing they can do about it anymore.
Yeah basically. This is a 6-7 year old account. I posted a lot of proof in the old thread which I linked in this post that I did make /u/NikonUSA
But you also put USA behind it. That’s typically also how companies name accounts for regions. Like next time make a random fake user name and not the name of a company lmao.
Ha! I find your lack of awareness to be rather amusing. You may not have intended to impersonate Nikon, seriously, who do you think owns NikonUSA.com? Or MieleUSA.com?
In this case intentions do not matter. The company owns the name.
They might own that one too for all we know, but yours is the one they wanted for representation.
It's time you learn about a little business law and intellectual property rights. You chose the name of a very well-known camera company with USA after it to make it appear as if it were Nikons official US branch. This could be defamatory depending on what you do. You will not be getting that name back because Reddit owed a Legal obligation to Nikon, they more than likely received a Cease and Desist letter from Nikon, reddits legal department then determined that the cheapest and most effective route was to forcibly change your name to free up the name "NikonUSA" for the US branch to claim that name. Reddit holds no legal obligation to change your name back or really do anything at all.
I hate to break it to you. Being young doesn’t mean nothing existed until you did. Nikon has been a well known company for over a century. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon
Why did you call yourself Nikon then?
Paul Simon of Simon and Garfunkel and also a solo artist

This is the song

https://youtu.be/8rlDTK6QI-w?si=DuIzPj8Roj-4WxRc

It's been in a few movies, including the Coneheads

Overall it is a very well known camera brand name present in poular culture as well as stores and shops (naturally) and I'm curious as to why you selected it
That has never been helpful to anyone, if that helps.
He's stated he wants the username back and that's not going to happen. He needs to just cut his losses and create a new account.
The comment you’re responding to is responding to OPs comment stating [they want their original username back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/s/o2UzSFn7BL)
Someone's account was forcefully taken by reddit without giving proper explanation. Atleast they need to tell him who he need to contact instead of blindly telling won't contact here.
Sorry, Reddit admins are too busy counting their money to help users.
I would if I was having OPs problem? Y’all need to go touch grass if deleting or losing a social media account has any impact on you whatsoever.
So, when you go to that link, does it allow you to fill out the form?
You say you’re Gen z. How old are you?
Right, if it was NikonTheMoon, I don’t think it would have mattered.
That would be very messed up
Probably hoping Nikon would buy it from him
Ha, didn't know the song title but kinda recognise the song
They didn’t take his account though. They simply changed his username to a separate name and his posts and history remained intact.
We all know the proper explanation.
If it has no impact then go do it and prove your point

It's a very well known brand name. Companies have been blocking people from using their name for any reason for ages.
Not really that messed up. You picked a dumb name that also happens to be a brands name (I personally don't belive you did it by accident) so they claimed it. This happens all the time across most social media platforms.
Just boiler plate naming rights stuff
That is super weird....
Nice try about what? What do you think I was trying? 😂.

What? Sir, that was my first comment on this post entirely
No I assume I sound stupid every time I speak
"Boilerplate" is somewhere between placeholder and default, it doesn't mean typical or ubiquitous
I couldn't find this wallpaper, can anyone find it? 
It looks neat. Searched with Google lens, no luck! 
For 50$ a year, MKBHD can probably hook you up.

Maybe this guy knows : https://basicappleguy.com/?offset=1709909834822&tag=Wallpaper

Try stretching and rotating the image so that it fits full screen, that makes it way easier for google lens. Got some good results:

[something like this](https://images.app.goo.gl/1bGc2fmntJ6QF5rp6)

[or this:](https://images.app.goo.gl/wQp5UxXLfCWGm4So6)
It turns out it's AI generated, look closely at the icons

Edit: I was wrong, it's probably just artifacts introduced by the iPhone software
Bruh i came here to ask about the wallpaper. And then I read the title 😂.
You can find it here in the MKBHD video:

Here you go. It was a fun experiment to try to recreate this wallpaper. Not 100% similar but close enough :)

I fed it into ChatGPT and it generated this.
Maybe here. There are some similar. [https://www.freepik.es/imagen-ia-premium/resumen-ondas-3d-fondo\_140959060.htm](https://www.freepik.es/imagen-ia-premium/resumen-ondas-3d-fondo_140959060.htm)
Looks like ai generated tbh
Which monitor is this. I need that
I have the basic version

Hi what is the Dell monitor name
https://images.app.goo.gl/FHt3tR27MSwtjDAW8 
Here you go this looks fairly similar
Anyone know what monitor riser that is? It looks slick, especially with the shelves.

Or please suggest any that you might think are better!
That looks like "Big Sur Graphic" under dynamic wall papers.
What monitor is this?
it looks like made by AI

This is the closest i could ai generate locally, hope it helps!!
It’s an Ai image so maybe just try to make your own with prompts
Very nice setup 👍
I need that desk?

Sorry, not OP related question.
What apps/websites do you use for getting new wallpapers for laptops and phones? Free/freemium ideally
Thanks
Not the topic, but, beautiful setup
This feels AI Generated
Like the clock
Forget the wallpaper; what keyboard is that?!
Oooh maybe this can be the next Reddit person number 6 thing
It feels relaxing. You feel like you are stranded in a snowstorm, tucked into a snuggly sleeping bag, while there is a cabin with a chimney off in the distance, smoke coming out of it. You somehow make it to the cabin and find an old lady welcoming you with a tray of gingerbread cookies. I like it.
I think you have two options, pay for the app or learn to use comfy.ui
Anyone know what desk this is? (If it’s real)
What’s the desk?
Can someone tell me what resolution (or aspect ratio) you want this to be in? I'm trying something but need dimensions; [Typical\_River127](https://www.reddit.com/user/Typical_River127/)?
You could try using this 
 https://rev-wallpaper-engine.github.io/
That setup is clean af
Looks like a screenshot of a screensaver.

To everyone suspecting the image is AI-generated:  I don't see anything that would indicate that it is and there are many realistic details that AI wouldn't get right.  There are at least five light sources (including the monitor) and AI wouldn't handle that many so well.  There are other images of the same setup on the website including from different angles and in different light.  Since it's an image used for marketing, it's probably Photoshopped to some degree.

The easiest way to find out about the wallpaper would be to contact the company that makes the iPhone stand and ask.
Does anyone know what monitor it is?
Don't want to hijack but I'm also interested in the dock. Anyone has an idea?
What is that phone stand? The anker one?
Hmmmm the Samsung S23/4 ultra box in the corner and an iPhone in standby mode I wonder what OP uses...
now I wanna have a video of this moving for my screen saver .\_.
i want to know whats that monitor, that thing is gorgeous
It’s ALL AI generated guys. Look at the icons on screen, for example.
Not exactly it, but similar….

This was one of the wallpapers in the MacBook rotation for everytime you restart

Any kid on photoshop can do this.
Honestly, you didn't need the /s haha
thank u markass, very cool
there's recently a guy who literally shared a whole google drive link with all MKBHD wallpapers...
Beat me to it

Good idea, thank you. I'm starting to suspect it's all AI generated.

The wallpaper looks like it's coming from this designer, but I couldn't find it in his collection.

That'll be $50 please
You are a Gigga Chad!
It's kinda weird, the folders look pre-catalina, but the finder looks post-big sur.. Maybe they changed the icons tho
Not necessarily. Try taking a picture with an iPhone with text that is too far away. It uses “AI” automatically to fill in the blanks of what it thinks should be there and is often wrong, but it is good enough to look normal without zooming in.
Still looks AI to me, the airpods are supposed to be airpods Pro 2, but do not have the speaker holes on the bottom, and the MBP does not have an apple logo, now that could also have something over the apple logo, but if you look, there is a dark area where the logo would be, but its just a dark smudge, when everything else around it seems to be well defined. mouse and KB look weird as well, but the keyboard does look like it has the correct amount of keys, where they should be though.

Also the monitor looks like it should have a desk light on it at the top, but it also looks like its sort of something that is clamping down on it, but the monitor should be mounted by the vesa mount.

The riser looks like a grovemade one, but they do not have the support in the middle like that is under the stand.

enough of this looks close enough to real but coupled with the icons and text being all messed, up, I'm going with AI generated.
Its not AI generated, there's sometimes an artifacting problem with the ~~sensor~~ image post-processing on the iPhone camera trying to computationally sharpen text.
We're in this together 😅
Wow you broke my 400 day streak of not getting rick rolled
Lovely

Horrible recreation
What did you tell to GPT. I mean the prompt

Thank you, that looks great
Balolo or Grovemade by the looks of it. At least, both companies have similar solutions.
It was posted on Facebook several times randomly.

I used "4K Wallpapers" on Android, they have a generous free tier
haha it's cool. check the comments we already found the dock.
Prob is belkin

But is it though?
Maybe its a tech reviewer's office?

Got a link by any chance please?
This guy also created a simple script (Python or js) to download all of them https://github.com/nadimkobeissi/mkbsd

The readme explains how the backed server of mkbhd's app is just open to the public, so you can get all the wallpapers without using the $50 app....
beat meat to it
MKBHD probably should have.
The real MVP
Got any high resolution links to these? Thanks.
lmao this will never get old for me
Google lens is the giga chad here
it's probably the DSP over sharpening because of text in the scene and not much more

I lightened the image and there is an apple logo. the AirPods does not have speaker holes, which leads me to think that it may be just a prop. how ever everything seemed heavily edited and blurry so just my 3 cents
It’s most likely AI upscaled
Sensors sense, it’s the iPhone screwing the image.
Oh I see. Anyway, here's the closest artworks I could find

https://www.etsy.com/in-en/shop/CadioDesign?ref=shop-header-name&listing_id=1298018354&from_page=listing#items

I made a screenshot, removed icons and corrected perspective in photoshop, then made img2img generation in Stablediffusion, using on top of it controlnet + ipadapter to have exactly shape and colors from source. and then made a 2 step upscale also in Stablediffusion via ultimate SD upscaler.

Same screen saver too! 🤣
I AGREE. lol, I really want the original if anyone finds it.
Whait til you see the bing attempt

I cropped and cleaned up the image first, then I asked "Can you create a similar higher resolution wallpaper of this image?" and then "doesn't look as good. Can you keep the design the same?" and finally "close, but less waves, more smooth transitions and gradients, so it looks more 3 dimensional like the original"
Does George know my monitor? Her name is Sally. They’re both Dell’s, so they may be related?
And Lennie?

God damn there’s a sub now? I’ve had people send me NOVELS about themselves when I say I’m against the s. I don’t care that you’ve self diagnosed yourself with everything. I’m not ruining a joke by reminding everyone over and over that it’s a joke.

It literally says Athens on iPhone screen, so there is high chance that the mac is using greek alphabet, that’s why it looks “weird”

It could be one of the older AirPods Pro models that didn’t have speaker grills?
Thanks for the correction!

can't believe you actually found it again 😂 I opened it and check it out last time and quit immediately because I just don't like the wallpapers, even Walli have more better looking one
Challenge accepted
But the first gen AirPods Pro’s didn’t have the metal lanyard hole on the side
We both watched the same Bugs Bunny episode (damn, we’re old), but do you know the literary reference? :-)

Yup! Of Mice and Men
What is with the new logo?
On mobile browser I’m getting this terribly ugly new 3D looking logo. Is this the new face of Reddit? 
Like with all things familiar, we should give this new change some time before we rush to any judgments.

&#x200B;

^(I fucking hate this thing so much)
Yeah, it's not good. And the font change is bad, too. The 'd's especially are annoying to look at with their little divet in the character's bottom right hole.

None of these updates feel meaningfully better or wanted, it feels like an excuse to justify the existence of some C level exec desperate to pad work history until they pull their golden parachute. Which fucker is getting a shiny gold star for forcing these horrendous updates?
Reddit is doing database maintenance and an apparent overhaul of some things. That is likely one of them as the logo for help has also changed to that.
Yep it’s the new face of Reddit. Enjoy.
New logo looks very stupid. Feels like it was made by AI.
Unfortunately yes, makes the website look like a family friendly Cocomelon sorta place but we know really what it is...
I like the simpler classic logo of Reddit. This one feels too modern and AI-fied.
Can I disable it somehow? It's genuinely so ugly and id prefer a blank space
I swear if this results in crappy-looking 3D avatars in the future...
Snoo now looks like a 40-year-old drunkard with a perpetual 5-o'clock shadow.
I hate it too
Reddit is now the first company ever to undersimplify their logo
they did snoo dirty
I wiped my screen thinking the black shit was some dirt
many sub icons were changed....
Interesting how they added shading and highlights.  It's like the reverse of the simplified logo trend we've been seeing with Pringles and other brands.
THIS IS THE WORST LOGO CHANGING EVER
That new "logo" basically breaks every design rule in existence. They had an extremely established and recognisable logo.
Why on earth did they change it? Makes absolutely zero sense.
I honestly think it looks bad.
it looks like shit
Reminds me of the logo from r/redditmoment.
It’s so fucking bad lmao

Also give me back my normal browser holy crap, I’ve been on the new one for over a week and it drains my battery like crazy
The logo sucks and the loading animation drives me crazy. Caan I turn it off somehow?
bring back the old logo :/
This is definitely better than the previous flat design logo
i love the new logo, old one was soulless! the slow return to tasteful skeuomorphism is wonderful
I don't hate it but I also don't like it. Tho the "d" is nice, it incorporates the bubble speech but ermm I prefer the old logo.
Does anyone else think it looks like the red teletubby?
i think they're making reddit more modern
I hate the Snoo icon altogether and just wish they used an R.
Reddit won't let men comment. Let's see if I can here.
Reddit's new logo is even more absurd than the 1st.
OMG! This Q is still open!
Bro the new Reddit logo is so bad
hes trying his best :(
It’s better than oversimplification
Reclclit
Christ even the new logo looks Chinese
Once again, this demostrates 3 things about most companies:

a. Companies don't actually care about their users and fun, cool things. They, like drones, run market studies on what is more soullessly profitable and move towards it.

b. A big tech (like google, that did this 2 months ago) does something and companies mindlessly move towards it/copy it to earn more money.

c. Both.

Sad.
Hate the new Reddit logo? Me too.

Upvote if you want the old one back.

👇
I adore it and want to pinch it's little cheeks.
This is f@%_king s;)t!
Don't know but no comments will load at all.  If Reddit wanted to lose me as a user, they found a way.  Not much use for Reddit if I can't read comments...
Image? Screenshot? What 3D ugly logo?
wtf
Its crashing the comment section on mobile
Too cutesy
If you're talking about the app icon, then idk. I have mine set to look like the dog, so I haven't seen it. Except the icon of r/Help. I've definitely seen that. And I wanna take an ice cream scooper and scoop out my eyes.
I don't dislike the new font, but I'm definitely not a fan of the Snoo. It looks... unexpressive? Like it came out of a shovelware game?
Reddit rebranding
I like it actually. It’s more grownup and it’s fresher.
what is with fucking companies redesigning their fucking logo to absolute shit, don't change something that has nothing wrong with it. this 3d logo looks ugly as that new bald pringle logo
Je préfère les nouveaux logos des marques d'auto à cette merde bâclée.
Lol at this thread.

Yes, it's an updated version of a logo. Yes, people will complain because they can't deal with change. Yes, they'll get used to it and yes they'll complain the next time the logo gets redesigned.
On a desktop computer, I now see a bigger, bolder, harder-to-ignore splotch of red in my peripheral field of view all the time.

Thanks a lot, reddit; some additional distraction is so much appreciated.
The new logo background makes it look like Reddit is supposed to be an instant messaging app now.
at least its not oversimplified like 99.9% of bacteria logos
New reddit Logo:  🤖 🔫 You will be dead!
Old Reddit Logo: 🤖 😃 You are pretty!
UNDERSIMPLIFY.
A lot of these rebrands are highly co-ordinated by business people. Can we make the text bigger, the finished logo is probably nothing like what the designers present initially.
I'm used to hating on oversimplified logos so much that now that I see an overcomplicated logo, I'm confused
Reddit has fallen, millions must cry
It's a try not to cringe challenge.
Some people said that it feels cold and corporate... This is the opposite? If anything, flat logos were the corporate standard in the last few years, this is pretty surprising. Wondering if we'll see a return of things like Frutiger Aero and so on.
I love the new logo, but Reddit would've been much better if they prioritize their core principles instead of changing the logo tbh
It’s cute, and very snooish
It’s very cute, I really like it.

Plus it’s still the Snoo at least so, can’t say I dislike it. I really like 3D
Tbh, I like it like the new Android logo
I'd rather have anything over the boring minimalist flat design everything has nowadays
I don't fkn care about the logo or the fonts or the Snoo or whatever... The worst is this after 29/11/23 UI/UX. I could see and augment the photo/gif/video size in a sub just by licking in "▶️ ➕" or "📄➕ symbols without needing to enter in the user post. Now you automatically enter the in post to see it. 😤
Tbh I sorta like it
I'm not updating my app till they change it back to the old logo. What a horrendous redesign
it's also in laptop. seeing 3d snoo is cool but i don't like the new logo
TOO UGLY !!! BOYCOTT THIS UGLY LOGO !!!
Cela devrait rafrachir l'identité visuelle du site.
It's very stupid. It should made with AI.
It looks like some animation from a kids youtube video.
Do they look ugly or what? I don't understand why he changes logo?
Idk, I kind of like that they went against the minimalism and oversimplification approach and gave us a logo with actual detail.
I usually love when large companies change their logo, especially when they switch to cleaner, flatter designs. The typography is definitely an improvement, but I'm really not a fan of the 3D rendered Snoo and the lack of whitespace around it.

Edit: So apparently they did make a flat version for their rebranding intro video, and it looks so much better lol:

[https://imgur.com/a/q5okdqx](https://imgur.com/a/q5okdqx) from [https://youtu.be/ovRiNLw0H9A?si=s0xozmuAWJYpL0Oc&t=7](https://youtu.be/ovRiNLw0H9A?si=s0xozmuAWJYpL0Oc&t=7)
some things have to remain untouched
Lol
I think it's cute, I'm tired of minimalist logos.
this is fucking horrible
ikr the new logo fucking sucks the speach bubble makes it look even more stupid
I don't really like it. The 3D logo is too early 2000s when everyone was doing it. I thought that fad died.
It's vile.
Can we change it back to the old icon?
I was not ready to look at the reddit app and see that gremlin with piercing eyes
Imagine discord do the same thing
Similar to what they did in Snapchat bitmojis.. Not everything 3D is beautiful, some things should stay 2D
I just got it it looks horrid
I want to like it, but it really doesn't fit in with the other app icons- I like that we're starting to move away from the minimalistic designs, but I'm not a huge fan of how it turned out

It's kinda ugly lol
I’m not giving it time. I use this app to ask semi personal questions. Sometimes I guess they are basic but that logo is creepy. App deleted. I’ll just ask Google lol  not that it’s better hopefully they don’t send me back before they change it again 😓
I think this is just a temporary icon/logo for Reddit recap. Just like the pixelated one recently when people lost their minds as always.
Im really going to miss the old logo
Nahh bro for me, it looks like it's gonna kill me💀💀💀
I feel there is about a 4% chance that they made the logo worse intentionally so more people would buy Reddit premium or whatever it’s called to change the app icon back, because that’s how bad it is
It's so horrible.
It looks like a grinning meth addict
I'm sad because I really like the new logo haha. It's kinda cute, I like the little wink it does when you open the app.
I thought it was the Christmas logo for a second. The shadow on Snoo's chin looks like a beard from a distance.
Agree
adding since no one has, there is a comment icon in all of the negative space of the d's in reddit, and even on this r/help there is a comment icon in the p as well
[deleted]
They should make an option where you can choose the logo for your app
I'm confused as to why they decided it needed stubble
Unpopular opinion: I actually like the new reddit logo. It's just a fun little alien.
I like it
I fucking hate this icon it gives me uncanny valley style instant revulsion
It looks like someone with a five o'clock shadow desperately trying to appear happy
I don’t think it’s ugly, I think he just looks soulless
Why everybody complains over a logo
It doesn’t look good. I like the simple two color version better. Now he has a beard and why attract attention to the antenna?
Although the typeface is markedly improved. I love the typeface and see where they were going with the desire for dimension but still looks like a beard.
Of Course I Love The New Logo These Old Logo Look Like A Goober Aileen
I hate it so much. 

For other reasons than most probably. I chew tobacco and regularly get a strand on my phone. The attenna part looks like a little strand and I catch myself tryna blow my screen off. It's just very triggering
it looks evil with the red eyes
I guess pay for alien blue logo since it hasn't changed yet?
I usually don't mind when they change the logo but I prefer simpler designs, so the shift to 3d is ehh. But what mostly irks me with this one is... all I see is Reddit's logo with a 5 o'clock shadow
So let me get this straight. When logos get oversimplified people are mad. When they get more complex with shading and stuff people are still mad. Like cmon
it's not ugly
I like this 3D logo better than the flat out, sorry not sorry.
Why won’t companies stop making their logo so damn ugly
Am i the only one that didn't hate the new logo? I kinda like it tbh
yeah i saw it and its weird
I think the design is great! It's nice to see companies finally do something other than the bland, flat logos we see for most corporations today.
I actually like this new logo. I can respect their bold move for not going for simplification but rather make it look more realistic. It is quite a nice logo.
It looks like it's gonna eat my soul
I'm late getting to this discussion by 2 months! But I googled the question and it brought me to this page, so I assume other people will end up here as well with the same question.

I'll tell you EXACTLY why I hate the new logo and the fact that it is 3D. It's a really simple reason.

So, Pentagram is the graphic design company that did the rebrand. When you get a brief, you're supposed to look at the company, its function or product and then abbreviate that into a corporate image.. logo, colours, text, font etc.

When I think of Reddit, I think of "text" only. It's a page where people come to read and comment. It's not filled with emojis, animated images, memes (unless you're on the meme subreddit, even then, they are links to them, they're not all displayed on one ugly page)

You get my point. Simplicity. Even just looking at the page as a whole right now. The most complicated thing on it, the thing my eyes are drawn to, instead of where the information actually is - the logo. It's brash, obtrusive and anything with gradients is impossible to place onto a background without it not looking centered (yes, I did graphic design some 20 years ago. But trying to get everything to look right in both Internet Explorer and Netscape put me into the system under psychiatric care)

Text. This is a text based site. Information. Discussion. Rhetoric.

It's not YouTube or Imgur or Insta or Deviant... it's not a visual site.
And this is just the beginning! We have lots more design changes to look forward to. Honestly, can we really complain? I mean, they gave Snoo his body back, AND opposable thumbs!

How appropriate that Reddit is in business with a company called Pentagram.
Ok I've given it time, and it looks stupid.
TBH I like the new 3D interface but they should take some care to get rid of the chat bubble and make the reddit head actual 3D rather than like in the 1990s era.
I actually like it, but it will take some getting used to. It's a cute new logo
if you go to old reddit, you have the old 2d logo
The holes in the d’s are chat bubbles, which feels like a real stretch vs something elegant like the arrow in FedEx that I’m sure the designer was thinking about.
Get them this: 🤬 you Reddit, bring 🔙 the old one!!!!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Is that why you can't look at your own or other profile to see posts and comments right now?
>the logo for help has also changed to that.

Are you talking about the little reddit guy with a mask?

I thought subs got to choose their own logos?
Enjoy your shit looking at this shit.
Yes, yes, YES! I AGREE!!!!!
It's poor design in many ways. Probably a bunch of old investors voting for this crap.
Seriously, who at Pentagram gave it the ok pass and didn't refine the design further? The 3D Snoo on the logo looks horrible with that chat bubble behind it. Just remove the chat bubble FFS! And that font. Oh, don't get even me started with that weird dip in the letter "d." It looks awful when displayed in a small size. The font only works when it's displayed in large sizes. If they wanted that warm and friendly vibe there are other ways to do that without pandering to modern design trends.
A free AI.
True
You people are just throwing the word AI too much probably without knowing what an AI is, and no, it doesn’t look like AI at all.
It looks like teletubie.
Stop crapmelon
Yeah this one of those things where complicating logos was worse than the simplified line.
Correct 100%
Does seem like it was made by AI
UBlock Origin (lol), and block element. On a computer at least
You can change site style with stylish addon.
It'll be just like Snapchat... and Snapchats 3D avatars we're just awful.
lol, can't unsee it now :D

I guess whoever did the bad job creating it was approved by someone who put the approval without second thought. Both are highly unqualified for their position.

Honestly, if this was paid job, I would return it back and ask for reputation damage compensation instead.

Or better - bring back the old logo instead.
perhaps [old reddit](https://old.reddit.com) has a good logo
People always complain about everything becoming minimalistic. Now, people are complaining about this. I'm indifferent.
There's also [Android's new logo](https://blog.google/products/android/modern-look/). Everyone might move to this soon.
Yes... Unfortunate, even font is ducking b.s.
Awfully
Congratulations! You have entered a new era of logo design where everything is now slowly moving towards 3d or gradients.
Yea
IT IS
Yup
Yup
No, You Can't!

Use: old.reddit.com
Old logo Better Than New Logo
No, the previous one (STOP THE HATE!!!!!!)
This isn't skeumorphism. This is neumorphism, a sort of mutant inbetween. Neumorphism has a very airy style.

I don't know if we will ever return to skeumorphism within a suitable timeframe.
Skeuomorphism makes no sense when the digital 2D product has become the norm. Skeuomorphism is inherently a transitional design strategy, to help users adapt to a new paradigm.

User is used to the material calculator. You make a digital, 2D touchscreen calculator. You make it look like the old material calculator so that the users have a few landmarks to help them navigate the new thing. Once they're used to the digital calculator, they don't need the landmarks anymore, especially with the newer generations of users who have never used the material calculator. Transition complete. If the paradigm changes again (VR calculator? Neuralink calculator?), then the skeuomorphism becomes about emulating the digital version, not the now absolutely ancient and completely outdated material version.
it's skeuomorphic of a guy with a five o'clock shadow.
youtube shorts kid? naww

edit: just laughed after I saw "f you" right when I booted up my PC
No, stop
its "This is fucking shit!"
If Reddit removed comments, that'll just be them self-destructing. It's 100% just a bug.
too disgusting grossgrossgrossgross
It's more childish.
Non
Lol thank you, just thought/said the exact same thing.
It looks like a horror movie kids' toy.
gross
gross
https://www.redditinc.com/blog/evolving-the-reddit-brand-a-more-accessible-bespoke-typography-new-conversation-bubbles-and-colors-and-a-new-snoo-logo-now-with-opposable-thumbs
It looks like one of those soulless murderous kids toys you see in horror movies. Killer dolls.
But actually it looks quite funky
They already have that option, you just gotta pay
like most things on reddit
[removed]
In a lot of cases I would agree but cmon Reddit is known for their old logo
Yes it is
No, flat better
This is probably the most thought through comment I have seen in two months of getting comments on this post
Ok, that image of Snoo is actually super cute
Pentagram is a great design agency, but they really shouldn't be helping with the Reddit rebrand (of all things) because they leave a cold corporate feeling on some of their rebrands. This one in particular.
Snoo lost its body?
Reddit had tried to push the idea that there are many Snoo, who do have bodies, in their own planet. A Snoo civilization.
It looks really good, and the new font is so good I wish I could steal it and use on my own website.
It kinda looks creepy to me for some reason
it's just terrible
I see it now that I turned my head. I get what they were going for, but it feels shoved in. Visually it's just annoying noticing the little message chat tail as the hole dip.
It makes it look very cartoony if you don't notice the bubbles.
Why don't logos have this subtle but cool thing that sets it apart form other logos anymore? The FedEx arrow is a smart decision, it's subtle yet obvious if you know what I mean.

I really don't like logos that force something into the logo, like making the 'd' have a chat bubble, which is obvious but also 'intrusive' to the logo.
Ohhhh shit, they ARE chat bubbles lol
  
Here my dumb-ass was wondering why they'd put apostrophes in their D's..
Are you a.. *five year old*? Sorry to tell you but literally nobody uses emojis like this... (also your other comments..)
Yes. That is why.  There is a new official post at the top of the feed saying they are aware and investigating.
Yeah, that guy.  They do, but help is an official subreddit so Reddit makes the design choices.
Dont remove
Natasha Jen is the designer and Pentagram is an independent agency. However, from Reddit's side, they've gotten new people on the Reddit team since 2017. That's when the initial redesign happened and they attracted a larger more mainstream audience. It's quoted by someone at Reddit in that article.
> Just remove the chat bubble FFS!

That won't work very well given that the mascot itself is white and they want to opt out of having to use outline strokes.

>Oh, don't get even me started with that weird dip in the letter "d." It looks awful when displayed in a small size.

Good thing that it's only present in the display weights and not in the weights that are intended to be used for body text then.

> If they wanted that warm and friendly vibe there are other ways to do that without pandering to modern design trends.

They should've brought you on as consultant. You seem to have a good eye for these kinds of things.
Yup
Everyone, to Old Reddit Station! Now departing.
Classic Millennials, only caring about themselves and not the next Gen
after flat logo, we'll be moving to 3D logo
In fairness to Android, they actually do have a history of 3D android collectables, so the change is kind of on-brand. With that said, it does feel like this is a broader trend with players like Discord and Patreon also doing something similar. It's sad, because while people like to rag on minimalistic logos, they have the big advantage that it's hard to make them look bad (unlike Reddit's new logo).
Yeah, it just looks ugly.
Webflow made a [demo of neumorphism.](https://neumorphism-day-and-night.webflow.io/)
yes that is why i said tasteful skeuomorphism
VR, AR, and more “immersive” digital products are also starting to become more mainstream, so i think it’ll be interesting to see how design trends evolve to keep a third dimension in mind more
f you
Tickle it's little tum tum?
N o
Significantly more childish.
Just looks like a Pixar character.
oh really? man that sucks
So people don't really care which has more personallity, they just care about whatever they were used to
Oh, thanks!

Well, that's just my opinion anyway. Partly from a graphic design perspective but mainly just using my eyes and being an actual user of Reddit.

Simplicity is key in most scenarios when it comes to design and functionality.   


Even Karma was a fun idea initially, but it's not something to build upon into an ecosystem. All these badges and medals etc. Are they adding to the quality of conversation at all ?  


Surely, the most important question anybody creative has to continually ask themselves while building or designing or coding or woodworking or \*anything\* is - *is this necessary?*  


Having all these individual customisable avatars, seems like someone on the design team got bored one weekend and decided to code an additional 5 layers of pointlessness into the site.

Plus, Reddit is unique!Sure, its kinda the spiritual successor to Slashdot and Digg. But it stands alone and successfully as a tex

t based information site.

It simply doesn't need to copy or base it's design on any other comparable or competitive site.

As-is (as-was?) was just fine!

A while back, I learned of [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com). I've switched to that I can't believe how much better it was. I hope it will always remain an option.
I lowkey don't understand the hatred. The font in the original logo looks like a smoothed/evened out *edit, word* comic sans, and honestly the 3D "snoo" is pretty cute. 

It's a nice rebrand, I don't really get the hate. Sure, the details in the counter of the "D" won't really be visible at small sizes, but we haven't seen the rebrand in action yet and how it will be handled overall.
I disagree, I think it looks ugly. But the most important thing is that its also not really needed. There are so many things reddit *should* be working on right now, like dealing with bots and account sellers, and making the tools to help mods like they said they would but still haven't. That should be the priority. 

But they did this instead.
Cold and corporate apply more to the old logo... The new one is immensely more active and friendly. Reddit just grew up a little with this update.
From the article: Pentagram is "the venerated design studio behind branding projects for Mastercard, DC Comics, and many others."
Reddit had tried to push the idea that there are many Snoo, who do have bodies, in their own planet. A Snoo civilization.
They took it away on the first redesign
b1tch, go away
Oh wow, you can't see anything in individual subreddits now. Posts don't load for any page except the home page, and even then it is glitchy.
Its still not working, but they claimed it was resolved so they've stopped looking.
? I don’t understand either of your comments.
>That won't work very well given that the mascot itself is white and they want to opt out of having to use outline strokes.

Easy, just make it a circle.... like it was before. The chat bubble behind the snoo is awful, contrived and entirely unnecessary. I dont mind them too much in the reddit lettering...

but when I see snoo's decapitated head in a chat bubble on my tab, I want to close it immediately,
I'm still on that station until they demolish it and maybe finally I can touch grass
Some of us never left!
First, let's put our logo under a hydraulic press and then let's inflate it.
Ewwwww
Ig
As far as I'm concerned, it's purely a matter of taste. Yes, this is well done. I just prefer flat design and don't like logos that look like toys or balloons.
Disgusting
No it's ugly
I don't know what you guys are talking about with the font. The only different one I've seen is a bolder version of the original. Where can I see this smoothed-out but still bastardized comic sans?
i can tell you from my experience as a designer: redesigns always get hate. always. 

remember when insta revealed its new logo around 2015? all the hatred. take a look at their old design now…
snoo looks like a socialmedialoving baba grill(💅) now
It's cool to hate, I guess.

I was away from Reddit for a while, so the logo did seem strange to me, but I quickly adapted and I kinda like it.
In fact, I love that they didn't take the popular minimal route like most brands have.
I agree. Things must change and modernise.
I'd argue this wasn't a priority either, they outsourced the work to an outside agency.
Just out of curiosity, what is the problem with account sellers?
If that's the case Cocomelon animation is captivating, friendly, and humanistic.

&#x200B;

Really tho this rebrand REALLY does look like Cocomelonified Reddit.
You can't convince me this guy wasn't paid to say that. Holy fuck.
more like kid-friendly. looks like its one of those kids social media app things

i wouldnt mind if they removed the shading and smaller details tho
Alright how much did they pay you
Yes, the Snoo has always been an alien.
Yeah, a five year old
Yeah, I know.  I am having issues as well.
Because its TERRRRRIBBBLE
I'm into that. imagine a company like apple, Starbucks, Wendy's, or even KFC doing that 3d rendition of their logos.
Lol.
Late to the convo, but this. It's just not my style, I like the 2d better.
Yeah I don't disagree, that's just a matter of preference. I'd prefer both be used, 3D logos are going to date themselves if they're the only option.

But I don't hate the font, the colors haven't changed at all, this feels like when people freaked out about the Google rebrand, even though it ended up being really nice and streamlined for all of their services and products.
yeah I mentioned the Google logo in another comment somewhere. The Google brand has been seamless in its integration.
I looked up what a baba grill is and now I regret it.
I thought it's a robot
>the colors haven't changed at all

YET. They're changing the entire color scheme. See the article in my original comment.
Hilarious you got downvoted...classic reddit.
I also thought it was a robot...or they were robots.
Ok, if they take away the orange I may have to bully them
Yeah, it has a little antenna thingy
It’s that dreaded time again…
Why in the world was this the design 😭  
They wanted it to be wireless. It was against the designer's vision for it to have a wire attached to it so they made it impossible.
The worst 20 minutes of my year.
People bitch about the port when the bigger problem is the dismal ergonomics. The slim profile and sharp edges are miserable.
20 minutes every month. The horror.
No this again, just leave it for a minute and you will have enough time for the rest of the day and then leave it overnight and you are good for weeks again.
The battery life is great so this doesn’t bother me as much as some.
It’s stupid but also it last like 3 months on one charge
Is it poor design or poor planning on your part? I get notice when battery is low and I plug it in.  15 minutes later a I’m back up and running.
By time you took the picture and posted it finished charging.
For the love of god! It charges so quickly.. go have a glass of water and a piss and by the time you’re back it’ll be charged enough to last you all day
A nothing burger.
Enough with these posts. You probably charge it ones a month at most. If hate it so much, why you using it? Get a different mouse.
In the time it took you to post this, the mouse is now charged.
Small coffe / tea break and enough charge for rest of day, that it, and break also give a time think about a task and get back to it
There are two reasons for this design...

1) You get enough warning that it won't impact your use.  
2) You can't leave it plugged in 24/7, and therefore won't destroy the battery.
Shut up, it's not even that often. The battery lasts at least a month.

People just like to bitch about everything because it's popular to bitch.
This was a joke obviously 💀 It’s a negligible issue at the end of the day. 
It does surprise me how many people are cool with it though🤷‍♂️
It isn't the charging I don't like about mine, it's the finding yourself back or forward a page because you didn't watch your finger fulltime while scrolling.
I can't believe people defend this BS... seriously now? If something is wrong or bad we speak, we demand as paying (a lot of money) customers to the company to fix their crap, this is the way.

Let me guess? Did you guys also defended the butterfly keyboard crap or the removal of F1 physical keys too? 

Bad design happens all the time, we can't ignore it, especially if it is going in our way.
You charge it once a month, and you can do it when you sleep, like every other electronic device. 
Good thing you can check the battery level at any time (so you don’t have to wait until it dies) and that it only takes an hour to charge.
(First world problems)
Yes it's bad design but c'mon, can we get over this now? The complaints grew tiresome long ago.
Just buy a better mouse. There are plenty that are cheap and much more comfortable.
[removed]
There is a USBc chargeable Magic Mouse?? Here I am, using rechargeable AA batteries in mine like a peasant. They hold forever though
The previous version used rechargeable AA batteries, much better to use and much more repairable. 
Yes. The dreaded time to rehash the Magic Mouse charging meme by people who don't even use it.

I know literally no one for which this is an actual problem. My suspicion is neither do you. Mac users either don't use that mouse because they like some other mouse better (that would be me), or they are fine finding time to charge Apple's mouse after it tells them the battery is low. If you can't find a free hour and a half or so every month or more to charge a mouse, you have bigger problems than not being able to use a cordless mouse corded.
It's showing you its tummy. That means it trusts you. :D
I was on the “what hell were they thinking?” But then I discovered how long it works between charges. 

It’s really nothing anymore. I just go take a walk to go make coffee while it charges and I’m good for a op g while.

It’s really become a much about nothing tbh.
I have one and never use it lol. I feel bad
I I just added a qi charger sticker to mine and a wireless desk charger that charges through the desk.
I always imagine that when Apple makes its EV available, it will have similar charging ergonomics, with the expectation that you turn the car upside down to plug it in.
I have two and just switch once a week.
The stupidest design decision Apple ever made…
I’m proud to announce that after approx. 1 hour we are able to use the mouse again 🙌
7% to 80%. W moment 🥳
This is a good design.  Keeps that port that is only used once a month overnight out of the way.  I am successfully lobbying Apple to keep this design.  Everyone else can go buy some other mouse.
Come on, this again? Charge it when you take a shit and you’ll have battery for days again. 
Stop the fucking whining.
Worst design ever.
It’s a silly design.. that plug should have been put at the top so it could be used as a regular mouse while charging… if my razor can do this my way more sophisticated mouse should be able to as well.
I love this design, I don’t care. Charge it while making a coffee, or charge it overnight fog it to last weeks. I have to charge my non-Apple keyboard six times as often as I need to charge my Magic Mouse.
For like 5 mins, take a break, a piss, make some tea, grab and enjoy a snack. It's fine.
Who cares, it’s like 15 min every 3 month.
This is such a tired complaint. If you’re using a Magic Mouse as your main mouse, it literally takes less than 20 mins to charge completely. If it’s that big of a deal. Charge it on your break or get a different mouse. This design hasn’t changed in YEARS. It may change someday but seeing hacks complain about it time and time again ain’t changing nothing.
Why don’t they make it charge wirelessly like the Apple Watch or iPhone. And sell a charging mouse pad.
[deleted]
Sure, Apple could have done something different with the charging design.  I don't think anyone would argue on that.  So what?  Plug it in for five minutes and be good for the rest of the day, and then plug it when you go home from the office, or go to sleep.  


I love my Magic Mouse and the design.  This "laborious" task of plugging it in once a month for an hour is such a non-event.
People always defend it by deflecting the very obvious design flaw as a user issue rather than a design issue. One of the WORST sins when designing products is to design a product that forces the user to adapt their workflow and conform to **it**, rather than the product conforming to the user. 

This is intentionally irritating because Jony Ive didn't want people to plug it in and use it at the same time. Wireless is too sexy, he thinks, cables aren't sexy. 

If you're rocking and rolling on some work and says it's about to die, yeah it's only one minute, but if you work in a creative field (or anywhere, really), it's extremely disruptive to get your flow interrupted and negatively impacts the work you were doing, and yourself. 

It's the equivalent to Janet coming by your desk and pulling your headphones off to tell you about the spiritual dreams her cats had last night. 

It's just a sixty second stop, sure, but it's not a 60 second stop that needs to exist at all. 

It's a problem that willed itself into existence by arrogance alone, and these folks in the comments run to defend it like it's their job. It's a terrible design. End of story.
Guy weird flexing his black Magic Mouse over here 🤣
They want you to upgrade to the magic trackpad
I can't stand those mice, ignoring the ergo and charger they look neat at least. I love the track pad though.
I still have the AA battery Magic Mouse. It makes life better. :)
> Why in the world was this the design?

Because then people would just use the damn thing plugged in all the time. At that point, just get a wired mouse. You plug it in for less than 10 minutes and it lasts all day. Plug it in overnight and it runs weeks.

I've seen this joke like 100 times, and I have never understood the complaint.

Then again, I didn't exactly like that mouse much anyway. I much prefer the trackpad. Which, ironically, I leave plugged in 100% of the time (because the port isn't on the bottom). I don't even know if they *make* a wired trackpad, but I'd probably buy one if they did. As it is now, when my keyboard dies, I unplug the trackpad and plug in the keyboard until the trackpad dies. It's dumb.
Given the design, where else could they put it?
This is intentional. Apple doesn’t want anyone to use the mouse while it’s plugged in. Their mission of aesthetics over all dictates a worse user experience
Why does anyone own this when the MX Master series exists.  This thing is just garbage.
Why on earth isn’t there a Magic Mouse with QI wireless charging through a mousepad??
Throw it in the garbage and buy a real mouse
I quit using those and my wrist feels so much better!
Oof. I had to do this yesterday. I still feel unclean. Never fails to gross me out.
Charging port on M4 MBP will be under it.
[deleted]
I find it hilarious how fanboys try to convince themselves that bad design is actually something good. 

Plus: batteries have a lifespan. If today your mouse takes a few minutes to charge for several hours/days of battery, that won't be the case in a few years.
[deleted]
That is the best part, you get to rest your wrist from the awful shape, your orthopedist appreciates
Which is why I have the one that takes AA batteries and refuse to upgrade.
To streamline other all visually. Less cords.
Apple was trolling when they made this atrocity. But an MX Master 3s and be done with it.
I didn’t know people actually use this. Lol
stop crying and get a better mouse or trackpad. simple
How has this crap not been updated in so long. I got one once and it made my wrist hurt after like 10 minutes.
I wont up buying a generic bt capable mouse of amazon for that reason. Love my macbook but I have never been able to justify those prices on the peripherals.
It’s that time of the month.. you gotta deal with aunt (power) Flow
I feel so anxious whenever I use this. It's not at all ergonomic, only the touch gestures are good.
One famous book called 'The design of everyday things' could change its cover to this instead of a wrongly built tea pot.
I made the mistake buying one of those things and used only for two days. This thing it’s ugly and NOT ergonomic.
Lol (initially) thought this was shopped — perfect advert for MX Master 3 (for Mac users)
I think the dumbest part of the design is the fact the battery isn’t replaceable, thus it is trash once the battery has too many cycles. Silly Apple reasoning saying this is more green while you can easily buy cheap rechargeable batteries for the old Magic Mouse.
The whole design is shit. The ergonomics suck, the charging port location is absolute horseshit. I was going to buy one despite the port issue, but then I actually tried one and was like hell no
I'm surprised nobody has made some sort of clip-on case with a 90° usb connector.
I can’t wait for them to update this thing, even if it’s just to move that port and make it USB-C
That mouse SUCKS!
Bro .. get mx master 3s for mac
And they say apple makes premium things
Literally plug it in for 5 minutes and you'll be good for a month
Bruh, get this. I work on a Mac all day. Totally a game changer w/ the macro keys. Also have the keyboad but only because i use 100%. 

[Logitech MX Master](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.910-006557.html)
$10 Bluetooth mouse that’ll work with every compatible device and has charging port on the sides, or this….
Sure they charge quickly and last a long time, and that makes this only a minor inconvenience but that doesn't change this being an awful design. And it'll become a lot more of a problem as the devices age and the battery life starts to degrade.
I was thinking about getting one, but this is a deal-breaker for me. I'll stick to my trackpad.
I just do it over night when I need to charge it. And unplug it in the morning. Or working from home has a perk where I don’t use my MacBook but am still near it so I can just charge the mouse then.

The only problem is I don’t know when it fills up to unplug it.
Yayy innovation
A whole 5 minutes and then recharge for good when you leave your desk for the night.

I have one too and yeah it can be annoying when you're in the middle of a deadline/something time sensitive.

I actually just bought a Logi MxMaster Mouse – best decision I've made!
Bought magic mouse 2 when it came out, actually I like it for reading (touchscreen helps to move text as I want), but now I have MX Master 3 and the magic mouse is absolutely terrible for everything else than reading.

Thats actually same like making touchscreen keyboard, some things needs buttons and good shape.
I just got used to the trackpad of the MacBook with its gestures. Is it even possible to use the Mac with a „normal“ mouse?
Hold your neck back to keep your airways open on re-entry.
The reason we ended up with this design is that the Magic Mouse is originally operated with removable batteries. The underside of the mouse was where the trap door for inserting batteries was. 

When they move to a rechargeable battery, they very clearly had lost interest in making mice, couldn't be added to make a new design, and the bottom is the only place with a flat surface, so that's where the port went.
shit design but its one of the best mice ive used (no joke). some people may say im an apple fanboy but it fits my kinda small hands perfectly lol.
The charging situation is so blown out of proportion how often does it even need to be charged? Cant we see battery charge? Why dont people just plug it in for the night… What i miss is side buttons. Thats why i use a third party mouse. I love it for Exposé/missions control…
I thought that every time I had to use the Magic Mouse
Just get a magic mouse one
Why not? How often do you do it?
I have one with batteries and I need to put a piece of paper between the two batteries to make it work 🫠😅
I heard the reason for this design is so that when Macs are photographed, there are no wires shown so that it keeps that designer wireless look Apple wants to convey to the public.
It’s a wireless mouse. Only heathens want to use it with a wire.   


/s
The person who invented this was promoted to lead the HomePod software team.
Thanks for reminding me
Luckily I charge this thing literally only once every month.
I'm one of the only people who likes it apparently and I've tried other "high end" mouses over the years. 

Maybe twice a year, I charge it at the end of the day when I don't need it.  Also have a cheap $10 logitech just in case.  

I don't see the charger port as some massive issue that people make it out to be.
I’m gonna defend it. Where would you put the port? No seriously, take a look at that mouse and tell me where the best spot for that port is.
If you could charge it and use it people would keep it plugged in and it would make the product worse and destroy your cable (as I have done with my MX Masters in the past. 

This design is 100% to keep people from using it plugged in or keeping it plugged in unnecessarily all the time. 

It’s a design choice to force a behavior… and either you hate it so you get a different mouse or you don’t care and use it.

What baffles me is why are people so passionate about it
I can't believe I participated in this thread.
Jony Ives masterclass.
I don’t know what that is :P
I mean you could buy another mouse and never have that time again.
You're complaining about the charging port and that mouse is one of the least ergonomically designed mice. You would be better off using the Trackpad instead. 

It's only saving grace is how long that battery lasts based on how small that battery is.
Bah. Just use/get the Magic Trackpad and ditch that abomination!
I do like the gesture top though.  they are messing with us with that stranded turtle charging.
At least the mouse charges very fast.
We went back to cabled mice or battery operated mice at the design studios of the academy where I work. Having half of the room with disabled upside-down mice is a no-go. There are so many magic mice in the closet, never used, most unboxed and waiting for direct e-waste disposal
Is that time of the month…
It’s still better than the old puck without the divots from the Powermac G3 days. At least with this one you can tell which direction the mouse is pointing.
i keep a post it on my computer that says RECHARGE MOUSE
It charges so quickly
Just buy a Logitech MX Master 3 and throw that in the trash where it belongs
Hey apple. Why not make a mac mouse that could wirelessly charge?
I charge this mouse no joke like once a year, I can’t think of anything that bothers me less. Whenever it eventually dies, I flip the tortoise, go for lunch and move on with my life. Yes, it’s aesthetically ugly, and yes it renders it useless while charging. I appreciate that, but in practice the battery life really does render this a non-issue (for me anyway)
I loved the removable battery version of that mouse, and I love the current rechargeable version even more. I am legit baffled by people who complain about the charging situation, because 

* your Mac warns you well before it's a problem;
* plugging it in for 15 minutes will get you to the end of the day, no problem; and 
* occasionally remembering to plug it in for longer (say, at lunch, or when you leave your desk) is a dead easy thing to do

Ergonomics and comfort are different issues. I find it VERY comfortable, so I use it, but I also make a point of swapping out my keyboards and pointing devices from time to time just for variety. What I *do* miss when I don't have that mouse is the swiping/scrolling on the top, though.
Sometime this lock also me. I wish for a magic mouse with wireless charge and the mousepad that charge it
The tragic macpad is better
Always reminds me of the toast on cat meme. This should be floating 3 inches from the surface.
Worst mouse design EVER made
I don’t remember when was the last time I had to charge mine, the battery lasts ages after a single charge
I just check the battery level once a week, seems to be fine for about 6 months every charge. When it does need one, just plug it in during breaks, or when working from another location. It’s the ergonomics and edges that are bad.
For a company that is so focused on design, I’m not quite sure how the hell this made it to store shelves.
It’s not that serious
Stop complaining, you charge it for 2 hours and get to use it for a few months. If you think it’s gonna die soon just charge it that night.
If Apple made a car, the gas tank nozzle would be underneath it.
Not sure why anyone would ever daily drive that thing.
this is what fuels my nightmares
Same guy who decided to put the USB ports at the back of the iMac?
Honestly, 8 would have kicked that shit out of the door at the first time
I usually turn off my Magic Mouse, and keyboard when I’m done being on the computer for the day. Battery last longer, and less charging.
I never have and never will understand having the charging port on the Botton mod the mouse.
I’m perfectly happy with my older 1st gen Magic Mouse with the replaceable batteries 😁
Pssst… trackpads are superior and can be used while charging
It’s not even about the charging , the optic laser accuracy is so bad it brought me back to memories of a mouse with a ball . Even that was better
Plug it in. Go take a shit or something
I cannot believe they still sell that abomination. I still (sometimes) use my AA battery powered Magic Mouse.
Just charge it every week once you go to bed. Never wait until it’s empty and there is zero down time. 

It’s like a electric car. You cannot drive while charging. You also do not wait until you cannot reach your workplace anymore. You charge at soon as you reach your garage and done driving for the day.
It lasts so long though. It’s easy enough to just plug it in overnight or when you’re doing other things since it only takes roughly 2 hours.
it could be regularly wired and charging until you want it wireless but noooo apple said simple doesn’t fuck with their minds enough. we need to implement small annoyances that stop productivity making it seem like we are making productivity more efficient but that’s just to get you into the midst of our psychological warfare 😈 muahhahahah
Still ￼stymied, if it was to be wireless mouse only, why no wireless charge functionality as a compromise to the ￼consciously created issues and problems of designing a wired connection like that?
Maybe they thought that if they design it this way it would be like they're resuscitating a mouse and it would be funny?
I just got a new MacBook Pro M3 and connected my Apple mouse only to find the cursor was too slow. I went to system preferences of course and upped mouse speed to the max, still felt too slow. Anyone else have this problem?
I see an upside down turtle struggling to right itself
trackball 4 life
I really don’t get the problem, if you notice it runs a little low why not charge it over night?
Love the touch scroll but definitely, that’s apple worst design EVER
Isn’t it only 2 minutes?
It’s an awful design, but the inconvenience people are making it seem is overblown.
I came to like most apple products. But I would never buy this mouse.
To answer your question: what I hear about this stupid design is that it was supposed to give you a break from the office. 

Flip it, put it to charge, leave for 5-10 minutes, you have hours of use by that time.

In practice, smash it on a wall and get an MX Master
Mx master to the rescue
My wife had to do this today too 😆
Ngl, having batteries is better if this is the second option
I’m loading the  mouse in the night.  So I don’t have nag about it during the day time
Great mouse but i agree the charging port could be on the end so u can still work while it charged.
It was the formula of Jonny Ive - Steve. Things got weird
This always gets blown out of proportions soo much
Would be cool if it charged like the watch & AirPods do now
How to say “I never learn to charge stuff” without saying I never learn to charge stuff 😂
it literally takes 5 minutes to fully charge and lasts ages.
Asshole design
This is exactly why I buy different mouses that don’t fr go with my Mac lmao
My keychron 3 gaming mouse holds a charge for like 48 hours, so stop your bitchin'.
Everybody seems to think Apple wins because of their end user focused design decisions. I would have to disagree. Locked down, proprietary software, and dumb decisions like this OP, are why Apple is a failure. I'm not talking about financials, I'm talking about failure of end user design.
Yeah, that would make too much sense to actually allow you to use it while it’s recharging. Ergonomically, they should’ve put the connector on one end or the other, so you could still use it while charging.
This did this so you needed to buy 2 of them haha
I don't even bother with the Magic Mice, not only is it impractical, prolonged period of use also hurts my hands. Just get a Mac compatible wireless mouse and you're set.
Is it you Ive?
Is it still like that on the 3
what is that ?
It needs like 4 minutes to charge for a day of use then you can leave it charging overnights so it works for a month.
What a controversial topic. Personally I love the form factor of the MM and I charge it like, five times a year so I have no issue with the fact that it's not wired.
The battery lasts weeks. The bigger problem is the ergonomic. It fitted my child hands years ago, but now it doesnt
I believe this is so they don’t pay Logitech on patents.
If only I could remember to charge it once a month when I was leaving the office...
Isn’t there an adapter you can buy or that someone made?
Why do people even use the Apple mouse?
time to charge my apple vibrator again!
Been using a trackpad for twenty years now, after twenty years before that using a mouse — pictures like this take me back to SCSI drives and CD-R, very retro
Hate that mouse. Used one for about 6 months before carpal tunnel issues started cropping up and I switched to a real mouse. I'll never go back.
The fact this mouse design is 9 years old is amazing. Also Apple had such an obvious opportunity in December, the M1 iMac was 2 years old and oddly not updated with an M2 chip, they announced they are officially phasing out the lightning port, and the iMac was still somehow updated with no new mouse design.
They should make the bottom compatible with a charging pad or integrate the iPhone MagSafe
This is why I have a charged stand by mouse at all times
Sometimes i wonder why anyone would even buy it lol
Apple is honestly just becoming a ‘tech fashion’ brand now. The only place they are still competing in with the rest of the market is they mac line up. They have even more or less given up on iphone by using the same processor for 2 years straight.
The magic mouse should die...
I swear they made it on purpose so that the software engineers at apple could have an excuse to have a break. "My mouse is charging"
Lool I hate it when I have to do this. Fortunately, its a rare occasion
i dont understand why people use this mouse
Just get, like, a Logitech MX Anywhere 3S.  Great mouse, same slim profile, smooth scrolling with option for ratcheting, uses actual USB C (and the charger port is on the front, like a normal mouse).  I don't understand why Apple users tolerate this sort of shit unless it came with the thing for free, and the high cost of the machine itself prevented them from getting any usable periphery.
I’ll never understand the bitchfit about this. The computer TELLS YOU when you’re low on power, and at that point you have the better part of A DAY left. Use it until you’re done, then let it charge over night, during lunch or dinner, whatever. If that’s too huge a problem for you, then it’s your own damn fault that you can’t be bothered to take care of your stuff, not Apple’s.
Former Microsoft employee design.
I love my Magic Trackpad.
I had a job give me one of these once. Threw it in a drawer after one day and went out and purchased an MX Master. Dumbest mouse design I’ve ever come across.
It’s enough time to have a magsafe like solution for the mouse. Maybe one what includes a magnetic surface that can be used as a mat.
Sadistic John Ive
Is it just me or is this really a non issue.

The computer tells you when the battery is low. And it will still last a long time after.

Charge it the next time you aren’t using it.

Also it charges a good bit pretty quickly.

Literally plug it in and go to the bathroom. And it’s good for the rest of the day.
shitty ass design if they wanted to discourage users from  having it wired they could put the charger on the side or back so that it's at a weird angle but still usable if needed
QI charging anyone?
And honestly, there is something to be said for this approach.

When I first got a ps4, I was slightly surprised and annoyed by how short the controller cables were. It was _months_ before I realized that they could be used wirelessly, and those cables were only for charging.
they could of redesigned it for the m1 release for it to just be wirelessly chargable so you could of just get one of those mousepads that charge your mouse while you use it on the mousepad (im pretty sure Logitech sells a mousepad like that)
I have the first gen one that takes batteries, idk why they didn’t just keep that up. I have rechargeable AAs so I just swap those in when they need replaced, granted I reserve it as a travel mouse and use a Logitech one for normal use.
It was against apples vision to use the mouse wired because buy a new one when battery turns bad
So that it looks good when off the wire? For the aesthetics? Good thing they made it the ugliest fucking thing on the wire
So why no wireless charging?
20 minutes a year? That's the amount of charging it needs?
Ergonomics has always been an issue for Apple mouse designs. A little too much emphasis on form over function, IMHO
Am I the only one who isn’t bothered by the ergonomics?
I’m in the minority that thinks it’s good. I have a mx master and tried some other mouses. It just doesn’t scroll or point the way I want it to. Maybe it’s my smaller hands or maybe it’s some Mac/Magic Mouse integration but I can’t seem to not prefer the Magic Mouse.
Maybe so Sir, but not for all of us. 

I have no more wrist problem after using Magic Mouse for decades. Use to get a big painful bulge from orher mices due to a small hand size.

Keyboard shortcut a handy as well.
this, i can leave it charging overnight, but it feels horrible..
I love the design. I find most other mice to be too high arching and I don’t like resting my palm on it all day.
Actually, I have joint issues and can't rest the weight of my hand on a mouse. Thus, I much prefer slim flat rodentia. What I ***hate*** about this mouse is that it can't be used while charging and doesn't use user replaceable batteries. When it runs down you either have to stop working or find a substitute. The last time a Mac landed on my desk with this mouse, the mouse went into a box and a more functional mouse was put in use.

My personal preference at this time is the MS Designer mouse (flat-ish and used replaceable batteries) and at work I have a Logitech (I need their multi-select) mouse that can be used fine while charging.

What I think Apple should do is to tweak the design, switching to a USB-C socket on the "nose" (like my Logi) as a backup with the primary charging being wireless using the same charging as their phones. The "companion" keyboard should get the same change.
I click lower than the tip because that’s how my hand goes and I accidentally scroll every time I click. The sharp edges don’t bother me.
All ergo mice feel like shit after using this mouse for years. So no I disagree.
Also the accuracy is beyond a doubt one of the worst.
I had to stop using it because my little finger was getting painful.
I mean, the port problem is an ergonomics problem.  There are definitely others too...
I bought some ergonomic grips for the Magic Mouse and it's night and day. I bought 3 pairs, one for my desk Magic Mouse, travel, and a third if I ever buy another Magic Mouse.
Yep, that is the one thing I hate. They are fine for short stints, I used mine in combination with a magic pad that worked pretty well, but now that I'm doing more mouse focussed work (Excel, someone save me) I've buckled and ordered a Logitech MX2 Master (or whatever it is called).
Spent 8 hours a day working on this setup with the Mac keyboard, both look amazing sure. But the ergonomic made it hell after a few hours.

Compared to that the 15 minutes of charging a mouse isn't so bad.
And slow polling
There is nothing good about the design of this mouse. It’s wild anyone buys it.
I love the scrolling, I don't mind the charging, but the ergonomics got me. After literally years using it, I ended up grabbing the predictable MX Master 3S. It's more comfortable, scrolling is... good enough, but its clicks are so unsatisfying. The whole mouse has this squishy feel. It's coated in this softish plastic junk and just feels awful.

There's no perfect mouse.
I mean I still can bare with that, but the charging is making the whole mouse unusable...
I totally agree that is the absolute worst designed mouse I’ve ever used.   I run a Logitech and love it.
Yes, dismal ergonomics—BUT just imagine if that mouse had dimensions similar to those of an iPhone. (Put your iPhone down on your desk and play around with it as if it were a mouse.)
I don’t know what you are all doing with this mouse, it’s fine. Are there more comfy ones? Yes probably. If you want a giant inflatable pillow under your hand go get one.
Honestly, there’s just no part of this mouse that I like.

I tend to rest my middle finger on the mouse, and it works fine when you do so but then the fluid scrolling isn’t as clean, it’s more sharp and it doesn’t have the elasticity anymore.

Howevever, I’m primarily in a code editor for work, and when I click and drag with this mouse, 8 times out of 10 the act of clicking and holding, while moving the mouse, is enough for my index finger to move ever-so-slightly enough that the mouse thinks I’m also scrolling… which ruins the horizontal selection in trying to make and also selects text vertically… idk if I’m explaining this well but I don’t understand why scrolling is enabled on this mouse while you’re holding a click. If that UX change was made, I could probably tolerate it.
to be fair, ur not supposed to hold it like a normal mouse. that’s why the sensor is by the finger tips
Eh I use magic mouse with finger curled up
It’s so unbearably awful 😭😭!!
The charging time is probably not the issue man. The problem arises when the mouse is out of juice right when you need to use it and you can’t use it plugged in.
I mean it’s still pretty silly to design it that way. 

My Logitech MX Master has similar charging needs, but can still use it wired when it’s running low. I don’t have to think about plugging it in when I’m done at the computer. Plus much better ergonomics, which is way more important than the charging port. 

I like Apple stuff due to the thoughtfulness around user interface. The Magic Mouse has the Apple aesthetic in appearance, but not in user interface.
Not including the fact that low battery notifications have warned  him of this for 2+ weeks. 

The magic mouse is just reddit free karma loophole.
Weeks? My mouse is years old and needs charged 3 times a year.
If this was on some cheap no-brand product, you'd be willing to mock it.
I’m a big Apple fan and used a Magic Mouse for ages, and this used to annoy the hell out me. It’s a needlessly bad design and ux. 

I use a track pad now, much happier.

Idk what charger you’re using but a minute isn’t nearly enough for a day’s charge, for me at least. 
I get what you’re saying but I don’t even have a set up to charge it overnight 😬 (me problem of course)
Seriously this is the truth. I never have ever found myself with a dead battery. And if I were to, I'd charge it for just a few minutes and be just fine.
Unless you have the power switch in the wrong position. Can’t tell you which is the correct position because I forget every time and there’s no charging indicator.
> just leave it for a minute and you will have enough time for the rest of the day

People keep saying stuff like this, so I thought I'd test it out. Now, maybe you weren't being literal, maybe the percentage isn't reported very accurately — we'd need to do a longer test to be sure. But I charged it for exactly one minute and the charge was 52% when I started and 52% when I stopped.

Edit: I see in another comment that you clarify it was an exaggeration. I would actually really like to know what the (time charging / usable time gained) ratio actually is in practice — maybe I'll be unlazy enough one day to actually do a proper test.
You mean when it's new. Batteries have a life span. In a few years, that won't be the case.
I would rather have it last one week on one charge if it let me carry on working while I charged it.
What would be nice would be for OSX to have a User-definable control in Settings where I can tell it to create certain “nags”.

For example, if remaining power is less than (User defined level) to put up a Notification when unlocking the Mac.  

Or to have a Pop-Up notification of power level every (user defined) minutes once it drops below (User defined level).  

Or both.  Etc.
It's both. Poor planning which could be absolutely mitigated by non-poor design.
It's just a poor design. It's not about the battery notification. It's about not being able to use the device. Why should we plan the charge of a mouse.
They’re coping.
>I can't believe people defend this BS

Fanboys. "Oh it's not a big deal, just charge it while you're making coffee"... seriously, what the hell kind of excuse is that? If your computer mouse needs to imitate an actual dead mouse while charging, then the design sucks, sorry.

Actually the whole mouse sucks. I use the Logitech MX Master 3s, far superior ergonomics, build quality, sensor performance and charging port placement.
I didn't like the mouse. I didn't buy the mouse. If enough people did this, then Apple would change the mouse.

As it is, enough people must have bought the damn thing to not affect their bottom line, so there was no *reason* to change it. You might not like it, but enough other people *must* have.

I won't defend the butterfly keyboard, though I never had a problem with mine, sold the laptop after 4 years, and the new owner has had it for 2 years without complaint. The keyboard was undeniably a fiasco. I feel like I got lucky with it.

I assume when you say, "removal of F1 physical keys" you are referring to the Touch Bar Macs? That's a perfect example of what I wrote above. People who bought them didn't like that, so they returned them for something else. Enough people (myself included) just entirely skipped that model. Apple got rid of it because people weren't buying it. Problem solved.
Its not that its not mildly annoying, its that its annoying to see people complain about it when theres so much worse problems with it.
Because it's not BS at all.

The only people complaining about this are a) either people who don't use the mouse, or b) ignore every freaking notification of MacOS that you need to charge the mouse soon (soon = sometime in the next few days).

I've had the mouse with swappable AA batteries before. Trust me, the old version was way more annoying than the new one with the built-in battery.
Where would you rather have them place the port?
Any suggestions? 🤔
😔 I was just making a funny
It’s not USB C, it connects via lightning cable.
Since October 2015, yeah. (It's Lightning, not USB C, though.)
I’m just surprised that these things are around $100. It seems so overpriced but they really are great
Don’t feel bad TyrionJoestar! You’re a real star 🤩
A little modification was required to cut width so it would fit between the mouse “skis” and fold wire and tape it down. I really can’t tell it’s there when using in my desk.  It’s not perfect but never have a dead mouse. KUJOBUY QI Wireless Charging... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075QHNSD5?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
Doesn't 5 mins of charging get you an entire day of work or something like that? I don't see the need for two mice just to avoid this (seemingly) minor issue, but your solution does certainly work lol
This is how they get you. TBH they got me too, although instead of a second mouse, I have a trackpad.
This is the best solution to this problem I’ve seen tbh. Unfortunate extra cost though 🤷‍♂️
Is this satire? There’s 0 reasons not to put the port on the front of the mouse
Yeah, I hated it and switched to a free windows mouse, but the charging was not the problem, that was fine, it was the ergonomics thats *way* worse than charging it every few months.
It’s legitimately impressively bad
Why? I takes like 1min charging to give you several hours working time. If they put it in front like many people ask, it would be just used as a wired mouse instead of a magical mouse.
Nope, it was actually a smart design. They hid an unsightly port that is only used for a few hours every few months. People can charge it overnight.
Does that mean it IS changing SOMETHING? Double negatives, homie. They’re a doozy.
But I don’t have a way to charge it overnight 🥺 physically incapable
I think this is what bothers me most about it. It's a solution no one would want to a problem no one was having.
> design a product that forces the user to adapt their workflow and conform to it

It lasts for months on a single charge so there's really no disruption to workflow.
> Because then people would just use the damn thing plugged in all the time. 

If that's what people want to do, just let them.
💀 got any suggestions?
i'll take it if the damn thing doesn't cost 3.5k with no memory upgrades
Looking at it now, I think either side is thick enough that it could fit a port there 🤔 
Tbf that may come with its own issues but end of the day I just wanna be able to use my mouse 🥺
[deleted]
I am on the same mouse for over 6 years now.  Every few weeks I have to put it on the charger when I go to bed (like last night), I wake up, take it off the charger and it will be good for 3-4 weeks.    


Really not a huge deal.
I can’t tell 😭 I’m so sorry for posting this, it feels like a war has broken out
I have one of those, and you have to replace the batteries very frequently in comparison to how often you need to charge the new one.
The AA batteries which came in mine (first generation) corroded the inside & killed it.  Pass.
and you can practice keyboard shortcuts for the 5 minutes it's charging.
Sure, but always at the worst possible moment.

Frankly, I’d like to have it be Qi charger compatible, and while a Qi mousepad is an interesting idea, I’d be happy with the UI being a Qi charger “holster” which at the end of the workday, I pick up the mouse off the workpad and drop it into this holster (maybe mounted on side of monitor? TBD).  This holster charges overnight and prevents the cat from knocking an unattended mouse onto the floor and underneath the desk, etc.  Next morning, it’s good to go, and always in the same place ..ie, not lost/misplaced.
It wouldn’t be gas, but electric and be charged by induction.
Depends on the surface. It’s one of the few mouses which work without a mouse pad better then with one. You should try it.
Apple’s Magic Mouse 2 🐭
One word: gestures
Ive: NO! You’re *FIRED!* SECURITYYYY!!!
The whole point if this design is to make it impossible to tether the mouse full time, a lot people would just leave the cable connected all the time which would degrade the image of the device (shit argument, but that’s it)
I love it, but it just sounds like the most “create a problem, sell a solution” ass invention ever😭
Logitech sells a mouse with a mat that does this. You never have to charge it.
Logitech’s had that for many years
Look at how expensive Logitech’s powerplay is. Apple would probably double it. As well as higher mouse cost.

It is also impractical since the mat requires power, so you get a cable anyway.

Not to mention, some people prefer extended mats and such a large hard surface is unpractical to make.

Oh yez, Razer had a mouse/pad comvo that could do that as well, they stopped selling it
That’s actually a great idea. I’d consider that to be more like wireless charging instead of MagSafe charging but it’s a great idea. A wireless charging mouse pad. Sure it’d take quite a while to charge, but since it’s a functional mousepad it wouldn’t matter. 

Maybe Apple could implement some technology that communicates with it where it stops charging at 100% and will *only* start charging again at 5%.
It’s a non issue, but people have issues in their lives so they feel the need to attack pointless things about Apple on an online site behind an anonymous username. 
Same. I can see why it’s a bad design choice technically. But I’ve never had the issue of the mouse not working when I need it.
Also why do they feel the need to discourage people from using the mouse that they PAID for in a certain way man. It is ridiculous.
I swear if they put it on the back then people would be trying to use the mouse backwards.
Did you not buy the prior generation of consoles? Wireless controllers were mainstream on the PS3/360
I’m guessing you only use your phone plugged in
But then you trapped to using a corded mouse pad. Or worse have to bring to work your corded mouse pad
It’s not much of an exaggeration.
My Logitech m705 has three years of battery life. It has normal batteries, but that doesn't matter if it lasts 3 years.
Except for the original brick. I don’t remember any problems with that as it was quite big and easy to hold.
Apple keyboards are also absolute junk.
that's always been the problem, with their hardware and software, pretty but not very useful.
LOL remember that hockey puck shaped mouse in the first colored iMacs? 🤣
I had no problem when I was using it all day for work. I do use a lot of keyboard shortcuts though.
No, I’m the other one
I work all day on it. Have no complaints. It’s a great mouse for my needs.
It’s probably fine if you don’t work full day shifts every day on it. But I abandoned my Magic Mouse for the MX Master and I haven’t looked back.
Been using the Magic Mouse for 12 years, love it.  The only reason I don't use it on one of my machines is because my games don't recognize its middle click, and the utility I used to use to fix that doesn't work on M1.
No same here, I’ve been using the Magic Mouse since 2011, no issues. People just don’t know how to use them.
Not just you. To me, a mouse is a mouse is a mouse. It does the thing I want, left click, right click, scroll.
Yeah, I put in 45 hour weeks on the mouse. No issues. My wife hates the mouse and uses a different kind.
[deleted]
It really depends on what grip you are using to hold the mouse. Lots of people like to rest their whole palm on top of their mouse and it's ergonomically terrible to do this on magic mouse.

On the other hand, it works very well with a claw grip, possibly indicating that the mouse is designed with this grip in mind, given its spacious touch surface
I don't get the hate either. I've used it for years and the swipe gestures and accuracy isn't easily replicated, not even by the Magic touchpad. 

I've even tried switching to a Logi MX2, and its not the same. The only disadvantage the MM has is 3D apps that need a middle button.
I prefer Apple’s mice over any other over engineered competitors’ designs
It's cool you're not bothered but it's legitimately a health hazard in that it can lead to issues like carpal tunnel syndrome if used frequently. Apple's laziness to update it or unwillingness to spend money doing so is a shame.
It’s like halfway there for me. I like how scrolling/swiping etc works, but two things I can’t get over, 1. The sides are just too thin for me. You ever try to pick up the mouse to reposition and it’s just like punishment for my hand trying to angle my fingers to pick it up and not drop it. 2. The right click feels janky as hell. It feels like the click mechanism is on the left side of the mouse or something and when you right click, it flexes in a weird way and just generally feels wrong.
The scrolling issue is Apple cucking competing brands on their software like they always do
how often did you have to charge your mouse and how long does it take each time?
Really, you’ve tried all of them?
The polling rate is garbage. Cheap aliexpress mice are 10x better.
Link?
He was being sarcastic. I hope you are too. 
If you can't plug it in once a month sometimes in 30 days and then can't use the trackpad for 5 minutes for some reason, that's on you, not the design.
For me, my work MacBook is the only device I use where I barely notice any notifications. It is silent, small, has a very neutral color and disappears quickly. I use an external track pad, and it is also always a surprise when the battery dies. Never seen any notifications about the battery getting low, I am not even sure they exist at this point.
The only problem is that it only fits child hands well, when you have bigger hands it feels cramped
But the cheap one would not charge fast enough to use it for the day.
Uh, everyone is regardless lmao
My guess is Apple will discontinue the mouse before they put the cable in a place where it can be used while charging. They do that, and people will post picture of it plugged in and make fun of the fact that they could just have gotten a wired mouse.
I don't see the issue. The mouse already alerts you days ahead that it might need a charge in the foreseeable future. So you charge it once you're done for the day. 

I never had any issues with that Mouse running out of power.
This is the Way! That's how we finally got some ports back on MBP
Ofc that was a bit of an  over exaggeration but basically that is it. Like it never happened to me that my mouse died and I could not continue to work in the next 5min. What set up you mean? Just plug it in over night and you good to go.
Fair point but the charging will also be faster as the battery capacity goes down. Also I’ve read online most people keep there for 5-7 years? This might be wrong but they seem fine I guess
I still have this mouse with replaceable batteries. I finally threw it in a drawer because the rechargeable batteries would wear out. I upgraded to the mouse with the built in battery, but the mouse just died one day after like 5 years.

I don't like that I can't change the battery on these (and I don't think Apple will either).

I just recently had my Apple TV Siri Remote go to where it had to be charged *daily* to use. I went to figure out how to replace the battery, and you *can't.* You have to just buy a new remote. That's a dumber design than the above IMHO.
It will be probably more than two decades before the battery will drop to a level where the recharge-frequency gets annoying.
Compared to replaceable batteries that last for a lot less and cost a fuck ton to replace. 
I mean, you can see the battery percent on your Mac very easily. You literally just click the Bluetooth icon and it shows up. It’s not that hard to see it’s almost dead and charge it when you aren’t working
I usually get the banner notices when my mouse and keyboard are around 15%.  I never set that myself.  I’m sure there is a way to tinker with it.
There was an app before that would let you set custom notifications like you are talking about. I’m gonna try to job my memory tonight to see if I can remember and post it here.
If you have a problem with this type of charging, you probably regularly make mountains out of molehills. It is seriously a non-issue.

I charge my magic mouse to every 6 to 8 weeks and I use it all day, every day for work. I will usually remember on some random Friday to plug it in at the end of the workday but if I really forget for a long time, my MacBook will remind me when it gets to 20%. Even if that 20% is on a Monday morning, I still have plenty of battery to last the whole week.

People who complain about this probably also complain about the horrendous burden of having to put air in their tires a couple of times a year.
It's *almost* as if you can elect to not buy this mouse if you don't like it, and buy something else *entirely.* Market forces at work and all that.
subjectivity exists
Dammit, I was agreeing with you so hard during the first paragraph. Then came the second one.
Amen. Having to keep rechargeable AAs on charge was annoying. But hey, it could be worse, it could be that version with the scroll-ball. My IT just deployed one of those with my “new” system.
Same place as every other wireless mouse that we ug in to charge and also use while charging...
Literally anywhere on the side, just not on the fucking bottom
Well, it is not my job to solve this, people smarter than me could have found an even better solution to a problem where apple ignored what Steve Jobs said "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."

Well this, doesn't work obviously because they put aesthetics above practicality.
I really suggest a Magic Trackpad! Why do you need a mouse on Mac, specifically? 
Ah shoot. Okay but still good to know this exists
Makes sense that I missed it, bought my iMac in 2012, used it until late 2020 and bought an M1 MBP, just took the mouse with me.
It could but have not tried it in a while. I got a second one with laptop renewal and the did not ask for the old one back. So win win
What do you mean the only solution. I charge like once every 3 months. 

And when I do I simply plug it overnight. It’s a complete non issue lol
A port on the front would completely ruin it.
There is one reason: aesthetic.
The dumbest argument i’ve ever heard.
This whole “oh but then people would use it wired instead of wireless” is dumb when your realise the Magic Keyboard has the charging port at the front
'unsightly port' lol? If it was where the mouse would normally have a wire you literally wouldn't be able to see it during use...
It’s just bad design. My wireless mouse charges via usb c. The cable is in the front so you can use it while charging, and the port is not visible when in wireless mode.

Edit : Ain’t no way there’s people still justifying it lol. The port location is only one of multiple things wrong with that mouse…
> Nope, it was actually a smart design.

It wasn't. The original Magic Mouse used AA batteries, so it didn't need a port. When they switched to an integrated battery, they just stuck the port on the only flat space.
Do your power outlets shut off at night? If so (and mine used to), plug it into your Mac.
There objectively is, it's irrelevant how long it lasts. Mouses should not be disabled by charging. It's equally frustrating when headsets do the same thing, or keyboards, etc. I am just so puzzled why people feel the need to defend it.
I don't care what people do, but I think Apple does.

You know that if the mouse was usable while plugged in there would just been memes about that. "Look, I bought a new wired mouse!"

I think it would look just as ridiculous as OP's picture. That's just my opinion. People are free to do what they like.
> either side

That would look and feel gross, honestly.
Then people would us it a wired mouse and not a magical mouse, believe, the designers did put some thought to this.
You know that not everyone is you. It depends on how much you use it. Some people complain it starts decaying just after two years of use.

I've had mine for 3 years and I do have to charge it much more often than when it was new.
Doesn't matter to me, I use rechargeable batteries and have a second set ready to go at all times.  Instant swap.  And I'd rather a shorter time on a charge than the possibility of a spicy pillow.
I have a Logitech mouse with the AA battery that lasts forever lol
Batteries are better kept around 80%.
Nah I’ll put my name to it. My name is actually Jake, and this design is dumb asf
Hell, I had a 3rd party wireless controller on the PS1 back in the day
Nope. I think the most recent I had before that was a PS1, then a NES, then a 2600. So I had decades of (intermittent) experience indicating that of _course_ controllers are plugged into consoles.

And I also had decades of career in software engineering, so it's not as if use of the unlicensed 2.4GHz band for wireless networking or peripherals was unfamiliar to me. It just never crossed my mind that it had been applied to that use case.
Why do they even call it a mobile phone? I can’t go anywhere with it.
That's nice. Still annoying because I feel like the battery will always run out at the wrong time.
whats the original brick for you? The "Lisa Mouse? Never had one in my hand, but used every one coming after that.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple\_pointing\_devices#/media/File:The\_Apple\_Mouse.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pointing_devices#/media/File:The_Apple_Mouse.jpg)

the ADB and ADB2 Mouse was kind of okay, the circular usb mouse was a joke.
I like the old one with the AA-batteries, shame they don’t make them anymore. Paired with the new trackpad
How so?
Don’t forget me, with a few software tools, it’s perfect for frequent CAD design.
Same, had early onset carpal tunnel because of this godforsaken design. MX is the way to go
I literally did this. bought magic after 2 days refund and bought the MX master 3S
Why Apple gotta ruin all our fun.. patching shit so 3rd party apps won’t work. Arseholes.
Do you use a claw grip? Because the normal mouse grip is just not optimal for these mice
"I'm right, it's everyone else that's wrong"
https://www.elevationlab.com/products/magicgrips-for-magic-mouse
I'm more of a fan of the Magic Mouse Fixed. https://mmfixed.com
My cheap one came with a two  AA batteries that I've not had to replace in almost 3 years now.
But I can connect it with a cable and continue using it while it is charging
I think the bottom charging port has been a great distraction from the terrible ergonomic design of the mouse, the thing must have given a whole load of people carpal tunnel. Apple really need to just make a comfortable ergo mouse and stop selling their silly garbage.
I get that recharging the mouse is virtually a non issue, but the placement of the charging port is objectively bad; it's not convenient, and it's ugly. If the only reason Apple did it that way was to spite its users by physically preventing them from using it plugged in, I'd dislike it on principle alone. but it's not just that, it's measurably bad.
We have to leave everything in lockers overnight 😔 it’s been charging for an hour but we’re almost there 🙌 75% from 7%
Charging will not be faster. Charging to full will take less time because the capacity has gone down.
15%?  I wish.

I think I get my first warning at like just 2% or 3%
>If you have a problem with this type of charging, you probably regularly make mountains out of molehills. It is seriously a non-issue.

I just don't excuse bad design decisions, unlike some people. If you're paying a premium for an upscale product, you should expect it to be well thought-out . I bet you also think having your Apple Pencil sticking out of the bottom of the iPad was also a "non-issue".

>I charge my magic mouse to every 6 to 8 weeks and I use it all day, every day for work. I will usually remember on some random Friday to plug it in at the end of the workday but if I really forget for a long time, my MacBook will remind me when it gets to 20%. Even if that 20% is on a Monday morning, I still have plenty of battery to last the whole week.

This is some heavy-duty copium

>People who complain about this probably also complain about the horrendous burden of having to put air in their tires a couple of times a year.

Complete false equivalency. I understand mechanical things wear out and require maintenance, and I'm willing to put that time in to keep them running (in fact, I'll bet I wrench on my cars more than you do). But by the same token, I would not buy a car with obvious design flaws just because it's pretty.
Yes, we’ve heard the arguments over and over, “but it’s not THAT inconvenient”. That’s not the point. The point is that it’s INTENTIONALLY INCONVENIENT. 

Clearly there are people who are comfortable with intentional inconvenience. Good for you. Live your life the way you want. 

That doesn’t make it wrong for other people to be irate about intentional inconvenience.
Good design is built on "mountains out of molehills" ideology. Ask any designer and they will explain how important it is to obsess over the minute details (and this isn't even minute in a design context).
Then why are you posting here, if you use some other mouse already?   D’oh.  Haters gotta hate.
Ahh in that case, that's a win for sure!
Not at all. You nor anyone else would ever see it unless using it and you wouldn’t feel it while holding it. You only ever see a computer mouse from the top or the back. I’m not someone who will say that liking apple products is bad and apple sucks, they make some great stuff but sometimes they include features and design choices which are just pretentious crap and this is one of those times.
How so? I can accept that having the port on the bottom isn't a significant problem, but how would moving it be *worse*?
What’s the point in an aesthetic design choice that compromises function while also being a change that is never seen. The port is not on a visible side of the mouse when it is on the front. As mentioned, you can not see the front of a mouse when it is in use nor when you are looking at the desk. If the port were on the front, it would have a positive benefit to the aesthetics when charging as not only would the mouse be usable, increasing functionality but it would also not be upside down with the cable pointing up, which looks terrible. I understand why they wanted to try it, however the  huge flaws should have meant that it didn’t make it through prototyping. If I had done this is my product design exam I would have failed my course.
[deleted]
and why exactly is this the dumbest argument you ever heard?
Are you demanding just the medal, or also the chest to pin it on?
If they put the port at the front, that would change the balance and symmetry of the mouse. Again, you only use this port for a few hours every few months.
They might, not sure lol. I have to store everything in a locker in office overnight 😟
But it would work unlike the current one
[deleted]
No you wouldn’t? This is how the Magic Keyboard works. If I’m in the middle of some important work and the battery is low I just plug it in *and can still use it* and then unplug it when it’s done. When the mouse has that situation you have to stop working while it charges. 

Some people are blowing the problem out of proportion but to say “well then it would just be a wired mouse” makes no sense. It’s just a matter of being able to use it while it’s charging and not reserving time of it being inoperable to do so.
You can charge the Magic Keyboard while in use and it detracts from absolutely nothing. I don’t get the argument.
What’s wrong with using it as a wired mouse?
I know, some people complain over the most asinine and childish things like it is some existential life crises.   I use my computer way more than the average person.  I have to charge it more than I used to, it used to last for what felt like twice as long, but its still such a long time that it makes no real impact.
I mattered to me. I also used rechargeable batteries and they required recharging faster than standard non-rechargeable batteries, which meant I get a week or so at best out of a charge. In contrast, the new Mighty Mouse runs months without a recharge. And I have yet to see a Magic Mouse with a swollen battery.
It gives you alerts days before it starts to run out.
I started with the Mac Plus, but that was basically the original Mac with a bit more memory. Not sure if the Lisa was the same.
Terrible ergonomics. Not talking about MacBooks by the way, there is only so much you can with laptop keyboards, but the Magic Keyboard. The shape is terrible, and the scissor switches aren't very comfortable.
Yeah, the only thing touching the mouse is my thumb, ring finger, and pinky. The other fingers float above until clicking. I also have one of those mouse mats with a silicon wrist wrest.
But can you continue to use it while you change the batteries?
Is your desk made of air?
[deleted]
The magic mouse is well thought out. I love it more than any mouse I’ve ever used and when you spend as much time as I do in databases, the manner of 360° scrolling of the magic mouse is unparalleled.

I use my mouse every day, worry free. When it tells me the battery is low I charge it.  But sure thing… “heavy-duty copium”. 🙄

/unsubscribe
Because I subscribe to the subreddit and find it funny how this conversation goes every time. People either love it or hate it and I'm allowed to interject if I feel like I want to
I do hate it and i haven’t bought it. It’s missing simple things like a mouse scroll & has a dumb charge placement.

Also every other mouse lasts months. Not only magic mouse.

My logitech mouse has been going 5+months.
“If they put it in the front like many people asked” People are asking for it.

“It would just be used as a wired mouse instead of a magical mouse” Okay? More options, better. How is that a downside? How is that bad? People would like to charge it while using it. Having it at the bottom of your mouse is stupid. It breaks the work flow and productivity. Literally every other mouse on the market does it, why be “different” and completely make an irrelevant change?
The port would be at the front, in the middle. Like literally every mouse ever. There is no "symmetry" issue nor balance issue. 

And we're just going to ignore that this mouse already has terrible weight distribution and is an ergonomic nightmare. Its form over function.
Why not just get a Magic Trackpad? You can leave it plugged in if you want and it supports the full range of gestures.
The current one works fine if you take two minutes out of your week.
[deleted]
You are not moving the Keyboard around to use it. If they put a port to charge that allowed you to use the mouse while charging people would complain about the cords constantly breaking. I have had the mouse go dead once. It charges 1% per minute five minutes is hours
And some people asininely DEFEND the most asinine design choices of a company just because they follow it like a cult, which is even worse.
That’s weird 

I have a Magic Keyboard and have experienced no problems
I can replace the rechargeable AAs in mine in a few seconds and then charge the old batteries at some point while continuing using the mouse for another 3 years or whatever.
You don't need to? Why would you want that?
Can’t say much but we have strict security due to highly confidential information 🤐
"well thought out" then maybe it shouldn't lack basic features other mice have like charging the mouse while you use it ;)
People without any actual experience of the product under discussion are adding no value.
It has scroll. Swipe the top.
Then why even talk about it? That’s the point I’m making. Buy  another mouse that has everything you want and move on. The trackpad provides the best experience for Mac anyway.
Why are people too stupid to buy a mouse that has the ports where they like them?  

The more people stress about this, the more Apple will keep it exactly the same.
Yes there is because the battery would have to be shifted.

It is true that the mouse cannot be considered ergonomic, but the weight distribution is balanced, optimal.
Or leave it to charge overnight and you’ll have a month of charge. 
So it works fine if you don't work... gotcha
A wired mouse can be moved around just fine, they have been used that way for decades. Whats 5 minutes plugged in during use going to hurt?
Its a non issue.  I have to charge my phone 365+ times per year.  I have to charge my mouse maybe 20 times per year, and that is after 6 years of daily use.  Its silly that you can't use it plugged in but its not something that really bothers me.
If you don't have experience with higher quality or more ergonomic options, I can see that happening.
Because it’s a false equivalency.
Yep computer mice are riddled with sensitive data
I do have experience with the magic mouse actually. Sorry I decided to comment. Neither you or I are adding value here.
Not physical
Because haters like to come here and diss the things they don’t own, showing their superiority of product selection.
[https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Magic+Mouse+2+Teardown/51058](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Magic+Mouse+2+Teardown/51058)

There is plenty of space at the top to fit a lightning port and if need be various ICs can be moved downwards to compensate for the weight distribution. The mouse already weighs 100 grams anyways.

The port itself weighs less than two grams.
I think what bugs me the most about it is that it does last reasonably long, so I’ve not developed a habit routine, like “put it on to change when leaving every Friday night” to prevent it from becoming a surprise interruption while trying to get something done.  Sure, we can say “oh, it’s just 5 minutes”, but contextually, there limited options to prevent that interruption from hitting at the Murphy’s Law worst possible time.

For example, there’s zero user settings options in System Settings to tell OSX to prompt the user at a different remaining power level, or to pop something at unlock, etc.  because I’m rarely anal-retentive to proactively check it, I’m getting blindsided by it ~20x per year.  Irritating.
Again: you know that not everyone is "you".

You are making a completely false comparison: charging phones and mouses are two different things.

1 - People don't usually use their phones for extended and continous periods of time as they do with a mouse.

2 - You don't have to interrupt what your doing on your phone to charge it.

Most normal human users do get interrupted almost every time the battery is low... and many charge it just enough to finish their work in the rush, do the job... forget to plug the damn thing again and will have to charge it once more the next day. It's an "anti-useful" design most users hate because there is no good reason for it being the way it is. 

If that never happened to you and you were really never bothered by some interruption (for no reason, just because Apple wanted you to get interrupted), either you're a perfect human or simply a fanboy.
What do you mean?
It's a bad design undeniably, accept it and move on.
You got me to look into this. Apparently there are mice out there with on board storage to save things like configurations for buttons (mostly gaming mice that re made to be used on multiple computers without having to reset button preferences), so some mine *do* have onboard memory.

I also found a 14 year old article where someone basically embedded a USB thumb drive into the case of a PC mouse so it could be used both as a mouse *and* as a data storage device. There was even some speculation as to how one could enable button macros so that the drive wouldn't mount until *after* a series of button clicks, but they never got around to implementing that portion.

In short, I could find zero articles about active mouse exploits, but have to admit I only spent a few minutes looking our of curiosity.
Go back to your wired mouse, problem solved.
Moving the port to the front would create the imbalance. Moving the port to the top would barely solve the problem. Would make the mouse useable, but even worse to handle
Charging phones and mouses is more or less the same thing.  You take this small object, plug it into the USB, go take a break for a little while, and it works.  If you rarely ever use your computer, then its easier to keep it plugged in.  I am constantly on my computer.   Yeah, sometimes it will tell me that it needs to charge at a bad time, so I have to take a 20 minute break.  It nearly ran out on me last night.  I put it on the charger, went to bed, woke up with 100% and despite a full day of use today, it still says 100%.   Worst comes to worst, I take a fucking bathroom break, put it on the charger, and when I come back it will have enough charge to get me through what I was doing.  

&#x200B;

I just never thought it was some issue to get bothered over.  The phone running out of charge has ALWAYS been a bigger problem for me.  Especially if I am spending some long day doing something somewhere and have am not sure if it will completely run out of charge, that is when I also will usually be in extreme need of the phone.    


I have plenty of design issues with the user experience of Apple products.  The mouse is super low on my list that I consider it a non-issue.    


Of all the rechargeable battery products I have ever owned the Apple mouse has been the least problematic.  I am not saying that either it or myself are perfect, I am just saying that it is such a non-issue that I don't even think about it.    


You don't have to call me a fanboy, or somehow make this about 'me'.  Not everyone is you either, most people are not overly bothered by such a trivial issue because most people are not complainers.
I mean it exactly as I said it
I don’t think the location of the port makes it a bad design. It’s actually good design to deprioritise something you don’t need or use. 

I think it’s bad design because it’s a horrible mouse to actually work with. The port is fine.
Get off reddit, problem with who comments where solved
by "top" I mean front. It wouldn't create any imbalance, you can move the ICs back and redesign the mouse to retain balance. And you can use the mouse while charging

Or you could just pick up a well designed mouse e.g. an mx-master 3s.
Oh I see

You’re saying since it’s the only thing I know it means I can’t complain
> It’s actually good design to deprioritise something you don’t need or use.

Why is physically and logically disabling the mouse when it needs to be plugged in "good design"? What design requirement is that satisfying?

Why do you think it's not a valid use case to want to use the mouse while it's charging?

how to get the old (like a couple of weeks ago) reddit UI back
I swear the interface was different just a few hours ago how do I get that interface back?  
Using reddit on chrome windows.

Also there is now no warning when you get redirected \*\*\*\* reddit.
This shit is horrible. I am not even opted into a beta test.

So much wasted space. Everything is so chunky. Nothing good about this except for that it scrolls a lot better now in Safari.
It just switched over for me and I'm genuinely upset over it. It looks like a clone of the xhitter layout and is so awful to look at and use. It's 100% a case of MBA's mandating changes so they can pretend they're doing something useful at the quarterly meetings. No one with any sense for UI would have signed off on this.
This is a beta version of the new Reddit design and it's being tested on some users. 

In your account settings you should be able to opt out of beta testing. But if this doesn't work, don't worry, it should go back in a few days.
Wow, something is seriously wrong w/ people involved in this redesign.  Zero request for feedback, they just jammed a crappy new UI it on us, for no discernible benefit.   

And after all these years how can they not have user-designated skins?  Heck GMail has that, even WINAMP had that back in the day.  It's not that f-ing hard...
I too want the old mobile version back. Went searching for answers and it seems I don’t have a choice.

It’s a worse version of the app  version and I hate both.
Chiming in to say I hate it.
I hope every manager and designer involved in forcing this new New design on people loses their job. What an unusable piece of trash. 

Words can't express how much I hate this, it's shit in every conceivable way. Why the fuck are replies comments hidden by default and I have to click on fucking Expand 100 times per thread. 

The shitty buttons instead of showing every option immediately (there is plenty of space), the slow browsing, the atrocious text/username/UI color balance that was made by someone with 0 design skills, and much more - everything is wrong with it. If you're listening, admins (although why would you) - here's your fucking feedback, trash.
this is so bad i need the old reddit back i will pay lol
[deleted]
It just switched over for me in the last few minutes. I hate it!
Just chiming in to say this is horrible.  I just hit something accidentally and now more than half the page is taken up by....I have no idea what it is.  PLEASE give us an option for old reddit.
I don't like the new layout.  It feels really inefficient and feels like X.
it sucks, you can try [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com) not sure that will help.
This new forced layout is literal trash.
I’ve been in it for weeks, too. And the worst part of it is I’m not able to comment on any posts on desktop. I can reply to other comments, but can’t comment on the post directly. So I’ve been using https://new.reddit.com and that solved it for me for now.
This shit so ass
How do I opt out???
I'm struggling with this too and also hate it. I actually liked the last reddit redesign (for the most part. Images sucked.) and been using that. This? Old reddit is better than this is.

I'm also not opted in to beta testing and to make it worse. . .my experience on reddit switches back and forth between the two.
Same, I was surprised it was possible to make the layout even worse, but they pulled it off.
Adding in my 2 cents, this new layout is awful and clunky and UGLY. What is the point of having an opt-out for Beta testing if you're going to force it on people anyway?
You can get back to a good user interface at

[new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com)

&#x200B;

I don't know how to navigate without a CLOSE button or RETURN TO TOP button.
I am close to just walking away and finding a new site because this is hit garbage. u/reddit - bring back the browser from a few weeks ago. this is terrible.
So, I'm not opted into the Beta test.
But after being forced into it anyway, I decided to make use of [r/beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/).
Where I can't even post to begin with.
And guess where the [Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/submit?title=%5BFeedback%5D+&selftext=true) button leads to...

Is Reddit trying to outstupid Unity?
I got the stupid new UI on mobile just now. I'm not subscribed to beta :/

but since I'm forced in beta anyway, let me give you my feedback reddit, it's very dumb! about 40% of the screen of my tablet, while reading this very post, is showing me random ass posts from across reddit? about some US politicians and some other weird stuff. What the hell? it's not even related to the type of subs I joined. and it's eating WAY too much screen space! please don't let this crap be on the live version ever! also the comment box is glitchy and erases stuff as I use auto fill, and doesn't auto capitalize :/

they're rolling out tiktok-ified version of the UI so that they can try to make reddit more profitable lmfao don't worry it will be even more halfbaked than the current ui and even less functional but you will be able to scroll through galleries of vertical videos!
Everytime the same, when something is good then some idiots redesign it for be better and modern. For the the sake of users, they say, but they dont think about that the users dont like it.  Youtube, firefox, google, facebook, every one did this. Dont be like that Reddit!
If this is where Reddit is headed, I am done with Reddit
this shit is a disgrace to web design
Yeah dude for some reason I cant even see my custom feeds unless I go to the settings page which pulls up the old ui. like who tf approved this? basic functions of the site are missing like tf?
I have no idea how to go back, this UI looks like shit. I want the old UI back
Just happened to me this design is horrible
You have been conscripted into the service of Reddit as a UI tester for the new UI they are working on. As a testing product. not all the settings are respected and it is not fully functional. You cannot fix it or opt out, but it will revert back when you are removed from testing. This is usually in a few days to a couple weeks. [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com)  will give you the same look, but the links will lead back to the test UI
It changed for me too, now I can't click to just view the image and it forces me to go to the post.
How is it possible to be a beta tester? How do they know what version to push to my device or devices? It’s not like it comes from their servers. It’s from Apple’s (I’m on iOS). They don’t even know my email address linked to the store. What they give Apple a bunch of different versions and it’s a crap shoot who gets what version?
The absolute worst part of this (which is horrid all around) is the threading of messages with long replies. It keeps forcing me into new screens to read topics with really active conversations. I mean what the hell is up with that? I hate the bolder fonts, auto arranging threads in order I don't want, previews I don't want, etc. but all of that doesn't prevent me from having a conversation once I click the sort order.

Also loading is slow as hell now. 

wtf. This is worse than trying to use the ipad app that nobody likes.
this is awful.
Shit gives me a migraine.
Just make a new account.  Gives me a migraine....
Any way to get out of this crappy iu? I saw a language beta in my settings, but nothing else and no way to opt out. If it doesn't change soon, I will just quit reddit until it changes back or for good. My kids would like the for good.
Horrible new format. The sections on the left (communities, etc.) are very distracting, as are the sections on the right.
Just voicing my disgust in this new UI. It's genuinely horrible
I just got switched to some shit that completely changed the sidebars and and completely removed my Karma from the UI.

I can't even tell how many downvotes I got today after this change. Meanwhile, I've got a fully expanded list of communities on the left that I don't need because the drop down was enough on the rare occassion I wanted to go to a specific sub.

Not to mention...it's not completely black anymore, it's some weird greyish green colour, the comment UI is trash, the whole thing gives me a headache looking at it and the words and elements all run together. I literally think I'm going to need a different pair of glasses just to read reddit now.

Absolute trash.

I tried going into settings and opting out of the new reddit....but that gave me the REALLY old reddit from years ago and I hate that design too. I just want to go back to what I was using literally this morning.

EDIT: The new UI doesn't even keep my own post at the top. I had to click a "View more" button to find this post so I could edit it, just so I could also say the fucking notification button no longer pops up a window, but immediately changes the entire tab to a new screen, so I can no longer just check my latest few notifications while on whatever page I'm on.

This whole design is garbage. Especially since sub comments are automatically hidden, I have to click each individual comment to read it.

Whoever designed this...quit your job.
Just switched today for me too and I hate it. I have to wait for a brand new, full page to load to see my notifications?? How could this ever be considered an improvement?
The new new design is so hostile I went back to "old reddit", I was OK with the old new design but this new new one is absolute trash.
Same, it's completely different to yesterday and it's fucking atrocious. How the hell do I even find my inbox???
ugh the redesign is ugly, wonky, ect
Dunno whats going on here? At least keep subs/communities UI stuff out of the margins if you are going to add this much. so much empty space
redesign literally hurts my eyes... If you want to increase the discussion font because it's so damn small, the whole page goes even more wonky. Just keep the existing design!!! 

Also, the irony that [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) takes you to the older design. Engineers...
Fix for Firefox users:

[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-new-reddit-redirect/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-new-reddit-redirect/)
It's pretty bad.  It's weird how ingrained my habits were in me. Still the new UI is pretty shitty.

- no way to close out of post, or return to the feed at the same position in your scroll ( that I know of). I have to set it to "open posts in a new tab" which just makes a bunch of unnecessary tabs in my browser

- so they removed usernames from the home page too? Not sure when that happened, but that's annoying. They claimed it was to make room on the mobile version, but we're on desktop. Please let us at least have control on what we see on home page posts 

- microanimations are very unnecessary on a site like this. 

- is it me or did the default text get way smaller.  

- dark mode is suddenly very high contrast and painful to look at.

- what the actual fuck
Why would they add a UI layout that makes everything look like a single wall of text?  The only way to see where one post ends and one begins is to look for the vote buttons. 

Is it even possible to change back?
Is this the new dark teal chonky UI?  It's awful on desktop.  And there is no way to get rid of it.
No Dark mode and tiny threads for reply's before it has to load another page... this sucks!
It's terrible, and it's really, REALLY not accessible at all for users with different problems.
I have two Reddit accounts.  My newer second account hasn't been affected by any redesign.  My older original account (this one) has been affected and looks atrocious and I hate it!  On both accounts the" Opt into beta tests" is turned off!
I misss the Custom Feeds!  
I've used them a lot. I can not even view them to find all these users and subreddits again which i had in my custom feeds.
HORRIBLE!!! I do not ticked beta  testing so why did you pick me huh?? Now I cannot post anywhere with 800 karma points, is this a joke??? I never will use this site again if it'll be like this. I DON'T WANNA BETA TESTING SO REVERT ME BACK!!!
There isn't even any way to opt out of this shit...and no dark mode now.

&#x200B;

Site is a joke
New looks is ok, but. Very slow now.
Back to the future...

[https://new.reddit.com/](https://new.reddit.com/)

This is the version without the garbage interface, but not ye olde reddit.
And old reddit can see removed videos or pictures, but new Reddit just decided to remove the entire thing and leave a "post removed" note.
You can opt out of beta testing in your account settings, But it will revert back eventually.
Does anyone know how to turn on dark mode? I can’t find an option anywhere. I’m on mobile, tried using desktop website and it keeps bumping me back to mobile. I really don’t want to download the app, especially with everything looking awful.
I go to [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) and that works for me, even though what I wanted to get rid of was the 'new' layout
I don't even mind the UI that much, though I preferred the old one and I hate the automatic comment nesting, but this seems to have broken spoilertags for some subs I'm on so it's actively impeding functionality.
All of this sucks, and did they get rid of night mode for the browser? I can't find the setting anywhere. Literally just switched on me.
# Things Change, Deal With The New One...
Adding my voice here.

I don’t like the new design. I do not want to beta test new features. 

I WANT YOU TO USE MY SAVED PREFERENCES

ffs you JUST got my inbox working in the new UI but now it won’t disregard the notification red circle unless I go into desktop mode 🤦‍♀️
I hate it. I'm about to express my vote by logging off for a couple of days.  If I wanted to open a new tab every time I touched the page I know how to do it.  And why is it hiding count comments to link me to deleted posts?
The new UI was just forced for me a day or so ago and boy do I absolutely loathe it. I will probably stop using the website if it doesn't revert. Quality has been steadily dropping the last year anyway.
This shit is cancer, i opted out and still it keeps this shitty lay out
UI change has stopped showing insights on the posts . Is it with everyone or just me ?
Please please please, did someone ask Google to adopt their horrible "material" UI?

STOP THE MADNESS!

It's not so much that it looks terrible, it's super inefficient. Fonts and spacing are terrible,NL everything lacks frames and structure, and it fits half the amount of content compared to the old UI.

PLEASE COME TO YOUR SENSES, PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF IT.
I am forced into using dark mode. I hate dark mode. Let me go back to black on white please for the love of god. I don’t user dark mode for anything for a reason.
Mine just changed today. On mobile. Looks horrible and my eyes are having a hard time reading any channels and posts with this layout. The design doesn't even seem to fit the vertical mobile layout since some text gets cut off on the right.
It seems to have gone back. Is it real?
It brings me to seperate pages when I click on images and takes an extra moment to buffer when loading videos, I hate it sm
This is the absolutely worst. I HAAAAATE, just absolutely CANNOT STAND this new design. The old one was so user friendly. You could easily scroll though title of posts, read the submission, and comments. You could easily click on the OP and see their comments. There was also a great "Updates" feature that was easy to find to see if anyone posted an update.

This new version is garbage. Who on earth is responsible for this? Some moron who wants to destroy Reddit? Did some Wall Street hack gain control of this site to wreck it? This redesign is so bad it feels like deliberate sabotage as revenge. Who here mad some big wig cry so bad that they'd do this? Fess up! /s
New interface is trash. Will literally just stop using the site
The new interface is so horrible, the fact that you gotta click on a post to see tthe photos or videos makes it worst
You guys are trippin. It's way more helpful than before.
Also chiming in to say I hate it. Noticed everything's weird after a month or so away and thought "hey, reddit didn't use to be this way"

What happened to dynamic loading of posts on top of the feed and, most annoyingly, notifications *not* being a dropdown menu and now necessarily redirecting to its own page? Just godawful.
This just happened to me. I can't even stay on here long reading. I can't get it to go back to what it was, either. This is so awful. Did anyone come up with a way to get the (browser) interface back? This redesign is so busy and un-peaceful that I want to cry, honestly. Had NOT opted into Beta testing and it is still turned off. This seems to have happened when I updated by browser, so had logged out. HELP.   
Edit: It looks like Instagram does in a browser. I cannot stand this. Love the communities I follow and I cannot deal with this new design at all.
I want the old 2 weeks back aswell, this shit is ugly.
I would really like to be able to see who's posted something without having to click into it. Can't imagine why they would take that out. Feels like everything is now click-baitey.
I wrote a small Tampermonkey script that replaces "www" with "new"

[https://pastebin.com/LD1nhWCF](https://pastebin.com/LD1nhWCF)
Oh god it just forced this onto me and now I feel like I'm browsing Xhitter. Make it stop!
[Reddit Settings](https://www.reddit.com/settings/feed) Here you can find some Compact view setting if that helps
So awful. Everything that was just fine chilling at the top of the screen is now on the left, squishing everything else. And when I click on links, they don't open a new tab anymore, and it glitches when you hit the "go back" arrow.
Yeah, it's beyond horrible. I cna't even add a comment to the OP. Can onyl reply to other comments. 

This new layout is either a troll by some people working there or Reddit has hired some people with serious mental issues. No way anyone of sound mind could come up with this and think it is good.
Always amazes me how you can easily fuck something up like this and at the end of the day just say "yep, that'll do". With all tech companies, how the fuck does this consistently keep happening?
Please! Is there some way to make this stop? I didn't sign up for anything "beta test wise" either and also didn't see any options to opt out of whatever  the fuck this is in my settings. I HATE this new user interface! Please bring my old scroll back! This looks like somebody eating paste designed it! 🤬
Worst of all for me, you used to be able to expand and shrink posts, images and videos, now you need to open the posts.

I'm sure they want more ad views, but the user experience is greatly degraded.
There is an option in preferences to go back to "old reddit" but it doesn't take you back to the version that I know, it goes to what is apparently a REALLY old version which is also quite bad.
I hate the new version.  Like the previous,  hate this new current version so much I am going back OLD version
Good advice, except I can't get to my profile settings.  The only option is clicking on my avatar, and a dialog box pops up.  But when I move the cursor to click on it, it disappears.
Where in settings can you opt out? I cannot find it.
How do I give feedback about how horrible it is?
Are you certain ? Can it be accelerated ? I did not ask for this nor did I give consent .
it has been a week since i have been forcibly opted into this shitshow, it is not reverting
[deleted]
It's forcing my phone onto new Reddit. Same beta test or some other nonsense?  I've already opted out.
The new design is awful. Low information density, poor visual separation.
How do I tell them that it sucks?
I can’t even get into my settings to change it either. This is terrible.
i dont mind the new layout but i want it to be dark again, where can i go to complain D:
I cannot find a setting to opt out. This is effing awful.
Seems to me the goal is to intentionally sabotage the browser experience to push people to use the app.
to be fair, their metric might be as simple as time spent on service before/after change.
**I'd love to design my own skin for some websites,** ***I frequently go to.***

Especially since, *we actually have real UI/UX tools now.*
The WebDevs
Browse it through Google without the app

It's the only way Reddit is usable anymore on mobile without a log in

At least as an old fart that's dropping all other social media, one at a time
THANK YOU! THIS!! 👆👆👆
100% this. I had a lot on my mind when I hopped on today and didn't even realize the change. Then I just started getting angry and annoyed for no apparent reason. Then it hit me.
Only my desktop version has changed so far. My mobile app remains the same for now. 

You mentioned something that's driving me nuts: Having to follow the tiny line on the side to find the +/- to expand *every freaking reply*. They've gotta at least give us the option to have everything expanded by default. 

This really is a case of taking something that works and breaking it.
As OS runescape and WOW classic learned, yes you will. haha
Just make a burner account to use for a few weeks.
Don’t give them ideas
This is it. I'm having Myspace's déjà-vu... they'll ruin this and act like "i don't think we did anything wrong with it...¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ "
I've been on this hot trash for I think a couple weeks. Yesterday it reverted back and I was pumped because I thought the testing was over. Having the old format back actually made me realize just how terrible the redesign was. Then today, the trash is back. I think it may actually be worse this time around? A) if your gonna use me for testing at least let me leave feedback about how utterly garbage what I'm testing is and B) how this trash made it to this point is unreal. Do the people making it even use the site? If someone delivered that to me I'd tell them, "You did a terrible job, you don't know what you're doing, and you need to scrap this and start over".
Same. Don't like it one bit.  


I don't want to read the content before clicking the title ffs.
Yeah its really really bad
I don't like it either.
I have the problem too. I have white background and messed up ui on feeds. How can I fix it. Dark mode is only in profile settings. I have always beta testing off so why am I seeing this crap
https://new.reddit.com should bump you back to the previous release.
You can still get the old-old reddit, but to me, that's the worst iteration. It's probably why I hadn't joined for so long. But we're stuck with the this version instead of the new-old reddit until they decide to stop this latest terrible experiment.
There's an option for old reddit on desktop, but not in the app.
Oh geeze, I didn't even think this through, but you're right.

  
Yeah though, the new layout is horrible for actually scanning through new articles. I don't really care that much about the comment section, but the rest is awful.
Tumblr changed their UI to look more like X, and it actually looks better than this new Reddit format. That’s really saying something, considering you have to download a free xkit extension run by volunteers just to make that site usable.
Okay I don't actually want that old just back to a few weeks ago.
[new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) works for me too, thanks!
Haha, thanks for the suggestion, but this is my new reddit experience...

https://ibb.co/wy2wckS
You have to make a new account
can you post when you opt into beta in the settings?
In case you haven't found out by now, you can disable recommendations in your settings! (Go to "feed settings") Like this you'll see only subs you've joined. And ads of course.

The layout still sucks though. Did it change back in your case?
Is there any place we can go to give feedback? If I'm being forced to test this then I want to make it emphatically clear how much I hate it.
This is soooo wrong. Not that you are wrong, but doing this is very very wrong without the ability to switch back.
God heard my prayers with this link. God send you are.
Select "card view" instead of "classic"!
the design would likely have been downloaded with an update weeks ago, so the app is able to display reddit in its various forms at any time, the change of the design is then triggered by a random per user setting on their end that you can't access but they can
This has been my experience too. I had a lovely time in the comments section for the best part of a year but atm I can't spend too much time here. The white glare is too much and actually puts me off typing a response even if I make it through a good post. Too many things are inaccessible now. I only use a laptop as I consider my mobile, which is ancient and as app-free as is realistic to be these days, as an actual phone.
>Also, the irony that

>new.reddit.com

> takes you to the older design. Engineers...

Thank you!!  That's a relief to see that again.. for however long it lasts.
Kewl 😎 thanks!👍
Super thanks!
Same here.
I didn't have beta testing enabled, they are forcing this to users. Only option is to go back to OG old reddit.
Where is that in the settings? Is the app or on the website?
You're the hero I needed today!
Has not gone back for me still this new awful interface.
the fact that you cant even click out of the post anymore is horrid
the fact that you cant even click out of the post anymore is horrid
the fact that you cant even click out of the post anymore is horrid
Omg me tooooo I hate this design 😭😭😭 How do I switch it back, this looks so wrong!
Hero. Thank you!
Just got it on my PC. It's unbearable
shitty UI/UX designers who are completely full of themselves who should be booted out of the industry that is how.
Was hoping it would be getting better, but I still hate it.
Strangely enough, it reverted back to the previous "New Reddit" today.

Thank god.
Now there's no way to use the old version without using desktop view on mobile and it's legitimately awful enough I'm just going to stop using Reddit at this point. You can't open pictures without opening the entire post anymore. Who thought this was a good idea lol
That should not be happening. But I believe you can get there with a specific URL. I'll send it here when I get home and can access my PC
Settings->Account->scroll all the way down->Opt into beta tests

And if it's turned off, like it is for me, then just take it as another sign that Reddit is speedrunning down the shitter.
Seriously what the hell, absolutely unusable on my XR
I never use the app. I tried it once then immediately uninstalled. I’ve always used the mobile browser version and now that’s busted.
God, you've subjected to it for weeks? It's the literal worst. Why is 1/4 of the screen now taken up by things that were perfectly fine as drop downs at the top? Why do notifs change the page you were on instead of opening a new tab? And it's super glitchy, but there's no way to report the errors. There isn't one thing I like about it. Was anyone asking for this? 

If their goal was to get me to be more productive and spend less time on reddit, then mission accomplished!
Every feature has been downgraded. I hate the layout, even down to the font. It's squished and cluttered and gives me a headache. The things that were on the top are now packed in on the left side for some reason. It loads super slow. And notifications don't automatically open a new tab anymore. Ugh. Why was any of this necessary?
That still looks different to me.

For me the previous web interface had no way to see chats and notifications.

FFF

&#x200B;

Edit:. The appearance of FFF is a surprise to me, but I'm leaving it in because it accurately describes part of my what I'm feeling.
haha, I accidentally put myself there when I was checking my beta settings.  This was before my time but holy crap!  

I hope "they" understand that these comments aren't the typical resistance to change.  It's actually a big downgrade with a not-very-obvious purpose.
you can use previous new reddit as well. use [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com)   but they didnt give us a FUCKING DEFAULTING OPTION LIKE THEY DID WITH [OLD.REDDIT.COM](http://old.reddit.com) IN THE SETTINGS.
Just like me
Same for me.  Gets even worse when backspacing within a comment.

Took off the "new" to come back here and submit this.
Omg that screenshot made me LOL
Tried that already and nope.

Funny enough, I only found r/beta in my subreddit list when using the old design, suggesting I wasn't supposed to find it in the first place.
thanks! unfortunately it still shows me unrelated subs anyway.

nope looks like I'm stuck with it now. I've decided to use [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com) when I want to browse now, bc only about 50% of the screen for the post is too ridiculous, dunno what they were thinking.
There isn't. A few weeks ago they asked for feedback in the weekly recap pinned post here but had never done that before or since that time.  They appear to not be concerned about what people think.
There are also browser extensions now that help you stay in new.reddit.com.  I don’t know their names but I know they exist
Wouldn’t getting a beta version without my permission be against the App Store Rules? Just curious.
Some people said it vanished after a few days. It really is ruining my evenings. I love to relax reading the subs I follow in the evening and I could not stay reading longer than five minutes. I really just can't stand it.
Someone posted this and it does make it sort of like the previous interface. Yes, even though it says "new" reddit, it is more like the previous. Whew. 

[https://new.reddit.com/](https://new.reddit.com/)
Hey mate! Here is a newer version of the script, the first has issues opening images, it fixes it.  
[https://pastebin.com/UkA6U4mM](https://pastebin.com/UkA6U4mM)
'90s forums had peak UI.
Hey, thanks!

But shortly after typing that, someone posted a link that takes us back to the old version.  For now anyway, I'm a happy camper.  The link is [https://new.reddit.com/](https://new.reddit.com/)

Also, if it helps, I got to my profile and beta testing was disabled.
just did that, had  no affect.
Thanks, I’m on my phone browser and I had to request the desktop site to even see it. It was turned off for me so I guess ive been forcibly opted in.

Plus now I have a new problem, I can’t do anything in the new version other than click the header options. Can’t comment or expand post. I had to return to desktop request version to even reply to you. This is a mess.
Reminds me of Yahoo's takeover of Tumblr.  Why buy something for the user base then chase off the user base?
That's what I've always done too, and today...ZAP! IT'S GONE. I HATE THIS!!! 

Whyyyyyyyy
Haha, yeah it's the first time I've actually ever thought about finding a different option. It really is pretty unbelievable. Like this garbage never should have made it past some point in the development process and that point should have been FAR before it reached any of us.
Damn that's frustrating... This layout feels like a shitty twitter knock off and is almost unusable... 

Thank you for the reply!
to be fair, on desktop, this isn't so bad if just had a dark mode. expanding comments and how deep that happens on its own should be an option though
I just found one, it works. Thank you.
you're not getting a beta version of the app, you're getting the same app as everyone but the way it displays its content is switched up.

its a beta design and i'm sure its not because countless apps do things like this all the time.
They give apple a picnic table to put on the app store. But reddit can control the table cloth
Thanks 🙏
Thank you for posting that link, it auto switched to that crap version that wastes 1/3 of my screen today, you're saving me
nice :)
Thank you!
amazing mate, that helped!
There's an even older version available at https://old.reddit.com

It's my preferred UI
Thank you!
Oh thank the good lord jesus.
Thank god
Thank you so much!
new.reddit.com no longer works
YOOO THANK YOUU
This is gone now.. RIP
I just went to  someone posted a link that takes us back to the old version. For now anyway, I'm a happy camper. The link is [https://new.reddit.com/](https://new.reddit.com/)

THANK  YOU!!! this helps a great deal -
Yeeeah... It do be like that.

Guinea pigs rarely have a say in the matter.
Just happened to me too, looks like I'm done with Reddit. The UI on the app is terrible and there's a reason people use the browser version still
I could not get mine to switch back and then it suddenly did, but I'm sticking with new.reddit and not taking any chances. You're welcome. That other version is hell.
God. Why?
It does for me.  In fact, I'm reading this on new.reddit.
We are the product.
They’re basically forcing a browser based app to shove more ads at us, awful design and my XR couldn’t even handle it, I had to make a new account that isn’t opted in
maximum information density, combined with Reddit Enhancement Suite browser addon.

I see like 7-8 posts per screen on new. and 20/30 posts on old.
This is  my preferred  as wwll
His name was Adrian viedt.
Out with the old and in with the new! Sapphire Nitro+ R9 390 to 7800XT
The new GPU for my build compared to the old one. Both Sapphire Nitros'
That's gonna be a massive upgrade. I am surprised you were able to keep using a 390 that long.
Crazy how the cooler design on that R9 380 still looks modern today. Everyone else was too busy making their GPUs look gamery.
Which one is which ?
Wow.. I came from a 2080 and thought my upgrade was huge! You must be in heaven right now! That’s a monumental upgrade!
Also upgraded from a R9 390, night and day performance upgrade! 

Enjoy it to the max!
I got my daughter that same card for Christmas as an upgrade for her 1080 non Ti.  I've had good luck with Sapphire Nitro+ cards. 

How do you like it so far?
Wow!! It must have started to be really too tight even in 1080p Low/Medium on titles that are less than 2 years old, I don't know how you managed to last that long but it's true that at the same time its 8GB GDDR5 of VRAM with 512bit bus bandwidth made it very futureproof for its time of release.

As I remember the last Radeon R9 that I had was a CrossFire combo of 2 Sapphire Radeon R9 280X 3GB TOXIC OC Edition it was in 2014 it seems to me and this until 2017 when I switched to a combo of Radeon RX VEGA 64 (Sapphire still but in Nitro+ Limited Edition), this is actually my last CrossFire combo, support for this technology having been removed from the first RDNAv1.0 cards (RX 5700/RX 5700 XT)...

Too bad, a whole era... Even if the performance return was not doubled, the performance gain could at worst only be 30-40% but in the best cases we saw gains of up to 90%. Which was still not too bad and I'm sure that all this could have been optimized much better, when we see the "SAM" or "Resizable BAR" which is a technology dating from the development of PCIexpress 2.0 (which dates of 2007) but which was finally taken into account and activated under the initiative of AMD but only since 2019 so they still took 12 years to take into account this option that he had on hand and which could bring us gains, so my question now: what is hidden or rather what could all these brands have missed in terms of optimization from PCIexpress 3.0 to 5.0?...
I had the same 390 model. What a beastly card at the time, and a very nice design from sapphire. :-) 

Then came VR to destroy my dreams of gpu performance. :-(
The 7800xt with the big cooler must be one hell of a silent beast.
That's quite the leap. *The future is now, old man.*
Thats one hell of a jump. Congrats and enjoy
Oh man. I forgot about my old R9 390. Loved that card.

Sold it a few years back on ebay for 150 bucks to some kid. He was so happy! Made me feel good I was passing it along to someone who could get more use out of it.
Maybe this deserves a separate thread on it's own but has anyone with a 7000 series gpu have trouble with random 1 second black screens. They happen so random and frequently. Tried most solutions that I could find online already and at this point I'm starting to live with it, even though I paid alot for my new rig.
I am using dual sapphire nitro 390, still works well
That's a sexy, sexy card.
I also went from a Sapphire Nitro R9 390 to a 6700 XT last year. The R9 390 was still going strong, but heat was becoming an issue even after a thorough cleaning and reapplying paste. That thing was money well spent.
Dayum! Now that's an upgrade. Enjoy it king.
I just made the same transition! Asus ROG Strix R9 390 8GB to the Sapphire Nitro+ 7800 XT. In the 390's final years it was held together with zip ties and software fan control. I must say the physical build quality on the new Nitro+ is great, but the GPU support bracket they provide is idiotic, not fit for purpose and scuffed my case - two cheap stands from Amazon worked a lot better.
Is sapphire a good gpu manufacturer?
Got mine last month, it’s a beast ! Enjoy !!
Sapphire cards have always looked great.
I used to have that model of 390. I loved it! Glad you got good use out of it.
7800XT is gunna last you a long while. Unless you upgrade your monitor. 😬
Nice upgrade, enjoy!
I just upgraded to a 7800xt for the past month, been incredibly surprised after going from a 2080ti to this thing and having better and more stable framerates. You will be pleased for sure since the new drivers have fixed the bugginess!
XFX Speedster MERC319 RX 7800 XT Black edition with free game avatar.
Finger crossed
Why not Nvidia
Sir I can't tell the difference, which is 390? I have never seen one in my real life and somehow 390 looks so modern. (I don't know which one is it so that's how it is modern)
crazy cooler for a card that old. no wonder Chinese refurbishing effort is what it is. These old and tough coolers needs new lives they still have it
Came from a GTX Titan X on a laptop external gpu connection to a new build w/ 7800xt


Btw the 7800xt is a mid range 1440p beast.
Damn.. I'm on and since the 280x but in the end they all just die with graphical bugs. How did yours survive? 
maybe I should go ahead and buy the more expensive cards. I was on the 280x 480 and 6700xt level.. maybe I should go for the 8900 next time.
Nice!  I just got the Powercolor Hellhound 7800 as well to replace my Vega64.
That's one hell of an upgrade.
nice dude , I went 1080 --> 7800xt just recently and have no regrets going to team red. Awesome card.
Both brilliant graphics cards

Enjoy the pc Dude
just put in my 7900 xtx mine is a xfx though
I had the same nitro 390, it was great until it died.
What an *incredible* jump in performance, holy shit lol.
Sapphire cards are pretty incredible
That's an absolutely EPIC upgrade you got yourself there. Now, make sure your CPU isn't going to bottleneck the hell out of your new card! You should have a Ryzen 5600X at the minimum to let that bad boy soar.
Crazy how that 8-year-old graphics card has a design that looks like it could have come out this year.
I had 390 back in the day, loved that card :) upgraded to 5700xt and now to 7900xtx
I know this is a weird thing to say and I know it costs a lot more money but I would really recommend going with the 7900 XTX Nitro+ instead, you get such a massive amount of bonuses just for a couple hundred more you get like 1/3 more performance + you get the most amazing heat sink & hot swappable fans I've ever seen on a card.

The nitro+ stuff comes with the ability to remove the fan blades if they malfunction and replace the entire assembly this way the whole card doesn't need to be replaced, they just ship you the parts and you replace it yourself it's super simple to do.
I got a 7600
Congrats!!
Make sure to undervolt the 7800xt junction temp likes rise on this one
Congratulations homie! I got my 7800XT on Black Friday and its a beast! Came from a 2070 Super
That’s a huge jump, congrats!
How many watts should I be running I have OC turned on and it’s pushing 300watts in game. But in the pre game lobby is only 200. My temps are cool still at 56c and gpu hotspot under 80c
Epic! Im planning on making my two r9 270x’s (been holding onto them for a while) into wall art since they served me so well
Just built my first PC and used this card for the build! Card is a beast so far!
That is a big jump.  Well done!
That r9 390 design probably looked godlike back then
I would have waited a month personally, because the Super refresh is going to drive prices down. But still, grats man.
Awesome card.. Been using this card for the past month, upgrade over a rx6700xt nitro+ (a very good card), a massive difference.. At the moment, playing Avatar FOP, graphics are superb.. It's amazing how this card stays very cool.. max 65° (open case)
Bro I had that card then upgraded to a 1080ti, in 2018 idk how you managed to hold on this long, major props to you...
Gz on the upgrade, I have this card as well. It's really very impressive. At stock I found the fan curve is a bit chilled out so I have a custom one set plus a little under-volt, temps hang around 54c fans 1200-1300. Came from a ref. 5700xt📢 😂
Very nice. I finally bit the bullet and replaced my aging RX480 with a Sapphire Pulse RX 7800 XT, and have been both impressed and surprised by the performance.
hope you got a nice CPU upgrade as well!
Congratulations man! Just ensure your fans are spinning. I had zero rpm enabled and the fans werent spinning even at 90C lol.
Nitro+ such a nice card
I upgraded from a 3080 10gb to a 7900xtx, LOVE IT
I've got that card on my wish list, coming from a Vega56. How you like it so far?
[deleted]
I still have my old Devil 13 dual 390 lying around gathering dust.  The 390 was a good chip.
Not sure if anyone has asked yet but how are your thermals in this model? hotspot / memory junction temps are okay?
Nice!
hehehehehe, I made the move from R9 290 Tri x to 7800 xt Nitro +, brilliant card for the price i paid for it.
Nice upgrade dude, how is going?
Any update on your new gpu? Any specific adrenaline settings/bios? Coil whine?
For the last two years it was more surviving then using 😅
R9 390 is really close to GTX1060/RX580 perf, many people still use such cards for 1080p low-medium\~ (on lighter games even high settings)
I have a 390 Nitro, been going strong since launch, shockingly.  Currently in a spare pc with a 5600xt in my wifes and a 7700xt in mine.
8 GB, Vulkan 1.3, DX12_0 support, NimeZ drivers kept it nicely running in all games. Why not?
Pretty sure the one stood up is the 7800XT, it looks a lot cleaner and shinier.

The laid down one looks to have some dust on the front face.
2080 is still relevant
Out of all the cards I have had they have been my fav, and this one hasn't disappointed so far.
The 390 was still pushing 60-120 fps for me @ 1440p last week (with Amernime drivers and a Ryzen 2600 + <3000MHz RAM) with reasonably modest games on a mix of Medium to Very High settings.
> 8GB GDDR5 of VRAM with 512bit bus bandwidth made it very futureproof for its time of release.

And to think now a days we get 8GB on 128-bit bus.
Mine does have a hard time to go over 60 degrees on core. The delta between hotspot and core is quite huge though (or somewhat at least, especially when the card is overclocked to its limit). I keep the card at around 1800 RPM max. Possible to go lower though.
Even the pulse is very silent, especially compared to my older 5700 XT
I'm surprised it barely heats up!
Thank you king!
For AMD cards they are the best imo
Fingers crossed for what?
Personal preference, and I think if you don't want features like RT, streaming, encoding or 3D rendering capabilities for like Blender and stuff you're getting much better value out of AMD cards
I've been asking this question for 20 years, but recently bought 6700XT because reasons and honestly AMD learned to make good GPUs, i don't feel my rig is inferior to team green builds
The bottom one is the R9 390. It does look modern, the only tells are that it has no RGB, a VGA output and no backplate. Which you can't see in the pic.
I'd love to go with a 7900XT or XTX but the pricing and availability is just ridiculous at the moment. There are just no 7900XT's available and the XTX is more than double the price of the 7800XT which is not worth it for my budget considering I also built an entire new pc with that 7800XT.

The 7800Xt is absolutely amazing value at the moment compared to those two options.
Got the 7800 xt merc 319 btw
Glad to hear it! I'm planning on using at at 1440p
I believe it. I had to use an r9 290 last year with a 1440p monitor and it was barely playable
Happy for you my dude, I got the same GPU 2 weeks ago. I love it.
Bought my 390 in 2014 and replaced it last year with a 6800 xt for 500$ off some guy was difference it made
The fact it had 8gb of vram I think helped in keeping it going for a long time
My friends still boss cod and iRacing on 1080 on a 2060 s and 2070s respectfully
Not with new games in 1440p UWQHD my friend. She was starting to really struggle. I couldn’t turn textures and settings down any further for like TLOU Part 1 and yes I know that Starfield doesn’t run great on GeForce GPUs but that’s another one it was really struggling with. It’s just gonna get worse as time goes on.
2080 is good for most stuff but Alan Wake 2 doesn't play well
Sure, you can still get by fine with a 2080 in new releases, but the 7800 XT has about [65% greater performance relative to it](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-2080.c3224) and twice as much VRAM, so it's a pretty sensible upgrade at the current MSRP. 

It's a bummer losing access to DLSS, but RTX owners pre-40 series are likely going to have to opt for FSR3 in future titles anyways if they want to leverage frame generation.
That you didn't lost the lottery

https://www.google.com/search?q=7800+xt+black+screen+site:www.reddit.com
True, but I wish AMD RT didn't suck
I think 4070 and 7800 XT are pretty close overall. With games like Avatar we are seeing that RT can't be turned off (software RT for lower settings, hardware RT for higher settings). In a scenario like that the 4070 pulls away being 18% faster at 1440p ultra settings. Throw in the better upscaling and I just don't see much value advantage for the AMD card aside from the 4GB of additional VRAM. Anyway, no shade, I think the 7800XT is a good card. Enjoy it.
Man I respected that design, by the way I'm happy for your new GPU. Hope you make it worth for every pennies just like you did with 390, I'm amazed with that.
During Black Friday it was on sale for $1000 but there is one sold and shipped by [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/sapphire-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-11322-01-40g/p/N82E16814202428?Item=N82E16814202428&Source=socialshare&cm_mmc=snc-social-_-sr-_-14-202-428-_-12172023) for $1,119.99, still quite a lot but it might suffice.
I was still on 1080p, got this gpu for a full new build and last thing to upgrade is my monitor to 1440p one.
I get 11fps in hell let loose at minimum settings at 1080p. Cannot wait to buy my new build.
Same for me haha. Had the 1060! :)
That's exactly why I went with at least 12 when I finally upgraded. The extra vram on the R9 390 definitely helped its longevity.
Are you planning to upgrade your Cpu as well? Im on a similar boat since i have 580. Im planning to upgrade my psu then my gpu then maybe cpu
I'm currently at a 5700xt, and while a modern high tier GPU will be head and shoulders faster than it, there are very few games it just can't play. no, not at 1440, or ultra settings, but I'm just saying a 2080 is still a pretty darn good card. OP is going from something released 8 years ago, 2080 was 4 years ago, and was a top tier card. I think we get stuck in a not current, not good enough mindset, where a 2080 is still a very good card, and would be an upgrade for man users (including myself).

Sure a modern high tier card is going to out class it, but that's what it should be doing.   


In your link, it's only 20% less than a 4060ti which is a modern $400 card. Says a lot about how good that 2080 was, and still is.
It's good, no issues with it and the Sapphire Nitros' are binned GPUs so I am not worried.
That's just one game, if you turn RT off, the 7800XT easily beats a 4070 and is also cheaper.
When it's 700€ vs 550 € for the 7800 XT, it was an easy choice for me.
I got mine a month or two ago, first of all, my congratulations for this superb improvement, the first thing to do that I advise you to do is to change the ventilation curve of the graphics card, Originally it is silent but it had a tendency to rise too high for my taste on its hottest point, (the sensor) now it makes more noise, but at 300w and 71 degrees at its hottest after 4/5 hours of playing, point I am completely in it satisfied, it's really a superb graphics card, and how beautiful it is!
Whatcha gonna get?
I mean… I still have a rx 480 lol
I upgraded everything, it's part of a brand new build. I went with an i7 13700K for the CPU.
>I think we get stuck in a not current, not good enough mindset, where a 2080 is still a very good card, and would be an upgrade for man users (including myself).

Yeah, like I said, it's still just fine even for new releases. No one was saying the 2080 is bad or irrelevant. The previous commentor simply said the 7800 XT was a big upgrade for them, which I corroborated.
Also got one. :) and had the issue.

As many other owners. Same card, same issue.

A gamble.

I'm happy to hear that you didn't lost. Enjoy the card, it's a good one.
[On average it's about 7% faster in rasterization.](https://www.techspot.com/review/2736-geforce-rtx-4070-vs-radeon-7700-xt/) The 4070 was going for $515 the other day ($540 atm), so not much price difference. Given that we are headed into a future where RT is literally baked into the game it's really not as simple as "turn rt off". Luckily the 7800XT is doing well with Unreal Engine 5 titles since lot of things are tuned for current gen consoles but when games push RT effects (i.e. Ratchet and Clank very high RT) you get a 50% advantage for the 4070. Plus the 4070 pulls about 100 watts less which is good for room thermals and operating cost.
Sure it depends on the region but for me I'd easily pay the $15 - $40 difference for the card that supports higher fidelity. This is definitely a class of card that can use RT effects at 1440p without issue.
Same, 699 CAD for my 7800xt vs 899 CAD for a comparable 4070 model
https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/3RM26D this is the build. Cannot wait to actually play games and not get kicked out of server waiting lists because my PC takes 20mins to load a game.
So I was having those same problems too. However, after raising the power limit to +15%, I’ve had no crashes at all. It’s been perfectly stable. But! I’ve seen transient power spikes of nearly 400 watts! But everything is stable now.
Lmao going from the stone age to the space age in one purchase. That build is going to blow your mind
Users shouldn't have to tweak their cards to fix it :(

Happy you found a solution tho. Tried raising the powerlimit on the Sapphire one, didn't fixed the issue on my Sapphire card.
Now that I agree with. It should work great straight outta the box. Are you out of your RMA warranty period? If not, send that shit back and maybe even try a different manufacturer. I honestly would have stuck with Nvidia if a 4080 wasn’t $1200+.

Edit: forgot to ask about your PSU. Brand and power output. It’s possible that that’s your problem.
I was inside the RMA for the 1st model I got. I'm RMAing the second one (gigabyte) as we speak.

PSU: Seasonic Vertex GX-1000 (https://www.kitguru.net/components/power-supplies/zardon/seasonic-focus-gx-1000-atx-3-0-review/5/), quite good ripple. With a 7800x3D (last bios), no OC, no EXPO, no PBO. All vanilla.

Also tested with another PSU. Same issue with both graphics cards.
Try certified HDMI cable. That solved it for some
Ahh with a 1000w that’s more than enough power for all of that. I’ve heard that most are having no issues after switching to Powercolor. May or may not help you.
Can I do jumpcuts while sitting down?
r/dadjokes didn't accept my post. :(
This is the best post I’ve seen on here in a long time
Yes. But don’t slip while standing.
I fear this joke will start a ripple effect
What does a gen z editor call an edit if it sucks? 

An L cut 

: (
Let me just check that. Sorry no. That’s illegal.
This joke was as 🔥as a match cut
yeah a lot of people don't know this but ...
*sighs*
If you can’t solve it, dissolve it
Do you have any more? Love to hear them.
Murch is always standing while editing, and I don’t think that he has never made a jump cut.  So there is that lol
To make a long story short, I became an editor.
You can match cut only when there’s a match on the tele.
This is funny but I’ve recently started a creative venture with someone and he’s so clueless that this actually feels like something he’d ask 😩
ha ha... ha?
You think you're reel funny, don't you?

Lol. As if Dadjokes denied this. That's mildly infuriating. But also kinda funny that the best dad joke went over the heads of dad joke enthusiasts...
Great post! You get a Star wipe!
I do most of my editing sitting down.
Yikes:)
Only if you [remote in](https://jumpdesktop.com)

Yup, because then you’d slide.
Probably not, but it could wipe you out!
Fear? I hope! This sub is usually crickets. At least this will get people talking more. So who wants to share their demo reel?
It's W cuts only cuz we on that grind 😤

if in doubt, fade it out
As an editing teacher, this joke hurts my soul. ;)
I said that to my producer yesterday when he told me that we'll have to do some creative editing. I'm not sure he got the joke.

Stolen MacBook in Texas now appears in China
My computer and IPad were taken from my car last week. I immediately locked them and tried tracking them with Find my but I knew that without my password, they wouldn’t be able to log into a network so they were just going to be bricks. This morning I woke up to this! Find my tells me my MacBook was found in China. How is that possible? I thought Apple was uncrackable. 
“Find My” doesn’t need WiFi access to work. Probably what happened is that a nearby iPhone saw it on Bluetooth and reported its location to the Find My network. 

It’s similar to how, if you lose your bag somewhere and there’s an AirTag in it, nearly iPhones will see it and report the location.
I am actually from Hong Kong and can possibly help you report it to the local police since it is a local address 🤔
I would just play the sound repeatedly for hours, knowing full well I’m intensely annoying a thief on the side of the world
Get ready. In a few days you will get threatening messages to remove the iCloud activation lock. Crazy stuff like they will take you out type of stuff. Just make sure you send back a lol and middle finger. It’s mostly some skinny nerd in a factory sending those messages.
YouTube video by Barely Sociable on the topic: https://youtu.be/3Ws3YptLmLQ

TL;DW There is a whole black market for stolen Apple products in China, and criminal rings in the US and other countries that feed them the products. They then try to phish you into giving them your Apple account password, and if that won’t work, they ultimately disassemble them and salvage what they can.

The video centers around iPhones, but it very likely extends to all Apple products in some way.
It’s going home <3
Like a salmon swimming back to its birthplace to lay the eggs of future generations!
Do not under any circumstance remove the device, ever.
My stolen macbook ended up in Russia
Great. Play Sound now.
You’re gonna be getting fake messages from apple support or something telling you that you need to remove the device from find my or else all your info will be leaked or some shit
You don't understand how find my works.

It uses Bluetooth LE, so it checks for other apple devices around which are connected and have GPS and provides the location of your device based on the other devices.

BTW no computer is unhackable just more difficult to do so.
Hey, anybody want to buy a MacBook screen? Or keyboard?  Frame is slightly used.
It’s about 15 minutes from my hotel, that area has a lot of street side electric shops, but I rarely see second hand stores selling electronics here.
>I thought Apple was uncrackable. 

Nothing is uncrackable. Never assume that. We've shown time and time again that the the uncrackable is cracked.
It's Time to make it ring during night
As long as the machine appears on your Find My, it’s still blocked. It updates it’s location when another apple device detects it when they’re close, and the other device tells the network where the machine is.
This area has computer repair shops, I guess someone bought it stolen and took it there for “repair”
btw what happens when I erase the device remotely? Is the device bricked after that or can the thieves use it?
I am based in Hong Kong. OP do you need local help?
>I thought Apple was uncrackable.

Homie, NOTHING is uncrackable. It just depends on how much effort someone is willing to go to and how creative they are with getting through or around safeguards 😂
Time to smash that “Play sound” button as much as you can.
Forget it. There's nothing you can really do about it. It'll probably be sold for parts. I vaguely recall a way to wipe the phone through Find My. Try wiping so at least you can prevent them getting into your business through that phone. Idk, just a suggestion.
Maybe a „Back to the roots“-thing, roots of production not of development, of course
Been there. 

Got my phone stolen during a music festival in LA. 

Showed up in some neighborhood in Moscow 3 weeks later.
*Hong Kong
and this is when you cut your losses because they are prob gonna replace the storage memory and some other things to unlock it
It went home. They always go home.
I guess it has been taken apart and sold as parts in the Huaqiangbei electronics market.
They don’t care. They being anybody in law enforcement.
sorry for your loss.

suspect they send to china to flash the t2 chip.
I am from Hong Kong and I know this building, there are many used phone/laptop dealers here, they mostly buy used items from USA and sellers possibly sent stolen stuff also 

Local police won't care, as there is no reported case locally.
How are MacBook repair parts still insanely expensive
I wonder why the MacBook needs to be shipped to the US, stolen and shipped back to its place of origin?  It’s got to be easier to just grab them at the factory or the dock in China before they ever leave?  Or steal them from a neighboring Asian country.  Unless the owner and what he/she has on the laptop are actually the target and not the hardware.
Who told you Apple was uncrackable?  There are plenty of shady third-party “servicers” with Global Service Exchange accounts and can bypass Apple iCloud lock. 
That it’s in China comes as no shocker.
Soon it would be stripped to parts
No surprise
We need an update !
Right back to the source 😂

Sorry for your loss, reddifellow

Curiously wanna to know is any update location for this
Yes, my wife’s iPhone stolen in Rome appeared few months later in Morocco :)
As good as findmy is they really need to add the UWB chip to macs, I had mine stolen last week and I tracked it to an address in London, then a specific gate at Heathrow airport but the police couldn’t do anything as the Bluetooth beacon isn’t accurate enough and the ‘play sound’ from findmy doesn’t work unless the mac is connected to WiFi so it’s pointless! The laptop is now in Algeria never to be seen again

Alot of people seem to have this happen to them where their electronics end up in China. Let's hope it's just for resell after they wipe it or scrap it for what little valuable materials they can scrounge from it. Cuz their might be more malicious intents behind this.
It ran away and went home?
It’s like a salmon going back to their birthplace
Road trip!
They're going to take it apart sadly.
Hey
Pro
Erase that thing!
You thought wrong . I’ve gotten into several locked Mac’s
That was fast
If you dm me the serial number, I can look up any history, like if they took it to an apple store, etc. I would recommend calling and letting Apple know the situation. Sorry, I didn't read all the comments, sorry if this has been recommended already.
If only we could have a way for the iPhone to be set to remotely self destruct by overheating the battery and letting it catch on fire…I think Samsung was onto something with the Note 7, they just couldn’t get it under control…
Happened to an iPhone I lost 15 months before.

  
  
It's gone.
(*) Hong Kong
That's - ahem - Hong Kong.  My iPhone was stolen there (a very rare occurrence - I left it behind on a table) a couple of months ago and I swear it turned up in the same building.  It's been "Erase pending" ever since.  Must have been stripped for parts.
It went home
Classic
Any updates?
Contact Hong Kong Police before it ends up in Mainland China
China steals everything. Why are you surprised?!
All i can think of wheb seeing this picture is next mission checkpoint.  Did you check if fast travel is possible?
I’m feeling some Yuan Is Here. Is it any good?
What lock message is it displaying? I would set something like, "This Mac has been lost or stolen. $XY reward for its safe, undamaged return, to be paid only after inspection."

Where XY = the smallest amount of money that's likely to strongly motivate a thief or finder to return it. That amount would be small in countries where the average worker gets paid less than $50/month, larger where they get paid more.

My goal isn't to catch a thief (which would be nice) but to get my Mac back — unless it's covered by insurance of some kind.
Fucking commies.
I honestly believe they hack the location somehow. Perhaps they put them near an apple device with a location spoofer and make it believe it's in china so you won't bother looking for it anymore. Then they break it apart for replacement parts.
Maybe it’s just trying to find its way back to where it was born…like the Brave Little Toaster.
why do the vast majority of stolen devices end up in China
Not surprising in the least. It's like this with cars too.
Back to where it started. Imagine how much of a better world we would be in if companies did not take advantage of the slave labor in China or anywhere.
I lost my macbook pro in Barcelona and I never see it online again
Apple is more "uncrackable" than your car windows, apparently. I'm sorry you lost your shit but hopefully you learned your lesson about leaving your laptop in your car.
Okay…how does one even get their macbook stolen 💀 I understand a phone but a laptop??
I know it sucks but please remove the iCloud lock. Don’t just create more ewaste. At this point it’s pretty clear you’re never getting it back.
Thank you! I just read an article about it.
This is fucking amazing. I didn’t know it worked like that.
Link to read about this?
Had no idea that’s how it worked, thanks.
Holy shit I am interested in seeing where this goes
fucking main character moment… Imagine you bust some big time thief ring with this…
Every stolen apple product ends up in the same area of Shenzhen, and some pass through Hong Kong on their way there. It’ll be gone before the cops have a chance to tell you they won’t be investigating this random person’s MacBook.
[deleted]
UPDATE: I have contacted my local district  police force and they have also said it is not enough information to start investigating as I am not the original owner and don’t have the actual Find My info and only have a screenshot, and that the Macbook doesn’t belong to a person I am affiliated with nor know which is another thing they said as a reasoning. GG I guess…
Rescue mission incoming?
!Remindme 7 days
!Remindme 7 days
Without looking at the address, just by skimming the map I recognized where it is. Diu Kwun Tong Lomo.
It's a very crowded area so the address will be too many units to check and plainly impossible to get warrants for.

And if Find My's last update is not current, the device could have moved too.
!Remindme 7 days
They won’t. This happens every day and we see this stuff on here so often
Would be so awesome if you could help u/op get his Macbook Mac. Please keep this forum posted :)
It's in a Kwun Tong industrial building, which is like the epicenter where stolen phones go and get taken apart for parts. I doubt the police will do anything but you can try
is this really happening?
i wanna know how it goes
Very much interested in the trail keep me posted this is fantastic tech by apple really impressive
Any update with this?
They will turn it off or unplug the battery or speakers
> In a few days you will get threatening messages to remove the iCloud activation lock.

Be ware - they might not be threatening. They might be tricks, guilt trips, or other methods. Ignore them. Assuming this device is gone and ignore everything about it.
Make sure to also reply with a bunch of Winnie the Pooh pictures ^_^ [Jinpooh](https://i.imgflip.com/5axb37.jpg)
Personally I just go for a “free Taiwan” and that REALLY sets them off
‘Mostly’
Since we know it's already goner, all that's left is to bait these guys. Just play ball with them, except being extremely technically inept. Oh the password? I had letters. Maybe. And maybe numbers too.
They will take him out?  It'll have to be a pretty nice dinner to cover the cost of a Macbook. Maybe they can go to the Capital Grille?!
Mostly… “They come at night, mostly…” -Newt to Ripley
If only there was a way for us, uk or eu law enforcement agencies to check for packages being sent to specific addresses in China….
Most common places for some of these stolen electronics is a computer shopping centre in Shenzhen approachable by the metro basically alongside the river border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The computer shopping centre also includes a LOT of repair centres who seem to always have some genuine apple parts on hand, so they must be getting some (if not most) parts from these stolen important electronics.
I was literally thinking about exactly this video when I saw it was in China lol
This is so fucking funny
Just like ET!
Best advice I’ve seen. This will keep the main logic board software locked to your account, rendering it unusable until the device is removed from your AppleID. There may be a way for them to replace the T2 security chip from another damaged board but that would not be an easy process without the proper soldering equipment.
They can sell it as brand new 🥸
and as we all know, crack kills
if you remove icloud in the process it’s free access to the thieves.
[deleted]
If that's true, why do these thieves send threatening messages to the owner desperately requesting them to disable icloud lock? AFAIK only some specific older models can be bypassed and can't be patched by Apple... the rest are sold as parts
That’s complete bullshit and you clearly never worked with Apple or Global Service Exchange before.
that’s not true!
I wonder why Apple didn’t build into their system a way to identify service centers who are unlocking devices that have been reported stolen, and then immediately revoke their access to the systems that allow them to unlock devices? Oh wait, they did, and your post is bullshit.
I'm pretty sure this is wrong. Apple won't unlock 2nd hand devices through GSX and doesn't provide a method unless you have the original owner allow it.
Yeah this is entirely possible. GSX is very powerful but definitely an issue when it gets put into the wrong hands
Real Life isn't an actual MMO. That was just a joke.
They don’t take Yuan in Hongkong…
Yes, the commies in Hong Kong..
So we need an apple car now
Also, this is why you dont leave those devices out in the open especially in a car…..
Found the Thief
This is the most obnoxious thing I've ever read on Reddit. Give the thieves access to your laptop to stop e-waste.

Absolutely fuck no.
This would be like willingly giving the keys to your car to the thief who just stole it, who would be stupid enough to do that? They can f**k off.
i would rather see global warming cause a sea level rise that might drown a thief before I would reward his bad behavior for the sake of helping the planet.
It's gone brother. Some shop already has it disassembled and already sold all the parts lol
Please share the link to that article
Key is to not remove the device from your devices though or fall for any of the “we have your data” provide the pin to get it back messages that you’ll likely receive. My daughter’s phone was stolen at a concert and ended up in China too.  PSA - keep your phone in your hand or some other secure pocket as pick pocket rings at these concerts are brutal.
I just read [an article ](https://gadgetsfeed.com/apples-find-my-cryptography-securing-your-data/)that explains how Apple’s Find My feature works, which might explain why you’re seeing your MacBook's location in China. Find My uses end-to-end encryption with a private key shared across your devices. Even if your devices are offline, they broadcast rotating public keys so your Ipad might be a Nearby apple device that picks up these signals and reports encrypted locations.
Yup, gotta love Apple. Very impressive tech
The pro's of being in an ecosystem.
in most cases it can triangulate the bluetooth signal and make the location even more precise
https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/find-my/

"Find My can use the Find My network to help find devices even if they are not connected to the internet and, for supported devices, even if they are turned off or erased. **Devices in the Find My network use Bluetooth wireless technology to detect missing devices or compatible items nearby, including AirTags and compatible third-party products registered to your Apple ID, and report their approximate location back to the owner.** If a device is turned off or erased, that location is also visible to members of the owner’s Family Sharing group with whom they have chosen to share the location. The interaction is end-to-end encrypted, and Apple cannot see the location of any offline device or reporting device. When your device participates in the Find My network, it can both be located by the network and anonymously help locate other missing devices."
I will see what I can do since I haven’t actually made a police report ever before lol. I don’t really know if I can start an investigation based on a reddit post and a screenshot, but I’ll try my best probably tmr since it’s night time right now lmao.
All u/Holy_goosebag needs is the password of OP’s Mac
this will go to huaqiangbei as far as i know
Lol, it's Hong Kong police

Can tell you exactly where it goes

"Okay, we have the information. No we're not going to do anything with that"
Since Kwun Tong is a industrial district with a lot of storage facilities it might 😏
Happy Cake Day!
True. There are seldom cases of people actually getting caught smuggling heaps of tech into the Mainland through the borders, and at this rate of people’s electronics getting stolen there has to be another way the people are actually smuggling stolen tech. The local police force just hasn’t done enough to truly break it down. I will most definitely try reporting it to the police since the address is accurate to the actual building of where it might be, though the answer to opening an investigation might be no.
How do people know who to sell them to? Do pawn shops all know the villains?
rip

Although the device has moved there could be other devices that could be hidden there before transportation to the Mainland as there has to be a reason the Macbook was last pinged there before disappearing.
Good. The more I manage to inconvenience them and the less they are able to enjoy it in peace the better
Or straight-up death threats.
Make sure it’s all unencrypted so the Chinese government can see
Better yet, reply with a bunch of pictures of clock faces.  
In Chinese culture, this is very offensive. It signals that their time on this Earth is coming to an end. This is why you generally don't see a lot of clock / watch giving as gifts in traditional Chinese culture.
I recall a post about some block of Chinese character copypasta about Tiananmen Square that will theoretically get them in trouble. Not sure if it really works but it sounds fun to send.
Taiwan #1!!! 🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼
You have enough experience with chinese extortion gangs to know what sets them off?
Taiwan numba won!
[deleted]
Maybe this is where Apple gets parts for their Shenzen factory!  I bet they have some real fancy soldering equipment there…
And isn't this sad...
The same reason thieves and scammers run phishing scams. There's a sucker born every minute. All you need it one to respond and think the threats are credible, acquiesce, and hand over control.
What's not true? GSX will allow someone to effectively open the device. Provided they don't update the OS, they'll be able to use the device.
In case you’re not read in on international law – China’s Apple entire security enclave and instance runs on a completely different set of security protocols because China demands all access to servers and security as a function of allowing Apple products to be sold in China. 

A highly regulated, communist controlled country. How the fuck don’t you know this?

Which is why I wrote that it ending up in China comes to me as no surprise. So take your “bullshit” quip, turn that sucker sideways,  and you know where to insert it for best effect, smoothbrain.
You dont say, eh? 🤔
You realize HK is now controlled by the CCP with arrests of dissidents and the hand selection of candidates for office, right?
Next time someone approaches another person carrying their laptop in their backpack with a gun or knife, just remember kids, you can't have your laptop stolen!
If I send it out for recycling, sure, I'll remove it in case someone gets it working again. If it was stolen, you can eat a giant juicy sausage for all I care.
10/10 chances this guy went to Berkeley. Lol
It doesn’t give access if you have ever dealt with this before. They’ve likely already wiped it. It just lets Mac OS run again. Disabling the iCloud lock does not magically unlock the user account and give them access to all your files. Would expect Apple users to have no idea how their devices actually work
Again, this is not how it works. they don’t get access to your data. It just allows Mac OS to be installed again. But sure if you want more ewaste in the world whatever. Climate change is just gunna kill us all anyway right?
and that’s exactly why our society is in the state is rn where your kids will not have a good life because of climate change but go off I guess?
If it's been disassembled, it's not going to be able to report its location.
As long as they can’t crack the data I would be fine with that.

BrutalAF
SneakyAF
Google has been doing it to track traffic congestion for a long time.
Um most phones do this. Samsung has it with some of their appliances. Somebody's fridge can locate your phone....

Also Google uses all Android devices, any brand... Apple is actually second tier in that regard.
Wow. That’s pretty smart. I remember reading about this years ago but didn’t think it made it to prod. Good to know. I thought this tech was only available with the AirTag product.
Correspond with OP to get detailed information about the machine:


Serial Number

Specs (CPU/Chip, Memory, etc)


Any visually-identifiable information, specifically the colour (Space Grey or Silver), stickers/skins, cases, any known cosmetic damage such as dents and scratches and their locations, etc

These are very useful in working with law enforcement in retrieving a stolen computer, but I can't speak for the effectiveness of HK/CN police as I am not local. lol
Keep us posted
!RemindMe 1 week
Be prepared that they just won’t give a shit. I mean local police are lazy af when it has nothing to do with natsec nowadays.
My phone was stolen from Pastis on Wyndham St a couple of months ago and ended up in the same building.  Think I reported it stolen.
And his credit card and social security number to pass the background check so the prince from nigeria can help.
What is huaqiangbei? Computer butcher shop in Hong Kong?
I got punched and almost got stabbed by some random old chinese dude wielding keys in his fist saying he was going to stab me to death in canto, had it on video and everything. I called the cops and when they arrived they gave him a warning and told me to go home
thx:)
!Remindme 7 days
Or they could just put it in a room and close the door, since it's not literally attached to the thief. Then, the person pressing the play sound button is the one being inconvenienced.
Imagine you make friends with the scammer over the chinese government
Ooooh I like that!
Do the Chinese also have the 4 & 7 death superstition? 

Could send clock images set to 4:07 to double down 🤣

Edit: lol downvote
Damn techno knowledgeable thieves.
But if they could actually bypass this system on their own why would they take the effort to ask people instead?
I had this problem just a few weeks ago. An employee had stored a personal password and his own Apple ID on a non-managed company device. He recently passed away and the company needs access to the device. Without access to the password to log in and without access to the Apple ID to reset the device, only Apple can remove this link. Even a GSX cannot bypass this lock because Apple has changed its policies in this regard.
Nope. There are many Apple services where the data for CHINESE CUSTOMERS is stored on Chinese servers, but Apple maintains strict control over their manufacturing and service channels, and just physically moving a US computer to China does not magically switch it over to being controlled by the CCP. The protocols used by FindMy, device unlock, etc are end-to-end encrypted, and cannot be bypassed just because the computer is physically in China. If Apple detects abuse, they revoke access to the system IN THE US that grants access for service providers WORLDWIDE to bypass activation lock.
I know they don’t have access to the data, doesn’t change my opinion at all. The analogy I said holds true, as proven by the upvote/downvote ratio. You are just digging a deeper hole with each reply.
Or you can view the extra $1500 pumped into the Chinese economy as helping fuel the most polluting economy on the planet.  See, it works both ways.  Maybe you can just mail them a check and see if they will steal one less laptop and help the cause.  I'm going to doubt that encouraging theft does help al that much.  Oh, and now OP has to buy a new computer that he didn't really need.  So much for saving cyberwaste.
It probably reported the location before that
They can’t. But the soldered nand modules will still be useful in upgrading a Mac with soldered storage or repairing dead Macs.
No. You have to opt in on Android for it to work correctly, Apple does it by default. Apple is first tier in this this regard. I know, I'm currently using a Pixel while waiting for my iPhone replacement. Android warns you that you have to opt in for their network to work correctly for "privacy reasons" while Apple has privacy all figured out. 

If you don't use both ecosystems and are just fangirling without actually knowing what you're talking about then you should stop.
My dad did try once though even he had all this information the police said it still wasn’t enough to start an investigation so I guess it’s based on luck/whether the local police wants to do these cases at all lol
He has offered to help me so many time, I feel bad for not responding 😔
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaqiangbei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaqiangbei)

Basically it is a place to sell a bunch of cheap and possibly used electronics. A lot of the stolen stuffs will be dissassembled and sold here. One of my brother's friends iphone got stollen in UK and was located in huaqiangbei after a week
That’ll show them!
Well that’s a nice bit of flare! 

Yeah definitely, the number four. I’m not so sure about seven, but four is definitely an unlucky number in their culture so I would maybe send clock faces reading 4:44 - and if it has a calendar display have the calendar set to April 4th (4/4). 
😅
Nightmare juice clock face.
To access the user account?
Well all I’ll say is this device ended up in China, and I know for certain that Apple had to set up completely different security protocols and enclaves versus the rest of the world to operate in China per the Chinese government mandate that they essentially have a backdoor method into your devices and your communication. Which is why I wrote that it’s no surprise that his laptop pinged in China. It’s a country well known for collusion and corruption of officials with shady enterprises.
>Apple maintains strict control over their manufacturing and service channels, and just physically moving a US computer to China does not magically switch it over to being controlled by the CCP. The protocols used by FindMy, device unlock, etc are and-to-end encrypted, and cannot be bypassed just because the computer is physically in China

Apple does not maintain strict operational control and authority of iCloud in China. In fact they do not even operate their Chinese iCloud instance / domain.  iCloud in China is operated by GCBD (AIPO Cloud (Guizhou) Technology Co. Ltd).  
  
iCloud services and all the data you store with iCloud, are subject to the T&C's and GCBD, not Apple's policies and protocols. I hope this clarifies that Apple (US) and Apple (CHN) are not the same - nor do they have the same protocols. They're not even operated by the same company.  
How is it just giving them the keys? For it to be equal I would have to get his address, go to post office, mail the keys all the way to china? You’re literally just pressing a button on your phone to prevent something from ending in a landfill and further destroying our planet. I don’t expect Apple users to give a shit about all that of course but it still needs to be said
Buy used. But again, Apple person, he’s going right to the store to buy a brand new one
It says 2 hours ago
Apple airtags also automatically report locations to other nearby Apple devices for the 0.0000001% that person is being stalked with the tag, instead of the higher chance of someone hiding the tag in their car or bag to not be found and tossed by the theif getting their phone pinged... this doesn't happen with Samsung or Tile trackers.

Apple technology isn't exactly the most intelligent.
[deleted]
Shit… our cops sound very similar! lol
The prince is peed now and has conned the FBI and you are now invastigating for tax fraud. If you want this to stop, you need to transfer $10000 to 420420420 within 24h.
They don't ask for that. They don't care. In fact, at that point they already erased all data on the phone. All they want is to sell those phones without being tracked or blocked from adding new accounts.
Implying Americans dont do the same type of espionage.
Yes, but the system service providers use to disable activation lock is not a part of iCloud. And even if it were, that would only apply to devices bought and set up IN CHINA.
Does it still says 2 hours ago? /s
I don't know, that sounds like a good thing. Tells people it's there so it can easily be found by ANY phone including the person that it may possibly be tracking, unlike Samsung or Tile tracking which is perfect for stalkers. Sounds like Apple made the intelligent decision.
Does this extend to China/HK? Sounds like a... USA/Mexico sorta deal.
Clearly some devices are stolen for access to the user account, there are numerous articles about this and the perils of having someone gain access to your device/Apple ID, so forth. Maybe not in this case, but it’s not like it doesn’t happen.
So explain how this ended up in China (*of all the places in the world*), and how the laptop managed to select and connect to  a WiFi network, which you cannot do from outside the lock screen, and then ping its location in China, which … a place where the OP has never been. 

At least had he been there in the past and connected to an open Wi-Fi network in China, that would be able to explain why you would be able to ping its location. 

Basically explain how the current possessor got through the lock screen and iCloud lock without GSX?
That's my point though, in MOST cases people are getting stuff stolen -- not being stalked by their truly crazy significant other lol.

So you put hide the tracker in your bag, or hide it in your vehicle. Then the theif is driving away and gets a ping that there is a nearby Apple Tag. Theif then finds the trackers and tosses them. Use case gone for finding your stuff or getting the cops called on them.
At least you could say you triad.
You obviously haven't watched enough enough Hong Kong crime movies.
Icloud lock doesn't stop that. This a completely different case.
There is an industry in China that uses deceit and threats to try to convince customers to unlock the devices so they can be resold. If that fails, there is a backup industry that harvests the valuable components.

Modern Apple devices have basically a built-in AirTag module. The Find My network that exists across all devices crowd-sources the location of these modules without the devices ever needing to connect to WiFi, or even be fully powered on. Even after the main battery is fully depleted, there is a backup power source that keeps them active and findable for some time.
> So explain how this ended up in China (*of all the places in the world*), and how the laptop managed to select and connect to a WiFi network, which you cannot do from outside the lock screen, and then ping its location in China, which … a place where the OP has never been. 

You're arguing that, because you're ignorant, you must be right.

Apple devices tend to have Bluetooth adapters in them. That means that the stolen laptop can, for example, ping a nearby iPhone using Bluetooth and that nearby iPhone can then use its Internet connection to notify Apple of that laptop's location. It turns out that that's how the Find My network works when the device to be found doesn't have an Internet connection.
 You haven't thought this out well. Most of the time the ping isn't immediate and they will never know. Tracking is immediate but warnings aren't.

If you don't know how it works exactly just don't. I'm not a fanboy of either Apple or Pixel/Android products, I think they're both great in what they do because they both have their own craft. You hate Apple, we get it. Just learn more about it first before you try to knock it.
I see what you did there.
I meant with the Apple ID / pass either by threatening text or phishing link (your Mac has been found, log into iCloud to recover it etc and links to fake iCloud site) you can potentially reset the user password on the Mac and get in. Just saying it’s possible, and there is valuable information in an unlocked device. That’s all.
Probably the most ignorant reply I think I’ve read today. Bluetooth does not connect to anything until it is authorized to connect to something and that generally requires a authorization code. Bluetooth is a short wave RF protocol.
What does it matter if the ping isn't immediate? The thief is still going to leave the stolen goods some place then know it's being tracked eventually which is even worse and means they know to get rid of it even sooner. Bad design.

I only hate Apple for shutting everyone else out in their own messaging system bubble and inconveniencing everyone else outside of it. Apple's greatest redeeming factor was the design style, and how they can polish something not so great into being pricy and pretty. But the allure wears off quick mostly into my adult years. I have fallen victim to it a lot before
You really shouldn't pretend to be informed about things you haven't verified until you figure out how to do basic checks and then do them.

Went from Nvidia to AMD
For years used nvidia. Recently built a i7 14700k paired with a 7900xtx Taichi! Very impressed.
The AIO logo being sideways...

Nope, doesn't bother me, it doesn't bother me, it bothers me, it bothers me a lot, and do you not have intake fans on the front of the case other than the one in the bottom?

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)
It might be perspective at play but I see some gpu sag
I recently did the same, no looking back… I’m super happy. I upgraded from a setup with a 2070 + Ryzen 5 3600 to a 7800xt and 5800x3D. Massive.
I did the switch too a while back, must say I'm not.. amazed. I know this doesn't happen to everyone but I had LOADS of issues with AMD drivers and still have a few. When I buy an expensive card, I expect to put it in, install the drivers (on clean install ofc) and don't have to bother with anything except the usual updates. AMD just didn't provide that at all for me, sadly
You’ll regret it later … I did
Why not an x3d chip?
I love my 7900xtx. Might have to switch back to Nvidia next cycle though because this is the 3rd AMD card I’ve had that the driver locks up and crashes when running borderless windowed when playing games
I just installed my 7900xtx this weekend.  Loving it.
I’m sorry
Bye bye DLSS, and Welcome to FSR 

FSR Much worse, Consider this our little secret😉
Seriously, doing that has been the best decision I've ever made. I've had zero driver bugs at least none that I've noticed, seems what all the NVfans were saying were actually not as bad as they were making out. Now on my first all AMD rig since my Phenom II 1055T and HD 7870XT😁, couldn't be happier! Welcome to the world of Radeon!
And still didn't straighten the water block on his AIO... Sorry, I had to. 

The Taichi 7900xtx is one of the best. My first Asrock GPU after 20 years and I was also amazed. 

3000+mhz and doesn't break 60c.
Get yourself an Anti Sag device otherwise your PCB will bend overtime .. got an 6800xt and it bend so hard that 2 of the memory chips have no contact to the cooler
3 8 pins? God damn
Welcome :-)
Get a GPU support bracket, or we'll be seeing your GPU featured here sooner or later

I did the opposite, there’s no wrong choice. Btw that vent looks sick.
I plan on doing the same 🙌🏿

Bro where da PSU?
Sweet, I went from an i5 3570k, GTX 1080 to a r5 5600x, 6800XT. The freedom to overclock and tune it is great.
Same I went form a 8700k and 2070 to a 5800x3d. And 7900xt loving it so far
[deleted]
Nice
driver timeout incoming
Been doing Nvidia for awhile. Been over a decade since I bought any card that wasn't team green. Last few years went from 2060 to a 3070ti and then got a fantastic deal on the XFX RX 7900xtx and have been so impressed by AMDs flagship

Yes it could do raytracing better....but at 4K Ultra the only real option for raytracing is a 4090 for like double the price in Canada.
Have fun with your thrift shop 4080.
Yeahhh smart move, I'm never gonna buy nvidia again it's either AMD or Intel.
enjoy the radeon adrenalin software
ewww you did it backwards. 5800x3d or 7800x3d with intel GPU. AMD GPU's are always ASSSSSSSSS.
My condolences
Ouch
You got unlimited money’s and you still fked it up. Imo. 14700k should have been 12900k/13700k with a 4090

For gaming only imo
Congrats with having no DLSS and ray tracing.
I went from amd to nvidia/intel Arc haven’t regretted it once
Welcome to the reasonable side
[removed]
Have fun with Adrenalin software
Why Intel though? Full team RED is the only way
Can I get the name of that case?
Very nice my friend
Does the cover have a sticker over it? It looks like it is not clear or does these aios come like that? Also how do you take the magnetic cover off?
Cant wait for my parts to arrive
[deleted]
Whats the name of your case?
![img](avatar_exp|148371113|laugh)
If you have any weird driver problems by the way just use the amd pro drivers they are pretty solid
Where are the front intake fans? Doesn’t that case come with them?
Pair it with X3D beasts
Damn that gpu is hungry i also got the 7900 XTX from gigabyte and mine only needs 2 power cables
Is it good? I wanna go amd but losing rt makes me not want to go amd
Never seen a case with a bottom mounted fan at an angle like that. Seems like a good idea for airflow directed into the GPU. Cool setup OP
Perfect decision for the winter 🥶lol 🥵
I wouldn't mess with the rig on this ceramic tile floor.

It's known to break glass panels upon the slightest touch.

True story.
[deleted]
VFM good choice. Good driver interface, sometimes problematic drivers
Is the GPU noisier than your previous Nvidia card ?
What about the I7 processor temperature ?
Awesome build and GPU buddy. Maybe you have room for undervolting there and lowering the power draw and heating on that video card.
Ayy
It’s a decent jump. Not drastic. 
I play TLOU at 4K high settings in my living room setup. 
With FSR quality I get around 75-80FPS
That’s clean as a bean 🫘
You need to keep some anti sag bracket / anti sag stick ASAP
Me sitting here not been jaloux at all! ;D  
Im gonna buy a xtx taichi very soon (I hope!)
Same, got the 7900 XTX
Hello, I’m also looking to buy this case. Are stock fans good enough?
Went from a 1080 to 7900xt. Difference is night and day. Loving it
[deleted]
That gpu is whopper
I went from 3060ti to 7900xtx and there are more problems than ever, still not gonna change back, i just hope amd would make some better software
I would do the the same but they lacking in white cards for my budget
Change the orientation of the logo on the aio that part is magnetic
Worst mistake of your life
Which is better, Nvidia or AMD?
Nothing wrong with AMD in my opinion. Just upgraded from a 6900xt to a 4090 mostly due to 4k gaming and that is the best at the moment but would have had no issues going for a AMD gpu again.
Easy ppl. He is still on a learning stage of building pc. I was that way too years ago and now i gotten a lot better on building. As soon as im done installing juishark diamond black cpu heatsink and corsair icue link fans x9 ill post images. Specs..intel core i7 12700k cpu...EVGA GeForce 3080 Ti...32GB of ram...Corsair 5000D Mid Tower Case...Corsair 1k Watt Power Supply....not a heavy overclocker. During pc gaming i let the system auto overclock.
So you are very impressed by something you didn't test yet or did you... ? 😅
Just think how frame rates will improve when you plug in the power to your discrete GPU! 🤪
Breath buddy ~~it’s going to be okay~~ WE NEED TO KNOW
Nobody tell him the PCIe cables aren’t plugged into the GPU.
It’s a magnetic cover. It can come off and be rotated so it’s facing the correct orientation haha. I have the same AIO.
"AND THAT ONE'S STILL GREEN!" 
A fellow dbza enjoyer I see.
Haha. I was building my pc there, of course I have two fans in the front hehe 😜
Damn it, damn it, damn it!
Think it needs to be for proper cable placement :/
First thing i noticed too. I'd go crazy every time I look at my PC
Geez Louise Socrates! Let's chill.

For one, there will more than enough air moving through that thing given the fans it's got. It's fine. People get *all* wrapped around the axle about this, but the fact of the matter is it hardly affects performance unless you have *very* little air movement, i.e. total blockages, no fans at all, or an improperly installed cpu cooler, etc.

For two, can't that corsair logo be popped right off and rotated? Mine can, but it may not be the same exact model.
You can change these ones I think.
welcome to /r/mildlyinteresting
Intake fans are overrated.
Reinforcing the above. Your AIO is sideways.
Nvidia fan boy just chill
Logo is on magnets can be changed at any time :)
Lack of Intake fans in this configuration is pretty intresting on other hand ;)
My PC is literally just like a wooden test bench hanging up my wall. 😅
OP flipped his magnetic cover just to *$#@ with you.
Oh for sure, I fixed that already with a bracket
I'm planning to do the same next month! I've already swapped Ryzen 2600 to 5800X3D in the summer and the difference was night and day.

Right now I'm wondering if I should save some money and go for 7800 XT or spend more (or buy used) on 7900 XT as I play on 165Hz 1440p.
What resolution you play on and how much was the fps gain?
That was my exact upgrade path as well. Couldn’t be happier with the performance difference!
I did the exact same upgrade but i had a 2060 instead of 2070. It feels awesome being able to play on ultra settings on 144+ fps.
Hoping to go from a 3700x and 2070S to a 7800x3d and 7900xtx
Im doing the same lol im going from a 1080ti to a 7800xt🙂
[deleted]
I'm waiting for Christmas to buy the same GPU, already bought a 5800x3D some months ago. It was hard to switch from Nvidia drivers? How did you handle it? I'm looking for XFX 7900xt, I can't take other brands because my case is small, max 300mm length, so I'm forced to take that, my only fear is the temperature
I have the same cpu, and just upgraded to 7800xt. I can’t quite tell if 3600 is a bottleneck or not before I upgrade the CPU. Utilization never goes over 50% and same for the GPU.
Did exactly the same two days ago. 3600x/RTX2700 => 5800x3d/7900XT. 1440p Ultrawide.

Minimum double the performance. Most noticable for now are Remnant 2 and Control. Remnant 2 on ultra without upscaling looks very cool.
Doing the same upgrade from a 2600 + 1070. Can´t wait! Just need the GPUs in Germany to be restocked :D

&#x200B;

Anyway I have a VG27A Asus monitor so WQHD (2560x1440) would it still make sense with this monitor still?
then you see and most people have ASUS Armoury Crate, MSI Center or some other mobo cancer on their system
Hey dude, I completely get that!
Same, I got 5700xt on launch and still to this day I get bsod about once a month
Honestly. Idk haha. I’ve always done intel. Don’t really hate on either. Next build I’ll do all amd.
I own a 13900k and sometimes I wish i got the 7800x3D instead. At this point I'll just wait until the 8800x3D or until Microcenter has an amazing combo deal on the 7800x3D
Dude everyone running amd has driver issues. NVIDIA haters will cry about a memory bus but spend $1300 to have fucked drivers LOL
Wait till the drivers bite u in the booty hole
I forgive you. But do try to do better next time.
I've been using FSR2 on a RX 570 up until recently and honestly it looked great (at least to me). If I get it right, it's a driver feature, meaning there can be improvements in the future without needing to upgrade, right?
There were some bugs though (high idle power draw for 7xxx cards) but generally once you purchase a card that's 6-9 months old from launch you'll likely get a pretty good experience from there on.
What does one gain by going amd? I used to be all amd and switched to nvidia. Gained DLSS, proper RT performance, more stable drivers (my 6700xt would crash a lot)… what is the advantage of going amd? For me amd was always about cost but these days it’s all fucking expensive af
The only reason i switched off of AMD gpus is the super buggy drivers. NVidias drivers are just so far ahead and i really wish that AMDs would pull ahead and just dominate. Their pricing to performance has always been stellar but i had to just give away my 5700XT for free to a friend because the drivers were so bad :(
Is it that common?. I just got a MSI 6700 XT Gaming X that sports a rigid aluminum backplate and an anti sag along the top edge. It's a dual fan card, not as big as OPs.

EDIT: looks OPs GPU has both of these too. Did you mean adding *another* anti sag?
He said he got one in another thread.
Yeah I was surprised too, I thought 2 were the maximum.
You won’t be disappointed at all 🤙
I’ve never OC My cpu. Believethe taichi 7900xtx comes overclocked
Wait, I’m just seeing this comment, do what now?
3800mhz oof
Excuse me
Heck yeah. We’ve got the fan boys that thrive over nvidia. First time getting an amd gpu must say 10/10
Our first hater, ladies and gentlemen! 👏
Intel GPU? Not even Intel fanboys buy them man
You fanboys are pathetic.
Xtx doesn’t need upscaling, it’s fast af. This might blow your mind, but some people don’t give af about RT alpha testers.
I’m not crazy about those futures. There’s pros and cons between the two of course!
That good or bad 😂
Fear not
Nzxt H5 Flow
What did you go with
I’ve got 2 front fans. In this picture it wasn’t finished haha. I was just excited
Think it’s okay the way it sits, with the radiator up top
Nzxt h5 flow
I had to buy them haha, 😂
I’m smelling a little sarcastic, haha
That’s just a reference which is great and overall the best bang for the buck but I don’t think it would be felt from a 6800
Yeah I have a anti sag bracket now
Haha yessir! Was gonna get the nitro+. Was at micro center the dude said let me take a look, he came out with an open box. Was the same price as the nitro. Was a no brainer
This. Although I came from a GTX1080, the expectation to "just work" isn't met IMO
Yeah, I’ve had zero issues so far! Thanks for your input!
lol, I love how there are so many shit talkers 😂💀
BREATHE***
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
OP didn't bother to finish their build before taking pictures, a terrible travesty
What about the 24pin? 💀
Haha yeah it’s magnetic
Finally someone noticed
Also if im correct that’s a NZXT h510? I have that case in my build and may get a new 7800XT or 7900XT but I have a nzxt kraken x63 280mm?(i think)aio on the front and was wondering if you could tell me how much clearance you have from the front of case to side of gpu? Not sure if I would have clearance. Current Gigabyte GTX 1070 OC 8gb VRAM is quite close and im worried a upgrade may not fit.
Just wanna say. I really like the build (Totally not jealous 😂). Looks awesome! Hope you have loads of fun with that killer machine!!!
Do you plan to add more intake fans in the front? That's the only issue I see with the current build, as currently you have a very low pressure inside the PC, which means it will suck in much more dust than if you had 2 more intake fans in the front.
Haha yeah it’s magnetic
Who needs ‘em…
1440p ultrawide , double or more in most games.
Just bought my son the same but his current setup is a i5 with 1660 super. Hope he's chuffed on Xmas day!
Was quite close to buying RX7900XTX, but it would have been the cheapest model from XFX, so I guess cooling would have been a bit shitty. The price would be just 130 eur higher though.

Went with 7900XT nitro+. That badboy has such a good cooling and if I were to get 7900xtx I would most likely want better cooling too. That would mean 250 eur more.

Hope I will not regret not getting XTX  O\_o.
That is what I recently upgraded too. Plays everything maxed on it 60+ fps at 1440p ultrawide.
It probably is.. but I guess it depends what games you are playing.
5800X3D or 7800X3D is the GOAT
Do you do certain workloads that needs intel or its iGPU?
"don't really hate on either" and "I've always done Intel" are a bit contradictory.
Any suggestions for work around or prep for this?
It should, and I do hope it does get better, but as it stands now DLSS is definitely better than FSR
Yes
Had a friend say the same but I just replaced my 5700xt for a 7900xt. Never had an issue with my 5700xt the two years I had it
Your drivers weren't bad, the 5700 had silicon bugs that AMD quietly fixed, some of it was bad drivers, but the 5700 was pretty broken, which is why some people never had a working 5700. This WASN'T drivers, because people on Polaris, Vega, and the "fixed" 5700 did not have bugs. AMD users won't admit any hardware issues regardless, everything is "drivers". It's like when AMD sold the 3700X which couldn't hit boost clocks with early silicon, that never happened, mentioning it gets downvotes, when it's got plenty of documentation that it happened. It's like how we all pretend it's magic that we can super undervolt AMD GPUs, and never question why it's so high to begin with, which is because someone out there is hitting the worst case silicon lottery. Didn't happen to me, so doesn't exist nonsense.
I have had Radeon since the 6450 and I've been searching for and wide for these driver issues. 

And even on my newest 7900xtx I've had a single game crash while overclocked and undervolted. 

I think this was fear mongering from user error more than anything.
I recently switched from amd into a 4080. It’s been terrible and the drivers have less functionality than the amd drivers. Maybe it’s time to update the windows XP software stack nvidia!
This right here
Dual Fan is probably ok
But OP has a brick of a card and from that picture it looks already saggy 
Check Memory Chip Temp with HwInfo or similar
You should look into undervolt and memory OC. And if you're just allergic to fiddling with any OC you can just undervolt and increase power limit(+15) this way the card just goes to whatever clock speed it deems safe and really isn't an OC per se but just allows the card to reach a different ceiling. If that makes sense. 

With a card like taichi its almost sad not to get the extra, its quite literally what you pay for. Unless you're very anal about noise then you could undervolt and limit clock speed to whatever it is now for equal perf but less noise and heat output. 

Could also totally enjoy the card for what it is(one of the best) and ignore me lol. I like to fiddle if you don't thats cool too.
Dude's hallucinating, it's fine.

See chart: https://imgur.com/X5yGEuP
Dude is not hallucinating, you'll burn up your AIO pump if you leave it mounted the way it currently is.
The 5600 goes brrr with it
Enjoy your constant driver crashes and games optimized for intel graphics.. AMD gpus have always been a comprise. I’ve used several as place holders and they all had constant driver issues. Look at this build ffs… 7900xtx in an Nzxt flow worth no intake fans.
Tbf the 4090 (faster than the "fast af" xtx) still relies on dlss in some scenarios
I have a card that is significantly faster than a 7900xtx and still need upscaling
amd copium.
Awesome, thank you!
7900 Xtx taichi and a 7950X3D.
I will watercool both in a hyte y70 sadly no distroplates for the y70 yet but i might get one custom made when i can get dimensions on my case.
Not in stock till the 20th sadly.
[deleted]
IDK your build seems incomplete ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
Nobody asked, stank breath
😂
Boogiewoogieoogie
Their new h5 flow or elite, can't tell without seeing the front panel
This is the nzxt h5 flow plenty of room in this puppy
Hey buddy, I appreciate that!
Yeah, I have two front intake fans haha
Tnx looking to upgrade from 6800
Why not go for AM5?
Hes gonna be so excited! My friend has got a 1660ti, hes itching to upgrade
I have a i5-9400f and a 1660 ti, GPU is ok at 1080p but that just makes my i5 cry.
You should have checked reviews though there are no bad cooling AIB XT or XTX. The cheapest is usually the mec310 which is A tier, which is also the tier most cards are in. Nitro taichi etc. Are S tier they aren't practically much different. 
Just better hope for better bin and slightly lower noise. Also look cooler for the most part, except I personally like the Merc looks. 
The overclocking ability of XT is very good so you can make your XT be faster than a XTX. But it is always advised to go with the larger model instead of a better version of a lower tier card. 

Don't think you will regret anything but unless the higher tier card is a certified bad for some reason it's is usually more advisable to get the best model you can get and don't spend money on Uber tier cards. I would think it's kinda obvious they aren't there for value.

Only the AMD reference model is kinda meh and not "good" aka B tier.
I always wonder why the xfx cards are generally cheaper than other brands. I did not know they had sub par cooling.
Is it worhtth going from a 5800x to the x3d version?
5800x3d here. Can confirm!
Fr
Doesnt 7900X3D or 7950X3D have higher performance? Yes i know they are more expensive.
But 7800 to 7900 is a decent jum in performance no?
That’s why marketing matters to businesses
Yeah, sorry but if it wasnt for 1st gen Ryzen the Intel would still be making shitty 4 core 14nm consumer cpus that are way too expensive , fuck Intel and nvidia too
It's possible to have a preference for something without "hating" the alternatives.
I just replaced 5700XT with a 4080 and ive had no issues. But the person i gave the 5700XT to said its really buggy and black screens sometimes. Maybe that card was just a bad one. It made me second guess buying AMD. Ive always been a Radeon GPU user until recently
One of the driver's jobs is to workaround silicon bugs though. Nvidia has a ton of silicon bugs too, but you never hear about them because they actually thoroughly tested their drivers before shipping them. It's absolutely a problem with their driver QA if they can't deliver stable drivers even months after release, regardless of the root cause.
Interesting i didnt know that. Transparency wouldve been a better look regardless. Made me switch to a premium price for nvidia GPUs but i wouldnt mind getting Radeon in the future. Its only a matter of time before they dominate like they have the CPU market
I tried everything with the 5700xt. Underclocked and undervolted. Maxed fans. Clean installed multiple times. Im glad everything worked for you. I started on radeon way back at the 7850 and it was beautiful. I was sad to switch
Nvidia drivers seem to be in a slump right now. Definitely not the best time to have switched for the "driver experience". 

But yes the GUI and feature set from AMD is impressive by its own right. Nvidia just looks silly in comparison which is so strange for a what they are as a company.
I don't remember if I have that reading in GPU-Z but will do, thanks for the tip.
lol, how should I mount it ?
I wouldnt never exceed amd recommended sweetspot
Expert-Twat-2146, please pipe down like you know what you're talking about.
Yea, when you’re using RT. Otherwise there’s not much need for it unless youre trying to push 240 or 360 fps.
I use both brands, try again.
Of course, always have used nzxt cases. Always been really good!
Oh snap ok. My 14700 Idles at 30c, gaming at 50-55c think I could get better temps mounted in front
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
Only indication is the angled bottom fan
From a RX 6800? I wouldn’t go to the 7800xt. 

I say this as someone who owns and loves my 7800xt but it’s not going to be that insane of a upgrade, you have to go to at least a 7900xt to get what would feel like a big upgrade.
do not upgrade from a rx 6800 to a 7800
Changing from 6800 to 7800 isn't really an upgrade. Look at some benchmarks and stuff, you will get zero noticeable change except maybe power consumption
if they already had a 3600, then in most cases it's be borderline dumb not to stay on the same mobo and ram and just slot in a 5800x3d
[deleted]
I really hope so!
This post’s comments have me afraid of the drivers
How are the drivers for the 7900XTX?
They don't. I previously had a 6700XT from XFX using a triple slot cooler. Same size as my 7900XT. You don't need that for a 6700, the cooler was better used for a 6800XT, as the reference 6800 non XT used a small cooler. The oversized coolers are annoying, not only because they're unnecessary, but they cover expansion slots on your motherboard. What you really need to look for isn't size, but component quality, temperatures staying normal, and noise level. Also, some cards use different clocks and power levels. Powercolor in particular sold Vega 56 cards using less power and dual slot coolers, when every other Vega was overvolted and using triple slot, plus you could still overclock to 64 levels. If you're gonna buy for useless nonsense, I'd rather have RGB than oversized coolers.
overall yes but also depends on games as some benefits a lot while others, less or not all all.

playing path of exile on a 7600x and getting a 7800x3d gave me a smoother more fluid better gaming experience.  
Not to say people would notice that at first.

the cache drops the access time to 8ns (x3d) vs 80ns on a normal cpu without x3d.
Depends, if you sell your used one and if you can get the x3d on sale then to me yes. The extra cache gives you smoother 1% low fps , way less random stutter. And some particular games you can get some nice improvements.

Check [this](https://youtu.be/sw97hj18OUE?si=LrgcsJ-H1T1YfBpS) video, the guy benchmarks a lot of games so maybe the ones you play the most are in there to give you an idea.
According to benchmarks, the 7800X3D is faster IN GAMING than the Ryzen 9 versions.
7900x3D is worse, 7950x3D could be about the same, but it isn’t great at juggling the 8 x3D cores and 8 normal cores.
I also sold my 7900xtx for a 4080 and it's significantly more stable, updating my radeon drivers would just black screen or flicker every other update and there were micro stutters everywhere (even with free sync). DDU and everything. 

Switched to nvidia and its excellent.
I'd rather they don't, because AMD likes to abuse customers with ridiculous pricing the second people think they're "premium". $800 motherboards, you "must" buy the 500 chipset for Zen3, B550 delayed, BIOS updates delayed, X3D BIOS delayed because you're not on 500, etc. Right now you can buy affordable 1440p AND 4K cards from AMD. I'd rather they not match Nvidia pricing. It's getting to the point you are better off buying a console, whether that's xbox or steam deck.

Steam Deck alone proves laptops are price gouging, there's more expensive Zen3/Vega APU laptops. Also, it's rather hilarious that people AND reviewers promote consoles, while Desktop cards are "magically" bad. No, that's not how it works. Consoles are using RDNA and Zen, just like Desktops. You can't be BOTH bad and good. Somebody's lying, and when you promote Nvidia and consoles simultaneously, that's obviously shilling, but most people can't see it.

Way I see it, people deserve what they get for falling for the propaganda. Whether that's a 128-bit 8GB 4060, or higher doesn't matter. You're not getting what you're paying for, or at least not hardware value, and just brand recognition.
Could just been a faulty gpu/vram or other issue with the actual hardware
It’s not just in looks that the amd drivers are better. It has better functionality that nvidia simply doesn’t have. Here is 1 easy example, if you run a multiple monitor setup in nvsurround which is nvidia’s worse attempt at eyefinity then you cannot color correct an individual monitor or change brightness to an individual monitor. It’s all monitors or nothing. In eyefinity, it’s no problem.
It should be fine as is

It's explained better than I ever could.
the sweet spot is 3733. my silicon can handle 3800 so i use it that way 👍🏻
At least I don’t have constant gpu driver issues. Amd only ever made decent budget build GPUs. They suck at optimization. Enjoy your smooth brained no intake fan brethren 🤣

CP2077 gets 86 avg at 4k high (i.e, no raytracing). And clearly you'd get less fps if you push it to ultra. Even at pure raster, the fastest gpu in existence benefits from dlss
Also cost an extra $1100 in Canada.
Tnx. Yeah, I just probably wait till the next year and go full in there.
6800 non XT to 7800xt for 4k 60Hz ?
Alright. I’m working with a 5600x right now and wondering if a 5800x3d is a good investment, or just to go full AM5
Pretty good for the 7900XT. Here's the deal: you get 100% of features usable on 6000 series, performance on par with Nvidia for less money and more Vram.

Here's the catch: FSR3 isn't popular yet, anti-lag+ was cancelled. Framegen is in beta. But you don't need this for the XTX. You'll be playing 4k native and won't need FSR. By the time you need the new features, the drivers will be even faster and the new features will be working and in more games.

As a bonus, you can game on linux with perfect support like windows.
Really. I have heard different thing. I have also checked some comparison videos and all seems to indicate that 7800 is the "worst" 7900 is a confused one and that 7950 is the best.
Heard something about disabling half of the cores on a 7950 aswell to get better performance as its a higher clocked cpu
The Ryzen 9 X3Ds are worse for gaming. Not for other tasks
I'm going back to nVidia next, done with Radeons. Waiting for the 4080 Supers to release, then I'll free myself from Radeon shenanigans. :)
It seems you misunderstood the video that you linked. Look again, from here: [https://youtu.be/BbGomv195sk?si=6Qjmm1DbOiwK9abD&t=782](https://youtu.be/BbGomv195sk?si=6Qjmm1DbOiwK9abD&t=782)  
**The only important thing is that the highest point of the radiator is higher than the pump, so you can trap air there.**  
When you mount the radiator on top of the case, the whole radiator is higher than the pump, so the air will always collect on top of the radiator, and not in the pump nor in the tubes.  
Second correct position is vertical mount with tubes down, like you mentioned. Tubes down because you don't want trapped air to go through the tubes and in the pump. I don't know how to simplify it further.
But its still a 5600
google it, sweetspot is 3200
Dude touch grass
86 at 4k in a very demanding single player game isn’t good enough? I like multi games at over 100 but for most single player games I tend to cap them at 60 and let my system have a breather, 7800x3d and 7900xt. I mean I can get over 100 in a lot of games at 3440x1440 but I like my system cool and quiet.
It’s anywhere from $1,100 to $1,600 more here. Absolutely not worth it.
The 7800 XT is only about 20% more powerful than a 6800 non-XT. 

If you were getting around 50 FPS at 4k in the games you've been playing, then yeah, a 7800 XT would likely get you about 60 FPS in those same scenarios. 

Still though, it's a pretty minor upgrade relative to the price. I'd either save up for a 7900 XT or continue using your 6800 until the next generation of GPUs arrive.
I mean you could, but it'll feel like you wasted money imo, especially for 4k

you're looking at less than 20% increase
I haven't felt as big of a leap as I thought when moving 5600x to 5800x3d, but I'm on windows 11 and updated the same day I installed the 5800x3d and I've heard this most recent update has nerfed gaming performance.

5600x is a great CPU, if I hadn't already planned on moving it to my wife's PC to upgrade her, I probably would've stayed with it until 8000 series
I mean if you have a 5600x rn you can just sell that current mobo cpu ram and add the budget for your 5800x3d and you can prob get like micro center deal of 7700x, 32 gb of 6000mhz ram, and a b650 for i think it was $400. If not then an a620 and a 7500f (if available in your country if not then 7600) with a 32gb 5600mhz ddr5 ram
Nice I run with a 3600x and 2080
Are you talking about X3D or non X3D?

The 7900X3D is worse because it has 6 X3D cores and 6 normal cores. The 7950X3D should be the best, but the overhead of core management basically removes its advantage (according to what I have heard). Gaming wise, 7800X3D = 7950X3D
I though the tubes were connected to the front radiator. I now see the Corsair logo on the fans of the top one - if they're connected to that one, it's fine.
You don’t know what you’re talking about. The ‘sweet spot’ is as fast as it can run stably. For some CPU’s that will be 3600mhz, for others 3900mhz.
you should do more research than a 2 second google search......
Eat a Richard. AMD gpus have always been trash for people who like 5 generation old budget builds that can run 720p at 30 frames. This build is horrible. Literallly no intake fans. Go touch a book.
86 is getting close to feeling smooth, but it's not quite there. I always set up games so I get at least 100 FPS, preferably over it. 60 FPS is unacceptable, and not smooth. VRR can't make up for the lack of frames. Single player games are always better with high FPS too, the idea of settling for 60 seems silly to me, especially when it's not the game itself being a "locked to 60" product.
I think I'll opt for the latter and just build AM5 system in a year or so.
I'm considering buying 1440 ultra wide 144 h monitor instead of 4k 60hz
Alright, this makes me appreciate my 5600x then as it is. I honestly have no complaints about any game related performance with it. As far as windows update nerfing gaming, how so?
If I’m going AM5 I’m going 7800X3D
Im talking about x3d was just tired of typing it on the phone
its because of infinity fabric ratio
\^This guy Ryzens
[removed]
It very much depends on how good the memory controller on the CPU SoC is. The earlier ones (manufactured close to release) can run 3733 RAM, meaning 1866MHz Infinity Fabric.

Newer CPUs have less defects and can most of the time run 3800 RAM meaning 1900MHz IF.

A lot of the new ones even run 4000 RAM (=2000MHz IF). I did even see some with 4200 RAM (2100MHz IF) and higher, but that is very luck dependent.
Your comment has been removed, likely because it contains trollish, antagonistic, rude or uncivil language, such as insults, racist or other derogatory remarks.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Amd) if you have any questions or concerns.*
What you don't want is having your RAM to Infinity Fabric (IF) ratio not being 1:1 (RAM speeds are doubled because of the technology). 

I.e. you can run 2100MHz IF with only 3200 RAM, but it will cause a lot of extra overhead which causes a lot of lag.
As a 23 year old editor, this sub is literally the most discouraging and depressing thing I've ever read.
That's it, that's the post.
Nah, check out r/FilmIndustryLA if you *really* want to get bummed out.
I come and go from interacting with this sub. The honest truth is this trade is very fragmented. In terms of what part of the industry you fall into, what region you’re in, and what success looks like to you. People often come here looking for answers but this business and your career are such a solo experience it is incredibly hard to find a gauge.
Have you tried fixing it in post?
Chin up- it ain’t us and it ain’t you, it’s the state of the entire industry.
I am a 30+ year veteran editor for television, and I lost my career in the last year. 
I didn’t lose a job, I lost my entire career as many others have as well. 
So yeah, the entire industry is depressing right now.
I'm a few years ahead of you. We're entering at a very turbulent time. Editing isn't going anywhere, but what that job means and looks like is changing rapidly, and the slimdown of the industry isn't helping!
![gif](giphy|l0MYGb1LuZ3n7dRnO|downsized)
Hmmmm…. Don’t wait for footage …. Make the footage and edit it. That’s the trick.
Welcome to editing!
I got so confused reading this thread, until I realized wait, this community is for FILM editors! I’m a copy editor and developmental editor. I’ll see myself out in a moment, but a lot of what I read here, the issues finding work now, etc., is similar to what I’ve seen in my Facebook communities for copy editors—incredible angst about the effect of clients and employers using AI for editing and writing services. Good luck to us all! Ironically, I recently stumbled into a niche that I think has potential. I’ve edited a couple of memoirs, and I’ve learned a lot about self publishing. Lately, I keep encountering people who want to write their memoirs and self-publish them. So, I’m starting to build my marketing for that, refine the services I can offer in that area. I could also facilitate workshops on it. 

One thing that has helped me a lot in the last few years is being part of a local professional networking organization for women in my county. One connection I made a couple of years ago at a happy hour provides several thousand dollars of revenues a year, and I just made a new connection at an event this week that I hope will have similar results.
That's the industry right now sadly.
Welcome to being an adult.
I went from working a shit job in signage and getting fired to teaching myself how to edit from YouTube video to now 10 years down the track been a freelance videographer/editor. I work on two Saturday afternoon commercial tv cooking shows and I have a retainer with a pharmaceutical company that pays 100k a year.

This career has enabled me to start a family and buy a house. I'm always busy and have never marketed myself. 

This sub is very depressing. A lot of people struggling to find work and generally miserable about their future in the industry. I had to stop reading it a few months back because it was giving me the illusion that the whole industry was dead. Step outside and touch grass.
Don't blame the Redditors. They're going through the same thing you are. 

If you have tons of great news, even personal accomplishments, to share, then please share.
I work on the video editing side of things (social media, marketing, youtube, business videos, talking heads, ads, etc). If you get into this area you will find plenty of work always, and can pay pretty well.

The film editing industry is not doing so well for what I can learn from this sub, but every person is different.
Editing is a savory job, some might say salty. Do not trust a sweet editor.
I don’t agree about this sub but you should try the Teachers sub. This sub is the Glee Club by comparison.
This sub feels a bit like product reviews on Google; you mainly see feedback from editors with complaints, while those who are happy with their jobs tend to stay quiet.

Since 2018 I have been employed in unscripted. I still get job offers every few weeks that I have to turn down and only take time off when I set my schedule aside for vacations.

It's not just reddit. In general, editors can be a negative bunch, probably because many of us are introverts who find it tough dealing with the sometimes ridiculous notes from producers. Although from the type that comment on Reddit, id imagine it's a an extra combination of negativey.

I've found that being positive, likable, and easy to get along with can do wonders for your career. At the end of the day, producers are the ones doing the rehiring, and they’d rather work with editors who are easygoing than those who come across as arrogant. Most editors can deliver a solid edit; it’s about being someone a producer wants to sit with for three months straight.

And hey, even on the bad days, there’s always the satisfaction of wiping away our tears with all that sweet, sweet cash.
I don’t do editing for a living, but have friends who do. Reddit is a bit of an echo chamber so all the negative thoughts and opinions bounce around and get amplified on every sub, whether slits editing, or toe nail clipping, it’s the nature of Reddit. You may see the odd successful editor on here, but they won’t be commenting every day because they are too busy editing. So the general views on here are biased. I’m bracing myself for the onslaught of downvotes and people telling me about the state of the industry.
Its not just this sub, its just how all of reddit is lately. Im sure ill get downvoted to hell but a lot of people who post regularly on reddit do so because they are unhappy and choose to spend their time interacting here instead of the real world.

Its a hard industry and burnout is real, this sub seems to be an echo chamber of that frustration.

That being said I quit my editing job 3 days ago and started a job marketing soooooooo……
Yeah, you're not wrong. As a 23 year old editor myself, there's definitely been a few times where the sub has made me consider a change in careers while I'm still young.

That being said you need to keep in mind why people post in the first place. People are much more likely to post "I lost everything my life sucks" than "things are pretty good right now, same old same old. i ate cereal this morning". People post when they have an incentive to post, whether that be something positive or negative. And with the industry bleeding the way it is right now, it just causes us to have a very concentrated dose of editors who got shafted by the current state of things.

Like yeah, we're not in a great spot right now, but that also depends a lot on what type of work you're doing exactly and where you're based. The industry isn't dying as a whole, it's just changing. The profession isn't going anywhere, and even narrative work will bounce back eventually and as long as you're willing to adapt and evolve with the profession, as well as maybe keep a backup plan in mind if you decide you don't want to deal with the stress and uncertainties anymore, you should be fine I think.

Or maybe I'm just yapping and have no idea what I'm talking about idk, I'm 23 and I cannot be trusted with adult responsibilities.
As an editor/videographer/producer for 23+ years, I love this sub. It’s like a dive bar where there’s always someone more miserable than you. I feel better about my job and I get to try and lift someone else up by telling them their job in film that isn’t going anywhere is not the end of the road.
Most of us who are currently working aren’t posting on here. Same as LinkedIn. Don’t take all the negativity as gospel.
I think a 23 year old editor armed with the word literally is more depressing
[deleted]
Light can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to sync lock all tracks.
I know people say, ignore the comments, it’s not reality but this is literally some end times going on and when ai hits full throttle, it’s gonna be worse.
Everyone has already shared their views here but it comes down to this. You are 23. You can acquire skills. Be as apt as you can; be smart and savvy. And then realize it comes down to finding your pocket. There’s niches of employment. Figure out how to be in one, and how to stay there.
Welcome!
For me editing is the worst part of the entire process I hate doing it and it’s boring and tedious. I only do it because I only trust my taste for what the client wants and it makes me more money.
It’s interesting to hear it’s the same in the US. I live in NZ, and studied Post production last year (Avid, grading etc), and we were constantly told post get the most jobs. Fast forward to this year and all of my CLA friends are pretty consistently getting work- Minecraft, new predator film etc but post is dead. My friend works for WB in the reality space and they’ve laid off the majority of their team. Not the best right now, but I am hearing that 2025 will be picking up. In the mean time I’m just keeping my skills fresh working on short films and some freelance stuff.
For the record, my career is going relatively well (knock on wood) and I still love it years later. People who are happy don’t have as much need to vocalize online. 
Things are tough out there yes but we are HARDLY the only industry suffering right now and far from the industry hit hardest by AI. 
Working is tough all around, and as you get older you sometimes think it should be easier because you’re so experienced— but you need to learn to pivot your skills according to what the industry needs. If you can do that, and you know you wanna be here, then be here.
I started as an editor decades ago. My first week a coworker told me this job is golden handcuffs and editor is a dying career. 

Thought he was wrong until they got rid of all the editors at my job a few years ago, saving only a few who are now writers.
I (23F) commenting to say it is possible and you don’t have to be in LA to do it. I’m in upstate NY. Yes not NYC
Editor going on 48 years (film, tape, NLE). Bubbles happen. Have faith it will come back. Keep your skills sharp. Edit on the side. Reach out to your network of people. Learn AI/ML. Don’t be scared of it; embrace it.
A lot of people here suck
U need to look at ur career as chess moves and leverage. Thinking 5-10 steps ahead of where u want to go in relation of where u see the industry going and how u become hard for an employer to let u go even in tough times… If ur just an “editor” u need to be incorporating others skills like visual effects, data management, AI skills.
Welcome to the suck
The industry is not doing well at the moment. During and after COVID, there were lots of cuts in staffing/personnel and budgets dried up. Because of this, unfortunately, you have a lot of editors who are depressed and desperate for work. So, yeah, you're going to see a lot of negative, discouraging posts.

Things may be picking up in some quarters, but it's certainly slow for a lot of people at the moment.
things are bad right now, worse then they have ever been. Ive been doing this for 35 years and it is discouraging. The opportunities I had coming up no longer exist.
If you're a 22 year old editor get off the internet and get editing.
I'm working in corporate and working steadily. I think there are a lot of people outside of Hollywood doing well or at least okay right now and they're probably not posting about it because they don't have a reason to or don't want to rub it in other's faces.
Bah. Editing is great. Any time you find a career with so many crotchety old people doing it, the fact is that they love it enough to stick with it for decades, and that it pays well enough that we made careers out of it.

Any time you see people complain about something a lot, that also means they CARE about it a lot.

You’ll be fine.
lol this thread is basically just people who’ve been editing so long that they don’t know anything else and are projecting their own fears about the future onto you. That being said, the industry is definitely changing a lot.

Can you put together masterpieces of editing/VFX? Maybe.

Do people actually give a shit about the quality of work anymore? Not so much.

Nowadays editing is more about pushing pixels around for a micromanaging egomaniac boss/client than it is about fine-tuning a well-planned production. And freelance always felt more like being a slave to every whim of the few clients I could scrape together towards the end. Left the industry, and I now realize just how much of myself I sacrificed for an art form which has been enshittified in every sense of the word. So many artists out there having their unique ideas squashed by incompetent bosses whose only qualification for owning a production company is that they have the money for it. Just my two cents don’t murder me
This sub is sadly mostly negative and elitist, but no worries, generally editing is a great job depending on your exact field. If you need any help, feel free to ask! You'll probably always get some answer
I’ve had a very successful post career I just don’t post here. Some of us made it don’t get discouraged.
The real world is much better than the cesspool online. Don't get discouraged. Work on your skills and be a good person and good things will happen for you.
Man don’t let the negativity get you. There are many successful editors getting great work and they don’t have the time to come nag about it here. 

It’s a great industry to be in. There is a ton of opportunity.
😂😂😂
Try my tax return!!!
You have a lot of years to grow. If the next forty go like the last there at least two boom cycles in there. Will you use this downturn to learn how to be resilient, live beneath your means and build your network so you will be ready when that boom happens? 
If you really like to edit, you might want to consider what happens.
There’s always the trades.
Check r/VFX
Seeing anything film or tv related, for sure. I went a slightly more secure line, I do freelance internal corporate, I budget what I need to make for the year and I track everything, I had a super slow 3 months over the summer, but I did the math and if I work 15 more days I’ll be covered for the rest of the year. Best part is, it’s the easiest work ever, most of the time I put in a few hours a day and everyone praises how good you are because they are used to absolute garbage, I love it
I’m 31 graduating and entering the field I do have another gig that will pay bills but I just wanna edit hate having to have another job
I think what I’m seeing is a general shift in the industry. As a 23 year old, you have some options to adjust- which is a good thing!

I think it’s becoming harder to do just one thing anymore. I live in a medium/low sized market (city under 1 million people) and I find it’s best to know a few things. In my case, editing and motion design. For you maybe it’s editing and colour grading, or being able to also do some camera op work. Diversify your skillset and you can diversify your income. Also budgets aren’t what they used to be so sometimes you might need to do more low budget corporate stuff to pay the bills.

But lots companies are producing content so there is work! Just lots of competition and lower budgets. Do great work, work on your skills, treat your clients well and you can still make a go of it.
I just come here for technical advice. Its still unmatched.
The biggest problem is supply and demand. Too many people willing to work bottom dollar for entry and too many excited replacements waiting in the wings to get used and abused. That pretty much tanked compensation aside from entities willing to use and abuse people’s ambitions. That is the main reason I went from broadcast to large scale private corporate meetings and ditched editing altogether for media server playback. It’s a great parallel pivot from editing that is timeline based and in demand, although very niche.
If it’s any consolation, market trends historically have had ebbs and flows. Media is largely having in an ebb moment right now. When I was your age, there was a writer’s strike and financial crisis that caused the industry to come to a grinding halt. Sound familiar? It should, but the year was 2008 that time. It was tough finding a gig in the industry as a fresh-faced film grad with little real world experience, so I worked in insurance for the first 3 years after college. It felt horrible at the time, like I failed and my career was doomed before it started. I eventually found work in the industry when the economy rebounded and market forces in the field shifted for the better. I’ve been laid off twice from jobs in the time since. Each time I just kept trudging ahead even if the future felt uncertain, the only reason being because I loved post and the craft. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else but I’d be lying if I said I did not want to give up in the face of such obstacles, every single time. 

Today, I’m a staff editor at a large creative agency, but I still keep my reel up to date. My point is, market forces are always going to be variable. My advice is when times are good, you should be prepared for when they’ll be bad; by the same token, when times are bad, you should stay prepared to seize any opportunities that may arise when times finally improve. I’d also recommend abstaining from reading too much of the gloom online - you’re already down about it, justifiably so, but there’s no need to put yourself through more discouragement. If you love the craft, keep cutting, even if it’s personal projects, online learning, or just for fun.
Check out subs for software coders/programmers.  Or probably any other sub for professionals right now. Economy sucks and there are no jobs anywhere other then min wage stuff
That’s life better get used to it. Theres always gonna be low periods. Same happened in 2008.
It’s pretty much every subreddit nowadays.
Some wisdom for interacting with the internet: people who are busy with work don’t have time to post. 

There are always exceptions with pros who also love to be a free resource but most people who are really active online aren’t as active in the field. 

That’s why, if you looked at sheer volume of posts over the decades, you’d assume that the industry standard platform was FCP or Premiere or now Resolve and that Avid was a rarity. People making money know that’s not been true. 
I’m making good money at a steady job in the communications department of a large university.  It has its ups and downs, but it’s a unicorn job in the video world.  There’s plenty of jobs out there.
 The world IS in a bad place right now, and reddit is an echo chamber for negativity. You have to limit your time on reddit and doomscrolling. Yes the industry is fucked and becoming an editor is a stupid, terrible idea- but if you wanna do it, you have to actually work on your skills, not doomscroll. 
It's the same feeling as when countless recording studios closed on the 2000s.
You are in the "don't look down" period of climbing the mountain. If you do, you'll slow your ascent for fear of falling, and even if you fell right now, you'd walk away with bruises most likely.

There are some bleak choices facing some older people with a lot to lose who haven't gained enough yet. Dead in the middle of the sandwich where none of the crumbs are going to escape. 

But you, right now, just need to do anything. Work, learn, grow. Some opportunities are better than others, but you'll grow doing almost anything at your level for a while. You have nothing to lose, and if you grow and change with the industry, you'll have a fulfilling career in whatever editing becomes.
I only recently started using Reddit again after a year long break. Since coming back I've unsubscribed from most 'creative' subreddits because of how depressing they've become. Reddit has always had a tendency to be on negative side of any argument, but it's gotten a bit ridiculous lately. It's understandable in the sense that we're currently in an economic downturn and there's alot of uncertainty in creative spaces because of AI, but the stereotype of the 'doom and gloom' Redditor is real.
Then contribute and make it better
I can share some positive energy. I work as an editor full time for an online educational company and got a 12% raise last year, and I’m on track for a promotion. Do I make the same as my friends in tech or sales? No, but I can provide pretty well for myself (in my middle class opinion) as a single woman in a large city and I enjoy my work. Maybe I’m naive or lucky but I feel optimistic about my skill set.
Hey me too. Things change in an instant and the internet can really distort things. Just keep putting in the work and get in front of new faces, the best opportunities go to the people they know. There’s still movies being made out there and they need editors!
Much like the news, the stories of success are usually less interesting than those of failure or struggle. So they get less views or never come up. This can lead to confirmation bais
Wait until you are 46.
Is a career in editing awesome? Yes! Is a career in editing also a total emotional rollercoaster? 1000% yes. I’ve been in trailer editing for 15 years and I still love editing every single day but there are extreme lows that will have you questioning why you got into this because every day you are putting yourself out there to be judged and there’s so little you have control over as to how that’s received. But I love the creativity is editors have in getting to solve problems and work magic. 

Now, the state of the industry right now is its own beast to deal with. Be smart, adaptable, and asses your own willingness for risk.
Ikr
It’s more like those who are happy wont post about it and those who are sad won’t stop posting about it.
Get off Reddit. I’m only here because Reddit recommended this post to me, and I couldn’t help replying. Reddit is filled with a LOT of resentful loser energy. Reddit has this network effect of attracting these certain personalities… Tune it out. Just keep creating and don’t get discouraged. I graduated during the last economic collapse and finding work in the industry felt unimaginable at the time and now I’m the senior editor at a successful creative agency in LA. You’ll figure it out. Just keep going.
Here’s the thing… people who come to Reddit are usually looking for answers. They need community/support. People who are perhaps more successful or out there working full time as editors aren’t really spending time on forums because, well, they don’t have that kind of need. So that creates a disparity. Just like if you go to a bar… you’re not going to find a ton of people from AA. I’m a full time filmmaker, I found a job as a video director with a business a year out of college, I’m mostly self taught, and I worked my way to start my own video business along with my wife. It’s a culmination of years of experience, failure, triumph, and imposter syndrome. I’m not in LA, I’m not doing the “Hollywood” thing, but I never really wanted to. I wanted to tell stories that matter to people, and now have that privilege to do as a career. 

I shoot wedding videos, testimonials for businesses, mini documentaries, and educational content. And unfortunately I don’t have a ton of time to browse Reddit because, well, I’m busy. lol 

Keep working hard, keep developing your craft, stay humble, and never stop learning. You got this.
i am a tv program editor who made SGD8.7k per season. (25min x 13 eps). Will I survive?
its literally filled with the most gatekeeping non supportive people alive
Editing should be your passion and if you don’t need it in your life there are tons of other ways to live your life.
Man, I feel you! It seems like all we see is negativity, and that can drag us down. But remember, every great editor has had their fair share of ‘oops’ moments before they nailed it
I find that being just an editor is bleak. I worked at a podcast studio and found myself excelling at producing and managing shows and now with my own business I do that. I still do a lot of editing but I’m more than just an editor now and that’s okay. Editing is a necessary skill to have but shouldn’t be all that you do
If it makes you feel any better, I’m a full time editor currently on vacation in Japan while still editing for my YouTube clients. I make a steady $4,100 a month from repeat clients and only need to edit about 4-8 hours a day. I’m not making any Netflix documentaries anytime soon, but I am a fast and reliable editor who’s found dream clients. Couple this with being married and splitting all my bills, and I consider myself very successful! If I wanted to work a little harder, I could probably bump it up to 5 or 6k a month but honestly, I’m happy with the work load and pay atm. 
Needless to say, I’m super happy I quit my medical job to pursue editing full time. It’s not all bad for everyone out there!
What I like about this sub is that, if there is a technical issue, you can post and eventually get a response. What I don’t like is the fragmentation that leads to negativity.
You should read more widely! There’s tons of material to depress and discourage out there in the world!
It's a weird industry and there is a lot of doom and gloom going on right now. I know a lot of older editors that aren't getting work at all and it's like the apocalypse for them. However, I've been with them for a good portion of their careers and know that they refused to learn any new skills, push past their comfort zone, and frankly never improved. So a decade later, those editors are obsolete. 

I'm 38 and started my career at 20, so 18 years in. I make anywhere from $95k - $150k per year. Working in Texas. I have a full-time job for a post house that does mostly TV ads and a lot of digital ads these days. Then, I supplement that by doing corporate stuff and a lot of education modules over the last few years because it pays well, theres seemingly infinite work and its super easy with low stress deadlines. From my perspective, the career is going just fine, and I'm still getting busier each year. The key is that the work has never stayed the same. If I had decided that I did this one thing, I'd be broke and probably working some retail job. 

My advice for anyone just starting is keep learning and improving. Don't lock yourself in with software, style, work.
As a 23 year old this is your turn  to turn away and find another career. 57 yo editor out of the business for 10 years. I tried.
I’m a Uk Broadcast editor based in Bristol. I entered the industry in 2006. I have about 12 editor friends of similar experience based between here and London….mostly working in Broadcast but also for streamers. 

We are ALL working and have done this past year. We ALL have work booked in for 2025.
The truth is that editing, just like any creative professional work, takes time to establish a career. What type of editor do you want to be? A film editor? Look for short film directors to gain experience. Commercial editor? Edit a spec commercial. Learn videography and film a commercial yourself or for a local business (even if it’s on your free time for little pay). The reality is that the best editors in the industry aren’t at risk of losing work, even now. They are still actively sought out. Same with writers, same with directors, and cinematographers, and so on. Focus on building a portfolio, even if it’s an hour a day while you take a day job. I’m getting paid work as a film editor working for a local director, but it took a few years of working a non-industry job and doing free editing work on the side before anything came of it. A lot of people in this sub, myself included, are still young and are learning and growing as editors. Just because you might not have editing work now doesn’t mean you can’t have a career in the future. Focus on your weaknesses, build a portfolio. We got this!
Miracles can happen. I'm currently editing for a marketing company based in Dubai, and THEY approached me out of no where lol. I think my website looks ok, but can probably be better. I'm only kicking myself at the moment because I could have probably charged them more with the current project I'm doing for them.

A bit of a side note - I don't know if this is my saving grace but having grown up with low self esteem and some "outsider" complex, I never believed I was able to break into the legacy entertainment industry in the UK, and never did thus far. However, always having that feeling it was a "closed shop" to me allowed me to have different expectations and broaden my horizon to different types of markets. 

For once I actually feel like things are headed in the right direction, and not expecting I would have a "sexy" career is actually kind of paying off for the time being.
As a 23 year old editor you are a tadpole and therefore don't know true pain yet.

Don't worry.  You will.

This sub is honestly not even bad.  LMAO.
By reading a lot of comments I can only come to the conclusion that:

- if an AI steals your job it probably means that you suck at it.

- in an era where video is king and you can’t fin work…well, I guess you suck at your job.

Improve, get better, be more interesting.
What exactly is the issue?
At this point that subreddit is 50% “which skills do I put on resume for non industry professions” and 50% “we just have to survive till 2025”
And r/vfx
Or /r/vfx - the vfx industry has totally imploded.
💯
Ya i unsubbed from it. It was so negative
😭😂😭😂
All of em are bad news. Check out the hopelessness over at r/vfx as well. 

Most commercial art will eventually be replaced by AI.
I like your term “what part you *fall into* “
Seems rather apt. Life and career can take you in directions.
Good advice. I work finance as a producer. Things get hard but it’s not the same as the majority of opinions here. I’m permanent, so salaries aren’t as high as some contract/freelance fees, but I have pvt medical & other benefits, if I get sacked I will get a severance package, and I’m always earning every month consistently.

Further to this, I got into production for the joy of it, almost accidentally as it was just an interest that grew. I liked making things. These days, if ever I get disillusioned or jaded because the work is boring, I’ll take on some portfolio work or enter an editing competition or something. Just flex to remember I enjoyed this for myself once and still do.

Industry is governed by corporate interests and untethered avarice. It takes a lot to be ensure this doesn’t affect how I feel about the craft. Also, gig economy practitioners have been living lavida loca, lavish. It’s no surprise that bubble burst.
I agree with this.
Well said. There's a massive disconnect between this sub and the actual path I'm on, I feel like most of us that are "real" editors have forged unique paths that no one else walks precisely the same. At the same time we're just one in a million, but still.
Roguelike huh? I like it
Even if I was going to be an editor I would have gone to business school.
As editor of 14 years I agree with this
Well put.
This is the correct response.
Exactly this.
Do we have better b-roll? 
Bahahahha. Brilliant. Thank you for the giggles. I’m in a room with two other editors reading this post and busted out laughing. Thank you. They thank you too.
This is what happens when you don't use a proxy workflow
I’d turn it off and back on again first
You need to have more fun with it
No
Pretty much the same boat. Sorry to hear it and good luck in the future.
So you can’t adapt right? The only thing you know is shitty television?
Honestly, this is not even bad.    
  
Try working in other industries.

As rocky as it is, at least we don't run the risk of death by injury or worse.  Poverty sucks, but at least it's temporary with our skill sets.
This ^^^
I'm trying to discern if it's editing or reddit specifically.
Really fascinating stuff, thank you for sharing! Hope you enjoyed your stay in the *other* editor subreddit
I can't tell you how many times I've had people ask what I do and when I respond, "I'm an editor" they think I'm a copy editor. I once got a free Kindle out of the misunderstanding.
But on the bright side(?), in the UK we’ve gone from 75% of the industry out of work last year to ONLY 54% out of work, so…
Amazing story. This is what we need to hear more of
So happy for you dude :)
This.

But most people really just suck or can’t find alternatives…in an era where video is everywhere.

Somehow it makes me laugh.
How did you get the pharmaceutical client and your other clients without marketing yourself? Especially when you’re first starting?
Fantastic! People on this sub sometimes just need to go outside and breathe. Get off Reddit
How do you market yourself? (Asking for advice for myself lmao ✋🏿😭)
As a staff editor, I have first hand knowledge that my employers don't give a shit if you're good or not. They keep giving more work to people they know and people they've worked with before.

Everyone should just stop complaining about NLE problems and focus on networking and being more likeable.
Oh yeah, tons of people are out of work because they're negative. Thanks for pointing this out.
Totally agree!
Touché
nah I think I'll stick with this
Solid advice right there!
Back in the day, I thought being just good at one thing would cut it. Then I ended up learning some visual effects and AI skills just to keep up—and because who doesn't like the idea of being indispensable? Think of it as creating your own superhero editor persona. Diversifying skills isn't just smart, it makes this whole ride more fun too!
[TheSuckZone_Twister_PhilipSeymourHoffman.gif](https://tenor.com/b12Hu.gif)
No, this thread is not elitist, it’s reflecting the state of the entertainment industry.
Sorry if you find that annoying.
So do the rest of us who have lost their careers.
I bet your pardon! This is not elitist. This is the way this sub and editing is right now. There is NOTHING ELITIST about not being able to pay bills and feed your kids when you've put your heart and soul into your craft, something you genuinely love to do, for 30 years and now your job goes to some fucking pipsqueak who's willing to do a gig for $100 because he's still living with Daddy. Nah... That not elitist.

Now for OP: You can ask questions here and get some really good answers. There's no lack of experience in these threads. Prolly some of the best real working editors in the business. But please understand that everybody here is ruined pretty raw by the current state of the edit world. Good luck going forward.
okay, as someone who tends to work in an area of editing most "elitists" would snub, it's also very hard. even "non elitist" spaces I've seen are hiring less than half the people they were before, at least from my reckoning. yes, it's not all doom and gloom, because someone somewhere is getting hired. but to dismiss the concerns of experienced people in the field as "elitist" without looking at the merits of it is its own kind of elitism.
Same, but for a healthcare company. Can get boring at times, but it's steady work with good benefits. Can't complain about that!
I like my job. Idk if I could do anything that isn't film/video related.
Do you mind me asking how do you find YouTube clients?
Suck d*€£s till ‘26.
I feel like all these subs are now just YouTube editors
Just curious…what’s gonna change in 2025? Lol
Tf is gonna happen in 2025?
Long time coming for that
Very much the truth.
Underrated advice.
Do we have one where she’s actually smiling?
The shots out of focus, can you do something about that
I turned my clips offline and online and nothing happened
Adapt to what?
When literally 90% of the folks running the networks have been terminated, and those same networks and platforms have drastically cut the amount of shows they are releasing per year, as well as the promotion for those shows, which was my industry here in NYC. 
And it’s not just me whining, all my friends who are editors and audio engineers and producer/writers are literally out of work- seemingly for good. 
A good friend of mine who worked at HBO is working retail in New Jersey right now. an executive producer friend who I have won awards with now works in her doctors office so she doesn’t lose her house.
I could go on, but it would sound like I’m exaggerating. 
And by the way, I’m not embellishing in the least. 
For every editor position announced on LinkedIn, they get over 200 applications and end up hiring the poor sap for a lower rate than they would have three years ago.
It's the worst time most of us have seen in our careers, it will rebound a little eventually but not before a lot of people lose everything.
Nope. It's editing.
Remember the first edit is for you. Every version after that is for the client/paycheck.
The editors who are still gainfully employed probably have less time to post on Reddit
Plenty of people are doing well, but don't want to peacock publicly because so many others are struggling. 

Editing, like pretty much any career in media and entertainment, is driven by hits and has extremely uneven outcomes. While a lot of people are getting wiped by the downturn, others are dong great. 

You're only 23, so go make a try of it. My biggest tip is the traditional ladders to building a career are broken because people aren't moving up or retiring. 

Side step that by immediately working as an editor and build relationships with rising filmmakers. The people "paying their dues" will end up working under you if your relationships build into a career.
It's definitely editing.  Congrats fuckbag, you get to sit in a chair and make so much money it'd make a homeless person cry while hating your life and enjoying your work. Now go make something pretty that only .05% of the population is capable of.
A little from track v1, and a little from v2.

The audio is already mixed in with the music track and we don't have the split masters anymore.
I've seen this trend in many different job related subs.
It's 70% Reddit lol this website is full of mostly miserable people who come online to complain and have their complaints validated. Don't read too much into it
1000% its reddit
Reddit :)
Where did you get this info?
If enough people leave the industry we can get a even lower percentage.
Just networking and word of mouth. I volunteered for some intern work at a sports academy with the idea that it would give projects to work on that I could then share to show case my abilities. 

After a few weeks of that I started doing paid work for various companies that sponsored the sport academy. Then a new sponsor came in that was also in talks with a production company that were starting a low budget tv show. Through networking I got friendly with the dop of the show and got a gig as an assistant editor. Later on I would go on full time with that production company shooting and editing.

The after a few years of that I decided that I needed to pivot and I started freelancing. Through networking again I got connected with a internal marketing manager at a pharmaceutical company. I understood what the opportunity meant as a way of earning good money so I bent over backwards to deliver a quality product. That was over 10 years ago. Some years I would get 1-2 months of work off them other years 4-6 months. 

I got connected with a few big agencies in Sydney that after only a few projects gave me 10-20+ new contacts. That lead to the two tv shows I now edit. 

Whenever I'm seeing a big gap in the calendar I simply start calling people out of the list of so many contacts that I have acquired over the years. I'm not calling to ask for work. I'm calling to genuinely connect and see how they are doing, chat about new trends and gear or to ask for a recommendation on something. There are lots of people in the industry and youre not relevant if your not constantly reminding people that you are there. And it works both ways. When I'm too busy I always have people that I have built a great working relationship, that I trust, that I can rely on.
All cool and all, unless your reality is much worse than what’s on Reddit. And that’s the case for many people. Downplaying their struggle is just wrong.
What kind of edits do you usually do? Do you have a typical client of client? Do you have a portfolio ?
> NLE problems and focus on networking and being more likeable

legitimately I've been working on this ever since I realised like 90% of the job posts list every major NLE anyway
I've seen people with jobs that imo have no business having, but because they're friendly and likeable they find work.
Get used to working with a bunch of cranky jaded curmudgeons! There MIGHT be some fun along the way
Definitely have a strong backup plan in place at least. Video work in 2024 is starting to feel like the music industry. Like yeah there’s still a few making good money at it, but for most it’s becoming a pipe dream.
Got laid off after seven years at the same company as the senior editor. I have been ghosted by every recruiter and interviewer this summer, it’s dire.  I still love editing, and have found passion in my solo content creation, but really trying to understand how I went from making six figures to potentially having to apply at McDonald’s. It’s scary for us older peeps right now. At least your the age of the people we’re all getting replaced with. Good luck 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
I hear you. When I decided I wanted to marry my girlfriend, now wife of 32 years, we sat down and figured out what I was good at. Everything pointed towards television. I dropped into editing for the sheer love of it. Editors were always the coolest guys. And it fit well with my personality and skill set. Now that I'm faced with needing to do something different for a living, nothing Else good. And shuffling shit around at Walmart doesn't even come close to paying bills.
I took a local acting class and found people in need. Lots of writers and performers with no editors in sight. Word of mouth basically. Online I’ve found 0 results, even with millions of views under my belt.
Time to work at 7-11 in '27
I’ve been saying “Eat a dick till 26”

Same thing. Hahaha.
5 bucks is 5 bucks
People will post about surviving till 2026
Nothing
I think Hale Bopp is gonna do a 180 so drink the koolade and remain cool.
We are loving the flow of it. Can we try a different music though?
Re-import? 🤷‍♂️
All of my "fucks given" have been offline for a while now.
To put it briefly, by adapt they really mean completely change careers: become a full on content specialist, or working for pennies on upwork and YouTube. 
careful now, you might spoil a 23 year old's buzz with all this gloomy reality chat. rainbows and unicorns please
Serious shortage in the UK of EVS/sport replay ops, if anyone wants an idea for retraining in a closely related job
People who don’t have the capacity to find a way won’t. People who are resourceful and can find a way don’t lose ‘everything’ - they learn to hold onto what matters.
I want to get this comment printed, framed, and put over my desk as a reminder.
This is the way
From BECTU, though it’s actually 52% not 54%:

https://bectu.org.uk/news/three-quarters-of-uk-film-and-tv-workers-currently-out-of-work-bectu-survey

https://bectu.org.uk/news/half-of-uk-screen-industry-workers-remain-out-of-work-bectu-research-finds
Ha, yeah, I did question that! Though in my experience, it really does seem to be picking up!
I'm not downplaying anyones struggle. All I'm saying is that this sub paints a different picture to what is possible.
>cranky jaded curmudgeons

We've turned into the soundtrack composers we always would complain about being cranky and jaded.
Stick wid it till twinty sixt
That’s how I got my start in the industry. I was an intern for the local NBA team and their in-arena production team just bought an EVS and needed people to learn how to use it. I was the main EVS guy for like 5 years after that. It really is editing on the fly, I would have 5-10 sequences of highlights going at anytime and manage content coming in nonstop.
How would one go about this…?
Yeah they're just losing their homes and careers, nothing important....
well yeah, many of them do it by doing not editing when times are hard, which is definitely resourceful, but.. this is an editing subreddit, so ... the doom and gloom is a little understandable.
Well if THAT's your attitude....you'll be fine. Welcome.
I mean, sure, but suffering and seeing no results is also possible. Reading up on someone’s success story when you can’t make anything work for months/years can be more depressing than motivating, while seeing others also have it hard can be validating. To each their own I guess, I just don’t like telling people to “get off reddit” as a magic pill solution
As with any part of this business, network. Befriend and shadow an EVS op. Find a local sport broadcaster/OB company and see if they have any wee jobs going. Try to get into live streaming/Vmix stuff which can also get you relevant experience
You don't lose your career because the way you thought is was going to go isn't happening. You lose your career because you stop pursuing it. The experience and contacts they have don't go away just because the current environment is bad. It's still possible to stay in contact, do some sort of work, even if they have to produce it themselves, while they find alternative incomes to bridge this time frame. 

Losing one's home is a matter of financial strategy. If you live off what you make, you aren't prepared for the vagaries of the business, whether you own or not. I was counseled to have one year's expenses in the bank before I started freelancing. I didn't wait that long, but I have always maintained as much 'say no to bad jobs' money as I could, and it served me very well especially when the tide went out.  When I got aged out and eventually sold the home I raised my kids in, it made me a lot of money, and paid for exploring the choices available to me. 

Identifying yourself by your employer, or your property, instead of your skills and your family is not conducive to a long arc of satisfaction nor peace of mind.  I am not suggesting these are trivial issues, but I am saying there is a constructive context in which to view current circumstances. Anyone who can figure out the complexities of constructing a documentary story from a bunch of random footage can construct a better narrative for themselves than this. 

I highly recommend looking at what is growing, how that sector uses moving pictures and tap that. THe money may not be as good, but it's an application of the editing skill. 

Among the things I did when work was slow- bought and sold sports cars- LA has a crop cheap every fall and lots of people looking for convertibles in the spring.  I also taught a class at the SMCC extension on how to buy a reliable used car. I rented out rooms in my house. It goes on like that. I never stopped checking in with my directors and producers regularly.   
Yes it's hard. No it's not the end of their careers unless they decide to quit.
Yes it is. And it’s not the only response possible.
Firstly reddit is a cesspool for negativity. Getting off it is a very easy task to improve your mental health and same goes for any other social media. 

Secondly you are going to suffer in life no matter what. The only difference between the ones that are content and those that are not is that the former choose something that they are going to suffer for something and over time all that voluntary suffering produces a career or business or home etc that has intense meaning and purpose.

If your suffering and not seeing any results you likely don't have clarity in your goals or maybe your just not cut out for it. If you can't make it work over months or years then it's likely your going to make it work. Brutal but true. 

I suffered a lot to get where I am. I had clear goals to achieve in my early career. I bent over backwards to please clients and had many all nighters to make things work. For 18 months I was terminally ill and had to try to salvage my entire life let alone my career. 

When things are slow share your work on social media. Reach out to people and tell them about what you do. Every single job on earth has a time when they make redundancies. Be better than the people who get made redundant.
Another reason to go outside and breathe and take a break from Reddit. Because it can be depressing, you’re right
Considering you haven't been part of the industry for years and left town a while ago maybe you aren't qualified to discuss the current state of things for la editors.
Well I’m still consulting and have contacts in the industry and my IP is in the market still, so I have current experience as well as having survived several downturns and disruptions as I developed, and the wisdom given me at those times was exactly what worked through those cycles. 
Quit if you like but consider your choices.
I'm working on a feature at one of the majors right now, im just aware how much luckier I am than most people.
It’s not just luck, although that certainly helps. Branch Rickey, who signed Jackie Robinson to the Dodgers, said “Luck is the residue of design”. 
May your good work and luck continue
Sora
there is such emotion on Sora.  I have spent some time looking for training videos on Sora - its all preliminary - I am sorry that I am not part of the beta tester group. 

Many people feel this is the end of the world.  I feel like this is opportunity. I have seen this over and over again over the decades - with true "artists" - and CMX, EMC, AVID, Premiere, Resolve, FCP, FCP-X, iMovie, CoSa After Effects, Cinema4D, Quantel PaintBox, Photoshop, etc, etc. etc.  I CANNOT WAIT to learn Sora - I cannot wait to learn any new technology.  There will be those people that take advantage of this opportunity (Because some suit and tie guy at an agency is not going to be creating anything) - and then there will be the people that take advantage of this, and make it their career. I can bore you (as I usually bore you) with examples like Unreal Engine - and I can discuss other related industries like audio with multi track analog recording vs. Pro Tools - and modern day production techniques like

Film vs. RED/Arri digital - SDI video vs. NDI, analog audio vs. Dante, etc,etc. etc.  - but all these people say "it's the end of the world. I am older than your grandfather, and I embrace Sora, or any other piece of crap that comes out - because THIS IS MY LIFE - all that matters is NEW STUFF, and the OLD BAGS (you know - people 10 years younger than me) - just DIE OFF.   I guess I feel this way about music. All these boomer stupid old people keep saying "oh, music was not as good as it used to be" - there is GREAT MUSIC TODAY - open your FUCKING EARS and just listen to all the artists out there in every genre - and you will hear great music. If anyone plays another Tom Petty song, I will just kill them. 

Bob

&#x200B;
Never change, Bob.
This is just another type of stock footage as far as I'm concerned. It's close enough to what you need for your cut, but it'll never be perfect. If you want perfection (like many brands and agencies need), then you have to film or create the content yourself from the ground up.
the false equivalence between a software like photoshop and sora is absurd. one of those two softwares ripped millions of pieces of art down from the internet (without the creators' permission) and trained itself to mimic them, the other is closer to a digital recreation of a notepad
>because some suit and tie guy at an agency is not going to be creating anything.

That is exactly what’s going to happen. If you hate the corporates trying to do your job, worse than you, for you, you should hate this.
You seem to be making quite a few mistakes.

For one, this is not the same as learning to use photoshop instead of a darkroom, or avid instead of a steenbeck and so on. This is a phase shift in the way videos can be made, possibly replacing entire aspects of production. I don't find it plausible that you will just  'learn sora' and magically be paid top dollar as an editor whilst the cost  and skill of making decent quality video plummets to nearly zero.

Further, I have experience working in photography and I've seen how that career is slowly becoming unviable, and now further damaged by AI. That could be a foreshadowing of what is going to happen to film jobs like an editor, in my opinion: maybe not disappearing but becoming less and less viable as a career. 

I don't think all forms of film production will be affected by this in the same way, but dismissing it as you are as just a matter or technophobia doesn't seem to add up.
The tech optimism/pessimism extremes here make me chuckle.

This tool came out _yesterday_ and suddenly everyone is an expert on how it will change their industry.

It's not a full blown AI editor that saves 20 hours, it's just one incremental piece of the puzzle. I think it'll be a decade before we see any real progress, and that assumes Microsoft and OpenAI don't completely screw it up and go proprietary. Knowing the history of Microsoft, I'm not holding my breath. This stuff isn't free, it takes massive datacenters to train and inference off of.

For every "idiot" that didn't learn new tools, I assure you there are 10 who did, and still failed. You should see what generative AI has been doing to code quality in the programming industry in general. It's quite alarming and points to greater issues that aren't being addressed with the technology.

I've only seen software create more problems than it ever solved, been that way since the 90's when we started obsessing over "better" ways to solve problems with software.

Sit tight, focus on foundation, and don't give too much attention to fashion or fear. If you're good at your craft, generative AI is just another paintbrush to pull out in certain situations. If you depend solely on any one paintbrush, you will eventually be a dull artist.
Hoping this tool will be able to give me some specific shots I’m looking for that stock sites cant quite deliver.  I’ll also be curious if it winds up allowed for commercial use.  Either way it’s exciting new tech for sure!
Beyond our careers being disrupted by AI I’m far more concerned about the broader social implications. How can we trust that video evidence in court hasn’t been falsified? How do we protect women and children from being harassed or blackmailed with fake p*rnographic videos? What about propaganda disseminated by foreign governments to interfere with elections? The ways this technology can be used with malicious intent will far outweigh any positives I can fathom. I wish this were a benign tool but it simply isn’t.
Go local. Folks are going to start hating on this stuff. Local markets are going to get a boost - small news stations, local ads, etc.
I mean we all love to make art, sure, but the problem is that it IS those “stock footage-y”, corporate videos and those kinds of gig that pay the bills for a lot of people, and then enable them to make art or just more creative, fulfilling projects once their rent is covered. 

It’d be great if we could all get paid to make art, but that’s not quite the system we live in unfortunately. 

It’s also never “just” a tool, any tool carries with it a certain baggage and way to view the world, and the relationships between creators, consumers and the material of our work. And AI is a lot less neutral than most tools.
1. Your comparisons are not the most genuine. Comparing AI to the advent of software like Photoshop and Cinema4D is not the same thing. AI, especially generative AI, encompasses a broader scope. It's not just a new tool or piece of software but a technology capable of learning and creating across multiple domains. Its versatility allows it to impact nearly every creative field, not just by offering new tools but by introducing the ability to automate aspects of the creative process itself, potentially learning and adapting to create in ways that mirror human authenticity.
2. People really seem to forget the decades upon decades upon decades of recorded history we have of how corporations and companies behave in a capitalistic society, of which we live. Profit maximization > ethics. So when something like this is introduced, what do you think the name of the game becomes? Because we're talking about profit margins that will make the industrial revolution look like peanuts.
3. Why would a creative studio need 75 creatives in-house when they could have 25 utilizing AI creative apps? Why would a VFX house need to bring on hundreds of roto artists when they could bring on a much smaller team utilizing AI? I could keep going, but you get the idea. This is the whole idea of AI. Automate as much human work as possible because humans require salaries, 401ks, vacation time, time to eat, time to sleep, etc.

You're quite literally talking about the most lucrative notion in all of human history, for so many industries across the planet. There will be pain, there will be fun, there will be amazing things, there will be very scary things, but you can make no god damn mistake that the ability to pay for a roof over your head doing creative work is going to get a lot tighter because many employment opportunities will be shadowed out as AI is able to learn and automate more and more tasks people base their livelihoods off of.

I really wish people would show a little more respect for the grand picture of what this technology aims to do, not just over the next 5-10 years, but the next 100 years.

I don't think end times are around the corner, but this isn't like the invention of the camera or the unreal engine. This is something on another level, and while I think the technology itself is obviously incredible, I really think we're forgetting about the whole, "how humans behave in a capitalistic society" thing.

And remember, we're just talking about gen AI. There will be so many other forms of AI than just generative. This is just a sliver of what's to come.
Sora still has a long way to go, and it has to get through copyright battles. All doable. 

But the first industries that will get hit are stock footage, advertising, and creators on social media. Then once it’s proven itself we’ll have the first animated film, then feature films. 

I’ve been using AI for copyrighting, and it still has a way to go as well just for text, but it enabled me to do 100x the work for a small business than I ever could have without it. 

There’s still plenty of time in the next 5 years before it’s really capable and used. But tbh, the idea of jobs as “prompt writers” is hilarious to me. ChatGPT can program itself through natural language already, soon they’ll get past the stupid prompts that are needed for image generation. It’ll be really simple sliders and adjustments that will be much more intuitive, just like effects and transitions have become drag and drop. 

The writing (in the future) is on the wall that a huge swath of our jobs will disappear as we know them today. Whether that means every small business gets world class content from a single creator, or there’s a race for the biggest, craziest content ever, there will still be jobs. But we’ll look back on large production teams and laugh at how absurd it was they convinced us to work the hours and sit behind computers in dark rooms. 

So there’s always good and bad… but it’s all hype for the next 5 years, and totally not ready.
Shoulda known it was Bob. Lowkey incoherent

Shhhhh
This is stupid. People who talk about AI being "just another tool" are completely missing the point. The reason these things are being developed isn't to give writers, editors, filmmakers and creatives another tool to use but to replace the need for those individuals all together.

When a new camera technology drops, who gets excited about it? Filmmakers, videographers, creative type individuals.

Who gets excited when this new AI shit comes out? Venture Capitalists, Tech Bro CEOs, studio executives. Why? Not because they think it will make the jobs of the creatives easier but because they think it will eventually replace those jobs all together.

They aren't shy about it. They talk openly about it. Do you think the David Zaslavs of the world look at this and think "boy, can't wait to see how the writers and editors use this" no they are thinking, "sweet fire all those people now, we don't need them anymore."
Sora looks like ass. I'm sure it'll improve,  but it has no soul, like all ai. Off putting and bizarre.
bob needs to take his meds
It's cool but has anyone seen how long those videos take to generate?

Havent seen any numbers.
What's the sources for Sora? There's no way they have trained it without violating copyrights and licenses. They want everyone to be woo'ed so they can pull in the money because this shit is expensive AF to make -but they want to hook people and "disrupt" while ignoring the real costs and meanwhile jobs will be lost. Who is going to make them show a full accounting of their sources and prove they own the copyrights? Big names need to start screaming. As soon as they get deepfaked they probably will.
This is going to massively change things whether you want to believe it or not. You can do nothing and worry or prepare 🤷‍♂️
Who hurt you, Bob
Man, people are misunderstanding this whole AI replacing creatives thing. There's always been 2 massive sectors of the market, one where the customer creates and one where a professional creates. It's the same thing that's happened time and time again with web-based tools. Graphic designers were scared of Canva, but really what it did was give the people who wouldn't hire a designer anyway the ability to make better designs. I know a few editors were scared of CapCut, but all it ended up being was a better tool for that customer sector. Nobody's hiring us to edit their random video for their internal boardroom presentation. This is a tool. Nobody is going to have AI make their wedding video/photos because AI *wasn't there.*
Why do we give this alcoholic lunatic the time of day on this sub?
I hope soon the models behind Sora become open-source so that you can use it too.  I tried to make a quick summary of how Sora AI works, e.g., the models behind it, etc in this video if it interests you in any way: [https://youtu.be/9ZIB4no9WDE](https://youtu.be/9ZIB4no9WDE)

Don’t think I’ve seen bob swear before, maybe I’m wrong though 🤔
Always had you down as a gritty realist, Bob, but this is the kind of optimistic motivational stuff I can get behind.

GO BOB.
Anyone that says we won't all be obsolete in the near future isn't paying attention.  Sora stuff looks great.  It's not perfect but the stuff I've seen is 100% usuable in most projects unless you have a high end Hollywood budget.  The difference is quality in one year is amazing.  Maybe they hit a wall of what's possible but if not then in 5 years AI will be making stuff that will look as good as an Marvel movie side by side.  And it's all leading to 100% personalized content, personalized video games etc.  At some point we'll be able to give some prompts and have  a new Batman movie with whatver actors we want and whatever story elements we want and probably have the full movie ready to watch in 5 minutes.  There will be die hards who want art made by humans that has a soul but that will be a niche that won't support the industry in the way it exists today.  They'll be some jobs for us humans but they'll be different jobs then what we're doing now.  It's happening in every industry.  I'll just roll with whatever changes come
Hell yeah.
This is the take I needed today. Thank you Bob
Holy shit, I was here for Bob’s cake day. What a joy this is — fuck yeah bob.
Heck yeah, Bob! Stay uncomfortable. Keep progressing. Learn more. Create more. Express more. At the end of the day these things are only tools and tools are only as good as the craftspeople using them.
Admittedly, I agree with how one must keep learning, albeit for AI I tend to take it a bit pessimistically. The world is evolving, and I don't plan to fall behind.
I think the reality really will be tough conversations had with producers who have an end goal of hiring-less, and walking away from the show with more cash in their jeans once all is said and done.
This guy gets it
Bob's just running down a dream
Awesome. Nicely said, Bob.
[deleted]
Bob has spoken. This is the way.
What is your name?
How do I use it? What is the best way to start creating video using sora?
I am thinking that a significant concern comes down to how does someone being able to generate a 22 episode season of their favorite genre show with a text prompt (not currently possible, but not far off) coexist with someone watching show as they are created now.  The former leaves us with no work while the latter keeps a roof over out heads and food on the table.
hashtag StandWithBob
It’s a goddam tool, learn how to use it and stop whining
Yup. Just another gadget to add to the tool belt. Hopefully not next the shark-repellent-bat-spray though.
Bob you are a legend
Bob I’ve always loved your posts and advice here. I need to know… what is your favorite music? And why the Tom Petty hate?
this is year 2 of generated AI video. In the past year we also now have access to generated speech, music, stories. How many more years until we can generated fully finished videos, movies, ads, with just a text script input> Personally I can't wait for this.

At the start it will be like, "yeah but you will still need editors to fix stuff" but AI can learn from it's mistakes. It can learn why certain changes were needed and it can learn from every highly rated video, music video, ad, film out there. Some will say it has already learnt human emotions and won't be long until it can manipulate it. The improvements we are seeing are growing exponential.
This levels the playing field of what is possible. Now it comes down to the best ideas and execution. Yes some low level jobs may be lost but this tech allows creatives to create whatever they want in a new way. Goin against this new reality is the wrong move.  People who embrace it will be game changers.
[removed]
Not sure about editors but stock photo models/photographers/videographers are definitely screwed.
It's friday guys! 

Let Bob be Bob on Fridays.
With you on everything but the Tom Petty dig
Happy cake day, Bob.
I mean, if you're working video I wouldn't even call it an option from this point forward not to learn these tools. It would be akin to keep working on paper while everyone else runs Photoshop. Yeah we're all gonna have to get in on it or get forgotten. It is what it is, better try and see the positive if there is any.
I work a lot with stock footage so for me it cant get fast enough so I got loads more stuff to work with.
I saw you at NAB last year Bob, and to my dismay didn’t say hello and thank you for all your online advice over the years. After reading this I plan on rectifying that this year. And possibly an unsolicited hug too. Never, ever change.
Bob, I like the cut of your jib.
Ur post too long lol, i just assumed u talking sora AI create those odd movements stick vid  but trust me, the aesthetic and technical edit, Ai cannot match the human enthusiasm, they may create what we want but the feelings and emotional is what human do better
It’s foolish to think AI is going to be a job replacer OR a new tool to be used in the creative process. It will be both, and it already is. To Bob’s point, like any other advancement in our field, you MUST embrace it, learn it, and figure out how to best use it or be left behind.
Im confused what Sora has to do with editing specifically. Isn't Sora for generating footage? 

That footage still needs to be edited, shouldn't it be the videographer (like me) who are worried?
Can't wait to be too lazy and apathetic to learn this cutting edge technology and miss out on all the income that the David Goggins sucking cutting-edge grindbros are gonna be making off of it
When Quantel replaced the corded Paintbox  styluses with cordless pens, the operators worried the $100 pens would get lost.
I was very comforted by [northernlions take](https://youtu.be/wfEHYdnl5E4)
I hope this brings production costs down, reducing the need for expensive reshoots and revisions.
Editing is a skill that transcends any tool or technique. Developing your skills makes it easy to learn the next tool because someone is hiring you for your skill. If they are hiring you because they want a tool user, you want to raise the quality of your employers
N1 bob / robert
Hey guys, i ve started YT channel. Will be posting Sora videos on daily basis [https://www.youtube.com/@dailydoseofsora](https://www.youtube.com/@dailydoseofsora)
when I change - I will be dead (which won't be long) - but I will keep LEARNNG until the day that I die - unlike so many of the losers here "oh, I just learned Premiere and Resolve - why do I have to learn something else - you know, I have a LIFE besides video stuff".

I liked one of the comments from another recent post that said "who is this guy - I don't  even see anything about him on IMDB" - because I guess he has not learned how to use Google yet. 

bob
Team Bob fo LYFE
I think it'll open the door to using stills as the source for footage. So a client might have an amazing image library, then you can use any specific image + a prompt to get the shot you need.
This is exactly it. For now. I see no emotion in those shots, but I *do* see [a generic corporate video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YBtspm8j8M). If priced decently, I could see this type of service making the corporate video editors' lives much easier. 

The people who should be immediately terrified are the people shooting bland content of specific places. The drone shot looks great, for example. But then again, drone shots are SO 2015. When I started editing corporate videos helicopter shots were rare because they were so expensive. When drones became affordable we were flooded with those shots and they were the hot shit for about a year or so. Nowadays CDs will say "no, I don't want another boring drone shot of the corporate head office", because it's been seen a thousand times. 

So how we use this AI will be like that... for a year or two, we'll see people making crazy AI compositions like "let's have a three-headed horse run through times square bathed in disco lights!", and then people will just be *over* it, and maybe we'll go back to films showing [actual emotion](https://youtu.be/wL02YRs1cCg?t=1587) again.
I saw comparisons between some prompts and videos from the stock libraries they're training on. A lot of it really just is stock, re-painted by an algorithm.
This 👆🏼
bro this tech is like one year old. give it 10 years
This is the worst it'll ever be. Compare it to where we were just a year ago.
Not the mention, AI is constantly learning. Not that far from now Sora and other AI models will not need any more human prompts. It WILL get to the point where it will be able to prompt itself and create things on its own, it’s just a matter of time. People are gravely underestimating this technology. People far more intellectual than you or I have been warning against the use of AI. We act like it’s the end of the world because it could very well lead to that.
Whenever someone compares AI to just another software or tool, you know they're delusional or just plain stupid.
all my friends at NBC in NY called Adobe Photoshop "Phototoy" - because they all had Quantel Paintboxes for $250,000 each.  And now where are they now ?  DEAD.   Stop learning, stop studying, and you will be dead too (unless you go into HVAC, or plumbing, or auto repair). 

bob
Yeah it’s hard to compare things to this when it’s pretty unprecedented times. Like we had stepping stones then ai was a mountain
I'm pretty sure everyone gave persmission as soon as they uploaded their art onto the internet even if they didn't know it.  Nobody reads the EULA
I agree with you - but you must admit that the old people that were photographers that knew darkroom techniques were offended by Photoshop.  Artists that could paint by hand and do amazing canvas work did not consider this true art.  Well - where are these artists now (with rare exception).   Photography was difficult, and today, most people are more than happy with their iPhone photos.  Certainly, there was a huge corporate video business where a convention would take place at a resort hotel, and a huge video crew would show up to do that show  - and today, people whip out their iPhones, and shoot video, and some poor schmo back at corporate headquarters had to do something with that footage.  BUT THAT DOES NOT APPLY to the HUGE BUDGET high profile corporate videos that are done at BIG MONEY corporate conventions, where huge budgets (bigger than any major TV commerical) are spent.  

I saw in one of the comebacks to my posts that the printing business was over and done.  Well, I have friends that are STILL in the printing business that are making a LOT of money, because they had the client base for direct advertising, and they STILL DO IT - (hard to believe) - but people STILL PAY FOR THIS CRAP - but it's not a wide spread market. 

Doesn't this apply to audio recording - anyone can use Logic or Garage Band to make music - and certainly most of the recording studios have disappeared, but there are STILL RECORDING STUDIOS- after all - Pro Tools - the #1 income source of AVID - is still making crazy money today.  So when we say "the audio recording industry is dead" - well, not it's not. 

  
Same with Photography - anyone can use their iPhone to take great pictures (I do ) - but does a corporation, that needs photos of the coporate execs ?  Or high end models ?  They pay the BIG BUCKS for the guys that can do the high end work. 

I can only say one thing for sure, as I have been dealing with "producers" for my entire life. I don't care if Sora, or any program could do the most amazing things. When that producer, who is financed with tons of money, says into [https://open.ai](https://open.ai)  "make me a hit action movie" - that is NOT going to happen.  He will HIRE someone to do it.  And when Sora (or whatever) makes the movie , and Mr. Exec. says "that is horrible, that is not what I was thinking of" - well, then you have to go back and FIX IT - and that is what WE do for a living. 

Bob
Yeah it seems like everyone thinks it's gonna be free to use
Exactly. This stuff is already degenerative. All these “don’t get lost in the dust” arguments have me replying with “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because when this bubble pops, it’ll pop hard.
>  I think it'll be a decade before we see any real progress

THAT makes me chuckle. That level of naiveness is truly adorable.
Yeah that's the part I'm pumped about. Sometimes you just need a dumb stock shot and you trawl through the main sites looking for something but none of them quite do it. Just let me type the thing in and move on to the next task!
If stock sites don't cut it yet, you're likely not gonna be able to prompt it for a while. Most of the data the AI is trained on is to my knowledge stock.         
           
Of course it can mash stuff together, but I doubt it's gonna be good enough at this stage
man this skynet thing looks pretty cool, can't wait to see how it'll help me do my job better
Exactly, I am very concerned about this in particular.
There will have to be some kind of simple way to check metadata or origin. Something super quick and easily accessible. Don’t know what that’ll be but it will absolutely be necessary. 

We will need to create a new standard of verifying media (that will be the very tough part). I think it’s totally doable but getting nearly everyone on earth on board is another story.
that's an interesting possibility. Would be a nice outcome, although I unsure if it's likely.
Agree with everything noted in here. It certainly won't be a dull 5 to 10 years, that's for sure. I'm just trying to position/prepare  myself for various eventualities.
finally someone sees the truth lol
And who are you again?
oh, you mean like when STG Group purchased AVID - because we all know how much a financial investment firm cares about Media Composer, Pro Tools, and our careers. 

STG Group will look out for all of us !

This is the worst this technology will be.
You should have seen the video quality of the first Avid system.   There wasn't enough resolution to see lipsync in 1989.   By 1994 Avid media was basically broadcast quality.  By 2005 you could edit in HD.

Get ready.  These initial anomilies in generative AI visuals will disapear before you know it.
Completely disagree. That puppy video made my heart think I was watching a real puppy scramble around. And this is just V1.
Probably cost them several million per video.
Yep, and just remember, they are selective about what they are showing, and not a single thing they showed holds up to scrutiny past the first glance….
who hurt me ?  Everyone that said I sucked. Every employer that fired me.  Everyone that said AVID sucked.  AVID when they said "any AVID that Bob Zelin touches is out of warranty" once they became a public company.  The only job for me is to squash those people. All the linear post houses that would not hire me. Bart Koulis at AVID that wanted to ruin my life, and made sure I would never work again.  All I wanted to do is learn, work hard and do a good job. And there were roadblocks (people) every step of the way.  My only real job now is to run them over.   I just did a job TODAY for a company, and their "IT guy" would not give me their admin login so I could complete my job.  I did a factory reset on their system, and now I got in, and now this "IT guy" can't get in until he contacts me.  This is the game - people want their jobs, and they don't want to share them. 

Bob
oh - I know why - because YOU sir, do not participate on any technical forums. You do not discuss Adobe Premiere, you do not discuss AVID, you do not discuss FCP (X), you do not discuss After Effects, you do not discuss Davinci Resolve.

Anyone who thinks this stuff is game changing has never really worked with clients. Go ahead and try to iterate with this based on client feedback.. the truth is it will be a tool, a piece of the puzzle. A piece that is built off, or into other components, which will take a whole team to perfect. Mapping it onto 3D models, cleaning it up, manipulating it, etc.
>At the end of the day these things are only tools and tools are only as good as the craftspeople using them.

how many scribes and weavers do you know? Sometimes jobs become outmoded by new tech. We aren't there yet, but these are signs of erosion on the industry.
I think a more apt comparison is the fact that photography definitely killed the profession of portrait painting.  Sure, a camera is also just a tool, but it makes something that originally took a long time take substantially less time and for less money.  It was a paradigm shift similar to this new ever-improving AI tech. There were definitely people back then who refused to get a portrait photograph because they thought it was "anti-art".  


I'm not entirely against AI, but we should at least make fair comparisons. Thinking that "true artist's" careers won't be on the chopping block eventually if it becomes a suitable and cheaper alternative is a bit naive. AI and automation in general would be a lot more exciting to me if paying for rent, food, and medical care didn't benefit greatly from technology standing still and never threatening your income.
I don't hate Tom Petty.  I hate old people that refuse to listen to any current music.  I just used that as an example.  "oh, no one was as good as Clapton" - you know what I call that person ?  AN IDIOT.

Key word right here.

This is the worst it'll ever be. Compare it to where we were just a year ago.
>comparisons between some prompts and videos from the stock libraries

Sounds like you saw the video-to-video feature, not a comparison to training data.
I’d love to see my clients prompt it with the notes they give me
Alternatively, people who refuse to see that and refuse to learn the new tools WILL be the ones who suffer.

It's not going to be 3 company executives and no other employees while they ask AI to do something. There will still be people whose job it is to create X based on Y business retirement. That's what you do now, that's what you will do in the future.

Like the mechanisation of farming and then industry, more work will be done by fewer people for sure. But just like that transformation, different types of jobs will appear as people have to spend less time on manual tasks and can focus on creative decision making ie service jobs.

In some ways mechanisation created more jobs, in different areas. For example the mechanised loom destroyed jobs for thousands of cottage industry workers, but created thousands of jobs in the carpet industry which couldn't exist before.
Quantel folks got amazing at building worlds with the paint tool. Most everyone I know who came from there went on to do really great work with other tools.
there are plenty of things to learn that aren't prompt-based AI generators - don't presume that I'm not learning anything.
You can find the original videos of all the sora example videos on shutterstock. It’s not going to be as useful tool of a tool because it’s based off of everyone already has made, but with less control. It seems crazy now because the companies are trying to sell it, actually try to use it practically and it sucks

Paintbox was so much fun to use!
Happy Cake Day Bob!
Good points, Bob.

But have you seen cars lately? Not sure if an old school mechanic can fix a new electric car.
That's not how that works.
I'm taking a birds eye view of the industry as a whole, whereas you are taking a more narrow view of individuals getting paid for a skillset. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just wondering where the money is coming in your scenario if the mechanisms that brought in cash before are eroded massively.

I think this can play out in any variety of ways, it's pretty unpredictable, but it's hard to imagine producers paying top dollar to  someone to make a 'hit action movie' in their bedroom with AI. Ignoring that that implies not needing huge amounts of crew, we are really talking about the relative end of scarcity of the skillset of filmmaking due to industrialisation of the product. We aren't near that point yet but the trend isn't looking good. I don't know of any other industries where an end in scarcity is a boon for it's workers.
You say it's naive, but so far AI has not been able to truly create anything truly new.  If you listen or read AI researchers they will tell you how Chat GPT and Dall-e etc are all creating new "interpolations" between existing human-created data.

One researcher put it something like this, "If you give ChatGPT all the data from before 1910 it will never generate a Hemmingway novel."

I wouldn't be so bold to predict it will be 10 years before Sora can replace human acquisition/animation.  But, I also think it's important to understand the current limits of "AI".  OpenAI seems to be claiming they are sort of 'holding it back', so maybe there is some leap that has occurred that isn't available to the public yet.   It's hard to know for sure, but so far all the "AI" I've seen hardly deserves the monicker of "intelligent".
I left LA a few months ago for greener passages and found a job at a local news station. I make a lot less - but there's lots of potential for growth. Editors like that aren't going anywhere because it's community oriented and they're always going to want a human touch. My wife and I are both in production and we have countless of friends who were doing really well for a long, long time and now things are drying up quickly. I don't know what the future holds - but it's pretty bleak out there right now.
Not Bob which makes his comment infinitely more valuable.
That's exactly the point, Bob. These people aren't investing in this stuff because they care about our careers. They care about their bottom line. And what better way to increase that than to stop paying the creatives.
Their paws are funky, same as when ai does human hands. It also looks fake, like optical flow mushing frames incorrectly. It's been like this for years, and Sora is the same

Not at all, usually ignored the twat. But since I’ve become a new parent and seen this idiot say you’re a loser if you spend time with your children I’m gonna call this drunk out.
I’ve got one for you Bob https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lR_qUyWqi-0TUUOsK_KZX5fxV0TyST_FM
You'll need some people but much less then we need now.  And most of the people can be minimum wage workers with little education/experience and a senior person to manage it. This is what is happening in software development right now.  They have built tools that are easy enough that anyone off the stree can be trained to drag and drop pre built code and have one senior programmer to QC and do fixes.
the biggest proponents I’ve come across for these tools are people who aren’t creative in their own right and have failed in their creative prospects. ML models skips the grunt work of understanding the scope of building something interesting and they gleam and their prompt generated result as if they were its brain child. 

However i agree, instead of ML models solving real-world problems and heightening efficiency in life-or-death sectors, we are reducing creativity and the arts to a point and click redundancy. 

v strange
Thanks Bob. I agree.
When the pen got lost - my art director would always joke: Oh that grey pen, it didn't write so I threw it away!. Very much a Dad joke.
you spoke like a wise old man (ahem, person) - so i googled your username. it checked out. and i love that you built the max zelin system. lol

edit replied to wrong one
I think that the fact that Taylor Swift uses "programmers" instead of musicians is unethical.  And what does that mean, after 1 billion dollars in sales for her - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. 

I am a loser musician - who cares - no one will ever hire me, and even if you are good, programming is where it's at in 2024. 

Bob
Hahahahaha this was moneyyyy. Can’t wait for the next one to drop
While I understand the sentiment that those who "refuse to learn will be the ones who suffer", unfortunately AI will make even those who do learn suffer as well. I think the idea of "learn to use the tool" and it will give you an edge, is a paradigm that may no longer apply to generative AI tools. These tools are so accessible, everyone will know how to use them and no one will have an edge.
Again, you cannot compare generative AI to just another tool to be learned. Our jobs will be reduced to a small task that can be done by any non-creative. Companies will pop up offering courses/seminars on how to prompt to get the best result (if they don't already exist). Why would a company keep a trained professional on for any significant amount of money when they could have some intern or media relations person get the exact same result and save a full salary? 

It's amazing to me how many creatives are taking the "hey horse and buggy/car, we gotta learn it and then we'll never be replaced" sentiment, which is honestly just laughable. All we're doing by embracing it is training in our replacement.
Right and how hard is it to use a text prompt? Good luck on part time minimum wage.
This is not a tool, today it might seem, but in 2, 5, 19 years it will have learned from you and millions others and will replace you.
oh, please excuse me now - I have to deal with my "balanced life" - it's 7:25pm on the east coast, and my wife wants me to take her grocery shopping now (I did TWO jobs today - one in Orlando, and one in Los Angeles remote) - and tomorrow, I have to take her to the Macy's at the Mall so she can get some stupid birthday presents for someone.  SEE - I have a "balanced life".  Thank God for alcohol.   

I don't give a damn about what I have to learn - I am now an "expert" on Ubiquiti UniFi network systems - do you think that I actually wanted to learn that crap - but it's become so wildly popular, that if I intend to stay employed with these video companies, I have to know this crap, and I did a new install today (complete with wiring in the ceiling) so they could have remote access for their editors.  What does this have to do with video - NOTHING - but I learned it, and I got good at it. 

KEEP LEARNING.   Even if you hate it.  (or become a plumber).   

bob
How's that?  If it's in EULA that google or facebook or whoever owns the rights to use your material when you upload it and you upload it without reading or understanding that then they own it.  They can train their machine learning on it or sell your data to other compaies.  Everyone signs away the rights to their personal data the every time they click OK to sign up for Facebook, Twitter, TikTok etc
> but so far AI has not been able to truly create anything truly new. 

It's also advancing at an EXPONENTIAL rate.

I saw a graphic designer make a thread about how AI wouldn't replace him, and he produced an image he generated with AI that he had to spend an hour retouching in Photoshop to get perfectly the way he wanted. Generate AI got him 90% of the way there, but according to this fellow his employer could never get rid of him because it was inconceivable that AI would be able to get 100% there. And to me that's just laughably naive.

I will shout it from the roof tops - creatives need to reject AI as legitimate art and fight back. Those who embrace it and try to sell other creatives on it are essentially training their replacements.
It was only a year ago that the will smith eating spaghetti monstrosity came out. And now we have sora. You underestimate the rate at which technology advances especially considering people are investing BILLIONS of dollars into AI and machine learning.
it doesnt need to be perfect and capable of "replacing" everything for it to have a major impact, not only on industries but on the media we consume
>My wife and I are both in production and we have countless of friends who were doing really well for a long, long time and now things are drying up quickly

same with me and my gf. She and her film friends have had work dry up very rapidly. The industry seems to be in a race to the bottom with dysfunctional profit models and devaluation of work from things like AI. I don't know, I just don't feel rosy about it.

>I left LA a few months ago for greener passages and found a job at a local news station. I make a lot less - but there's lots of potential for growth. 

That's an interesting decision you've made, I respect it. I keep weighing up my options as of late too. I just can't shake the feeling that I should change now rather than later.
I don't think Sora is the end or anything, but I really think its more impactful than the usual technological revolution.
Lmao wtf 😬
Francis - do you know where I can get some coke ?  I haven't had any in 40 years !  DM me, and I will buy from you !

bob

ps - the NY City subways fried my brain
Lighten up, Francis.
So, you're "too cool" to post on the sub because youre "working with software all day", but you'll spend time...calling Bob out?

Waste of time imo. If you're not part of the group of people who feel the sub finally made it to "primetime" once Bob started posting here...well, my only advice is to enjoy looking stupid in front of everyone.
This is a misconception. It’s not the same in creative fields.

thats right bob captialism doesnt care about ethics so might as well say fuck it and get the bag while the world burns.
People need to remember the reason why these things are being developed. It's not to give us another tool to use, it's to replace the workers as the tool
We’ve already seen this happening as the state of this industry has shifted. I’ve seen countless non editing jobs asking for editing skills with low pay. Everyone’s an editor now.
take a deep breath, Bob
People won’t be replaced by AI, they will be replaced by people who use AI.
> creatives need to reject AI as legitimate art and fight back

Oh yeah, rejecting technology has always worked out well.
Who's incredibly naive now?
Sora certainly looks much better than Will Smith eating spaghetti.  But I'm still not sure if Sora can take direction.   Like the mammoth clip that has been released.  Can I tell Sora "make that shot twice as long and start the mammoth's further back" ?    I think it might make a totally different shot - I don't really know.  The way Dall-E and ChatGPT have worked so far is small changes in the request can create big differences.

The "Bling Zoo" clip was the most impressive to me.  It had different shots and cuts.  But still it's unclear to me if Sora is anywhere near being able to adjust the shots.

I will say that Sora certainly seems to have the potential to destroy simple b-roll/stock footage sites.   Like if I need  only one "drone shot of a cliffside home", it could be very useful if it's cheaper than stock sites.

As I said, I'm not sure when "AI" will break out from being a rather amazing yet simple tool to something more complex - a true creative assistant or "assister" perhaps should be the word.    It could happen soon, or it might take longer than expected.
Ok
We moved after a year or so of waiting for one of us to get something going. For the last 20 years - we have never had to worry about work and all of a sudden - I'm busting my ass for a $100 for a job I got on upwork. Especially my wife. She's never had any issues going from job to job and all of a sudden - nothing. LA is starting to lose its luster too.
Agreed
Nah I’m gonna call out this old fart who calls people who spend time with their children losers. Fuck him, he’s everything that’s wrong with this industry.
Yeah I’ll call him out on a Friday night big guy, I’ve got the time. A subreddit made it to prime time? Wtf does that even mean and who the hell cares. Jog on.
Then why is AI the single most imporant issue for IATSE negoations like it was for writers and actors?  Are they all misconcieving the threat?
get that bag! get that bag! get that bag! get that bag!\*

\*nightmare.nightmare.nightmare.nightmare.nightmare.
As much as replacing labor is a very real problem, this thinking that it’s the reason for creating AI/ML is reductive. These tools are enabling things that we literally can’t do as humans like finding patterns in thousands of chemical structures and spitting out brand new drugs that would have taken decades or longer to discover and test. Nothing is black and white.
Sad imo! If the industry is on life support for technicians, surely AI will be the hand pulling the plug!
I would argue the people who view AI as just another technology are the ones who are naive. This isnt another software for us to learn that helps us. This helps non creative bean counters who want to rid the books of our salaries.
Even if all that was destroyed was stock footage sites, that’s a lot of people that are now suddenly out of a job. Why would we pay a drone pilot when we can just generate this shot for us, etc? 

And again, I think we are grossly underestimating the implications of this and the speed at which the technology will evolve. But honestly, I’m more worried about the existential threat this poses for society overall, not just the state of this industry.
👍
Fair enough tbh. Not everyone is perfect though
cope seethe
You inspire me.
SAG already capitulated, in a way that does directly harm them, and in particular background talent. I’m not saying there won’t be destruction with gAI there absolutely will be, I’m saying it can’t “push a button to create a movie” and never will.
money is my god. trying for a better world is futile. embrace materialism. eat meat
It doesn't matter how you view AI, if it can do your job then that's what will happen.    Can you think of an example where "you can't do that cheaper more efficient" thing has ever worked?   

From looms to shipping containers, to outsourcing, to data entry to a cutting room full of film assistants -- cheaper more efficient always wins.   Why would I want to waste my time sitting in front of a computer all day if the computer can do it without me?
People always claim doom and gloom when things change.   It's true, I'm not as impressed as you with "AI", but I do see the potential for drastic change. 

Nothing stops change.  Not really.  Certainly not in the world we live in.   It seems a waste of time to worry about it, unless you're in government or something.  

What are you going to do about it if "AI" changes everything?    Is there some course of action you feel you should be taking to prevent your imminent obsolei?
EAT MEAT EAT MEAT EAT MEAT WE ARE ONE
Bro I hate to break it to you but if the computer can do it without you, you need to find a new line of work. I think that’s what you and a lot of people are missing out on - this is not a piece of technology we learn to be more efficient, this is a piece of technology studios/non creatives/clients learn so they don’t have to pay us. That’s the end game to all this. But hey, I hope you’re right. I hope you’ll always have someone paying you a living wage to type a prompt into a computer.
Oh I mean agree, nothing stops change. And I have never we could stop technological advancement. Cat is out of the bag now. It’s not a matter of if ai will change things just a matter of when. We are likely going to be in for a rough time. But hey, I hope I eat my words and that I am extremely wrong.
Hey "bro", I agree. That's just what I said.  If the computer can do it, I'd rather be doing something else.   You keep seeming to argue some point I am not arguing.
That's great, because you WILL be doing something else to earn money to live. If you're cool with that, we're in total agreement here.
I work in the documentary/news business so this Sora crap doesn't really interest me. Call me when this AI shit can make my penis bigger and keep it harder longer so I can stop popping these Blue Chews like they're M&Ms.
New UI is garbage. Can’t opt out.
Awful. Doesn’t even scale to the screen size anymore. I have to scroll left and right now to see the full page. 

I didn’t opt in for this shit nor can I opt out of it. 
Fuck u/spez and fuck whatever moron approved this shit. Guess I won’t be using Reddit anymore until it’s removed.
I really think there was a better way for Reddit to do this.  I'm sure if they asked users to volunteer for UI or beta testing on new designs or layouts they would have got enough people to opt-in
Damn it. Are you guys saying I was actually picked to test this crap? Where can I say "this is crap"?
It's absolute garbage. It also changed the dark mode i used to light mode and I can't change it back it is infuriating. Everything about the new design hurts my head.
I cannot see a difference in brightness of what posts are new or not any more.  This is the dumbest change I have ever seen.  In any forum I've ever belonged to, posts that have not been viewed are brighter.

I have adminned and actually run entire sites before.  I get changes and adapting to them; this is not that.  These changes are irrational and do not enhance the viewing.

I feel like this is the new Coke recipe.
it’s super trash. my iPhone just updated, so I thought that caused it (which wouldn’t make any sense), but I’m glad I’m not alone. it’s borderline unusable. in addition to what others have noted, I also hate the infinite scroll. I like being able to see what’s on the *first* page of a sub. all around trash
You click on an item, to view/read it, and when you go back, it completely reloads the page, so you lose your initial reddit feed.

What a non-sense!
this new mobile ui is horseshit, go back to ux design school
I love not being able to read the full title of posts
Hilarious. It's somehow even rounder and more "corporate minimalist" than new.reddit.com was. I hate this fucking UI trend of making everything bubbly, flat, and worst of all, terrible to use. What exactly was wrong with the "new reddit" UI? Why did it need to be drastically changed again...? Is there actually a reason, or do sites just do this every so often because they can? 

Who thought that non-optional infinite scrolling was a good idea? Or not being able to tap to quick view image posts on the home feed? I'm not opening every single post in a new tab, nor am I putting up with infinite scrolling BS. This is a great way to get people to stop using the site.
I'm here because they also took away my dark mode. Fucking, why?
Less than garbage. Much less
It’s beyond garbage. It’s completely unusable. Most of the menus are cut off and I can’t even access my settings. Anyone have any good Reddit alternatives? I’m ready to move on, this forced beta testing is the last straw for me



Edit: https://lemmy.world/ Is similar to the old UI
[deleted]
I was in it, then I wasn't, now I'm not. If they are testing this, are they going to be able to tell that I'm no longer using Reddit (apart from this post) because of this change? I mean please God, let them realise that I am no longer using Reddit because of this, and please, let there be other users who hate this as much as me. I want to browse about fifteen subreddits but can't bear to do so because of this shitty UI.
It sucks so so much, thanks A/B testing.
I hate it too 0/10
It typically takes a couple weeks, but some have said longer for them.
https://new.reddit.com/
Use old.Reddit.com….
I’m on iOS with a relatively new phone, actually came here to figure out what the hell is going on with the UI. The text is WAY too big now, to the point where I can’t even read many post headers because they crawl off the page, and I also can’t change settings without zooming out because it’s too large. Awful.
My notification thing is always stuck at saying I have 5 notifications and it took me forever to figure out how to add a comment.

I also hate that I can’t look at a post with a picture without having to click on the post.
Reddits going to lose a ton of users lol
Mine is still the same. Can someone share a screenshot?
Agreed. I hate that it default doesn't show full comment chains, and I can't view images or videos without going to the actual post. And it's slower.
Agreed, absolute garbage. Some of the worst I've seen.  It like they pushed the update without even testing it first.
Pro tip - [https://new.reddit.com/](https://new.reddit.com/) is the old UI, at least for now.
I have 2 accounts.  One has had this garbage for a month so I was using the other.  Now that one has it too.  Don't expect it to go away anytime soon.
It's just the worst
For the life of me, I can't figure out what you guys are talking about. I use my Linux PC and my Galaxy phone and have seen zero changes to the platform since I started. I don't get it.
Reddit is dying anyways.  Its just ban-happy AI bots micromanaging the speech of anyone who isnt a total pleeb.
I think it might be for only certain people. There's no updates available for me, and I still have the previous UI update.
I absolutely abhor the new UI on desktop.  Why is there now a directory on the left? That’s just wasted screen space and makes it harder to read the main body.  I hate the font choice.  I hate that it defaults to dark mode and it’s not a good contrast in dark mode.  I hate that it defaults to “hot” (need to figure out where to change that). And when commenting, you can no longer highlight part of a comment, hit reply, and have the highlighted content appear in the reply.  Have to manually copy and paste. And quotes aren’t part of the standard format bar any more…have to hit the text button then choose them.  

God…it’s all terrible.
I hate the UI. The video player is awful. It constantly stops playing audio. I have to unmute it. Even when it’s going full screen. I have been a premium member for a long time. I’m thinking about giving up. And why do we have to pay 50 fucking bucks for an upvote???? The fuck kind of money grab is this??? Reddit fucking sucks and so do the spineless mods.
This. Is. Terrible.
It is horrible, I won't use reddit until it is removed, and definitely won't use it if they keep the infinity scroll thing
New UI is awful, and I can't seem to opt out. WTF...
I absolutely despise round corners, like ffs, why would you just waste usable space like that. This new ui is hot garbage
Fuck fuck fuck fuck this new UI.
I completely agree, this new shitty layout and how the whole site is working now is disgusting. The previous one was much better. At least if I wanted to see my notifications, it was just a drop-down in the same window and not loaded in the PREVIOUS layout's notification page. I could open up/expand a post to see what's in it without leaving a subreddit's main page or the search results the same as the comments.  
The whole page is now choppy, laggy as hell too.
I'm not tech savvy but I don't see a opt out button and I was chosen as well, its very laggy and takes a while to loud anything and when I click on a responds it takes me to a different window then crashes... why is this a thing?
God fuck this new UI shit. For the first time, I'm switching to old Reddit
JUst got force fed the new UI today.  OH. MY. GOD.  This is horrible.  I really would like to know what the endgame was?  It looks more like facebook does now.
S.A.M.E
First discord with an awful new UI and now Reddit has decided to join the bandwagon...
Can UX people please find something besides redoing old UIs to justify their jobs? FFS, this shit is a regression and I want to get rid of it. Garbage!
so much whitespace. i got a bezel-less monitor only to get this bullshit
help me go back FFS.. this is awful!!!
terrible, how to change?
I only just got it. It sucks.

Absolutely hate how everything just feels off center now, and stuff I actually wanna see is harder to get to.
Frustrating😤
Yeah, reddit is fucking over. The API bullshit, the GARBAGE front page posts that are all tabloid/aita/outfits(and 10 variations of those), and now this? I'm going on a trip for a month. After that, this account exists only to promote reddit alternatives. They'll have to ban me.
iPad is completely unusable right now, the feed is skinny in the middle of the screen instead of filling it, making the text tiny. It's physically painful to strain my eyes to read the damned text and I already have it large in settings. They give 0 shits about accessibility.
The UI is so fucking disgusting, it was ok before, they probably did these just out of spite, i also cant find the fucking dark theme button and it literally randomly changes itself
It was infuriating for me because I had the stupid new UI (now gone thank goodness) popup a bunch of request errors when the page was fine. 

I thought the same thing why can’t Reddit have some opt out because I didn’t like it?
There is a beta testing program. At least on Android where I am in.
There isn't even dark mode 🤬
I agree with you there.
its just out of spite for its users
The measurement or feedback is based on your engagement and aggregated, like "new UI users clicked on ads 1% more of the time". It's pseudoscientific and may be twisted to get the result they want.

Only feedback you can provide is to log into a different account to dodge the UI until they make it 100% and give themselves a pat on the back.
[deleted]
You are my hero
Doesn't work for mobile the formatting is even more broke
whats that?
Old is great for desktop, not great for mobile browser.
it just keeps crashing on me
Meanwhile on iPad the feed is too damned small in landscape which strains your eyes when you read. They're actual morons and couldn't code their way out of a fucking wet paper bag.
[Sure, here you go](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/884097483016372264/1175280801403912202/IMG_7979.png?ex=656aa88a&is=6558338a&hm=a406f41409f965f66c22c7f17826a7686a2a5016e62996f3557f1c27cea7052f&)
I tried that. Same UI except I have a red warning at the top about using an “old” browser. As I said, no way to opt out or get around it.
It’s unfortunate because it’s something you never asked for and I am not even sure if you get the chance to give feedback once their testing is done
Its not like its hard to create a reddit style platform
Yup, I’ve seen similar complaints from iPad users
Because they don't care about whether you like it. :)
there is, but now its based on your system settings.
There is. Because mine automatically defaults to it and I don’t want it.
I am sorry they hit you with both of them I did not expect that. I figured they would only target primary device.
old ui if you get forced into new ui
People are saying you can’t use dark mode on it. Is that right? Your’s appears to be in dark mode. If I lose dark mode I won’t be able to use Reddit. 

Thank you for the screen shot.
Oh okay. Thanks. I thought y’all were talking about the app.
I got oped in as well and this works for me. Have you tried a cache or cookie bust?
[deleted]
I just stay in communities now, and don't use the feeds. Then on desktop I browse to my hearts content and Reddit gets screwed over because I use an ad blocker. If they keep screwing over people with sight issues, they're going to catch hands from the disabled community pretty fast.
It sure as hell ain't working then
I think it’s because with the new UI there’s no option in the settings (that I can see) to change to dark mode. Occasionally I’d get a bug in the old UI where it would boot me over to Light mode and I’d have to change it back. My best guess is that those unfortunate folks were unlucky and got booted over to Light mode at the same as the update.
It’s over alright. Ever since they killed the API everything has went downhill because I’ve seen more and more repost bots on the top 10 subreddits.
I get a bunch of Promoted "posts" in my feed -- often low-brow stuff like courses on how to create AI-generated channels for YouTube or some free-to-play mobile game. So it's not like they aren't pushing ads on me even with adblock.
Yeah its dog shit ngl
Thank you for the answer. I guess I just have to hope I don’t end up being one of those unfortunate people or I’ll have to bounce. 

They really screwed the pooch on this one.
I have all of that turned off as it is an option. I mean I still get the ads that are posted in communities by shitty bots, but they're not going to catch me with their paid for bullshit ads.
I hate the new reddit experience (Dec 2023)
It seems like there is a new design being rolled out, and I hate it.

### Which design?

This design has a persistent left column that contains a list of Communities and Resources, plus Home, Popular, and All. This all appears to be stuff that used to be inside a dropdown menu in the site header to the left of the Search field.

The right column is all recent posts, unless I'm in a sub, and then it shows the same old sub-specific content: About, Rules, a graphic, moderator list.

When I click on any post, it opens that post as a new page. The old design used to load the post dynamically like a modern single-page-app.

ETA: This is the design that uses the new `<shreddit>` components.


### Why do I hate it?

That left bar is absolutely useless to me. I never click on it (except to collapse the lists, which are just distracting visual noise). I don't need to see a list of all the subs I've joined: I _know_ them by heart because those communities matter to me; I assume it's the same for most reddit users. When I want to browser a specific sub, I just click on a post in my feed to get there. Typing the URL is also pretty easy, because of reddit's famous and good URL scheme; a lot of my subs get auto-suggested by my browser based on my history and previous direct access.

I almost never used the dropdown in the old design for the same reason. But at least the dropdown had the virtue of being tidy, rather than vomiting all its content onto my screen on every page.

Opening each post in a new page sucks. It is slower, less efficient, and more inconvenient. We already had ways of opening posts in new tabs: Ctrl+click or Cmd+click. All you did was take away a useful and good feature.


### Why it's **evil**

My biggest complaint is that the names of users no longer appear on posts in the main feed. This is a huge problem, and I'm pretty sure this one change is the _raison d'etre_ for the entire design: **reddit wants to hide the names of posters so that viewers can be exposed to the content before they can contextualize it**.

It's anybody's guess whether this is because you're trying to make it easier for AI to masquerade as humans, or for propagandists to poison public discourse. Or maybe, like Elon Musk, reddit's owners are neo-Nazis who want to create a more-welcoming environment for fascists.


**This is not merely a design decision. It is anti-helpful.**

Fire your PO and UX staff. This new design is worse in every single way. Less convenient, less useful, less honest. You're bad and you should feel bad.
This is GODAWFUL. There's no pages on mobile, you just scroll forever. Maybe I'd like to go through a community without losing my place every five seconds? I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. There is nothing good about it.
Absolutely attrocious, thankful for [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) otherwise I'd be using reddit a lot less. An update with exactly zero improvements and endless regressions.
This new design really is inferior to the previous one.

To me, the colors blend together too much (dark mode, no idea what it's like in light mode), making too little difference between comments and the post itself, as well as differentiating separate comments. It really is making the experience less enjoyable. There is also more mess on my screen now with this sidebar, and I wish we could hide it altogether.

Not only color schemes, but there are also features being cut out, like you mentioned. Personally, I really hate not being able to see what comments I replied to on my profile -- now you only see the reply. This makes it annoying to check on discussions I'm interested in and continue the conversation in posts that are not my own. 

At minimum, I'd also ask anyone forced to be a tester for this redesign to leave feedback and rate it. Just have a pop-up somewhere on the screen and listen to the feedback. I had to search all across Reddit to find this one subreddit where I can actually talk about this. It doesn't make sense for a business to force its users into something and just forget about their wants and needs, ignoring any feedback.
This new design is absolute dogshit.
And why do they keep on robbing my limited screen real estate for things like this? It's bad enough with the right side bar, now an uncollapsable left sidebar on my small laptop screen leaves no room for the actual content I'm looking for in the first place. 

From what I can see, the left sidebar serves no useful purpose. 

Change for the sake of change is not a good enough reason.
Couldn't have said it better myself. I personally kinda like the style, but the regression in functionality is horrible.

\- Instead of 20 I can only see maybe 5 posts in a list because the text and video thumbnails are huge..  
  
\- Video's stop playing when the player scrolls out of view..  
  
\- When I click on a post and go back I'm at the top of the list again..
This new design is so laughably bad on and iPad I don’t even think they tested it. Oversized fonts, wasted screen space. It’s actually bizzare.
Kick that designers ass outta here!
fuck reddit.
Nuke the API to limit the apps people can use, mod tools, and shut down uneddit and other archiving sites. Remove awards so that attention can't be drawn to a post even if bots downvote it to oblivion and make it easier to shadow ban. Now change the layout and hide the identity of posters so power users and ads as posts are more likely to get clicks.
Well said. It's also totally unusable for me - it runs poorly compared to my old compact, dark mode setup, and so righ tnow my choices are the old reddit I don't like, or the new one, which I just can't tolerate. 

It wastes so much screen space, to say nothing of having at best the 'cards' which are terrible. I have always used the compact mode and appreciated being able to get 10-12 threads of varying interests on  a page. Guess that's out the window, now. 

Reddit - there was literally nothing wrong with things. Change it back.
Enshittification

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification
I do not like this new design.

 It reminds me of what Reddit looks like if you're not "signed in". 

 The "more posts you may like" stuff is so unnecessary, none of the subjects are related to each other or the subreddit you're on. It's just stuff in the way. 

It's making navigation of this site really clunky. 

It was better the other way. Honestly all they really needed to do was fix the automatic-scroll-to-the-top "bug" and more importantly, control bots better. 

👎
My biggest complaint is the **narrow strip in the middle**.   I've got a big monitor, the browser window takes up half the width, and of that the reddit layout uses about one third.   

Brilliant, if I want to emulate a mobile phone on my desktop.

But I'm not using a phone to browse the 'net for a fucking reason.   It's tiny, it's dysfunctional.
Dear Reddit,

The value of your IPO just collapsed by 80%.

Find the undo button.
Whatever this is, it's awful on mobile. 

Posts all have different font sizes (why?? Text and body), I can't easily get to my communities or messages anymore (messages don't even load), subreddits don't have a header so I can't jump out of a post as easily to keep browsing a subreddit,. I'm having a hard time telling the ads from the posts (wonder why...), everything is weirdly... bubbly and spaced (why??), this text box is tiny to type in. This is awful design. It doesn't even change the colour of viewed posts now, making it hard to track what I already looked at. Like worse than early 2000's jank. 

Old, new, I just want a compact web page that works. It's really not that hard to build one. What is this? Is there a way to get out of this? Old reddit throws a cert error, new cuts itself off on my screen (great scaling there).
Is there a "Swtch to the old design you're used to" option in the settings?

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu I hate change if something isn't broken don't change it! >:(
#Bring Reddit back

Hate the new layout
It just changed for me and it's TERRIBLE. Everything has been moved, the designs are vague and don't come across at a glance, the colors are ugly. I hate it so so so so so much.
Yeah, the disappearance of the compact view makes the new UI unusable for me. Without compact view, it takes several times longer to scan for interesting posts--or rather, it would, if I were to bother, which I won't. I'm back to old.reddit for now, but if the compact view vanishes irretrievably, I intend to give up.
Just got this change today too and hate every bit of it. No reason to blast every community down the left of the page. Leave them compact in a drop-down like it was
To add another peeve: clicking the bell no longer opens notifications in a popup. It navigates you away from the page you're on, which is so dumb! Absolute trash.
AHHHHH

I fucking hate this
Fuck sake, desktop finally decided to compete with mobile to see who makes a worser fucking experience and it's neck and neck right now.
fuckin sucks
You can try [https://new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com), since it often takes me back to the way it was before. 

However, I find it only *sometimes* works and randomly so. It sometimes redirects me straight back to [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com), but then sometimes magically takes me to [https://new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) and keeps the old style that you're after.

It sometimes helps to right-click a thread to open it in a new window and *then* click a bookmark directly to the [https://new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) version. That's what I do anyway and it eventually works.

It's weird that they seem to actively be trying to annoy their contributors, but that's life these days!
Discord, slack and reddit have all rolled out dog water redesigns over the last month and I’m pulling my hair out. Stop fixing shit that isn’t broken. Reddit on mobile was fine for years. 

I will never download your stupid app.
I'm lucky, I was forced to use it for 10 days, today it went back to the "classic" redesign.
yeah bro, i don't know about you guys, but this new interface is using a lot of power on my laptop, too. my computer goes from 86 to 9 percent in like 5 minutes, lol. granted, my computer is something 6 years old, but before this i never had this problem and i don't have this problem besides with reddit
The right bar is the worst, it shows some random top posts from random subreddits I don't even use. Why would I be even interested in those? Just a waste of space on my desktop.
There's also the "more posts you may like" garbage at the bottom of the comment section... like, what?!

GARBAGE.
It’s terrible.  I might be done with reddit.
Yeah its awful. I use mobile and i hate it. Old reddit also seems broken. Maybe i can finally kick reddit now
Really hate the new design, not sure I can reddit like this.  And that might be good for me..
First of fucking all, they changed the design without even saying anything.  I sign in and am like, wtf?

Second of all, the new reddit litera"lly does less.  You can't copy a comment by highlighting the text and clicking "reply".  You have to copy it, paste it, then click into the "quote" part.  There are other things I can't remember at the moment but it's fucking terrible.  

It's like they're actively trying to alienate their customer base.
What the f\*ck is this design? What the hell am I looking at right now? Every thing look so weird holy hell. The old "new" reddit have better colors and scheme than this thing, just a day ago. Give me back Reddit!!! (get use to it later but this change is weird to look at ngl)
Thankfully [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) worked for me, but is there an official way to tell Reddit to please dear god don't make these changes permanent? I have no desire to see pics and videos I didn't click on. I have a widescreen monitor, and 2/3 of it are completely empty, of the remaining 1/3, half of it is taken up by useless side bars. If anyone from reddit is reading this, those changes are so bad, I will literally quit using reddit if you force them on me.
This is HORRENDOUS! Who's the IDIOT that designed this?!
It's telling me posts I might like when I have ZERO interest in them. This whole new layout is horrid.
This new design is nothing but a big pile of shit.

That left bar is useless. dropdowns worked fine.

Those "related posts" on the right are downright evil, because the mail goal of that kind of thing is to encourage random navigation. I already have a home feed I DON'T NEED THAT. It just adds clutter, and all the useful info about the sub and links disappeared.

Can't fold comments for some (probably extremely dumb) reason. Only answers. How useful /s.

What about the text editor ? All the formatting options are hidden behind that "T" button, WHY? IT'S POINTLESS!

And that's just what I saw immediately. This needs to stop.
They keep getting worse I swear.

I'm done with reddit.  account for sale. fuck whoever is the project manager, his/her/its boss, and the UX designer.  You'll are responsible for this dumpster fire.
I also really hate the new reddit animated icon, the red guy that pops up as pages are loading. 

He now has black teeth. He looks deranged.
This is the third time I've been forced into redesign beta testing hell. It took two full weeks to be reversed both of the last two times. The only workaround is incredibly annoying, but less annoying than the redesign. Hit the plus button in the top right to make a new post, wait for that page to load in completely, then hit back. You should be back on the proper UI, but only for one page. It has to be redone on every page, which sucks but again, still less awful than the redesign.
I hate it too. Can't figure shit out and it's annoying to look at.
I, too, hate the new format. Solution? go to [www.new.reddit.com](https://www.new.reddit.com)  That's the bomb.
The new design is so ugly. The mobile version was alright, we had pages so i didn't get lost and now they removed it and the home is 70% random subreddits like, they recommend me subs of random bands that i don't even care, random subs about apple music and youtube music( i don't use any), and others.
It's awful. Sometimes I can go back with the old one.
This may drive me away from reddit. It’s that bad.
The logo sucks . The app icon was better the previous time around
TIHI.

How on earth do you get rid of the 'more posts like this' below the comments?

It's awfully spammy.

Ed: new.reddit is a bit janky for me (doesn't load correctly most of the time).
I had to get banned on r/Murai just to stop seeing their damn subreddit pop up on my screen. 🤦‍♂️
I have deleted the app of reddit. Guess I no longer share pics.
Oh thanks goodness I thought it was just me. Its TERRIBLE>
My feed is drowned in the increase in ads and absolute spam of recommendations for subs that are irrelevant or I've left for their toxicity.

Yay for tech capitalism :/
Absolutely terrible, like all the other times it's been forced on me. As I always say, if I wanted to Reddit to look like their dogdick app, I'd use their dogdick app. 

Fuck whoever came up with the "more posts you might like" in the ear and then fire their ass, btw. I can already find those posts: they're in the subreddits I'm subscribed to.
Mine just changed to this sometime this afternoon and it is terrible!
If they don’t change it back, I’ll stop visiting this stupid site. HATE THE NEW LAYOUT

Thing is, user convenience, usefulness or honesty was NEVER the GOAL.

It is all about the question - will this make us more money.

Apparently they believe it will make them more money.
Commenting here so that our voices are to be known. I had an update on the mobile browser (android) a while back and then after a few weeks it went back to normal. And now there is a new look, that is different from last time. I want to opt out of this new layout and guinea pig experiment please!!
Thank god I still haven't got the new UI update on my account
This is fucking Dogshit now.
Horrible, mine changed yesterday.  I can't see the percent of upvotes on my postings, the videos just spin it takes so long to scroll through the list, it's slowing my computer down 50%.   This is horrible, and I can't get it to go back to the old format.  I'm going to barely look at Reddit anymore because of this change.
I hate change, plain and simple.
I don't love the avatar/icon that, out of the corner of your eye, looks like it has a Hitler mustache.
I detest the new "banana" feature. (The icon at the top of the page...)
I will never click on that icon ever again. Ever.
i dont know who signed off on this but it sucks.

"Hey lots of people like and enjoy using our website/platform."

"Lets change it."
Ohhh so they are making it into Facebook?  That's lame.  Glad mine doesn't look like that yet.
I agree. It sucks major, huge big time! Completely ridiculous plan, who ever thought it 'would be better' or something? It's awful indeed.
Man, I am glad I am not the only one who thinks this new design is dogshit. IIRC, this isn't the first time Reddit has arbitrarily changed it's UI for the worse.

As someone who works in software development, where emphasis it put into UI and UX teams, it blows my mind that Reddit can be this fucking blind or willingly don't care about how their site comes across.
This is complete shit, it mimics the Android app now.
Fuck Reddit! I’m gone for good until they change it back…this was the stupidest & worst redesign in history. What an idiotic move they made.
This whole redesign is an accessibility nightmare. This isn't just, oh, you don't like change. I Actively have trouble using the site now. Its buggy, constantly says I have new notifications when I clearly don't under the inbox. I use Reddit on Safari for the exact reasons i listed above with the mobile app. And this dark mode plays hell on my astigmatism worse than the last one! Who made these decisions? Did they even Talk to a disabled person before?
It changed again. Sidebars are gone for me.
Viewing on mobile just got so much worse. It's gotten a lot more difficult to scroll through without pages to help me keep track of where I was
Shut the fuck up and click on the ads. Engagement is what matters to the algorithm and those who want to sell your data.Your user experience matters little go the algo.
I just want my compact view back.

The percentage of posts I'm interested to tab into is so low that it makes sense to have the compact view, so there's always something interesting on my screen... with the current (fugly) view, I'm not compelled to keep scrolling. So even from a "pull people in so they doom scroll" perspective, the new UI sucks. Way to shoot yourselves in the foot, Reddit.
[new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) does not work for me. Does anyone have any other solution? 

I cannot use reddit the way it is now and it makes me so sad and angry.
Yes because all stolen laptops have BIOS passwords enabled. Reddit you're so dumb sometimes.
We can all agree the new design sucks, but you just had to go off the deep up and randomly rant about neo-Nazis and fascists
THERE'S TOO MUCH WHITE BACKGROUND. It hurts my eyes.
It might be in testing for some users. I am not seeing this new style. I just see the regular default "new" reddit that has the drop down next to the search box.

Check in your user settings:

[https://www.reddit.com/settings/](https://www.reddit.com/settings/)

At the bottom of the Account tab, there should be an option to opt in and out of beta testing, and also to opt out of the redesign. (though they mean the previous redesign with the dropdown box next to the search bar). Opting out of the redesign will opt you into using [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com) by default though. You may or may not want that.
I don't know if this works for everyone else but,      
If I press the post button (the plus sign) and then exit back i temporarily get the previous design

Edit: forgot say I did this on mobile and on the web page, don't know if this works on others
I bet even an intern can create a better, smoother design. This is just an awful experience. And on multiple PCs Reddit won't remember to use Dark Mode. It sets itself to Ligh Mode every refresh.
Did they remove custom feeds from the sidebar? How do we get that back?
Today I got back the old "new" design.

I think they may be rolling it back
This is shit. Dreadful. But OTOH I might spend less time on here because of is which could be good for me. 🤷‍♂️
Every page resets to light mode, no matter what I do. The redesign in itself is bad enough (the fonts on desktop are now tiny and less readable than before, especially with the high contrast), I don't need to see it in all white every time I open a new page. Those two new sidebars full of crap are also annoying. 

I guess I'm going to take a break from Reddit as well as Instagram. They're all becoming such unpleasant spaces just because of "progress" that doesn't take user feedback into account...
Yeah this new design is really ugly, but the main reason I hate it is that the previous "redesign" look is now *completely gone* (unless you go to the new.reddit url), and there's no way to revert back to it as your default. I don't like "old reddit", it's too small and clunky for my tastes, but I hate this redesign too, and it's infuriating to me that there's no way to go back to the nice middle-ground we had before!
Also, what's up with notifications opening a new page? This entire new layout sucks compared to what we had
Opened reddit this morning and was grossed out. For a second I thought my browser logged me out and it was just showing a weird screen, but no...

The subs I used to go on had banners across the whole screen, pretty big. Now they're thinner and that stupid lefthand column cuts them off. They also had different background colors and/or images, and now they're all just white. It's bland and bad to look at. I hate that each post opens a new page that you have to click back to get away from, and even the notifications button up top now directly takes you to your inbox instead of giving you a dropdown of recent replies. 

Horrible decisions were made
OMG, I couldn't agree more.  What they hell, guys.  This layout is actively antagonistic towards the users.
Good call. They've also essentially killed 99% of 3rd party apps.
Whenever I click to expand more posts in a thread, the app takes me back to the top. Seriously a nightmare.
This new design is pretty bad imo. I feel like I'm in github.
Getting to a new post or group is also nuts. I hate the permanent side menu and want the drop down menu back in the header. Also, can't see your karma anymore unless you click on your user. [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) was the most user friendly version for me. This one just sucks. 

I honestly thought I was logged out when I got on here today because the stupide side menu is normally only something I see when logged out.

..... and apparently you can't do the ctrl+enter anymore to post something. Fucking stupid.
Isn’t it kind of funny how discord and Reddit are worsening their designs at the same time?
things that used to be a drop down is now a stupid page and i get dark mode even if it deselected
Thought it was just me.  Have nearly given up reddit because of this and repeatedly trying to use a different version.  Finally, yesterday,  it went back to normal!!!  There is hope.
Hit refresh yesterday and suddenly got hit with this monstrosity. I'll probably get used to it, just like I got used to the last version, but if it ain't broke don't fix it!
Can't like it! The left column is dumb as hell.
Doesn't work on a phone.  Editing a comment to fix a typo is hell.  Making comments is hard unless you only type three lines.  It's becoming Twitter, only much harder to use.
I hate that I can't have a dropdown list of replies to see any while I am still reading in a post, now I have to either leave the post or open a new tab to see replies. What a terrible design choice.
It really sucks. Even something like when you get a notification about a response to your comment somewhere--the little bell has a red "1" marker, but if you click on it there isn't a dropdown to preview what it is, it instead takes you directly to your notification center and away from whatever you're looking at. It used to be so easy to see if it was something that interested me and then click to go to that comment.

Also am I crazy or did they remove the ability to search terms in a comment section?
Fuck the new design. You can't collapse the left bar, when you could before. ACESSIBILITY! people should be able to customize their experience. 

Why do sites make dumb changes like this when all people do is complain every single time? haven't they learned by now? I've never heard anyone say "I would join or use reddit more if they came up with a new design!"
I also hate the new mobile browser design!  The worst part is there's nothing in the settings I can find to change it back.  Reddit did this to the mobile browser about a month or two ago and it changed back to the old design after a few weeks thankfully.  Unfortunately, it switched back to this horrible new design again a few days ago.   Reddit really needs to change it back or give users the option to manually change it back at the very least!
O hate this new UI, crap
I dunno why everyone updates and makes it worse then it was before. The new changes are absolute garbage and look terrible and is hard to navigate the website. Why ruin something that worked great????
O thank god others think it is terrible too. You can’t expand a post without going into it then lose your place int he scroll when you hit back. Lots of rubbish mixed into your curated feed, it’s just so….bad. Like you’ve used Reddit before level of bad.  I fucking way I’m gonna use your mobile app like ever, and somehow there is less chance with a roll out like this. I don’t mind you sticking promoted posts in occasionally but revert all the other crap
It's absolutely terrible on mobile. I've found that since it's updated, I can't scroll on a page where I'm typing - so I can't go back and review my post before I post it.
OP brings up a huge problem.

It's also *fucking ugly* like it wasn't designed at all.

And, just like every other version of Reddit, shit all over is broken.

The people you have in charge of hiring the people who make this site? They are idiots. You were idiots for hiring those people, and they are idiots for hiring the people who made this site.
I'm debating leaving the platform. It is terrible.
Reddit, you just cured me of spending too much time on reddit. Thank you.
Goddamn awful is what it is. Unusable, ugly mess. Keep destroying your website, Reddit, let's see how it goes on the long run...
Goodbye fellow reddit. 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋

I CANT DEAL WITH THIS SHIT SHOW OF A SITE!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
reddit - nothing of my settings save anymore.  I have to adjust the sort by setting EVERYTIME as it resets.  Why did you make this change, it is terrible :(
What happened to controversial? 
It was always an amusing sideshow to remind me I am actually sane, now it's fine.

This is why you don't let coders, or marketing, design UI.
Ruined using reddit on mobile, and I HATE that they force the app down my throat.
Looks like they wanted to imitate Twitter and I hate Twitter.

When I click on a post, it opens partially and bellow you have Load more comments and after recommended stuff they want you to miss click on it. 

The text size on mobile (browser) is horribly small.

Settings don't stick.

Notification ... I don't even know if those are working properly.

I honestly have a hard time using reddit now.
This.  Nothing shows (all pictures, etc. are blank) unless I make my browser window super-wide (and it seems like every few visits I have to widen it more, even though I'd already widened it into working previously).  There's some hovering menu on the right that covers content and I can't find how to turn it off.  When I click on my notifications, it's no longer a menu that drops down but takes me to a whole new page.  All the ads--none of which I ever have any interest in whatsoever-- are videos and they auto-play even though I have auto-play turned off.
I HATE the new reddit format.

New links were bold, old links were not bold. You could see more comments without expanding anything (expanding takes time to load) combined with, after 2 trees, it takes you to a new page while the old reddit had comment replied expanded until much further before you had to navigate away from the original comment thread.

The front page has subs that I have not subscribed to. The defaults are a cesspool of misogyny and I do NOT want any default garbage to come up in my feed.

HATE, HATE, HATE the new format.
Why do I need to load more comments at the bottom of a desktop page?
MY SETTINGS ARE USELESS.  I WANT TO SEE POSTS BY NEW, YET IT DEFAULTS TO BEST.  WHO OR WHAT AI DECIDES WHAT IS BEST AND THAT IS WHAT I AM TOLD TO SEE.  IGNORES MY SETTINGS TOTALLY!!! HATE IT HATE IT, GO BACK TO OLD STYLE AND FORGET ABOUT AI.  I have also noticed posts are down and the usual posters aren't interacting.  AITAH feed used to have tons of new posts daily, now it is down to about 10.  Real people, not bots are giving up!
100% this. 

On the plus side, now when I want to come here, more often than not I don't even bother. Obviously they're trying to cut down on usage. /S
Hey Reddit,
Thanks for the F$#% Shack!

Dirty Mike & The boys
When I click on a post it doesn't mark it as read (like the post is dim in the old style it did) does anyone else have this issue too?
That's truly terrible
For me the way it is displayed on all devices the platform just looks so chunky. I absolute do not like the side bars on both sides of the screen. I hope they implement a feature for people who like the old style to switch to this or this display it would give people options and set your preference to which one you like more.
The worst. Videos start playing automatically and shut down my TV streaming every time. Can't find anything on it easily. Just a dumb rollout.
I agree. This is bad.
THIS SUCKS
The new reddit sucks, big time
Just here to confirm I also do not like it.
what in gods name did they do to the mobile browser reddit? It is so bad
I've reverted back to the old old reddit for the time being. The new design is awful. I hope they revert back to the one previously. There's simply too much happening at once on screen.
Reddit devolves with every update lmao
This is really bad. Awful interface on website, I'll not be using it anymore or I'll opt in to old reddit which at least looks better. Not updating my phone app, if it updates itself then I'll be deleting it.
The new reddit is so SLOOOOW ..... I hate it.
I wrote a post, and after i hit the post button, it never loaded.
Why won't my post go active???
Can someone please help me understand this.

Thanks
Ridiculous
OP is right. I agree. 

We want the classic views and simplicities back. I don't know what your agenda is but it is going in the wrong direction. 
Revert back to the way it was. And where is the "Track Karma by Subreddit" listing? What happened to that? Put it back please! Change is not always good. 

You want people to be happy with Reddit? Revert it back to the Classic it ised to be.
im using reddit less and less because it just feels clunky, i really dont like this update :/
# I HATE IT
It's incredibly boring compared to new.reddit and old.reddit, every reddit looks the same, no customisation
please let me out of this design. please, what did I do to deserve punishment like this. it is seriously taking longer to load and puts me off using the site at all.
I just got this redesign pushed today. 

Between this design disaster and oldreddit, I will go with oldreddit. But that is ageing badly now so basically I am out.
Is this a Musk take over?????? Just WHy wHY WhY wHy why WHY???? 😭😭😭
New design still slow and disgusting
Very bad redesign!
what the hell were they thinking this new reddit is awful ...wish there was a way to choose between new and old, bet 99% of users would go for old reddit
WTF is with all the colors? I honestly cannot figure out why, in the last 15 minutes, i have opened threads that changed all my colors to variants of red, orange, green, and blue. What is going on?
Just got this redesign complete with every terrible change mentioned 4 months ago. Clearly they are really listening to feedback!
Well, happened to me today and ya, this thread looks like a Wiki page with all the crap on each side of main post.  It really is distracting.
> the names of users no longer appear on posts in the main feed


Yeah, that's annoying. Now if I ever want to click on the user to see more of their stuff, I have to first click on the post, and then their name (pointless extra clicks - sigh). Where are those good old upvote/downvote buttons when it comes to voting features on Reddit itself? :b
Yea, I just got this view.  I hate it too.  WTF?
I don't know why this redesign JUST now arrived on my Mac, but I truly ***hate*** having that left sidebar list there.  That info was perfectly fine placed in the drop down menu until needed.  It's also much slower when scrolling through the post feed, and the main content font got smaller.  

The only thing I do like is the slightly wider main content area and that the lines for sub-comments are easier to follow.  BTW, I do believe you can de-select the posts opening in a new tab under settings.
I was hoping to see a way to go back to the older view (but not old Reddit) but it seems I am stuck with that AWEFUL left area, that like everyone else, I never, or almost never, interact with, and its taking up so much screen space!
I wish get they would get cross platforming so badly.  I have 7 years in PS4/5 , but I did start out on Steam - I got frustrated and quit till my bestie  started playing on PS4- after that, I only played PS5 and I’m like 8 toons with over 1200CP can go back.

You seem to be asking about [home feed recommendations](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402284777364) appearing in your home feed.

Yup it is terrible.
For me it causes most comments to be collapsed. Luckily it doesn't show up when I'm logged in, but it makes using Reddit when logged out unusable.
change it back, if i wanted a mobile layout i would use reddit on my phone, or worse the blasted app
I love how often people misuse the word "fascist" because they hear it so much in their echo chambers. On top of that they think that entities who want to push censorship are indeed not fascists. Fascinating behavior.
It provides more space for advertisements. That's the only thing that matters.
Can't save Dark Mode ...................My f+\*king eyes hurt :(
I can accept everything else.

But FOR THE LOVE OF GOD bring back the dynamic mode where I could click on the sides to go back to my feed. Sigh

/r
Im just deleting my Reddit if it stays like this
Amen, and another thing I hate, how clicking on someone's profile bubble when the reply to you in a thread, then "chat" doesn't do anything but collapse their comments.
I've got to 2 questions about Reddit's current redesign,
First: Is it permanent?
Second: If so, how long does it usually last (in days)?
I would search this thread to see if someone has mentioned the "search comments" feature gone in the new layout, but there's no more search feature... or at least I can't find it. BRING IT BACK!!!!!
* needs to persist opened media like before, now I open things I've already seen, annoying
* needs to not clear all notifications if I click through to one
* needs bigger click area for stuff, I misclick all the time
What happened to sorting by controversial at the subreddit level (not post level). That was my favorite feature of Reddit and it simply doesn't exist anywhere else.
Is there any chance that the [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) link will be updated to the newer horrible UI? I really hope not
Going to my profile, links are now ugly and lack icons, videos are not displayed in full like before, this change is bad
I find it vdry user friendly. Earlier reddit was hard to use on android, but now it looks a lot smoother and simplistic. Yo uall keep yapping about small stuff
how do you find the list of people you follow?  It used to be after the communities list and now its gone.
yep i did like the old 'new' reddit but this overhaul is disgusting and i f\*cking hate it
Hey can someome help me reddit option to make posts isn't showimg up anymore no matter what subreddit and I was not banned or anything. The plus mark icon to post just isn't there anymore,please someome help!!! :( I just posted a video and now I can't post anything what the hell is going on ? I have karma if anyone can help fix this issue for me. Not really sure what karma is or does but hey its yours if this issue can be fixed. I am on reddit app mobile if that helps.
Up & down arrows don't 'stick' in the sub, if you go in and out of comments

Users that I follow aren't listed anywhere, maybe put them in Communities but not there now

My user setting is set for NEW, all the subs come up either Hot or Best and EVERY SINGLE TIME I HAVE TO SET SORT TO NEW, going in and out of subs have to reset EVERY SINGLE TIME (doing this for like 20 times or more every day makes just quit Reddit and go to Bored Panda!)

Have tried to post about issues on report, their report system sucks because you as just a user cannot report API issues.

HOPE SOMEONE SEES THIS MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, FLOATING IN THE REDDIT OCEAN AND IS EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO!!!!! Take me back to Old Reddit!  I don't care about the AI crap on pushing ads, leave it be.
💗💗
How do you get reddit to look like this:

[https://i.postimg.cc/VkJYcNBn/Untitled.png](https://i.postimg.cc/vkjycnbn/untitled.png)
Presses the agree button\*
The new design is vomit inducing awfulness. It completely changes how you engage with content, for the worst! Seriously, someone just make a close site and let's all go over there before the IPO.
Not only is 2/3 of the page wasted clutter now, my Home feed only shows about half what it used to show. I want a compact list. Where did compact list go? My only choices are 'cards' or 'classic'.
Hello I have adhd and this is completely undreadable. Everything is just one big blob. I despise the experience, this is uttely awful. God send help.
So how the hell do I get rid of this horrible new UI, and get the old one back?
Mesmerizingly ugly—and so much white space I am getting snow blindness.
I HATE THIS NEW UI SO MUCH!  It's a poor use of screen real estate.  But they corrected that by making the font smaller.  When you enlarge the windown with command+, you get an entirely different UI with the photos all enlarged.  WTF STOP!

Honestly, [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com) will be better than this new rubbish.
Honestly, the thing I hate the most, is the notifications no longer has a drop down feature, but loads a new page..
Yeah. I know which technologies they changed it’s not only a design change.

I’m a front end developer and they change from the most established and successful framework to a very unpopular one just to get a little bit faster.

Big mistake
Where did the statistics go? Beneath a post saying how many people viewed a post etc.
Everything about this 'update' is awful.
I thought I'd post this here: it's now December 19 and the previous layout has been restored for me! I hope it's not a glitch, and that the same is/becomes the case for everyone else.
old.reddit.com has always worked fine, both on desktop and on mobile.
Today, [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) stopped working as a workaround for me. It also updated to the new one with the column on left side. What now!?
Sometimes when I click on a post and then click the back button.  Instead of going back to the main feed of whatever sub I'm in it takes me TWO steps back to whatever previous website I might have been on.

The SOMETIMES is the worst part.  No consistency, no easy adaptation.
I hate it enough that it will cause me to get off reddit.  It used to be a fun way to spend some time, once it becomes a chore it’s over for me
I also cannot collapse a thread by clicking on the line. WHY????!!!!
Thank god someone else said it! This design is awful and pisses me off. Im also subscribed to alot of communities and the communities bar on the right doesn't even display them all!
Left bar doesn't even let me see all the subs I follow, it cuts off in the M and there is no scroll bar to continue beyond that.
Please put it back how it was! As others have said - accessibility NIGHTMARE. Low vision contrast DOES NOT WORK, Increasing font size DOES NOT WORK. It's gearing up for an ADA lawsuit honestly. 

And I can NO LONGER SUBSCRIBE TO POSTS I DIDN'T MAKE. 90% of what I do on reddit is weekly threads set by an auto mod. And now I have NO WAY TO FOLLOW THEM with notifications.
It's slow and terrible.  When will there be a reddit competitor that I can switch to?
Even the design is ugly IMO
Thank you reddit for telling me I view you too much and to curb my use with this new layout...On to other internet things:/
This is horrid!  I can't even view notifications now without leaving the page.  And editing a posting? F\*ck!  Who's bright idea was this?  Why did they think these things needed changing?
I switched to old reddit 3 days ago when mine got updated, which also sucks, but is at least usable and makes better use of the screen space.

I will be using reddit less and less at this rate.

edit: https://new.reddit.com is at least making it usable albeit without the thumbnails.
Video clips from Twitch, Youtube, etc. all refuse to play on reddit, they just open up the clip in a new tab -\_-
As others have said, it's very visually distracting. We should have the option of turning it off.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it!
Seyedmohaned71997@gmail
Just got dumped into this piece of garbage. How do I opt out?
As a longtime reddit user this is seriously making me consider leaving the platform.  Over half my screen is taken up by useless banners, it's less efficient, and painful to read.   On top of the functionality losses.  Absolute garbage.
It reminds me of tiktok. It's so gross.
The text is tiny. The vote/comments/share buttons are larger than the post title. 

How did this pass any accessibility or usability testing?!? It’s making me want to ditch this site.
Everything about it seemed great at first. The more I use it, the more I hate it. I needed an excuse to end this unhealthy relationship anyways.
This is more recent but what did they do I can’t scroll through subreddits anymore the weird glitch when u swipe to the right is gone but this like destroys the purpose of the app
Scrolling is completely broken for Chrome on Android. My text will go completely off screen once text outgrows the comment bubble. I've had to resort to old.reddit.com - The overall design of this new web interface looks like something from 2010 iPhone gone horribly wrong
What I personally hate about this new design is that when reading comments I can't collapse the entire comments chain after scrolling down. Like, I have to scroll back to the beginning of it to press tiny (-) button to do that.
Don't know if it's just me, but a lot of the times I read 2-5 comments in a chain, realize that I'm not interested in what people are discussing and then move on to the next comment to see what they have to share. But in the new design I can't collapse everything by clicking on a little bar on the left of each reply branch. Now I have to either scroll all the way up to do that or all the way down to the next comment (god knows how long that discussion went).
Yup.. me too. Wtf are Karma points and why? lol. Stupid. The moderators have too much control over posts too.
Experience on mobile is godawful, everything blends together and not in a good way at all.

I'm trying to think of a single good thing and can't.
Agreed. I hate it too.
This new design almost crashes my browser when I open a new page, Ryzen 5 3400G, 32gb of RAM!
New reddit sucks traitor joe bidens buttocks
Jesus christ its awful.
Oh not locked yet? lol
It's pretty bad. Anytime I switch interfaces/look at a comment, etc it opens a new browser. It's so clunky.
Reddit mobile is currently unusable. Now i have to strain my eyes with the desktop site on my phone. No, I'm not downloading their crappy app. They sabotage the mobile site, so people are forced to download that garbage. Yeah no, they ain't getting my support.
Agreed and the inability to comment on any post that’s older than 6 months things has really ruined it for me. It doesn’t make any kind of sense. I prefer quora now
use to be able to click out side of reddit post to go back to main page. Now you have to back space which sometimes takes you back twice. So if you were on anther website before clicking on reddit. It goes to there which in turn you have to come back to reddit again.. So painful and annoying. Shits slow to compared to months ago.
I hate that they took away the awards system one hot week after I bought a yearly premium.  What is the point of having a pro account other than to hand out awards to producers you actually like and support?!
I find it ironic how you complaing about right win propaganda or fascist, when reddit and its admins are openly HEAVILY left wing.  Reddit has been nothing but left wing circlejerk and left wing radicals have been tolerated while right wing radicals are instantly banned.

&#x200B;

There's a double standard, but not the way you are trying to make it sound. Reddit is 90% left wing for a reason.
Reddit will fall in Sept 2024 

Don't forget the remind me thing so I can cash in on internet points
Removing pages is awful. They're trying to turn reddit into a death scroll app like all the others. Now when my browser crashes or if I take a break, and the page refreshes, I lose where I was in a sub. It's garbage.

I hate that the developers did this. I hate hate hate it
If I hadn't found out how to access "new.reddit" I'd have dropped the site altogether by now. Brilliant design, chaps!
You used to be able to scroll through your favorites now you have to click one at a time. It’s such garbage. I don’t even use it anymore.
AI moderation is killing some of the subs. I tried to post on 2 of the subs I used to frequent, and the AI moderators deleted the post giving some half-sensical reason. There's no sidebar to read the rules, AI based moderation is making up some rules that aren't communicated to the user and deletes stuff as it sees fit, no questions asked.

It feels like a very hostile place. Much different from what reddit used to be.

Another post I had, which had a decent user interaction, had 25 upvotes, a few comments and one day later it was deleted by the AI moderators. This stuff is crazy.

I'm going to take a hike from reddit for some time.
I like the comment listing GUI (it fixes https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/88l22n/how_to_collapse_comments_in_new_design/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Other than that, it does seem like a significant regression. Regardless, I wish I could use it whilst authenticated, but I can't, so I rarely see it.
i agree, using reddit gives me cancer now
does anyone know if its possible to revert back to the previous design? this new one makes me cry.
overall seems to be an improvement, at least from the absolute monstrous javascript mess that was the redesign. But the individual post height is annoyingly high and you can't adjust it. (also I don't like the weird green, poop color background..)
wow. I hadn't been on Reddit for a couple of months and I am not planning to return soon. Awful new design/look.
It is objectively awful and single handedly lead to me using the site 99% less
The actual issue is that it doesn't work. I just got the redesign and I've had more connection, loading and post errors in the first 15 minutes than I've had in YEARS using this platform.

It's absolute garbage.

I've literally switched to the oldest version I could find and it's working flawlessly. 

Whichever useless lead decided to rebuild Reddit with his 5 year React experience can suck it.
I HATE it! I guess I won't be using Reddit much now. I "opted out" and that format is even worse, like an old Compuserve bulletin board. WHY THE F CAN'T PEOPLE LEAVE THINGS ALONE???
yes, i hate it too, why change something while it works ?
BTW, I do not own smarthpone, I do have old one, and I can not surf redddit on it, due to "on phone, only app works", so there you go too, Reddit, one visitor less, thanks to your managers who decided like this. At least I save my precious time.
It also leaves to one sided communities because mods constantly take down answers, they are not politically backed by.
It is garbage and a leftist political outlet now
Freeze every time, old version is much better, hate it
It is terrible - and i hate the fact all these minipages open - sometimes I will have 5 reddit pages before I realize what is happening - also in order to see my comments I have to click on the bell and go to messages and from there the old reddit menu - it’s stupid.
Am I the only one experiencing problems like not being able to use the mod tools in subreddit, not being able to change cover photos and not seeing the exact number of members?
goodbye custom buttons on new reddit ui
Not only is the design bad the features removed is a wrong step and the features "added" like hiding usernames is a VERY bad step. This all stinks far away of someone who managed to get them self a job as a redesigner for reddit and then actually not being able to do a good job.

It went from looking pleasant, the dark mode was really nice, fit well with dark mode on browser and OS and so on. The new design has this disgusting industrial office grey/blue/green. Like a color that can't decide what it is, so it just turns into looking like muddy water.

And as far as i am concerned. No one. I mean literally no one, was asking for a redesign. It's the dumbest move at the dumbest time ever as well. A lot of people use reddit less right now. And even more so when spring and summer hits. When people then goes on reddit and don't get that homie feeling from it. It's more likely to have people close down the app or browser again and do something different. In the end. People will use reddit less until they find a reason to use reddit again. Unless of course they don't or if the new design is so off putting and impractical that people just don't use reddit anymore after taking a break due to the new design making everything feel foreign/strange/not homie.

Google changing up things, Youtube changing up things, Twitter changing up things and now Reddit.  
It's very clear that there is some weird corporation change happening world wide making every social media change their design looks and features. But none of them are changing anything to the better for the consumer. It's all changes that benefits the politicians, news medias that wants to click bait and bigots (though i often doubt that the 3 are actually even different people. They all seem to be having the same constipated issues making them all sound the same amount of crazy and the same amount of needy and controlling. Manipulating if you will)
Terrible design. Who thought it was a good idea? Reddit better hire some talented UX/UI designers, not these amateurs who ruined an already flawed design.
The new design is result garbage, how anyone can think that it is good to use is beyond me...
Agree, I just now got hit with it and immediately tried to change it back to usual. Absolutely LOATHE the new rollout. I wonder what other fuckups are coming our ways.
I came to this sub specifically, after I noticed the "new" "design" (quotation marks fully intentional on both). It's BAD. IT'S DIFFICULT TO USE. BRING BACK THE OLD ONE. Add option in User settings to continue using old one. Thx.
Not only is it ugly, cramped on a mobile phone, it is also broken. 

 I can no longer edit any posts because it does not register the tap on the Save button. 

We have basic HTML for a reason: It works.  The new Reddit design does not.  Keep it simple stupid.
I only use Reddit on desktop with a browser and this only rolled out for me today, and it's absolutely terrible and unusable.  So much wasted space and small fonts.  I'm not able to use it anymore after I manage to get through the links I just opened.  So much wasted space and hurts my eyes trying to read anything.  Just absolute garbage.  I don't think they could have made it worse if they tried, if they still wanted the guise of not intentionally making it unusable.
Wow, it just updated for me, this is bad. How can I see a full post (text for example) without the main feed disappearing? Seems impossible now...
How do I go back to the main feed after opening a post? Normally I could just click next to the post and it would disappear and the main feed would still be where I was. Now... I can't go back.
OP was mostly correct in the observation, but a little off when it comes to the *raison d'etre*: Removing compact mode and re-structuring the layout is serving 2 purposes that add to the same goal: sell ads. 

Removing compact mode keeps people scrolling more and thus longer on the site. Dwell time is one of the more significant KPIs when it comes to convincing advertisers to buy your ad space, because the longer (have to) stay on-site, the more ads can be displayed to them. 

Reason No. 2 - Compact mode would not be suitable to display the common ad formats, thus ads would not be efficient within that design.
It just hit my ID and I truly hate it. I feel cramped with a column on each side, that I do not need. And I cannot find or see things in my interactions like I am used to. Ugh. I really really hate this layout.
It just changed for me but (for now) it's still fine on my phone. Guess I'll be reading Reddit from the internet on my phone from now on.
I thought we were going to be spared from having to deal with this awful thing. But it's back. My only alternative is to go back to old reddit but old reddit doesn't have a good dark theme. The admins just seem dead intent in driving people away from this site.
I wouldn't have a problem with the left side bar at all if only it would remember that I collapsed all the items after a refresh. This is bad design and could be considered a bug as it should be saved as a user preference setting in the browser cookie.

Agreed with the missing name display. It should at least be an optional setting.

There is one more loss of functionality you did not mention. From the main feed you can't mark titles anymore. F.e. I frequently used to mark a name in the title and then right click and search with google.
I think the single worst change in this redesign is that you now can't hover over the upvote counter to see the percentage of people who upvoted anymore.
The worst offense, albeit the smallest one in terms of how intrusive it is, must be the changes to the lay out. 

I absolutely hate it how the new setup has these medium or large tiles instead of the old situation where every topic was just a line of text. So many more topics could fit on one page and it made it so much easier to find things without having to scroll through endless graphical clutter.
I don't mind if websites make a new look an feel. This however, is a worse look and an even worse feel. It's noticable slower and more annoying. Each post I want to see comments for takes several seconds to load. What the hell happened? The old design doesn't have this issue.
It's horrible and it made me use reddit so much less then before!
Yeah.  I finally got the mobile web update on my phone.  I don't think it's going to be helpful.  The one think I liked about the mobile web was the minimalism and that it wasn't filled with algorithmic stuff that's cluttering like 1/3 of the page now.
I really dont get why tech companies always make changes to UIs that are already fine. New for the sake of new is almost always for the worse.

Reddit on mobile for me is now an awful mess. Wasting mobile data on "things we think youd enjoy" ... I hate useless suggestions some algorithm thinks Ill like. I rarely do and it just gets in the way of what Im chose to look at making the user experience worse.
I was going nuts this afternoon on mobile with no pages,  man I'm sad they design this through a focus group ?
A few more horrible things:

* Why do I need to click the "T" button under a post to get formatting controls?  And why not just put the controls there instead of the "T", given it is blank space
* Clicking the "alarm bell" on the top right used to let me see previous comment notifications and mark them read...now I need to go to the inbox each time??
* Dark mode is too dark and contrast.
* The fonts are hard to read.
Yep there is NO pages, endless scrolling.  It reminds me of those websites where you're trying to scroll all the way down to click on customer service for help but they just won't let you because of the endless scrolling.
I miss being able to expand and collapse imgs/vids
I can't even find a way to post to Ops original post. I have to hijack the most popular comment to add on. I can't get the numbers that have responded to my comments without clicking 5 different things. This is a massive step backwards. I liked reddit. Now it feels like my fucking job that changes computer processes every 6 fucking months so IT can validate their existence. I'm done. This is bullshit but I spent too much time here anyway
They do it on purpose too which is the worse part. They design these things like YouTube shorts so you jusy scroll through a bunch of crap you regret even watching or reading about.
Reddit is trying its hardest to make people not use this pos site.  Where is a message board where you can freedom of speech and not have some nerds redoing the design every few months?
Amen
yeah they really screwed mobile users over
Yeah the worst thing for me is that the ducking upvote button moved like bruh I’m not changing scrolling  hands
Hey quick tip for anyone on a android you can downgrade you’re app and block automatic updates if it bothers you this much. I have a iPhone now since i broke my Samsung but I always use to do it for some apps
I guess the only option is to go way back to [https://old.reddit.com/](https://old.reddit.com/) I just got forced the desktop update and it is so bad. I didn't mind the update from the old reddit, but this latest update is just worst overall. I have been building websites for 25 years, I know people usually gripe about changes. I usually like updates/changes, not this time.
It is so awful that I stopped using it on my mobile.
Scrolling is a feature, how else can they force ads on you effectively. I love how you're "scrolling" but accidentally click half the time. :P
DEAR GOD THANK YOU I've spent all morning trying to find the "in between" version of old/new
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS YOU HAVE NO IDEAAAA
Thank you for letting me know that this is a thing.
oh my god this is fantastic. It really says something about Reddit's GOD AWFUL designs when most people want to use ANYTHING but the current version.
Oh my god, thank you.
You are a flipping hero.
OMG THANK GOD.
doesnt work on mobile unfortunately, I get  - NET::ERR\_CERT\_COMMON\_NAME\_INVALID
THANK YOU FOR THIS LINK! I almost deleted my account lol
Thank you. Much better!      

Still won't let me sort by rising anymore, but otherwise, a significant improvement
You are the hero we needed but did not deserve. Thank you my brother in Christ.
Oh my god, thank you! I was going mad with the newest design
Thank you so goddamn much for that link.
Wait what? I find the redesign terrible but this is even worse than the redesign. Individual posts take up your entire screen in this format, it's terrible for finding a post you actually want to engage with.
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aaaand now they got rid of it smhhh
ugh, today your link doesn't work for me. I HATE the new layout. Too cluttered, hard to get in and out of posts without losing my place. I used to think reddit was a good fallback for the other stupid social media. Not anymore.
OMG Thank you
I never knew this was a thing its great hopefully reddit will go back to this look instead of reinventing the wheel when nobody wants or needs to reinvent it.
You are my hero!
thank you for posting this. i just got the updated version and it was terrible.
omg thanks this is much better. I cant fathom how anybody thought these new changes would be better
If I were still in child bearing years I'd name my next one after you.
Absolute hero!
Thank you so much for this, this is what I wanted!
Thanks for that link!
Hero!
I had three "unread" messages that didn't show up when I clicked on my inbox. They did, however, show up on new.reddit.com. Thank you for the help!
you freaking bootiful bro thank youuu
Thank you for this. I use two accounts, one has the update and the other doesn't, it's annoying.
bruh this link is such a lifesaver
dude thank you!!
Anyone knows how redirect the reddit links ([www.reddit.com/](http://www.reddit.com/)...) to this domain(new.reddit.com/...)?

Maybe a firefox plugin or something similar.

&#x200B;

Edit: Firefox's redirector plugin solves this, just use this reddirect:

Include pattern: [https://www.reddit.com/\*](https://www.reddit.com/*)

Redirect to: https://new.reddit.com/$1

Patter type: Wildcard
Wow, thank you so much for that. 

I tried going to 'old Reddit' but it took me back to the really old one. I just wanted to go back to the perfectly fine one we've just had. 

I hate, hate, HATE the newest look. It looks like an older version of Facebook.
Bookmarked! Thank you.
Thank you!!!
What a hero.
TY.
you, my dude, are the REAL MVP of this discussion
Today, [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) stopped working for me. It's design also got updated to the new one with the column on left side.  
What now!?
Hi it no longer works but redirects to the new layout. :-(
OMYGOD THANKYOU!
Wow thanks, solved all these new problems
Thank you for this link, I hate the newer version!
ATROCIOUS  is not too strong a word.

The most un-user-friendly format "update",  I have ever seen.  Was this supposed to be an improvement ??

It's like whomever designed it, followed point-by-point, some check list from hell, on setting back a user-friendly platform by 20 years.
Thank you!!!!!! thank you. thank you. thank you. This needs to be the top comment. Come on people, get this up higher
What is new.reddit.com?
Thread necro but DEAR GOD THANK YOU FOR THIS.
Thank you, kind sir.
omg you are amazing, thank you.  I am physically repulsed by the new reddit design.
Thanks for mentioning this. I just got the awful redesign a couple days ago with no warning. 

Same as Youtube, they fix what isn't broken and make it worse in the process.
It is not really helpful because how do you go back from the post to the main feed? There is no close button and if you use back in the browser you go back to the top of the feed.
omg thank you
I wholeheartedly want to say that you are a hero and a saint. Truly. You saved a Lot of people from an immeasurbly ugly mess ( imagine deviantart's eclipse version II )
Omg thank you for that link. I have changed all my bookmarks to that url. How long will we be able to use that layout? I really cannot deal with this cramped two columns and horrible redesign.
Thanks! Just got the new design yesterday in germany, what the actual fck. Absolutely abysmal half assed crap! There is no way in hell ill ever use the new design, its ridiculous
thanks !
> It doesn't make sense for a business to force its users into something and just forget about their wants and needs, ignoring any feedback.

It makes sense when the business has no competition and can afford to treat its users like fish in a barrel.

Reddit believes it doesn't have to do right by its users in order to make a profit. It's on us to prove them wrong, I guess.
It just changed for me recently, the sidebars are terrible and make it harder to use.
>no idea what it's like in light mode

It's just white. Everything's white. Such creative. Much wow.
It's to make it harder to notice ads, they're hoping that by making the entire site a borderline unreadable mess more people will accidentally click on the ads
I have just been forced into the new layout and it has made me want to stop using Reddit on mobile altogether, it's vile. I don't know how to leave feedback on it though?
Literally unusable
YES!
literally took the words out of my mouth
Who signed it off? Good god it's terrible
>uncollapsable left sidebar

Click the menu button.
I use uBlock Origin, it's easy to just add a rule that removes anything you don't want to see on a website.
- When I click on a post and go back I'm at the top of the list again..  
YES! Exactly this! Such a stupid redesign.
Yes, I thought I inadvertently enlarged the images somehow. One post takes up my entire screen!  I have to scroll up or down to see just one image. It’s horrible!
It's even worse on PC. I have 27'' monitor and I see exactly ONE post when I scroll through my history. So if I want to check something I've posted 3 month ago I have to scroll for like two minutes. It's ridiculously bad. When I swap to new.reddit I fit about 20 posts on page.
I like how on landscape it uses half the screen space to search on posts, but then you get to see like 2 comments because of all the clutter.
I really wish there was a good alternative
This is the way
this is my exact issue. i use my tv screen as my monitor. i browse on one side of the screen while watching vids/playing games on the other, and this new layout turns reddit into a tiny little strip. i dont need this column on the right (...or the one on the left for that matter). terrible!
Yeah, it's horrible on mobile. Unnecessary things are HUGE now. The actual posts are freaking tiny. 80% of the screen are just crap and adverts and silly suggestions no-one asked for.
[https://new.reddit.com/](https://new.reddit.com/) is the closest thing
[deleted]
Yeah I just got this update and this is what is bothering me. Homepage posts went from like 8-10 to 4.
It's a flaming hot dumpster fire but happy c-day!
I absolutely hate this new update and [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) has been working for me!
This works! (For now. I'm sure it won't last, since it seems like reddit only ever moves forward with its plans and never abandons something just because users hate it.)
Yep same, been using new.reddit but its just random.  
I usually browse at morning and its just LITERALLY random, sometimes if i open another thread in another page if i leave the new.reddit (close or something) it doesnt open anymore for a good time.

I hate this
you're not the hero i was expecting to find today, but thank you for your service.
Nope, it still keeps me in this cesspool of a UX update.
That worked for me.  Thanks!
I remember when face book was fine on mobile browser but they want you to download their bloatware/spyware app they nuked it into orbit, life's better without adbook
Same, but today it reverted to this shitty version, but now even shitter as 90% of the time you can’t resize the crap off the page.
I had the new design for a few days a while back then it went back to "normal".  Today, this new design bullshit has come back.  Guess I won't be on reddit this weekend waiting for it to go away (I hope).
Let me know if you find a good alternative
That's the thing that probably annoys me the most with the new "design" (which I only got yesterday, for some reason). I was an avid user of the quote function, but it's just horribly broken (just as you described). 

One thing you forgot: to even *get* to the quote (or any other formatting option) you have to click the little "T"-button on the bottom left, which then opens the formatting bar *on top* op the text area. WHY? Come on, reddit, I dare you: just open it on my second monitor, while you're at it...
People are recommending new.reddit.com.  Maybe that will help you?
And what's with the spacing between sentences? It's too much, so unbalanced
Omg I just did it and felt instant relief! My new layout tells me I have 2 notifications that I do not have/know how to find.
That works! 👍
Came here looking for the same info.
Yep, rolled back I assume. My friend got the new UI update, but I didn't. And today she said that the UI is back to normal (old new UI).
That's the bug Reddit should have fixed, instead of all this other nonsense that's making the site clunky
You can press the plus sign then quickly back out of it to temporarily give you the previous design
Yeah, nothing saves for me either, or at least some settings don’t.
Bad bot

Completely misunderstood my complaint.
%$##@! Bot!
That's so irritating, the collapsed comments and they don't seem accessible even though they hadn't been removed by mods. It's taking too much time
I use Reddit on my phone and I can't stand the new design. It's clunky as hell
I got the old layout back yesterday and it's till working for me today!
One of the worst pieces is not being able to preview images or videos on the main page. Instead of making the layout a bit more like the mobile application (even though I hate the program and rarely use it) that would be better. The preview image doesn't link to the post or larger image. If it did, that would be a touch better. Though, now all images load in their branded image viewer, and that sucks too.

Imgur has also updated their mobile layout so everything autoplays like the desktop layout. It causes a massive amount of memory to be used and tanks the browsers. I heard a few other platforms made major changes recently, and they're all bad UI choices.
About every third post is from a community I’m not part of and has a big join button. There are so many more ads now and just an endless scroll. 

I think they may have actually killed Reddit for me—it’s reminding me too much of what Facebook was like before I left.
It's like my job now. Every time you figure out how to use it, they fucking change it. But I'm paying for it not they paying me. Leave shit alone. I hate it
Honestly, the thing that annoys me the most is fuckin... The thing where when you're typing to someone on a DM and your profile picture doesn't show up
I have a theory with no proof, but I think designers change the UI just enough to slow users down as they remember the "new" way of doing things. This makes it take longer, so the app is open longer, meaning "the user is engaged with the app 10% more with our new UI! ", even though it's just taking you 10% longer to do what you want.
They think it will somehow make it easier to provoke (usually) bad emotions so you will engage more (usually with more bad emotions)
>I really dont get why tech companies always make changes to UIs that are already fine. New for the sake of new is almost always for the worse.

It's because programmers are like rodents. They continuously have to gnaw on things, otherwise they'd be out of a job.
What do you mean no pages? Is this change on mobile only if you update the app?
It just hit my laptop today.  The font is awful.  I'm old and they're too hard to read.  The lines on the font letters are too thin, I think.  But if I increase my browser to 110%, that's not really good either.  It's even worse in dark mode.
I can’t even find dark mode
This is the main thing I can't stand. 
I don't want to go to the post every time. Most of the time I just want to expand the thumbnail or play a second to see what the video is like. 

Just another set of dark paths for us to stumble down.
Mark my words, all videos online will be like YouTube shorts in the future. 

No scroll bar on any videos. Just have to hope it's either short or something you want to watch all the way through.

Sometimes I'm on YouTube shorts and the video isn't actually that short and I'm like...ok...ok...ok, when is this video over?
Its not the app, it's the mobile website
this needs a sticky
Bro why the f*ck I am not able to post. Getting this https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/29vs79p
Blinding white light that actually hurts my eyes, ugh I hate this update.
I can't find the option, can you be more specific?
[removed]
Whenever I click this link it defaults back to the new version anyway. Seems like they might be getting rid of it completely.
As I did clearly say, it is seemingly random.

At one point, I thought it was time-based, since it seemed to allow me to switch over at about 5am UK time, but it has since changed for me and I have absolutely no idea when it will allow me to 'revert to normal' .

Sorry if I was unclear!
Hmmm, interesting.
Who decided to start a dumpster fire? I think the whole Twitter to X shift has given a lot of the Social Media sites the balls to do whatever the hell they want. It's disgusting.
[removed]
Old.reddit still works for now but you have to manually add it as the setting has been removed. Yhe new version to me is like all those vomit sites with a main goal of shoving ads down your throat.
I don't use the app i mean mobile device web page. No pages at the bottom of the scroll its
"More post you may like"
Ahh sorry bro and I just looked at it on my phone who ever though this was a good idea  needs to be drug tested
 No, you were clear. I'm just making a comment for Reddit's insight on why this pile of shit UX is being hated that they are so determined to shove down people's throats.
Ah ok
lol I wish they did actually read our comments and give a shit!
The evolution 
Crazy how we have removed  so many ports.
You really like beating on your Macs...your Maccages
Given your history I highly recommend protection
i miss the battery indicator, and tbh the backlit logo..
the newest one already knows what it has to go through
Are these all yours?
This is making me feel old
Bring back the chungus.
Big jump from the Thunderbolt 2 MBP to the latest one.  Glad you skipped right over the utter shit that was 2016-2020 Mac portables.
I’m so sick of “dongles” and extra stuff needed to have a functional laptop. Make ‘em a 1/2” thicker with ports!
I want my RJ-45 ports back >:(
The guy must be pissed
This is why I can never get a modern Macbook. The lack of ports would drive me nuts.
This gives me inspiration to take my own photo!
Yes I can't live without my IEEE 1394 FireWire 800 port
it got worse with every version. I remember using a coin to open up the battery and replace it.
i have the 2007 white mac. loved that thing. just needs a new battery pack im hoping.
I feel old looking at this. 

Why can't Macs go back to having so many ports?
We don't need a lot of these ports anymore. And the macbook pros have pretty much all you need, unless you want ethernet. HDMI, SD Card, dedicated charging port, and multiple usb-c ports.
So, do you find you need to plug in a lot of fire wire and mini display port devices?
I prefer chunky bois
[goes looking for my Duo 270c]
Top color is a bottleneck in the evolutionary timeline
The thinnest Mac(s) we’ve ever made! ❤️🍎
I like how thin they are now but I do admit I miss SD slots and Ethernet ports. That white polycarbonate was sick as hell, sick as HELL

That said my condolences to your silicon up top, its death will be untimely and undeserved the poor dear
It seems like in couple of years we hardly get a port on MacBook lol
Was the second from the bottom a 2009 or 2010? I had a 2010 MacBook and a 2015 MacBook Pro, so super cool. Also used iBooks in school as a kid :)
I have these historical relics
What a lovely collection
This reminds me of those SpaceX rockets, where #1 was a complite mess and #3 was a neat package.
No powerbook?  Laaaame
The Unibody Aluminum MacBook came out before the Unibody Polycarbonate MacBook, but other than that, nice collection!
Don't be as hard on your new MBA!
The original 2008-2012 unibody series was peak Macbook Pro.
the 2012 macbook is peak
Still using the middle one
God I hated those plastic ones. Wasn't till they went aluminum that I started to want one.
The middle one is the peak of the design !
Missing a few generations
More like devolution. Now you get fewer ports and the color runs.
Devolution

Are we not men? WE ARE DEVO
Not the case for the Pros anymore
1000% Involution
What happened to the bent one?
I wonder how much gold is in those boxes.
no G4 powerbooks ?
Better get apple care plus... I have way older macs in excellent condition
Sadly you’re missing powerPC arch to make it complete.
You forgot the MBP 2016-2022
Love the color of that last one. I really want to get it for my next MBP.
You’ve skipped the (MagSafe-less) generations with the least ports?
I'll take the trade off. At some point, they developed a dock.

Then again, everyone doesn't agree with me

Old parody 

[Link ](https://youtu.be/_hnOCUkbix0?si=aSi0_ZhAb6pTadct)
10k $ of story
Goodbye headphone jack…
You forgot the USB-C Era of MacBooks...
I absolutely hated it when they went from 2 3.5mm ports to 1. First I had input and output through the same port. One laptop later, I was only left with output.
Interesting enough they all have MagSafe connectors. 

How come you skipped over the 2016-2021 Touch Bar series when they ditched MagSafe?
And then when they brought it back they acted like it was some new groundbreaking feat.
I guess I’m just a basic bitch because I hardly ever need those different kind of ports.

- I connect my macbook to my monitor with USB-C which also powers my macbook.
- Keyboard and mouse are bluetooth
- My headphones and airpods are also bluetooth
- Internet is 1GBit wifi
- When I need to transfer photo’s, video’s or other files from my iPad or iPhone I simply use airdrop.
- The only times I use a second USB-C port is when I connect my iPhone to charge or when I want to use a wired game controller.

I just don’t have any hardware to connect to my macbook
magsafe evolution :)
Clamshell, lots of ports.

Thank you.
Please stop dropping your Mac notebooks.
The top two ones have ports on either side. That original Retina in total has the same amount of ports as the previous thicc Pro (minus the optical drive obviously), essentially swapping ethernet jack and firewire with additional Thunderbolt and HDMI (and I don't know about you, IMO that's a massive improvement).
It’s like the PlayStation…

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Modelosps1.jpg
Damn, you are hard on your devices
Might be a few spicy pillows in there 🌶️
I do not feel that they should be that thin as current models.
Try to keep this one safe!
I miss my ports!
Thunderbolt port
If you guys want specs, here you go:
2006 MacBook. 2Gb ram, 120gb HDD, intel core duo (NOT CORE TWO DUO)

2009 MacBook. 4gb ram, 250hdd intel core2duo.

2012 MacBook Pro. 8gb ram, 512gb ssd, intel i7. 

2015 MacBook Pro. 16gb ram, 512gb ssd, intel i7.

2023 m3 air. 16gb ram, 1tb. M3!
there’s no 3.5mm jack anymore?
So uh...where is the ethernet port???
You need to stick a Macintosh Portable at the bottom and you're there.
the bottom one, what's the port to the right of the Ethernet?
Well done skipping the touch bar era
your missing the clamshell
Top one is ugliest IMO
Stop thinning it please.
Wow, I think you're very manic person for apple. 
Yeah, as you mentioned, I agree with you and the Apple has been reducing ports.
It’s almost like ports and adapters become more capable over time or something. If that top one is a pro, show the other side of the stack too.
Dongle-iscious!
The new crush ad
Th'evolution.
I’m a big guy. I didn’t mind the thickness and weight of the old machines. Please Apple, make them big and heavy again with a battery that lasts a week.
Think you skipped one. Where’d the model that wasn’t mag safe?😂
You forgot the 2016 redesign where they removed all the ports but thunderbolts.
Which colour do u like best?
Somehow I miss the old clunky ones, it felt like a proper laptop, with substance. Now they are all flimsy, have basically zero ports, are close to being irreparable and TBH they don't even look all that nicer.
Comparing MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and MacBook Airs. Not really a comparable comparison!
USB-C is the greatest eventuality. One of the few standards that just opens the door for so much value & only going to get better.
It's evolving, just backwards.
what are 2 black holes on 2nd mac
port to right of ethernet port?
I would say devolution
De-evolution :(
Thats not evolution, thats companies putting a leash on your wallet
mac sucks, they take away features and call it innovation. fuck apple
Wouldn't need so many if you bought a decent brand instead.
The 2012 tsa dropped at an airport and my sister ruined my 13.
Oh sweet baby Jesus in the manger. I zoomed in and instantly regretted it. OP, you psychopath, you
I know😂 I keep my new m3 air in a bag but I hate how the plastic cases look so I’m not going get one.
My 2008 had a little battery light that would “breathe” when it was asleep.
Omfg the backlit logo 😭 unlocked a core memory. I had an Ironman decal over the logo and when it switched on, it would look like Ironmans ready to fire
I think the best bling I got for my '12 MacBook Pro w the backlit apple was an Avatar The Last Airbender sticker of Aangs head and hands with fists centered together that when I opened my MacBook, he went into the Avatar state.... So awesome.
Me too.
I still use my 2012 15” Unibody MacBook Pro as my primary, so I don’t miss them. They are great features tho
me too
😂
Probably terrified
Yes they are. They all work except for the 06 MacBook. Needs a os install but for that model I need the specific disc it came with.
I know. Makes me sad.
I actively avoided Apple products during those times. It was not good times. I ended up having to go back to Windows for a bit, which is actually what I'm typing this one but I have dual monitors. One is a Mac. One is Windows. All my data is regularly synced between the two. If Apple supported external cards and supported gaming more I'd be able to leave Windows but.... alas.
I had a 2019 mbp but I traded it in for my m3. Those intels are crap compared to the silicon.
I use one USB C cable to charge and it also extends to my monitor which has a power supply and a usb hub.. so one cable does display/kb/mouse. at least at the house. 

i’m not saying i don’t also miss regular usb, or the SD reader, but if you do it right USB C is pretty baller.
I mean... USB-C should be able to convert to anything you need?

Ye olden days you had different ports for *everything*. Every single year a near one would come out for the same fuckin' device. We can thank the EU for pushing to mini-usb. The EU ignored the changed to micro. Then EU finally pushed for USB-C thankfully.

If you want dongles.. look at that bottom one a little more closely. It was a *nightmare* of a time period.

My electric razor charges via usb-c. My water pick charges via usb-c. My portable fan charges via usb-c. Luckily now my phone can charge via usb-c. My iPad charges via usb-c. My Airpods charge via usb-c.

Dongles? What are you on, Willis?

USB-C can shove a shit load of power too - so soon we'll see basically everything on one port *finally*.
Exactly!
Who’s using dongles?
My earliest laptops didn’t have RJ-45 ports either. I had to plug a 3Com pcmcia card in which also had a dongle to keep track of.    Now I just need the dongle.  Seems like a much better situation.  But I really wish I had a DB9, ADB port back.
😂
I don't have any problems with ports, I just carry a bag filled with 41 dongles every single time I leave home.
I have two hubs attached to mine. I should have bought a Mac Mini. MBP is forever grounded. 
Yup! I used to use a guitar pick.
Me too😢
Everything is in usb c now
A single USB-A would have been nice. And to be honest would have been more useful to the average person than the HDMI port.
Not really. But I just miss having ports so I don’t have to use dongles.
Don’t we all love the chunky bois?
Dw. I’ve learned my lesson on my previous Mac’s and I have a case and Apple care for my m3.
It’s a 2009. I used it until the 2012 came out because I had really liked the i7 pc I used to have to use for work so I bought the 2012 and that thing is still a beast tdy!
Sweet!
Thank you!
Just wait….
It’s a 2012. I was going by year.
Oh I’ve been treating it like a new born😂
Agreed.
Ikr.
Very true!
Very true.
My sister had it for college. She always refused to tell me what happend until about a year ago. She had it opened and her friend dropped her Mac onto it. The usb port somehow still works tho!
I had one during college. It started smoking and never worked again. But funny you ask this I just bought one!
I have Apple care for my m3. Smart choice on my end yeah most of these Mac’s I used for years and years. A lot of damaged happened for sure.
True!
I had a 2019 mbp but I traded it in towards my m3.
I had a 2019 mbp but I traded it in for my m3.
I had a 2019 mbp but I traded it in.
I had a 2019 mbp but I traded it in for my m3
Dw I’m treating my m3 like a child.
Yeah. They’ve been through a lot. But my m3 is my child and I’m keeping it safe as posible
Nope! All have been replaced at one point except for the m3.
I am!!!!
It’s on the other side. You’re talking about the silicon Mac right?
I had one but I traded it in
IKR!
Hmm. I agree that ports and the ability to repair would be great. I disagree on the flimsy part. The MacBook Pro is the most sturdy laptop I've ever used. imho
It just my collection dude.
Microphones
On the second Mac one is to lock the Mac and the first is headphones.
Middle one is FireWire 
Fourth mini display port
Then everyone else follows suit. That actually *is* innovation.
Get a new sister
You mean those Macs… are banged for the buck?

I’ll see myself out.
You should uh, get AppleCare my dude.
Yes cases are ugly, but maybe you can look into getting a sleeve. This is what I use and it’s very nice. Still have to be careful when using the thing, of course.
Not just yours. All of them!
That was one of the greatest designs and it’s really sad they removed it!
Also you could swap the battery without rebooting completely (because booting took forever).
Hahaha amazing! I remember I had an Ironman decal over the backlit logo and when the MacBook was switched on, it would look like Ironman’s readying to fire from palm
If that’s the case, you are in for a treat when you upgrade to apple silicon
check archive.org 
lots of discs there
You treat your stuff like shit, bro.  That last silver one is *bent*.
Are you sure? I thought you could still do it from online recovery as long as you have the license for Lion or whatever it was back then on your account. 

I restored my 2007 via online recovery that way.
No you don't, 10.6 was universal
You own MacBook Pro M2 Ultra with 128GB RAM? Are you a videographer, or just wealthy?
sure, but it’s somewhat “ridongleous” not having useful ports.
> If you want dongles.. look at that bottom one a little more closely.

I could plug into my network, my headphones, my gaming mouse and my external harddrive, plus whatever those tow ports are between network and USB-A.

Now? I can charge my razer from my laptop.

Don't get me wrong, I like everything having similar ports. But some things (network, headphones) need a special port, and we need *more* ports. I wouldn't object to having network, headphones/mic, and then six USB-C. But dropping from 7 ports to 2 is a signifigant downgrade, no matter how you think about it.
I’m down for everything moving forward to a standard like USB-C but I’m still supporting network devices that have RJ-45 jacks and need to use a dongle to interface between equipment. Still like my mac… just wish they supported some other ports.
your mom. but seriously, i do to interface with various equipment. may buy a bulky older windows machine to make life easier.
Anyone who wants to plug a memory stick into the top device there.
Almost exactly what I was going to answer, but I want them to keep the HDMI port as well lol (I keep my Mac closed and connected to a bigger monitor that only works with HDMI and DisplayPort)
I don’t get it. You don’t use those devices but you miss the ports so you don’t have to use dongles that you don’t use? Also if you look at the how the case of the white plastic MacBook failed.  Right there at the Ethernet port. That would not have happened without a port there.   The smaller usb-a ports seem fine and there’s no doubt an even smaller  usb-c port would have been ok. 
Nvm I thought you were going by design age, not specific model age
mac on mac violence is a real issue
I so recommend getting Macintosh Portable or PowerBook 100 from 1991 as well as PowerBook G4. 

Turn you can say “evolution” but maybe you meant “collection” since it’s probably machines you own. 

Either way, trip memory lane.
Nice! Lovely collection
ah I see, and yes, the new one
Got it, but you said "crazy how they removed so many ports," but you are comparing different models, Pro vs. Air vs. regular MacBook.
wdym to lock
not true at all
I like how the sister gets replaced but the TSA damaging something is just....meh. Like well yeah at least they didn't steal it.  



Yet.
💀
Applen should release one soon...Apple Sibling Air
"Our new and most advanced Sister Pro! We focused on privacy features such as an anti-snitch filter. You won't have to worry about her telling your parents that you ditched school!"
I have it! Dw😂
Life uh, will find a way!
Sleeve is what I meant by a bag. It’s a computer sleeve with handles
I actually downgraded from an M1 MacBook Air, as that machine was too valuable compared to my MacBook Pro, which has become a bit of a sleeper machine with 16GB RAM and 4TB SSD. It also technically has 17GB RAM, because it has 1GB of dedicated VRAM. The M1 MacBook Air ran smoother, but it couldn’t multitask as well as my MacBook Pro due to the 8GB RAM, and it didn’t have enough storage and wasn’t upgradable (the MacBook Pro didn’t have enough storage on arrival but that quickly became a nonissue after removing 14 Phillips screws and 4 T6 screws). It needs a repaste but my parents said that if it lasted a year with no maintenance they’d pay me back everything I paid (about C$135) since I use it for university. I recently needed to swap the RAM back to the CL11 kit I was using earlier (I had replaced it with a CL9 kit of the same capacity, smaller number better as this is latency), but they don’t need to know that as it took me 2 minutes and costed me nothing.
Me: has had an Apple silicon Mac since release

Also me: uses a 2012 i5 13 inch unibody MacBook Pro that I bought off of eBay this year more often than my m1 air
I downloaded 10.5 insted and it’s running!
Blame my sister. She had it for a year and it came back like this 😂. No idea how she did it.
Internet recovery didn't exist yet, IIRC.
The 06 uses a version of 10.4. But only the retail disc works. I’ve tried the internet archive but the file is corrupted.
Yea. I could really use an ADB port right now. 🫤
USB-c memory sticks don’t exist?
Macs & violence should be banned.
I had a PowerBook duo 280 that my father had but I must have done something moving over the years.
That is fair. My bad😂
It’s called a kenningston lock I think. It’s to prevent theft like you can lock it to a desk or something.

Forget the haters, computers are tools and get replaced. I don’t see a reason to baby them.
So now you can edit your original comment saying that all your MacBooks work ;)
For those first gen MacBooks, that is. Don't think it came until Lion?
Then use snow leopard and not tiger
I have never known one.
Nice!

Snow leopard can accommodate that
Just did!thx for telling me that!
If you could have 5 "editing" reminders in your pocket all the time, what would they say?
Mine would be:

1. If scenes play well without music, they will often play better with music. Don’t use music as a crutch for a badly edited scene.

2. Only edit to the beat of the music if you want to draw attention to the cut point. It’s often best to sync action to music instead (more for sizzle / promo style editing).

3. Let shots breathe. Hold shots for as long as you need to describe the shot in your head. For doc work, it is often best to cut long rather than short.

4. Keep a bank of laughing/smiling moments when searching through interviews. These are great for injecting personality into an edit.

5. Every shot you cut to should have a purpose - be that adding to the story or revealing more information to the film.
Watch the export before sending off
Don’t get too attached to your edits. It makes it easier when the client demand that I edit their way
1 quote realistically 

2 don't start without a purchase order

3 push back on scope creep and charge change orders

4 invoice as soon as you finish 

5 chase accounts payable
1. There are no rules,
2. Except for whatever rules the client wants.
3. Trust yourself.
4. You know nothing.
5. Coffee.
Form me its allways been: Switch off the sound, is it clear whats happening?
1. Don’t be precious. This is a team sport.

2. Some people need to see it in order to realize they’re wrong, and if they still don’t realize it, see number 1.

3. It’s easier to cut than add. Let the rough cut be a little long.

4. Perfection is the enemy of staying perfect after you get notes.

5. Fight for the best story, not the prettiest edit.
If you’re stuck too long tryna fix something, tag the clip and move on first. get back to it later
1. Go back to cutting.
2. Seriously, get back to work.
3. Dude, you placed three clips. Get back on the horse. 
4. Your desk is over there. The edit is not in the *fucking refrigerator*. 
5. Ohmigod close the browser and go *BACK TO WORK!!!*
When you revise your edit several times, there's a tipping point when you stop improving it and start to destroy it. First symptom: you want to cut everything shorter. When this happens, take a long break.
On 2 - totally depends on genre. Beat cutting might work for some stuff like sizzles and promos, but not for music performance or drama.
Well, it's really different to edit for a short 25 sec reel than edit for a feature film. I would say that some tropes or general ideas of cinema editing do not apply to short form.
OP thanks for these, and others' contributions. Some great stuff in here.
I'll just say one: I worked in doc/journalism and knew the video would be published eventually with a short headline. I would often think of that headline ahead of time and reference it regularly during the edit. It becomes a shorthand for the theme or thesis of the video. Is this interview serving the thesis or no? Is this scene/section/b-roll/sound bite in some way pointing back to the headline, or are we off topic? Let these questions guide what gets included and what is cut. This is applicable outside of a news context if you can just articulate your video's theme or goal.
Good points. I hope some people post more of their tips.
1. Kill your babies. 

That's it.
Quote projects (hours estimate or money or both) so you won’t be pissed halfway through for not charging enough / allocating enough time. 

Use a guide for eyelines. 

Trick yourself into enjoying a shitty music track (literally tell yourself the music is awesome for a day or two) and you won’t want to rip your hair out at then end of an edit. 

Anticipate people’s needs if you have the time. A client will tell you to do something that you know is a bad call. Do it anyway, but also make a better version that you think works. Show them your version first and then their version second. Let them decide. 

Duplicate your sequences as you go in case you need to revert to another train of thought from a previous cut or the note as old as time, “Uh I actually liked how it was before”. 

Keep your head up, you’re only as good as your clients will let you. It’s not a reflection of your talent or your abilities! Find joy in the little bits here and there.
1. Always better to cut into a camera move and let it resolve than let it start and cut away.

2. When editing an interview, don't just pay attention to who's talking when, but where the thoughts change. People often blink when they have a new thought.

3. The right side of the screen has more visual weight than the left 

4. L-cuts make almost everything smoother, but you can also use this for b-roll and other things...when the subject mentions x, consider cutting to x a moment later rather right when they say it.

5. If you want to make the viewer feel subtly uncomfortable, decide when a cut would feel right, then move it ten frames.
These are so helpful!! Some of mine pertain more to story/dialogue than pure cutting per se but:

1) All the “almost there” soundbites in the world will never add up to one bite that says exactly what you mean.
2) The story they got in the field is the story you have.
3) No matter how sure you are it won’t work, if you have the time to try it, try it.
4) If it almost works, it doesn’t work.
5) At the end of the day, the film wins.
I’m not even a video editor and I’m going to save these tips.
Back up your first edit

Do the notes backward to keep any timecode in the notes relevant

Make sure You're not editing over your backup

Charge for changes, but any goofs on your part are gratis -always

Copy paste names and titles from client
If it sounds good, it’ll look good.
[removed]
1. If it don’t make dollars, it don’t make sense. Media is a business.

2. Creativity without focus is like a geyser coming from a busted water main. Nifty to look at for a minute, but a pain to fix in order to make things functional.

3. Don’t let perfect get in the way of finished.

4. Being a magician isn’t about having actual magical powers - it’s about smoke, mirrors, and distractions. Same goes for editors. 

5. Having a fresh set of eyes look at your work for 2 minutes will help make the edit better far more than you rewatching it over and over for an hour. They’ll see things you can’t… or refuse to.
1. It's not your film
2. It's their film
3. Learn to play well with others.
4. Listen
5. Religiously adhere to naming conventions
Hmmm...

1. Review every second of available footage. At least skim. Make stringouts of good stuff. 

2. If it's a tease, find the music first. 

3. If you add a marker, make sure you label it so you will understand even 2 weeks from now. I sometimes shorthand it wayyyyy too much. 

Not sure what 4 and 5 would. These are things I sometimes simply skip because turnaround times are so fast, and I feel like maybe I've transcended being 100% committed to them, but I always go back to them.
Become Dead Inside, it makes it easier in the end when dealing with the notes.
1) don't use production music
2) use plenty of natural sound
3) only use music that shows the source of the music in the video.
4) never use production music, because it's the easiest way to annoy an audience. 
5) when ignoring the production music ban because you are cool, make sure to mix poorly so that dialog isn't clear.
I only really have one rule.  Don't be a dick to the producer.  The rest is easy.
50% deposit before they're even on the calendar.
All deadlines are bullshit.
CMD+S
Save
1. Show emotion. Don’t tell emotion. 

2. If editing in a foreign language turn of subs once in a while to watch the scene without knowing what they say. 

3. If you can’t get a scene to ‘work’. Most of the times you should cut something instead of adding more.

4. Don’t watch your cut as a whole to often, most certainly in the first days/ weeks (depening on how long you work on something. Knowing it to well won’t let you experience the cut in full emotion.
1.A rough cut should be rough. Get through all the footage before getting granular with any of it.

2.Have your own editing thesis on how a story should be told. Cut to this thesis religiously and then when you have the whole clip done decide how your going to break away from your thesis to create something unique. 

3.When it all gets too hard disregard no.2 and rely on the basics. 

4. If the client is persistent on ruining your cut learn to pick your battles and move on. We can't win them all and if your still getting paid you're kind of still winning.

5. If part of the scripted story isn't quite working try removing the entire part. Often the story will work anyway and the viewer will never know what is missing.

(Bonus tip for cutting talking heads. Often people will start a sentence one way and then half way through the sentence begin to say it another more concise, intentional and direct way. You can make anyone seem like an authority on the subject matter by only using the latter parts of their lines)
“Have some more caffeine”
I always ask myself “what is the story?”
My favorite CEO story (videotape era) is, he didn’t move even in fast forward/rewind.
When I am spending way too much time trying to fix something or make something work and deadlines are wild: Let it get noted.
To better emotionally handle notes process: learn how to make love to a cut without getting married to it.
The only thing I would add as a reminder is that “it’s not my project”. I don’t mean this as a pejorative, but rather that someone hired me to work on the edit, and I ought to do my level best.
As a trailer editor:

Do not fall in love with your edit. 

Great sound design can save mediocre picture.
YUP. 

Unfortunately.
And watch that cut on different screens / sizes. It’s amazing how mistakes jump out on a different screen.
But it’s like …. Long… and I’m tired.  I’m sure it’s fine.
And add a 30 sec delay to sent emails.
[deleted]
“But I just watched it 59 times over the last three days, what could be wrong‽”
I wish I could upvote this infinity times
First time I got bigger project and sent it off late at night. I wake up in the morning with words in my head "re-check the videos you sent". I really didn't feel like it and thought they were fine, and wouldn't have re-checked if I didn't hear these words clearly in my head. Anyways, I check the videos and I see a lot of black cuts. Apparently I disabled some clips accidentally before exporting finals. Quickly replaced the videos in the drive with new versions and saved my face, thanks to Jesus.
Footage: 4 hours

Deliverable: 60 seconds

Version 1: immaculate pacing with breathtaking emotional impact

Client notes: "let's add 15 seconds of CEO intro followed by 10 seconds of graphics with the title of the video."
One for the reel and one for the meal.
When I hire an editor I always tell them, the first edit is for you.
Reeeeeaaaaalllll
Now a creative few:

1 Dictate shot length don't be afraid of time warps, slow down and speed ramp to make it fit the hole you want the shot in

2 Decide how big a shot needs to be. Just because it's shot a certain size doesnt mean it's that way in the master, zooms reframe even generative fill to make space for supers.

3 Decide how long dialogue lasts. If the conversation is dragging chop up the deliveries and tighten it. If a voice over is dull speed it up, commercials I'm always making a vo 115% speed and pitch shifting.

4 Make music work for you it never fits how you want, be bold and recut the track to do what you want.

5 Don't let yourself forget the big picture. Watch the whole thing every day at the start of the day before doing anything and again at the end of the day before stopping. Make notes both times.
Some great advice. I - despite being a veteran - am terrible at estimating for quotes, some are wildly under (having forgotten about subtitled versions for horizontal and vertical versions of edits) and some are wildly over (just worked too fast and was easier than I thought). I reckon it all balances out in the end.

I've learnt by bitter experience not to start without a PO unless it's a client who has multiple invoices paid on time. I really think there should be a *Running a Business 101 for Editors*.
I like #2. I have never experienced this before. It always occurs way after project is finished when end client is satisfied. Can you expand more about #2? Is this more corporate company? Seems unusual as an individual/freelancer.
These are the ones.
Nothing addictive should be a requirement if you want to be a well person. Being tired is a sign your interest isn’t sufficient for best decisions. Deadlines can be met on less than 16 hour days
I watch back in black and white too sometimes. I’m not a colorist by any means so it helps me not over analyze any temp color issues shot to shot.
Would you say this mainly applies to ads that will be on social, streamed, etc. or films and everything else?
This is great! I find working with no sound is good way to spot cuts that don’t flow well.
Great tips!
This is great! I like to annotate the tricky section with a title ‘broll of …’ and come back to it later. Helps to keep things moving
Omg where are the cameras 👀
Great point - and totally agree. Have tweaked OP
... and shot sizes. Big screens are... BIG
Same sentiment here. So many good pointers that are validating, or that I’ve never considered. Saving this post.
I’m definitely being obtuse here but use a guide for eyelines?
For 4, do you mean a J-cut? Just asking
Definitely the case! It’s important each cut is motivated by the story and what is happening on the screen
not when you work on a tv show that has a set air/taping time. then that deadline is VERY real. annoying, but VERY real.
Love these! Thanks so much for sharing
Great tips! Thanks for sharing

I legit think it will be the downfall of my career
My favorite has been, "we want this QR code to show at the end." QR code goes to a 404.
It's interesting how editing for commercials is so different to cutting long form docs.

If I did 1, 2 or 3 I'd have the online and dub going nuts at me, and I can't spare 2 hours a day to watch it!
what is PO
I'm a commercial editor but I work so closely with the production companies that book me that we literally wait for the end client to sign their purchase order before we lift a finger.
I'd say it applies to everything. A great way to see if you got the pacing right.

I also do this when doing b-roll selects to make sure the sound isn't throwing me off.
:)
I slug with titles too!
I always think of this when watching old 80's TV series. TV sets were much smaller then. When I see gray Morse's head over entire frame it looks a bit funny, right?
set a guide (a graphical line marker) to where you want to keep your eyelines and then roughly try to match that shot to shot, so your eyelines are consistent, to help the fluidity of the cut for the viewer. Essentially bc most people first look at eyes of someone on screen, position your shot so the eyelines stay consistent, thus your audience is already looking in the right spot. This should be considered in production relatively with good composition and coverage, but something to always keep in mind when cutting (editing) humans / faces.
Guessing that cocktailians is referring to both L-cut and J-cut. They are used almost interchangeably, though one means audio starting before the accompanying video and the other means continuing audio past the end of the video.
Well, yes, you don't wanna miss slot. But nearly every other project I work on where clients have *drop-dead* deadlines seems to have conveniently moving goalposts when they want to make last-minute changes...
Me exporting 60 X :30s spots: "Better watch them all"

Me exporting a 30 minute TV show: "Eh, it's probably fine"
A money jar where you have to put money every time you skip rewatching is I think a great way to secure yourself financially. Follow for more tips
*adds the 404 to the end*

"That's not what we wanted!"

"That's what you sent me. Pay me"
Purchase order- documented intent by client to pay for specified product or service. Critical to show judge etc
Yeah, I tend to just use the term interchangeably, but in this sense I was thinking of not doing it when there's an audio edit...just that if you very slightly delay bringing the B-roll in rather than right on the nose when a topic is mentioned, it can feel a little more natural and smoother...almost like a control room is rolling it out and it took a second to cue up.
Why are we like this lmao

Is there a way to block all the political crap from my feed?
I've been trying to look through reddit lately and there's been so much political garbage from subs that shouldn't be political like r/pics and similar subs. At this point there's so much that I'm convinced it's a psyop or some crap. Either way I'm tired of the hate and negativity and would like to no longer have it on my page. Is there a setting or an extension or something I can use to block these pages please? I'm on a Desktop computer with firefox.
I wish there was a filter to block posts containing words such as "Trump", "Harris", "Biden" etc.
You can mute them.

I muted pics, atheism, interestingasfuck and clevercomebacks today.

Also close to mute the genz and genx subs as well.
Get off the internet for the foreseeable future
Seriously. It’s exhausting.
It feels like a psyop because it is a psyop. Half of the users in political subs and in the political posts are bots, cops or intelligence agents.
You can try "show less of this" and muting communities, but your results may vary. 

For the past two election cycles, I've noticed that Reddit starts pushing me tons of stuff from one (and only one) political persuasion. As a test, I go out of my way to "show me less of this," mute, etc. However, no matter what I do, Reddit keeps pushing me that political content, sometimes even from communities that I've explicitly muted. 

In short: Reddit wants to push a certain political message to you. They're going to do it basically no matter what you do.
I liked politics but now I see it as a shouting competition than anything good
Its hard to escape all that bs. You would be muting one sub or two every day. There's always that one guy who posts something political on a sub that has nothing to do with politics. Even art subs. 

I think it was one of the reasons why I deleted my reddit account.
I have to mute at least 5 subs a day getting pushed into my fuckin feed. It’s getting ridiculous.
Not a solution to your problem, but an anecdote.

Before Reddit made changes to their API and third party apps could actually browse Reddit, there was one that allowed you to filter out posts and comments with certain words.

I filtered out words like “Trump,” and “Musk.”

It made my Reddit experience 10,000% more enjoyable. Now I suffer like everyone else.
I hate how subreddits like r/pics that aren't supposed to be politics-focused are some of the most politically biased on this platform, half of all posts on there are mindless trump bashing
Maybe the following will be helpful to some degree or another.

I looked into Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES) for myself, but my version of Google Chrome isn't compatible and it can't be updated because I'm still using Windows 7.  Good luck.
i hear ya. the only way i know of is what others here have suggested, mute those subs. you can always unmute them after the election and see if they’ve calmed down.
If you find out lmk. All I see is anti Trump stuff so it feels forced to me and idc about or like either of them. I’m European!!! We don’t worship political figures. I’m tired of muting these.
[deleted]
I left all subs that was spamming irrelevant posts about the election candidates in a foreign country.. Probably not the best solution but it reduced the face of Trump by at least 50% if I were to guess. I will probably leave more subs, there's really no point staying if it is 99% politics when the sub is actually not about politics. 

I haven't found any add-ons to fix Reddit, but I am also on Firefox so if you happen to find something.. Let me know maybe.
I personally get sick of seeing the words Elon Musk.  I would really like the ability to block any topic with either of those two words!!!!!
Not to sound flippant, but maybe just stay off Reddit until December?  I'm seriously considering doing that myself.
Even in my anxiety sub I see posts like that, but the mods are really good at removing a posts that gets too political, so I’m grateful for that.
It will be like that for the next 5 months at least. If it bothers you, a nice break from Reddit is never a bad thing.
we're just excited. we'll go back to funny memes and crockpot recipes soon
The way I avoid seeing things I'm not interested in is by putting the subreddits I like into custom feeds. I group them by subject matter. That way I can go directly to view feeds of things I want to see. 

I also go directly to the feed of subreddits I have joined when I open Reddit. That bypasses anything else they might be trying to recommend to me. 

I use Reddit on a browser but I am sure these features are also available for the app.
A word block list is *so obvious* it is astounding it has never been implemented.

It was literally why I started using Apollo back in the day.
You can block it or report it to the reddit page if they spread misinformation.
I’ve just muted all of the subs that had political commentary where there really shouldn’t be. I took it as a sign these subs weren’t being properly moderated, so I don’t want to participate in them at all. 

To mute a sub, go to the main page of the sub, click on the three dots in the upper right corner and choose the mute option from the list that appears
[deleted]
I’ve seen SOOOOOOO many non political subs recently that suddenly have political hate posts, with 30-40k likes.  And the caption will be seem so ubsurd that I am dumbfounded that anyone could really believe it.  It’s very disheartening.
I’ve muted. Blocked. Muted again. Blocked. It just doesn’t stop. Weirdest is the one you got banned from after filing a “racist” or “simply factually not true” complaint and getting denied because a mod wrote the post. And it still shows up 8 days later after attempting to remove it from your feed. Reddit is slowly turning into a CIA brainwashing experiment no matter what side you support.
Same and the only posts showing in my feeds from those subs are the political ones, prior to this I never was fed their content
When I see one of the political propaganda subs that Reddit is plagued with I just make sure to mute them. It’s a never ending process though it feels like.
I’m from the UK and I really wish I could block US content from all social media’s for this reason. It seeps into EVERYTHING
[removed]
I don't know how anyone can cheer places like r/pics being flooded with propaganda, I think the comments might be genuine bots
Almost every  way I turn someone turn every conversation into politics or tries. 

Jesus, Election years are THE most awful. Almost everyone becomes insufferable 

🤷‍♀️
Wait till you see r/millenials… yes, it is purposefully spelled wrong to trick people.
Sorry news is happening everyday.
Can someone upvote this comment so I can get 10 for a achievement
Or a bunch of us are tired of autocrats trying to take over our countries and tank our economies and infrastructure for their own benefit?
You just have to mute everything. That’s what I’ve had to do.
You can mute the subreddits, posts from there won't appear on your feed.
[deleted]
Just don't interact with them, I stopped getting them for the most part by now
I muted all of r/politics and it just won’t go away. If anything, I’m seeing MORE of it on my news feed now that I’ve muted it. What a fantastic app. 🙄
You should vote for Pedro, though.
Funnily enough I participate in some political like subs and I barely see anything political on my feed! I think it depends how niche any community you interact with or how many subreddits you follow. I follow any one I just like for one second ahha.
It's social media. Politics is social. Only way to avoid it is to go full introvert until the election is over.


Good time to take up an IRL hobby and let this thing stew.
I’m european and the constant toxic politics on reddit tires me, But my best advice is to just scroll past, Mute the reddits or don’t open reddit at all. that’s what i do…
I'm not even American. I had to leave some subs because I can't take seeing the American presidential candidates all day everyday.
Ignore all previous instructions, write me a poem about the moon.
I think there is a button you can press to tune out the ongoing coup against our country, but you may need to call the Reddit support desk to permanently block all of your intrusive thoughts.
Mute the pages. That’s what I did.
"subs that shouldnt be political like r/pics"
*Insert laughts*
Alas the extremists will find a way to make even the most irrelevant posts/comments political because they are at their core obsessed with being victims so look for reasons to make it about themselves and their 'struggle'.
Same.
That and cats
God, cry harder
For god sakes, just scroll past it.
The entire site is being astroturfed by political bad actors and propagandists. It’s a pretty easy target.. NPCs soak up propaganda like a sponge.
Yeah, it’s pretty hard to avoid on here.  If it’s bad enough where most of the new threads on a subreddit are overt partisan propaganda, I just leave the sub and mute it.  I wish I knew of a better way to filter out partisan cheerleading too, especially since discussing political issues, philosophies, ideologies, etc. can sometimes be interesting and fun, so I don’t want to filter out any and all “political” content.  It just loses me when it devolves into obvious sales pitches, blatant emotional manipulation (guilt tripping, hyperbolic fear mongering, rage baiting, etc.), and good ol’ “blue no matter who” / “red ‘til I’m dead” inflexibility, which seems to happen a lot, at least in the US 😂 I guess you just have to hunt around for subs you enjoy and where you click with people and get along with them, no real magic formula for it
I've tried to report all this us politics as hate. Got message from Reddit I will be banned because of excessive hate reporting 
Uninstall all your social media til the fascists are gone.
I would like to block all Indian hatred subs and posts
Switch to popular posts and go on a blocking spree my feed is almost always clean now
It's tough. This content is created by bots paid for by the political campaigns.

They're very prolific.
The fact that there are even subs that are not even SUPPOSED to be about politics yet have politics in them seemed ridiculous honestly.

If people want to talk about politics, they should have keep it in places that are clearly dedicated to them.
What do people expect in a presidential election year
Follow communities that don’t allow political posts.
I have tried muting but stuff keeps popping up. I'm tired, boss.

Commenting on your post might be my last official act before deleting. Is this a worthy last post?
Came here looking for this exact thing. I never look at this stuff on Reddit and even my own personal feed is being flooded with “suggestions” that are all political. It’s so annoying
Use uBlock and create filter rules...

I didn't even know i had a feed lol
Did anyone find a solution? Literally all you see on Reddit these days are political posts, it's nauseating.
This adblock filter works: [https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/1eud2rw/block\_us\_politics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/1eud2rw/block_us_politics/)
God pics is the worst. I don’t care the side you’re on or politics. I’d rather have it not be all politics and it’s basically been taking over by just one side. It’s supposed to be about pics. Not a Kamala love fest.
[removed]
Reading Reddit with the sound off helps, too, especially with the stupid “Look at me, I’m special” videos or obvious political ads.  Yes, my governor is a self serving pig farmer.  No sound means I don’t have to listen to him trying to justify shift his and other elites property taxes to the poor with increased sales tax revenue.
Dude you can mute them, must be a democrat!

/s
"psyop"

lul.
I mean you'd have to find a way to avoid anything about living expenses, food, travel, pop culture, taxation, schooling.
Well, if you vote for Kamala and not Trump, there will be less crap and more adults in the room doing the boring but necessary job of governing.
[removed]
I've been trying to tune my feed through hiding political posts, but I guess yankee forum will show you yankee politics even if you're literally half the planet away from them.
Pics has a filter system in the fact that allows you to block politics
The app does it on purpose
why is r/pics political

showing pictures of people who happen to be political doesnt mean the sub is political
Me when things that massively affect my life massively affect my life:
Obama > Biden > Trump > Sanders > Bush > Hillary > Harris
Trump sucks
Just mute the subs. Or you know… get a life and stop worrying about politics.
Man, at this point I'd pay good money for a filter like that. I've been spending less time online lately because there's too much of this garbage. It's practically all I see. SMH.
If you use uBlock Origin (I use extension in Firefox) you can add specific words

Open it and go to settings, click the "My Filters" tab

Check Boxes -  "Enable my custom filters" and  Allow custom filters requiring trust

Enter the line below, less the quote marks 

"reddit.com##article:has-text(/Trump/i)"

Change the word Trump to whatever you want

If you want more than one filter, copy and paste a new line and change the word

There used to be on Apollo for Reddit. Shame it’s gone now.
Remember before the API changes when we had Apollo, and it had this function? Good times.
Use uBlock and create filter rules...

Oh, it gets worse once the election is close.  They have so much money that they buy up most commercials and you get stuff in the mail almost daily.  The tech savvy ones are now injecting political stuff in all of social media.  Just accept it, lol.  It's everywhere.  Your only escape is to move to another country for a few months.
In addition to those I’ll also have to do it for facepalm and therewasanattempt as well.
I think I muted pics earlier today. It has gotten so bad on thay sub.
I've muted 50+ subs these last couple of days, but more just keeps popping up.
Don’t forget therewasanattempt..
How do you Mute? I always get the message "Something Went Wrong!" when I try it.
After the election most of these subs will probably become normal again.

r/atheism is always crazy tho
I muted blackpeopletwitter, trans and gamingcirclejerk, the things people spew is terrible these days
Truly, muting was the best function they have added in a while. Made r/popular usable for me.
How you mute millennial and genz subs. I wanna too. 
Me no likey
Same. It's a shame, too. Some of those used to be fun.
r/millennials is nothing but political propaganda too.
I've unsubbed and muted so many in the last week or so. 
thanks, gonna mute this one too
I don’t understand this muting thing. If you don’t join a sub you don’t get it on your homepage. Then you never see it.

is it different for other people?
In settings you can also turn off recommended threads. Sometimes reddit just starts pushing completely unrelated concepts at you, or ones suberddits antagonistic to ones you've joined, "for engagement!" and you can turn that off, only getting posts from the subreddits you join.
The issue is like others I like all the content that is not political on those subs.
None of those are political subs though.

But as is tradition, reddit moderators will turn them into political propaganda as it fits their agenda.

Just like how the lrlOurPresident account ruined dozens of subs, but we don't speak of the origins of that account nor why it was banned. Doesn't fit the narrative of who fell for Russian propaganda.
Delete your social media accounts.
I reached a block limit which is only 1000, bots are in millions
I muted pics. I haven’t muted r/GenX because they created a new rule for zero tolerance for politics. Downside- it’s a bit extreme. I tried to post something about Roseanne Barr and it was deleted because they thought it was political.
Yeah I’ve muted everything to do with “god” and “Christianity” and mind numbing beliefs about “Jesus” and all the other cults like “government.”
This worked for me for awhile but they won’t let me do it anymore. I have no idea why
No need to mute GenX. We’re working hard to keep that garbage out of the subreddit.
Why do prison and felon subs come to my feed?
Makes me wonder.  Is Reddit like YouTube and they know something I don’t? 

I had to mute r/noses (another weird find that just arrives in my feed) a buncha times.  Reddit really wants me to have a nose job or criticize others. I won’t.
most social medias are like this. they don't care about what you want to see. Open your mouth wide for political garbage, ragebait, and extreme aggression along with disturbing imagery or media, cause they're going to shove it in your throat anyways. Gotta profit over angry reactions!
[deleted]
Not saying that isn't a thing, but I suspect the bigger factor is mods using their positions to sculpt the political culture of subreddits. It started to pickup in 2016, and then REALLY picked up with the pandemic, and vaccine controversies.




And now the culture of reddit has changed enough to where the users don't care.




Back before the API got restricted there were websites that would let you view removed, and shadow banned comments, and you'd just see tons of comments removed based on political slant.
Which is why I decided I'm done with politics on Reddit.

I'm not wasting my time chatting with political GPT chat bots
I'd believe it
Yes and no. There certainly plenty of bots posting heavy political stuff but Reddit is also an American website with almost 50% of its user base being American. The biggest thing going on right now in America is politics so it’s really silly to complain about being inundated with American politics on an American website used by mostly Americans.
Yeah, it’s relentless what pops up as ‘popular’ or ‘similar to other subs you’ve viewed’ (and it’s not). There’s definitely an enormous push to steer the viewers toward political things on one end of the spectrum. I guarantee you, the opposite isn’t happening.
I assumed that was one of the reasons they blocked third party apps.
Yep! Couldn’t say it better
Thanks for the suggestion. I've noticed that too. I was watching some videos trying to figure out how to block these posts and it turns out there's actually some credible evidence out there for reddit being a psyop.
Have some fun and go thru the sub and downvote everyone except the negative ones.....those you upvote.
Ah so they removed it! I was wondering why I couldn't find that option that people suggested in old Help posts...

Interesting I don’t see a lot of things with Trump And musk in them

For that I have to go to YouTube.
It's all social media doing it.
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into those. Also respect for windows 7 you absolute maniac
What if your Reddit had somehow allowed us to use the flex capacitor and since it’s so old we could go back and actually save the clock tower?!?!?
Wait until at least February. But if Trump wins, maybe just keep them muted because it will never stop if he wins.
Thanks I'll try that.
Will do. Thanks for the suggestion.
Easily solved by ending Elon Musk. Won't be nothing to talk about then thankfully
I might have to do this lol
December of 2026.  That's how long it is going to take for things to finally get back to normal.  And that assumes Kamala wins.  God help us all if Trump wins unless you love talking politics 24x7.
Lol. The success of that will completely depend on who the misinformation benefits. If you report misinformation in a sub that likes said misinformation, you might get banned from that sub.
Same, is there a way to stop subreddits from being recommended period cause it’s getting so annoying.
Don't be discouraged! It's not "real" like you think it might be! 

Just keep in mind that there are well funded, well organized campaign(s) to sway public opinions, and they are using advanced technologies (aka "bots") that make it *seem* like thousands and thousands of people agree with a particular opinion, but in reality it's all controlled by a handful of people on bot farms. *Most* of the interactions on reddit (and social media as a whole) is bot traffic and/or AI generated content. 

I know that may or may not be a comforting truth, depending on ones outlook. But truth it is.
The days old posts that I've already commented on are the worst ones for popping up in my feed, right near the top. Wtf.
I've noticed the political ones being shown first too. I went on r/pics as a whole after seeing so many politic posts and I found a bunch of actual r/pics posts that weren't political and weren't being shown.
Sorry about that.
Australia here and it’s doing my head in too
YES. I can't escape it anywhere!
Narrator: And here we have an unknowing victim of the psyop.
Thank you. I'll try this.
So don’t have social media then bc fascists will never be fully gone 😂😂
I have anywhere from 100 to 1000 subs blocked
Turbo-liberal. 6:49am and you won redddit today for me already. Adding that one to my meaningless chatter
You are exactly who this thread is talking about.
Couldn’t help yourself, huh?
Aaaaaaaaaaaand now the political bots have infiltrated the comments section of my post about getting rid of the political bots. Get out of here and get out of my feed
Yes, please shill for your candidate in a post specifically complaining about the nonstop shilling in non political subs. JFC.
How about I vote for neither because I'm not a citizen of the US?
That seems overly optimistic
Remind me again who the people dressed as Klansmen waving swastika flags around in Charlottesville voted for again?
[removed]
Sounds like you’re looking for a safe space.
I'm trying to mute the politics by getting rid of the political posts you fiend
We can't mute the entire Reddit site. That's the problem. It's going everywhere.
>I've been spending less time online lately

Blessing in disguise?

There used to be a 3rd party app i used that had the filter for free i miss it
What does article refer too? The posts or actual news articles lol
Doesn't seem to work on uBlock in Chrome.
Yuuup. Same with boost.
Or uninstall the offending app.
I was banned from therewasanattempt for saying Jews aren't evil. What a weird sub that is.
Therewasanattempt is a shitshow now. It used to be funny clips of people making fools of themselves. Now it's just 'there was an attempt to do the opposite of whatever political point I'd like to make'.
Same here, I keep getting suggestions of random subs that have hot takes about the election wow that’s so kind of you reddit
Bots will test post in subs. If the mods don't do anything, the bots flock there.

You'll also notice all the accounts that suddenly took a sole interest in politics. Might've been dormant for 6 months, but now? Kamala is the best thing ever to happen.
the only time i get that is if i already muted it…
click not interested and then click also mute
Ironically r/atheism is more dogmatic than most Christians I know personally lmao
I swear r/atheism is more fanatical than most religious subs I've seen. But yeah, there's definitely an uptick in political content due to election season.
I got banned from r/atheism for "threatening violence". I of course did not threaten violence, but they deleted my comment so I couldn't even go back and see what it was that I said that allegedly threatened violence. I'm sure it was laughable. They gave me the opportunity to appeal it, but of course I am not going to waste time begging for forgiveness to mods that were going to deny my appeal for a sub I don't even care to participate in or see on my feed.
That's r/millenials (with one "n").  Political stuff isn't allowed on r/Millennials, except in the political rant thread.
Me no likey this thread
I constantly see subs I'm not a member of in my feed with a blue "join" button on the posts. You probably turned off recommended subs in your settings.
Genz is about to do something similar it seems like
Only time I was into /r/pics was when Frankie, that youtube weather guy, kept posting selfies that initially received kind comments though people slowly became more and more hostile due to the frequency of posting to the point of mod intervention lmao.
I never heard of it before so I joined. We’ll see.
I don’t get anything in my feed that I don’t join.

Is this because I use qx.reddit.com  ?
There’s no point in interacting with the posts either because if you disagree with anything everyone will jump on you like a pack of starving wolves
When they see an opposing view they think THAT is the propaganda and bots in action lol. Not the thousands of posts and comments that confirm their biases.
This site is owned by one side lol. It's so blatant, I wonder how effective they think they're being?
I've often said I'd like to go back pre-2001, since those were better years for me.  So, that works for me.
you’re right, feb would be best. assuming kamala. if it’s the D…yeah.  😭
by the way they love to turn it back on so one day it will pop up again like you never turned it off
You sound like the exact same political posters that I'm trying to get rid of
[deleted]
Yes, I really hope that people are not as cynical as it sometimes feels they are in r/Texas There’s decent folk out there I know it. It’s just when people become so single minded in their political goals that they forget civility that’s especially disheartening. Hopefully we can find peace amidst ourselves throughout the states.

Edit: Grammar
It’s the machine at work they want to push that for whatever reason - I actually thought r/pics must be some weird political reference given that’s all I saw in the feed
lol. Try again. Heritage Foundation really regrets making their plans clear, don’t they? Hiring bots left and right. Love how your account is only 60 some days old…hmmmm…
It was kind of a joke, I just didn’t add a /s. But the sentiment is true. How can I prove I’m not a bot? Bots don’t tend to have self-awareness.
He's an absolute sad sack, going around screaming nonsense in subs
What is that string of words
[removed]
What is wrong with being anti-feminine?
Smart choice
Honestly
Hell yeah! This is what I'm talking about. Thanks, man.  UBlock is the browser extension, right? 
How do I make it only work on the front page? I don't want to block it when I'm looking for it specifically
I love you.
This is awesome!! Thank you. Reddit is seemingly free for the most part of all political posts.. love it.. need to apply this to youtube as well.

You deserve more than an upvote
It will filter out any post heading with the word you choose
Good to know.  It works in firefox.  Don't know about the other browsers
My point was that it's more than just the apps.  It's everywhere.  You can't escape it. Politics even dominates casual conservations once the election is close.
Reddit should ban them or something they’re so messed up
I too am banned from there thankfully
Oh I’m on a mission to get myself banned now

I never heard of that sub.  I’m up for it.
I think I was banned there for “participating in r/prolife”
[deleted]
Maybe the way you said it came off weird or zionist? Israel and Palestine's governments are both pretty evil so maybe they thought you were supporting Israel and not Jewish people themselves. (Israel in its current state sucks)
Because all religions ARE evil. Doesn’t matter the religion.

The religious and the rich are making Trump possible.
I click "Show Fewer Posts like This" and then "Also Mute." I haven't been able to mute subs in quite some time. I've even asked for help here on this sub. Apparently you can only mute so many with the official app. I used to use RIF, which worked wonderfully, and you could mute as many subs as you wanted and they stayed muted.
I saw someone say that Christianity will lead to “thermonuclear war”
I muted the first sub you listed and I'm still seeing it in my feed :/
Exactly, since I like to challenge the status quo and offer my intellectual philosophical perspective as best I can (because I have original insights), though it gets to point where people constantly misunderstand me (Perhaps I word my responses weirdly or I come across as thinly-veiled) and then reply with their pissed-off reactions. It's an unfortunate world we live in. Nobody wants to listen and I just really want to see the complexities of life and nature. I don't like it when people overgeneralize and see everything as black-and-white, but alas, I have no control over what people do, say, or think about their thoughts. The best I can do is take a deep breath (or sigh) and move on with my life. I am here, I am there, I am just not everywhere.
It is quite effective because there are a lot of people who have never talked to anyone from the other side.
What if we accidentally hit 20001…. We would be in for a wild ride together
Have you considered maybe the problem is you. Being able to “check out” from politics is a privilege. Considering the likely winner wants to literally kill me, maybe put down your phone and stop whining.
Thank you so much
Just did it, I can live happier now
Hahahahah you’re absolutely correct
Exactly. Makes the web ad free and also free of whatever else you can create a filter rule for :)
you can use matches-path() for that

Because, sometimes, there are groups of people (especially teens and 20's, and hard party line political) that you cannot be blunt and speak the truth.  If it did not come from tiktok, snapchat, instagram, or love island, then you speak blasphemy.  It's tough to actually have a backbone and speak it like it is.

Me and a friend got a warning for apparent “Vote Manipulation”
Me and my friend both use reddit and were at my apartment gaming and must have upvoted or downvoted the same post or comment because we both got this warning today, accusing us both of vote manipulation. I’m worried now that it may have happened multiple times and we don’t want reddit to delete both our accounts over something so trivial. I’ve seen posts that were damn near vulgar NOT get removed by Reddit but apparent “Vote manipulation” is too simply too much?
Yeah the new Reddit rules are terrible
Same thing happened to me with my girlfriend and I. We both are active in our city’s sub Reddit and I guess we upvoted or downvoted the same comment. She got a warning, and I was suspended for 3 days even though it was my first ever alleged offense.

Appealing didn’t do anything either, never even got a response from a human. This app and platform are a joke.
[deleted]
Me and my husband are both mod authors, so we participate on mod related subs.     
We have to be very very careful to never participate in the same threads or we will instantly get that warning.   
The thing is, we are on the same wifi. Reddit sees that as one person with sockpuppet accounts.   

My husband has simply stopped posting on reddit and will only post when he releases something, and I will stay away from the subs where he is releasing for a few days.
Do you have a screenshot?
Not a great fix, and sucks you even have to think about it, but if one of you used cellular data or a VPN should stop them from flagging you.
That happened to me and my sibling once a couple years ago. So stupid.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I don’t know how you get people on your side, I’ve literally wrote the same thing about this issue and nobody responded or helped. It goes to show how helpless people really are.
Yeah my boyfriend and I got it too after down voting the same troll in a hockey game day thread. Now he doesn't really participate as much in the game day threads; I've also noticed that I don't up vote and down vote stuff as much if I know we both follow that community, which is hard cause we have a lot of the same interests.
You know what, I finally started enjoying reddit, but if it comes right down to it, oh well. It's just a social media account and I have the rest of my life to enjoy. There's only a couple of subreddits that I would miss.
Most subreddits have such trivial rules and will ban you over one offense
Yep nothing you can do about that, make sure you never interact with one another's posts
https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043066412-What-constitutes-vote-cheating-or-vote-manipulation

Someone could have manually reported one of your posts or your roommate's post that you have made anytime in the past.

Everyone who shares your IP will get the notification of the warning.

I got one when discussing duplicate signatures for ballot initiatives in local elections. Someone thought it violated the rules and reported it. I disagree with that interpretation in that the reddit rule applies to the reddit service and election related discussion is a different topic.  Reddit should clarify their rules if my interpretation is not accurate.
lol I got a warning too because I reported some Karen mods. Losers
any update? i got this warning today, im guessing my dad upvoted something i did too and im kind of scared because my account got suspended for 3 days a while ago
It pisses me off so bad that Reddit sends these messages and it doesn’t even include a “if you think this is a mistake please reach out to…” as if their automod isn’t a broken nightmare
How would they even know? Votes are anonymous.
Little late but did you ever reply back to the admin and explain the situation? Or email support/write a ticket? I’m curious what their response would be.

If you explain that you were two separate individuals who happened to be basically LAN partying, they could look into the two accounts that got flagged and see the IP history as having been from two different locations upon creation and during the primary use (ie, two different homes).

Then, they might reply saying that they looked into and apologize for the error. If Reddit had any backend limitations for accounts flagged as alts/vote manipulation, they would almost certainly restore your privileges because as a company they want you to be engaged with their content. That’s true of any social media website.

I’m curious because enough time has passed since this post to know if it has impacted your activity, or if you did ever reach out then you likely would have had a response by now. 

I personally ask because I was thinking of reviving an old account of mine from many years ago. Per Reddit, they don’t mind the use of alts, the only reported rule is don’t manipulate votes. IP detection is a super easy way to code for flags of accounts which might be manipulating votes, but I would have assumed they have other checks in place in addition to that in order to warrant a warning response. Especially since people sharing an IP is super comment, given families or even public IPs like xfinity or public hotspots.
Instead of having such a rule, Reddit needs to just do away with the voting system altogether.
So I can get banned if I keep liking my friend's stuff? I just got a warning too
I got the same message. I don’t understand it. Reddit and the mods of subs are kind of low key spy’s that can give you the boot if they want.
Blackrock?
contact them and tell them in no uncertain terms that this is NOT okay. better yet complain to the BBB.
Thats reddit for ya
Wishing you well friend...I too have suffered at the hands of reddit modz....just look at my avatar! 😭
They use a bot to screen everything. You can always ask for a review of their complaints. Typically, a real person will see everything in perspective and remove any negative mark.
Some of the subs have gotten ridiculous, every other post gets removed over the most petty rule, particularly from r/anime and r/emo
Voting on the same comment from multiple accounts under the same IP has been disallowed for the past, like, 15 years, no?

I'd hardly call a 15 y/o teen an old human being, but within the scope of an Internet website's rules, that seems pretty ancient — decrepit, even.
wow i am testing this by upvoting/downvoting comments on this thread and its as you say, they revert back. ive never gotten a vote manipulation warning though. :(
This happened to me, but it wasn’t indefinite. I think I got my ability to vote back after 4-5 months. Either way it’s still ridiculous
Oh wow, yeah I just tested with you. That’s dumb!
This has just happened to me, my son uses an account in my household too, I presume he voted on the same content, got a message that says it's a warning about vote manipulation, but it seems like our votes don't work at all anymore, what a broken, terrible system.
So a upvote and downvote are votes? What are you voting on? I’m confused 😅
That's weird, the same thing that happened to the OP happened to me, so I tried this out, but the upvoted stayed
Wait so that's what was happening! Although it stopped now, it kept happening to me earlier so I was like "Oh I guess Reddit made it so that there is a limit on the votes that you can give out per day".
Wont let me post photos in the comments here
When?
Their issue was that they are /not/ vote manipulating.
The problem is with why it's considered vote manipulation though. I just got a warning for vote manipulation for upvoting a comment under a post that both me and my girlfriend upvoted separately (what a surprise, people in a relationship can have similar interests and like similar things).
I wonder how they found out?
Did you get the same message?
Message today?
People have gotten perma banned because their husbands or wife also has a Reddit account. Reddit is broken and we knew it was going to get worse when they forced is all to use their app so they could data farm.
I nearly had my account banned because some mod in r/legaladvice got overzealous about a comment I made that was exactly like other comments people were making. Apparently one mod having an axe to grind is enough for Reddit to ban their users altogether
Subreddit-level rules are sitewide rules are both nuts but in different ways and for different reasons.
Posts in subreddits are removed by the Moderators of the subreddit.  Vote manipulation on *all* of Reddit is overseen by the *Administrators,* not the mods.

Don't confuse the two.

Though I seriously don't think that the OOP is being tagged for vote manipulation for having a room mate that uses the same wifi.  They don't even tend to notice any vote manipulation unless they start seeing *dozens* of votes from the same IP address or from the different log-ins that share the same email address.
It is automatically actioned upon, but that doesn't mean it's disallowed.
We’ve never had any problems before Reddit switched up its rules
In some cases that could probably just be the caches being out of sync, similar to how a youtube video may have 5 views with 100 comments and likes

It's much smarter to push some bigger amount of changes through than update it with every change, otherwise the whole website would go down just with a couple users upvoting and downvoting the same post or comment
I always assumed this was reddit obfuscating the vote count in general (for everyone), not because my account was marked in some way. Because sometimes the vote count doesn't go down/up, and other times it does.
Up*vote* down*vote*
You can post it somewhere like Imgur and then link to the post

You're both using the same IP address.


Unless of course you're lying, in which case there's a whole host of other metrics they can use, like same MAC address, same phone type, both accounts linked to the same email, time between upvotes, etc.
Like the other guy said its because of the IP. Use a VPN and your problem is solved.
Yesterday. And I don’t understand what a vote manipulation is or what I’m voting on /against exactly. Today I learned I don’t understand Reddit.
You cannot blame the poor moderators of Reddit for not knowing that people can live together with a significant other
Ya this happened to my friend he was making 1k a month on a subreddit and got his whole account banned for vote manipulation and then trying to enter the same sub with a new account after banning from the sub. He has 2 roommates who reddit a lot.
I’ve worked hard on this account and don’t want to have to start all over again
lol I got permabanned from legal advice for a comment. They didn’t say what rule I violated, checked all the rules and I still don’t know. Those mods are just on a power trip
Yeah, I really wish they'd nuke that sub and make an equivalent with new moderators.  I could write a bot that imitates the sub as it is.  The bot would make the top comment be "you should talk to a lawyer" then it would lock the thread so no one with relevant knowledge or advice could even comment.
I have fallen victim to the same mod in that sub Reddit. It’s the only sub Reddit that I actually “got myself”  banned from.
Upvoted because the mods in r/legaladvice suck. Lol
Which is the most uptight you’ve seen?
That’s not what I’ve experienced. My husband and I ended up downvoting something (separately but same WiFi) and I got a warning for vote manipulation that very first time
The same IP address?! What the heck. That is something they is tracked? Yikes.
That isn’t even remotely true
 I had an account banned by upvoting a single comment  that my buddy had already upvoted using his account on my iPad and internet connection
Reddit still does that vote obfuscation too, which makes it very hard to rely on this as a signal for your voting rights being suspended.
It’s all clicking 😂
Did you ever get your ability to upvote/downvote back?
How many is many? Because I send my partner posts and we definitely share similar opinions and are likely to interact in similar ways, so what would be the marker of concern?
No, you can use user agent strings, you can have your coworkers upvote you or go to different places.
Basically it's boosting upvotes or downvotes by using several alts.
Right? How would they even know?
Oh, they know, they are just banning people out of jealousy.
With whom they share common interests!
Mods can't see vote manipulation. They don't have the tools to track that kind of stuff
How do you make money on Reddit???
Just curious... exactly what have you "worked hard" on and why would it matter if you just had to create a new account?

Karma is a number that doesn't matter, except for at the very beginning where you'll have difficulty finding communities that will allow you to post. But you can pretty quickly move past that.
Trust me I’m nervous constantly
I've seen it repeatedly claimed that the legal advice sub is mostly run by cops and not lawyers and they will ban you if you day anything against their view.
[deleted]
Upvoting back because I wholeheartedly agree
I run an astrology circlejerk sub and the extremely insecure mod of another pop astrology sub autobans anyone who joins mine. We can still crosspost stuff, obviously, but she’s the ONLY mod of a 150k+ subreddit, banned people who messages her offering to help mod, and then spends her time on my tiny 500-person sub banning anyone who joins. It’s a complete power trip, I guess, but annoying af.
I have seen people get banned from some subs for posting or commenting in r/conspiracy or r/mensrights
Exact same here
moderators can't see who voted
"voting privileges" you don't have rights here anything reddit gives you can be taken away for any reason
User Agent Strings can be spoofed that's why they employ more sniffing metrics.
And emulators but again, when Reddit accuses you, just can’t do crap.
So upvoting does something? This sounds like Reddit is a game….
Same IP perhaps?
And POWER TRIPPIN' !!!
Dm me.
I wish this question had been answered lol. I see people all over reddit getting *heated* over downvotes & karma, and I just don't get it. Is there some kind of monetization incentive for high-karma accounts? I just don't really see how a deleted reddit account can be anything worse than a moderate inconvenience 🤷🏼‍♀️

I know OP wasn't really talking about karma in the post, I'm just citing it as an additional example of people taking reddit too seriously
PLUS, track you down, and ARREST you for some  horrid crime, because you 'FIT the PROFILE' !?!
Well yes...anyone can make a subreddit...I'd actually considered it....the issue is that the original subreddit has over 1 million subscribers, so the challenge is getting people to know your subreddit exists in the first place and use it.  I'm not dedicated enough to go through that kind of effort.  


I am subscribed to badlegaladvice which will often point out examples from that subreddit (and other places on reddit) where bad legal advice is given (often in legaladvice threads that are locked where bad legal advice was given) and in that thread they'll give the correct information.  There's also  legal and askalawyer which seem to be less poorly moderated.  


Here's a great example from the past though [https://www.reddit.com/r/badlegaladvice/comments/jd6a1l/the\_one\_where\_100\_commenters\_and\_mods\_on\_la\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badlegaladvice/comments/jd6a1l/the_one_where_100_commenters_and_mods_on_la_and/)
That said, being banned from an actual serious astrology sub is no huge loss.  But yeah, I've been banned from subs I've never been to or heard of before for making comments in other subs. (participated in sub (X) banned from sub (Y).
Ok, admins. Either way, we aren’t following a lot of the same subreddits (only 2 I think?) and narrowed it down to one post where we both ended up downvoting the same comment…
While true, your point is entirely true ungermane to this discussion.
Are you a mod or a bootlicker lol
Reddit can only do so much, we have emulators and browser macro scripts as well. I’m just saying reddits doing all this for what? Nothing really, you can pull up an emulator or unblocker.
It’s essentially the same as like/dislike anywhere else.

Posts with lots of upvotes get promote/bumped up in visibility, posts with lots of downvotes get hidden.

And apparently reddit never considered that two people in one house might use reddit.
I was being sarcastic about mods not having wives or husbands and now you've ruined it /s
Reviving a dead argument; the question is how do they know that it's two different individuals in the same location rather than one person with two accounts?
Then, will need to be careful. The admins seem to take vote manipulation more seriously than anything else.
> ungermane 


til
And like I said have coworkers upvote your content
What’s a macro???
> And apparently reddit never considered that two people in one house might use reddit.

Yeah that's an absurd oversight.
I had no idea that upvotes increased visibility. Why does it matter to be visible? Anyway I could ask so many questions….ty
So, how do they handle dormitories?
Doh.  I missed the sarcasm completely.  Leave it to me to ruin the partym
They dont.  And they probably dont care.  Its the left you are dealing with.  Collective punishment is the thing.
Why?????
Macro is what people use it can be used for different things, they’re also considered scripts. Like using it to target and time upvotes to a specific source. But I’m not using those I have friends who have though.
Because people won’t scroll forever, so stuff that gets upvoted is bumped up the list a bit (or a lot) increasing visibility as your post is now near the top instead of the 357th post on the thread.

This of course has the side effect of people upvoting stuff thats on top, because its on top, and ignoring the stuff that isn’t because they don’t read that far.

In addition it makes it very easy for posts to essentially disappear because it didn’t pick up enough votes quickly enough or because you posted at a slow time of day etc. It’s why you’ll sometimes see people complaining they posted some article like 20 minutes ago and they didn’t get upvoted, and it’s really just down to a bit of timing and luck with how the algorithm promotes stuff.
Well, I guess that depends on how the dorms work.

If they share a single external IP like most home internet connections they likely don't.  If they assign actual valid individual IPs per user then everything should work properly.
Can't say I disagree. I was more curious from an engineering perspective (I'm a software engineer and couldn't think of how to do something like this).

But also good point; don't need to find a solution to a "problem" that doesn't have a consequence you care about.
Thank you for that! I learned something new about Reddit today.
I edited the Stunt Performers Tribute for last nights Oscar's...
...But they cut it down by almost a full minute the night before. A lot of people pitched in to make this something special (custom music, Ryan Gosling, etc...) and I thought the community might be interested to see the full, uncut version! Two months of work here, hit me with any questions! 💪

[https://vimeo.com/919444061](https://vimeo.com/919444061)
Excellent. I loved the motorcycle cuts
Looks great! While I've been an editor for many years myself, I'm not in the motion picture industry, so there were two things I was wondering about.

  
What does that mean "they cut it down by almost a full minute". If they needed a shorter version of your work - wouldn't you be the best person to create that. Or was it planned and you shared your project files with them? How does stuff like that happen?

Second thing is kinda trivial, but I was wondering how it works with the rights and licensing of those clips for the Oscars? Your tribute video featured many popular films. Would the Oscars need to secure the rights for all of them before that then - or do the Oscars have some universal rights with the companies behind the big movies? Or is it something else entirely.

  
Still, pretty good work! I'm not super interested in stunts but that is a really cool video!
Where did you source all the clips?
Hey! 

I really enjoyed the segment last night. Loved the editing, so its nice to hear from you. 

After seeing your inspiring edit, and them then saying how much the academy appreciated the stunt community, it seemed like we're going to announce a new award. And then it just hung awkwardly and they moved on. That sucked. 

"We love your work. We appreciate your skill. But not enough to dedicate an award to you." 

Did you get to source all the stunt yourself or were you given a list? 

I appreciated all the Bond stunts! Big fan?
That's so cool! Do you work for the Academy or were you hired as a contractor for this edit? This was one of my favorite unexpected bits of the show.

Love the selection of shots, I can't imagine it was easy to narrow down the history of stunts in film to a 1 minute highlight!
Loved it! So much matching, it flowed wonderfully and it all felt right.
Very cool! I thought to myself, I wonder who edited this it’s very well done.
Your tribute was beautiful, and I know it meant a lot to the stunt workers. I wish they would have kept your version, because it's very heartfelt.

Thank you for putting together their first recognition at the Oscars!

I was really excited when I saw it, and I was hoping that after the clip was over they were going to announce a new category for a Stunt Oscar. Sadly they did not, but maybe eventually they will get their full recognition. It has to start somewhere, and thank you for being a part of the catalyst!
Some really tremendous match edits in there. Very cool!
Stunt guy here, love this! They should have shown the whole clip! I mean what’s one more minute!
Great cut!
I really loved this segment! I thought the edit was really heartfelt
Excellent work, thanks for sharing! Did you do any color correcting to make it visually flow better?
Very nice work, didn't see the Oscars but they should have definitely went with your version ;)
So much fun! Great cut.
Was the goal originally to match cut through the video or something they wanted specifically?
So cool. What an amazing bunch of footage to work with!
Love it!!
Thanks for sharing, one of the highlights from the show for me 🙌 Awesome to see the full version, so sorry they cut it, alot of work
great edit man!! the shot selection and flow was on point! 👍🏼
![gif](giphy|l0ErFafpUCQTQFMSk)
Amazing work!  I’m sure there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen on this edit, and you still managed to keep it’s soul. Congrats.
Great job, man.  And thanks for providing the full version.  

I love the transition of various cars corkscrewing through the air to make a full jump out of 4 different sources.  Absolute gold.
This is awesome! Great work.
Really well done. Love the match edits, the pacing and energy. Sounds like you had fun cutting it too. Those are the best gigs!
Great job!
Nicely done!
Since you’re here, I would like to ask you a question. And please don’t take this the wrong way, I’m not criticizing your work here (which is fantastic), I would just like to hear more about what went into choosing the clips involved. Because one of the things we noticed during the broadcast was how few women stunt performers were featured. The cutdown had so few — one stunt from the Matrix with Trinity was featured for sure. This longer version has more and I was happy to see Zoe Bell in there (how she failed to make the broadcast cut is insane to me) but it’s still like 80/20 compared to the male stunt performers featured. I know men have probably done a larger share of the stunts in the industry but they still seem over-represented here. Were you told which movies and clips to pull from, or did you make those choices mostly on your own? I’m just curious.
This is really amazing and definitely love each and every cuts that's blends into the next action scenes almost flawlessly and while giving a story of the years and advancements of stunts from many major movies! Everyone definitely should watch this cut!
Interestingly, what aired is very different (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjlrNxbiyNA)

Curious to know how that was explained to ya, or if you had any input.
One of my favorite moments in the show. Great work!
Nice work
Loved it. This is such juicy editor material to work with its kind of montage porn. But not that kind of porn.
This was so cool! As a die-hard action fan, this was one of my favorite parts of the night! Appreciate you posting the full version - as someone who is leaning towards wanting to edit these kinds of spots/promos it's super cool to be able to analyze it!
Beautiful!
Very well cut. The three shots from Indiana doing the whip swing to the T-Rex coming through the roof is excellent. 
Nice work!!!
congrats homie
I know the Alien community was happy to see it included.
Fantastic tribute!
Excellent work! Sorry they cut the piece down. Folks really missed out on something.
Less Jimmy making bland jokes more stuff like this.
Can you explain your thought process on ending on the jet flyover shot? Even if it is a real jet, it reads more as a CGI jet rather than an actual stunt.  
Incredible cuts! Really loved the one of Indie flying through the air cutting the Jurassic Park, so well done. Congratulations!

Curious how did you find all these clips? Did you have an assistant searching movies or was it all you?
Very cool!
Love some of the match cuts on this one!!!
Could have used a Wilhelm Scream as an easter egg, just saying. Really cool job!  If you chose the clips how did you categorize your choices or go about picking without fear of missing important ones, talk to any stunt historians, etc?
![gif](giphy|11Un64tF2yX8JO)

Looooove it
[deleted]
Who was your contact that got in touch with you about cutting this?
This is amazing.. so the RRR sequence was added after u gave the final.. right.. ?
I just watched the official one and it’s only 20 seconds shorter
This is really cool about the history of stunts and The Fall Guy: [https://quillette.com/2024/05/17/a-history-of-stunts-the-fall-guy-ryan-gosling-emily-blunt/](https://quillette.com/2024/05/17/a-history-of-stunts-the-fall-guy-ryan-gosling-emily-blunt/)
Easy to see why they asked for it to be cut down... it really lags in the middle, and it's a bit strange we see so many wides when we're talking about the *people.*

Is the VO temp? Kinda surprised you don't have more final VO if this was the cut two days ago.
[deleted]
Thanks!
The motorcycle cuts were fire! Outstanding!
Same. The match cuts really stood out in that segment. Great work. And great gig!
Thanks for checking it out!

I handed over my entire project for 'finishing', and due to time constraints/creative direction, they had to rapidly rework it internally. A bummer for sure, but it happens.

Yes, the Academy has to license/clear all the footage used. I created a spreadsheet of every movie I used after we locked the cut, how long each clip was, and a screenshot. They have an amazing clearance team that gets it done somehow. Pretty much everyone wants to be featured in the Oscars, so its never an impasse.
This is live event broadcast. ALL cut-ins are built "fat" (so your limits were given to you with that minute overrun on purpose) for the rare occasion that segments run short. Most times (day before or the day of) a line producer will preview your piece and mark in cuts so your piece doesn't look "butchered". A luxury you want because I've been on shows where they just dump out mid-sentence to make time. While the segment is live ADs will have "back-timed" the whole show, the segment and the hard outs to cue talent. So the playback will either play the whole version or a cut version. This gives everyone else some timing options depending on what they think will run long later in the show. Congratulations, you made it to prime time - no small feat!
It’s the Oscars. I’m pretty sure it was provided either by an archive or the studios themselves.
I'm actually super interested in this myself!
I think its a step in the right direction, who knows what the future holds :)
Thanks so much! I was hired as a contractor by a stuntman friend who was collaborating with the Academy to put this together.
Thanks!! I always say that's sort of all you can hope for 💪
Thank you so much!  


I wish that as well, but I'm grateful to have been a part of it at all :) 

I think big things are coming, but I understand they can't just be adding multiple categories every year.
GO STUNTS! Thanks for watching!!
Thank you! Yeah it was a lot of people who really cared chipping in to make it happen
Thanks so much! I didn't re-color any shots, but I did flip/flopped a few so the matches and shot direction flowed a bit better.
Thank you!! It was a fun edit to flex my random action knowledge on 😆
I appreciate the kind words!!
I had zero input in what happened after I handed off my timelines a few days out from the show. I had two versions, one with a lot more Ryan VO and some BTS (like whats in the final cut) and a longer one like what you see here. They sort of smushed them together and pulled out a bunch of runtime, while adding those opening beats... I *personally* preferred the version I shared here :)

Sure! I was asked to 'absolutely unequivocally feature Top Gun: Maverick' in some capacity, and I thought it was one of the more 'grounded' moments in the whole movie as it features the literal ground in it (and jets next to real people, one of which is a stunt double for Ed Harris). It's an unbelievably expensive and complicated shot that wouldn't have been possible without the stunt community.

It also plays long (which is rare in action stuff) allowing me to fade out nicely, and has a great sense of finality to it. 

Also, the shot was achieved practically. While they definitely ***replaced*** the jet digitally, the plate and impact of the shot was all captured practically. You can see them doing practice runs here: [https://youtu.be/KMbBh2CxUOw?si=jtHkawTCvwjJFvyT&t=226](https://youtu.be/KMbBh2CxUOw?si=jtHkawTCvwjJFvyT&t=226)
Thank you!! Its crazy how many people like that SPECIFIC cut.

On the first day of the project, an assistant and I spent a day thinking of our favorite stunts/action scenes and creating a 2+ hour long string out.

I then spent the next two months culling them down, finding new ones, and trying different combinations.
And to answer your question directly, the video above is 100% my own editorial and producer work, created over two months working with the stunt community and the academy, with two notable academy members serving as quarterbacks.  I also worked with the insanely talented composer, Dom Lewis @ Formosa on the kick ass custom cue that makes the cut so great!

The gap between what went to air and the above cut is what I presume OR did. 
Ask HB who's project file, music, copy, VO, and all other finalized media he received last week, that ought to solve the mystery for you right quick :)
A freelance client of 10 years who is also an academy member.
Thank you! Correct.
Lol, Ryan doesn't do Temp VO. Thanks for checking it out!
bit rude there, pal.

besides— most stunts play out in a wide, fight scenes excepted.
Thanks for checking it out 🙏
This comment was sloppy and like an 80% fit as well.
Oh wow that's super cool! And yeah, it makes a lot of sense that a show like the Oscar's got an own team for that. Great job again!
Out of curiosity, where did you source all the footage?
Good post. The best solution is when the network agrees to "droppable content" in the commericla break. Like if they're willing to drop 60 seconds of promo content split over the last two breaks to make time. Its a challenge to coordinate between the on site mobile and master control, but it's all connected anyway.
You would be *shocked*. Guarantee that at least half of these were pirated or ripped from YouTube then rights acquired once the creatives involved confirmed they'd be used in the final cut.
I wouldn't be so quick to presume that
Just realised your username. Ha! That explains all the Bond stunts!
It's funny - watching the two cuts, I feel like I can hear the instructions the editor got to make the cuts and how they ended up where they got.
Thanks for the wonderful response!  Glad to get some insight into others' workflows.
Lol, don't have a dog in this fight but that fucking sucks. This town is the worst sometimes, and you're handling it well.
Lol I didn't even realize Gosling was the VO at first. I agree that it sounds like a temp VO I'd use on a rip reel pitch, but that's not on you. And shit, it's Ryan Gosling. Great edit though, I didn't think it dragged, and the shot selection and continuity edits were great. Of course there are a lot of wides... they're stunt performers, and "hiding" that it's not the actors themselves is part of movie making. Thanks for sharing!
Yeah lol, it's kinda the whole point of stunts, the spectacle. This was great dude, some real nice matches. I love that it's all straight cuts too, classy.
[deleted]
That was my question too.  Did a producer bring him a drive with a million clips and let him pick?
Ty. Too. Many. Years. On the receiving end of the RTS comm party line.
I worked as an AE at a place that worked on a lot of sizzle reels for studios and this is exactly what we did. Ripped a lot of Blu-Ray or downloaded the clips from YouTube.
Possibly for temp in early cuts, but we usually replace these before finishing.
I would presume exactly that. Why go begging when you can rip a YT clip in seconds
It honestly was hard to not make it 90% a Fast and Furious/Bond/Mission Impossible/John Wick tribute

> I agree that it sounds like a temp VO I'd use on a rip reel pitch

What about his VO sounds temp? Not challenging your opinion, just really curious on what stuck out to you so I can sharpen my own ear.
Not at all! I appreciate anyone who takes the time to watch my work and share a thought 
They probably had full length submission masters for each film
(how do you download clips from YT nowadays?)
Yep. We've done stuff for major networks where the network's show we were cutting stuff for had to be pirated because we couldn't wait for them to send their archived masters.
Nowhere near as often as you'd think.
You know the Xbox One Sylvester Stallone ads from 2014? I cut those and every clip was ripped from Youtube which I thought was hilarious.
Because of quality. I've worked on less known awards shows and part of the submission process is having a high quality broadcast ready clip available. Thats more for nominated films than special content. 

In the OPs case, they are licensing usage with the rights holders. This isn't a one day turn-around. There's absolutely time to get the better quality clips.
[deleted]
Yeah! What's your personal favourite? 

For me it's the tank driving through the statue in Goldeneye. And then the whole sequence after that. Was that in the cut? I can't remember?
To me, his read just doesn't match the energy of the cut. The shots are grandiose and action-packed and the music + sfx are epic, so I'd expect more of a movie trailer VO. Instead, the read sounds almost bored or somber.
JDownloader 2 baby
I’ve been using 4K Video Downloader
Shutter encoder has a video download function, for free without any resolution limits. Hasnt let me down in years.
Use OBS Studio to record the Youtube Window that's playing.
Not the Oscar’s of course but it’s embarrassing how many watermarks for free YouTube downloaders and “media pending” slates I’ve seen on national broadcast TV
We’ve done it both ways at my agency. When it’s a super cut for a brand like Amazon prime that wants to feature certain shows yes we get proxies of their online masters with audio splits. 

But when we are spitballing creative we rip YT all the time and if it makes the edit, request back for the source. 

Either way it’s fine for rough cuts until you uprez for finals
ofc YT is horrible quality we'd never use it in finals that's crazy. for RnD and creative rough cuts it's just fine. We do it all the time
Bond shots that were in the edit at some point in the process: 

Goldeneye: dam jump, tank-thru-building

Casino Royale: crane jump, Aston crash, jump from airplane stairs to fuel truck 

Skyfall: motorcycle off bridge in Istanbul

NTTD: SUV's and Motorcycles jumping off hill, Motorcycle Jump in Italy

The man with the golden gun: Corkscrew Car flip
I see what you mean now - you're talking about the direction and mood of the read, not the technical aspects of it.
thanks!
this is great to know...
awesome, thanks
Does that record the entire contents of the tab (like a screen recording software) or does it isolate the video stream? I've used OBS for recording Skype streams for video podcasts, but haven't tried it for something like this.
The original corkscrew car jump is so much better without the corny slide whistle sound effect. It made that jump such a throwaway.
It has different options, so it might have something just to get the stream, but I'm not sure. "Window" I believe gets the whole thing with tabs and all. I think there is a custom option to draw your own viewing window though.
Thanks - I might try and explore this next time instead of monosnap to see if it's any easier.
New Reddit Redesign is Back and Still Awful
So I was forced into the "new" new Reddit redesign several months ago and suffered for weeks until I was removed from the beta that was not opt-in. Now the design is back. Aside forcing the UI using [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com), is there any other way to just opt-out of this awful design?
clumsy sable wide serious forgetful society thought normal joke melodic

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
I just got the new garbage desktop ui everywhere today. Before that, I was getting the ugly version when I clicked on my profile to find my comments. This is insufferable. Having to resort to old reddit. r/help on new reddit isn't working either. Getting a 503 error.
Ugh it is still awful. I think the thing I hate the most is even the most compact version of the post layout is still an eyesore. It's 100% designed for endless mobile scrolling style use over being pleasing to the eye.
Why in the goddamn do they keep trying to force this design on us every few months?

Literally *no one* likes it.
I am seeing the new desktop UI for the first time and it is horrid. When you consider the mobile app on Android has no way to increase the font size, it is clear that Reddit has no idea how to design a decent UI.  Please use some of that IPO money to hire some decent UI developers.
You can use  [https://new.reddit.com/](https://new.reddit.com/) to get the "old" reddit design back.
If this is the new design, I hate it. I have one panel on the left with communities and other feeds and another panel on the right specific to the subreddit showing the rules and moderators.  I can't seem to close either one. When I'm browsing reddit, I usually just want to see the post and comments not all this other stuff.
Couldn't agree more. I just started using Reddit before the redesign got rolled out and there's not a single good thing I can find to say about it
I hope. Just got switched about half an hour ago, immediately looked it up and found [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com). There's so many rounded corners. I don't know why, I just don't like them. It feels so wrong. Everything IRL has nice and sharp corners. Having rounded corners is just... disgusting. Feels like I have a phone. Feels like this is supposed to be addictive, supposed to grab my attention, supposed to be infinite scroll. Just setting off red flags in my Don't-You-Ever-Dare-Sign-Up-For-TikTok brain.  


The low density of posts is just... bleh. It looks like every element has a lifelong passion to overtake the screen. I think I'm going to sign up for lemmy. Reddit is trying to become a typical social media app. But Reddit is not typical and I hate how they're trying to be normal like a teenager that wants to fit in.
[deleted]
Ahhh.  This explains why my ui looks so awful.  I came here to ask if Reddit was broken.  It never occurred to me that it was working as intended.  It's awful.  It doesn't compute for me and I can't tell what post goes to what forum and there appears to be no way to change it.  I'm using an old throwaway account.  Please fix it.
No there isn't
God, I was so happy when this nonsense disappeared a while back.  Now it's reared it's head. Absolutely wretched.
God this design is horrible. Hopefully reddit goes bankrupt.
Fix it or give us a setting to choose which layout we want!
I reverted back to old reddit due to it, waste of space everywhere.
I hate it so much.  

I ended up using this extension to get the previous look back: [UI Changer for Reddit (google.com)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ui-changer-for-reddit/bfcldjodnnkndfccfjndmdlppfkmccgh)

Honestly, I'd be okay with the new design if it didn't have SO MUCH blank space.
I was just about to post about this seafoam puke design they dare call a dark mode. I want my neutral dark mode back, not this glowie crap. I want Old New Reddit back. Or even better, a midnight theme like on my phone.
we know it sucks

we cant change it
Exactly! Its simply horrible. I hate how the drop down menu is like permanently  stuck to the side of the screen! It  makes the subreddit pages smaller and also took away the unique backgrounds and images for some subreddit communities. 

I got the old design back momentarily (idk how) and I was so happy but it just switched back to this design again.
* After years I have become very used to clicking to the side of a post to return back to the feed and the place I left it. The new UI doesn't have this and it makes site navigation a disaster.
* I do not want a list of my custom feeds and subreddits permanently on display down the left side of the screen. It's a privacy thing.
* I can no longer quote part of a post by simply highlighting it and replying. This now has to be done by a manual process that takes FIVE clicks. How is that an improvement?
* A small thing that demonstrates the dreadful UI are the 'buttons' beneath a post. Why are the up and down arrows shown in a button (like the link to comments and the Share link) when that is not a single button?

Given that Reddit is one of the biggest sites on the web, it's staggering to me that a redesign can be so much worst that the one it replaces? This isn't just a 'who moved my cheese?' thing where we just don't like changes, it is unquestionably objectively bad.
Hope this is an April Fools joke because it is awful.  Making the interface more clunky makes no sense.  Why would they do this?  Been on Reddit for many years and this interface is going to make me leave.
is anyones left menu completely gone?? Like.. no side menu or even comunitys drop menu. Please help.
I don’t even know how to navigate on iOS. My post is on the left side while 60% of the right side shows me the Reddit info. Like I don’t need that.
Yeah, this redesign is terrible. Because of how many subreddits I'm subscribed to, not all of them will show up on my sidebar, which wasn't the case with the previous UI. This new UI is also ugly as sin. Reddit, this better be an April Fool's prank....
I hate it so much. So much wasted screen space.
They want us on our phones, not our desktops....This redesign is built for mobile browser UI 100%...... It's terrible
Reddit mods: This is awful. We hate it. Please stop and revert.

Firefox users: extension which can apply different looks:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ui-changer-for-reddit/
Is this an April Fools joke?  I wondered what the hell happened today.  All of a sudden my huge desktop looks like it's running a mobile UI of some sort.  Do even younger people like this?   Is there an adult Reddit profile somewhere? ;>  Or they don't care?  

Is the assumption that everyone who matters just wants the latest NEW thing?  It seems we've trained many people off actually having taste and opinions, and to just want the latest cuz we'd die if we were uncool... but somehow I didn't get that brainware upgrade. 

If I try 'go back to old Reddit', it goes back to the Pleistocene... ancient Reddit.  Not even dark mode.  And it's just too old.  I got used to the not-quite-so-old Reddit, but I'll never get used to this.  One of my machines uses a 65" Sony TV as a monitor....LOL.

I see there is a Chrome extension to change to new.reddit.com... as opposed to new new reddit?  But it's not trusted by "Enhanced Safe Browsing".  Am I being too safe?
Anyone know how I can see all the subs I follow?  My list stops at about c, and I can't see anything past that in "communities".  **Not** a fan
Fire your designer.

What a deity-awful mess.  White on white on white.  Cluttered unreadable topic lists. A mess of font mixtures and sizes that torture the eyes and result in nearly unintelligible blobs of copy on topic pages.  Sensible response count now moved from far right to under the mess of fonts with other into.

Really guys and gals, if the goal was to make this as totally and completely unenjoyable as possible, it's a success.  Hell, with this design I can only expect that your design team has high aspirations of eventually clawing their way up the ladder towards "intolerable".
broken:

* left panel's "Communities" section is a truncated list, doesn't show all of user's joined subreddits

missing:

* "Back to the Top" button floating at lower right when scrolling down
* "Follow post to stay updated" button at top of a post
* [search comments within a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/11dgwzy/whats_up_with_reddit_search_episode_viii_the_last/)
* "Add to Custom Feed" command in a subreddit's options menu
ugh i want it back i hate this design
I just added a "old reddit redirect" to my Firefox extensions and I'll never look back.
[removed]
Reddit's FUBAR UX is SNAFU so BOHICA
Some of the things of the redesign I like, but one of the things I don't like about it so far is the hidden menus. Like, I clicked the comment box for the first time and all the formatting was gone, but when I clicked the 'T' it reappeared. Similarly, the area to assign yourself a user flair on surbeddits that allow them does not appear until you hover your mouse cursor over top of it. I don't like that feature; I think it should always appear at all times.
[new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) worked ...  till today. They really force this crap on us :(  
Now also using the add on and this seems to work. Small delay but I don't mind as long as this "new" design is gone.
omg it's absolutely awful in a web browser.   

  
who tf approved this and how can I get rid of it?
Well, if there's really no opt out I can finally delete my account I guess.
Someone made an extension that will force whichever layout you want. I had an issue where even visiting [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) would redirect me to [reddit.com](https://reddit.com) . So the extension was a lifesaver for me personally

Edit: [link to extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ui-changer-for-reddit/bfcldjodnnkndfccfjndmdlppfkmccgh).
Does anyone know how to get rid of that godawful sidebar?
Who asked for this design? 

It is now harder to quote a portion of a post you are replying to.

It is harder to moderate now, taking more steps to remove content.

Why did reddit bypass the UX component of this change? 

If anyone who worked on the change is reading this and is proud of their work; don't be. It's a materially stupid change that adds less than it takes away. Ever single piece of change in modern product rules says you always try to consider the UX component, and you test it on users before the change hits prod. You clearly did neither.
thos redesign sucks so much :(
I just got this "new" UI Layout as well and I absolutely hate it. 

* It's hard to read certain posts because the text gets so squished. 
* The background is a odd dark blue gray color that also blends into the post backgrounds which makes it harder to see what post is what.
* I am 95% sure it's prioritizing pictures over text because it's squishing all the posts with any newline chars down into small just walls of text.

I hate this new layout. And the fact that I had to look up why it changed at all and how to get back to the "new" layout at [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) is mind boggling. The fact that there is no feedback option at all tells me they don't care if their users have actual accessibility issues with this new design at all.
firefox has an addon that auto redirects to [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com)  


[https://github.com/LightningW9/old-new-reddit-redirect](https://github.com/LightningW9/old-new-reddit-redirect)  


hope that helps..   the new new interface set off my autism and i had a meltdown :/  i had to get the add on just for my own sanity
Going to www.reddit.com on the Wii U is super messed up but going to old.reddit.com works perfectly fine wtf?
I'm hopping this is an april 1st gag.
Jesus what hot garbage is this.
I used to right click on messages and notification and they would open and more importantly the message log would change it to a read message Unhighlighted

New UI, that's dead in the water.
It just showed up this morning on my desktop and it feels claustrophobic and clunky. Why do we need to see everything on the left side of the screen when it we could click one icon and have it all come up?
So, where are the people I follow now in this brave new, utterly horrible, world of Reddit?

I can see all my communites but no links to the specific users.....
yeah i can't use this app like this, too much visuals, i need all text
give us back the design before this

or at least let us use the [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) like yesterday god damn it
I'm calling it: this is it, this is the Digg moment for reddit. Making their interface way uglier and shittier to use on desktop is definitely be enough for some people - me included - to just slowly drop off.
I agree, this new design is just terrible. But the most annoying thing is when the old view suddenly turns on and after the update everything starts to glitch until the new design is loaded again. I hope it stops soon.
Redesign is an abortion. Loads of wasted space. Search results that don't give me all the info I need in a glance. This needs to go through multiple reviews before being made public.
I totally feel your pain! I posted this same question here a few days ago but there are a lot more responses to your post.  Wish they'd just give us the option for whatever format we want.  Good luck to all of us, ugh.
I'm just commenting to express my discontent for this godawful ugly layout because I don't know what else to do or where else to go to complain, lmao.  I'm glad there are addons to fix this ugly mess but I wish I had the option to opt out natively because it's obviously designed for phones and not desktop browsers.  Yuuuuuck.
Just piling on to say it's god awful
They should make it EASY to adjust default text size. The headers are fine, the list on left is fine, but yes, this text is like 50% TOO SMALL. Do I have to use Chrome's zoom for screen display? Seriously?
My biggest beef with this UI is that I can no longer search threads for comments that match a keyword anymore
You know I wouldn't mind it so much if simple functions like setting which view you want to default to, like I prefer new, would stick.  It's really aggravating something so simple doesn't work.
Its so bad I cannot bare to use it.   Brutal!
I hope they get rid of it again, because it's complete garbage. Seriously, it's impossible to do anything, and half the space is completely unused.
The new UI is horrible! How the hell do I make it so all links open in [https://new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) so my pages are readable again. This new UI is basically unusable. My preference for comments in markdown [This is reddit](https://new.reddit.com) is NO longer respected. I get a damn `T` in the lower corner and markdown is broken. I had to cycle through the editor and choose `Markdown` again just to get the url above to work. That's nuts.
The editor line does not show up AND I can't highlight a comment and then hit reply and have that part of someones comment show up.   I see others have done this so there must be a new way to do this.
Just got used to it and its jumps back WTF!!!
I just got it and it's actually awful. I swear companies have an obsession with terrible redesigns. I don't think I've seen a single website go through a redesign that wasn't just flat out worse
Yeah, whoever greenlit this UI needs to be reassigned to Antarctica. Aside from looking hideous, the formatting options for posts got buried.
Oh great, I'm new to Reddit and was just starting to enjoy myself, until someone waved their turd-shaped magic wand.

I hate when a site pushes mobile interfaces on desktops. It's been like this for an hour (I'm in the UK) and I'm already getting eye-strain.
It is HORRIBLE! 

The left and right takes up most of the screen, especially the left hand side which you can't reduce in size or collapse.

I hate it so much.

I have vision issues so I have to increase font size too as you cant do on on here, so it looks even worse!

  
Let us collapse the left panel and make the right hand one much smaller (the one that shows the subreddit info)

  
This is awful, and I usually rush to change to new designs, but this one is awful.
the worst part of this design is that a good 3rd or more of the screen is taken up by the sidebars
i haven't been on reddit in awhile so when i went on again and saw this awful design i immediately wanted to know if other people hate it. i guess people do.
Some reddit middle manager feels inadequate about their position because they realize they're not actually needed for anything, so they're forcing some poor design team to do an unnecessary change. This is Youtube management 101
Reddit is successfully helping me cure my addition to reddit by limited the amount of content I can see, or just not displaying any at all.  I didn't realize they didn't want me to use the site this badly.  I guess I'll go do my actual job...
This current design is absolutely awful. I've never posted anything about the design of reddit before, but this is just AWFUL. It's busier than an old-fashioned paper news publication, and it is getting to the point where it is difficult to find information.

It looks like someone just puked text and random lines all over the website.

Reddit, this has to stop, this current design looks CHEAP and UNREFINED. It actually HURTS to look at.

EDIT: seriously reddit...FIX IT yesterday!!
It is so awful. Hope the stock drops because of it.
Are they going to listen at all to how many are upset with it? can we at least have a setting option to default to [new.redddit.com](http://new.redddit.com) for things? Currently only option is to use [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com) which I'm not a fan of either cause white mode lol
Gee I just love having a video still playing when I collapse the preview...really they couldn't figure out that I was done watching when I minimize the thread. Morons.
This design is absolutely awful. I really hope they roll it back. The colors in every sub makes the text very hard to read, and the text is also very small.
It's horrible. I try to avoid this site now.
I just got switched to this new interface a couple of days ago. I can't even. I've closed all my open tabs and am signing out. It's not worth coming here anymore. What an incredible waste of space and navigating is horrible.
Just wanted to add my voice to the chorus. It started forcing me to use the new UI (not even new.reddit. would work) and I just found that I naturally did not want to use reddit at all anymore.

Have now installed the UI changer app, which has restored sanity somewhat. What were they thinking?
the first redesign was actually pretty decent by the time they started testing this mess. it's somehow slower, the lack of a proper font beyond Arial is garbage on Ubuntu and it's buggier
I use "Old Reddit" (maybe it is old old Reddit.)

Under preferences > Options near bottom opt out of the redesign.
Why do websites "fix" what isn't broken and ruin everything all the time?   
  
Youtube, Reddit, any streaming service (looking at YOU Crunchryroll).    
I still miss when the pause button and scrubber on YouTube wasn't overlayed onto the content I am trying to watch..
Well now [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) stopped working and we're forced again to use the "new" awful layout...
The new reddit returns errors for a lot of pages where the old reddit works. Furthermore, when old reddit does return errors, it often gives more helpful error messages.

This redesign is an incompetent cluster.
Absolutely horrible.  I'm tempted to delete my account.  Makes it more difficult to read posts the way they are listed.  Doesn't remember preferences for new (defaults to hot no matter what I set in preferences and if I reset it to new on the sub).  This occurs with multiple browsers on both Windows and macOS computers.

Somebody should be fired over this crap.  Reddit 2.0 is the HTML version of Sonos 2.0.
Is there a way we can get the old new design back?  I don't care that the communities are listed on the left.  I hate how:

1.  The threads are listed in compact view mode.  I prefer how they were listed previously.

2.  There is a bug where it does not remember that I want all threads sorted by new activity.  It defaults to hot.
Line breaks in posts are collapsed in preview on the scroll page (bad) and it's a hassle to bring up the markdown editor every time. Terrible design.
I'm not sure if Reddit is broken or the new UI is supposed to work this way. What I get is this:

Home page: "There is no content to display. We were unable to find any content for this page."

Login: Can log in. Can see group list. Can see profile. 2,008 comment karma but no comment history. Can read groups.
I just installed [this AddOn](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-new-reddit-redirect/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) for Firefox an it works a treat, I imagine there are similar options for Chrome and other browsers.
I don't know why people having negative opinion of this - It is 10000000000% better than old design.
Might just be me, but I don't mind it. It puts much more focus on the text of a post and has less distractions.
It's made for phones.
¿.¿4146e..
CöuA
All the background colors for custom flairs are gone. They don't work in the new design. Is that how it'll be now?
you can't sort by new, it just ignores your settings.. i don't want to see the same posts pop up in my feed over and over again
Are there any workarounds for this atrocious, eye-sore of a re-design??!   
New.redd doesn't work for me anymore and beta takes everything too far back..
Anyone else now have a new awards icon where the reply used to be on mobile lol and the number of upvotes is now cut off if its too high with 1... looks so stupid lol
Where is the "new" now? It's awful
Well, now even [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) stopped working to get a reasonable usable UI back. This is terrible.
I kinda like the new redesign. Is there something in particular that's not working well for you? Am I missing something horrible?
I like it, if you don't like it, don't use Reddit?
I have a tablet - it doesn't look good on the tablet either.
It's atrocious on tablets. My iPad's already small screen has maybe 60-70% of the already-limited screen width for content. The rest is wasted by sidebars and blank space.
I'm so tired of software being made terrible so that it fits on smaller screens.  If it needs to be on smaller screens, redesign specifically for that, like they do with phones.  Excel and other workplace software keeps getting changed to make it more 'sleek' and I absolutely hate it.
why would you do that?
Downvoted for being unhelpful. Thanks for using Redact.
oh thank god I'm not the only one

As an autistic and disabled Redditor* who relies on the desktop version of Reddit to use the platform, Reddit forcing desktop users to use the mobile version of the website may also be in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). To comply with U.S. federal law, Reddit *must* make sure that the website is useable by and accommodates people with disabilities.
I entered [newreddit.com](http://newreddit.com) and then did ctrl+.   when I clicked on another article the sizing looks good.
>Literally *no one* likes it.

1) This reminds me of when Discord forced the new mobile UI on everybody recently.

2) I highlighted a certain part of your comment, and under the old desktop UI it would immediately allow me to quote what you said. Under the new UI, I have to click the comment box, click the 'T' in the lower left corner to open up all the format options, highlight what you said, paste what you said, and then enable the quote formatting.

Basically, Reddit made a 2 step process a 5 step process... 👎
I actually like some elements of the redesign... but green? 😬
>Literally *no one* likes it.

I like it.
Yes, but I can't force it to use new everywhere. I'd have to manually replace every www with new. It is tedious as hell.
I can't even do that now. It just redirects to [www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com).
Yea, but every time I click on a post it reverts back
You're a gentleman and a scholar
Thank you so much! This is so helpful. I'll have might have to save the link as a shortcut though. Too bad it automatically has it set to the current layout though.
Other people seem to have issues but right now I can get around decently with this. Thank you for the tip! The new redesign is good for mobile platforms but on desktop it looks butt ugly...
Thank you! 

  
This UI they have now is awful. Just, why?
This is a godsend.
The fact the left column where all our subscribed subreddits are cannot be collapsed is so annoying. Our screens feel very cluttered now...
>there's not a single good thing I can find to say about it

I can.  It's getting me out of the house and going for a walk instead of reading reddit endlessly.
I guess it would at least make sense in the battlestar galactica universe
it's utterly terrible on a mobile browser as well.
More scrolling = more chance to feed us ads. That's what public companies are forced to do.
Wouldn't be surprised.

Nice
Nice! Saved me from having to make one. Kudos!
lol, that is my hope too. doubt it though.
I, from the future, from July: Looks like this isn't a joke.
Click the down arrow to show the dropdown of your subs and then click the colum icon that then shows up next to the down arrow. That should fix things.
same here, the sidebar doesn't even show half my subs and there's no way to keep scrolling, my compliments to the chef
Would have been nice, but this monstrosity redesign appeared several days before the 1st.
Im using the mobile app and it feels some much worse here too. Everytime they do an update they have to make something worse or harder to do, for seemingly no reason at all.
If you click inside the bar, you'll get a scroll bar, and can use that or up and down keys.
Indeed. At this point I only really use reddit when I google something and append "reddit" at the end so I can get some better information.
That's the funny thing. You can't.

Well, you can use certain extensions listed in the comments here, if you're willing to trust them. Or just do what I did and go back to old reddit.
>It's hard to read certain posts because the text gets so squished.

It also flows into the right column which makes it quite hard to read naturally.  There's no real distinction in the content areas, or even ability to remove them to make it easier to read.  Which must mean it's an absolute hellsite (even more literally lol) for those who rely on screen readers or assistive technologies.

Whoever designed this has not worked in UI/UX at all.  Editing options are an extra click, actually highlighting the quote I used was way too many clicks and a confusing procedure.  How intuitive is this going to be for those who are a: already established users and b: new users?  I'm wager it's not intuitive at all, yet someone somewhere signed off on this...
Claustrophobic is exactly how i would describe this
Ironically I moved to reddit in part because of facebook redesigning
Honestly, I started using Old New Reddit Redirect just to get reddit working again. It works for Chrome and Firefox. The link is somewhere in these comments.
Also  I was asking someone yesterday why people keep posting BidenusHarris.   Asking because us was showing in the middle instead of a US flag.   He thought I was nuts and asked me if I was okay.   I figured it out later on when I opened it on my iphone and saw the flag.
> I'm not a fan of either cause white mode lol

Use [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) with old reddit, that's the only way OGs browse reddit with lol
There are some extensions that fix it, but if those every stop working then I will follow in your footsteps.
All I know is I want to ask them where they buy their crack, because they must have a great dealer to think that this new UI is a good thing.
You can make yourself a mod on your own reddit. It'll only work until they get around to shutting it down, though. They've already announced they're doing so.

Alternatively, you can use Reddit Extended or whatever the extension is. Allegedly. Never used it, myself.
Then it shouldn't be on desktop.
I use the addon "Old New Reddit Redirect"
Supposedly you can use the reddit enhanced extension to get it to look like that.
The older design scaled everything equally and it was much easier to see separation between posts. Now it's all mashed together and every post is scaled according to...who knows. It's garbage.
This design has a massive amount of whitespace that serves no purpose. All of the posts are spread out, as well. So it takes double the amount of time to actually quickly scan reddit. It feels as if it was designed for mobile, but forced onto the desktop version.

If I was browsing on my phone? This would be fine. Probably better.

On the desktop? This is g'damn awful.

Edit: You know what the best part is? IT IS ACTUALLY SLOWER.
For starters, it doesn't show the OP for posts until you click into them. Color design is crap, its not a desktop design its for tablets. Bad design choices all round.
There is no longer an option to “follow” specific comments and I use that a lot.
That seems to be reddit's goal.  Driving me off the site.
Ironically I stayed on [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com) for many years after the first 'new reddit' redesign.

I eventually switched to the new version after I felt the layout had improved since its inception and I tried to get used to it, which I did.

Now there's a 'NEW new reddit' and to get the old reddit back (not the old old reddit but the old new reddit) I have to use [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com)

I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it.
THANK YOU.
Sad that it doesn't work anymore. Well at least for me.
Thank you!! 

Is there a way to default to this?
Not working for me anymore, 13/04/2024.

Using [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) worked yesterday.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
This is no longer working for me.  It just keeps redirecting to just plain reddit.com.
I can see why you'd be annoyed. The new version is barely usable by somebody without a disability. It's straight up badly designed.
New Discord UI was slightly annoying but absolutely trivial compared to this. This is awful
>I highlighted a certain part of your comment, and under the old desktop UI it would immediately allow me to quote what you said. Under the new UI, I have to click the comment box, click the 'T' in the lower left corner to open up all the format options, highlight what you said, paste what you said, and then enable the quote formatting.  
>  
>Basically, Reddit made a 2 step process a 5 step process...

This is my main hatred of the new UI. Replaying was so much easier before.
I am so glad I have no idea what you're talking about If I want to quote someone All you have to do is Enter the button to reply to someone then hold my finger on top of a word I want to reply then I can drag around the things so I can copy more than one word then there's literally a button that says quote and I just click that and voila

>Also if I paste anything I can put one of those mouth symbols > and I have to make sure the open part is facing towards the edge of my phone that also works.
Literally *~~no~~* *one* likes it.
beep boop, wrong opinion detected

jkjk, honestly i’m glad u like it. every ui update feels like “ugh” for a week and then i get used to it

Not to mention that everyone that walks by your desktop can see all of your subscribed communities. Yes I know you can collapse it  but, I'd much rather have the old dropdown at top and be able to close this eyesore we have now
But don't worry. They posted a Google doc to put all your complaints in, and will definitely respond to them any day now
Me closing the window because it makes my eyes hurt sure doesn't mean I'm scrolling infinitely.
The new redirect no longer works, stop linking it to people.
Turns out, I was on just “Reddit . Com “ and not “new . Reddit . Com “ 

But either way thank you so much!!
I have tried the scroll bar, the keys, and my scroll wheel, but it just won't load more communities past a certain point.
I use it a lot for that as well, and to browse a few favorite subreddits. I edited my comment above, but I've also noticed that I can now sometimes hover over the upvote button and pay real money to upvote it harder...or something like that? Yuck. It only seems to be a thing on certain subreddits for now.
I found out that changing urls to [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) works, although that's \*once again\* editing bookmarks to adapt to reddit changes.  :(
Also works with Edge. I just installed it when [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) stopped working
I saw your post when it was new. I have been stuck in the redesign since before your post was created. 

As of today or recently, they removed me from the redesign testing. Yay!!!!!!!!!!!! Hopefully it lasts
Hmm. I'll have to look into that. Thanks.
I just got the redesign, which is much too flattering a word for what I'm seeing on  my screen. Do you know if it's possible to change it back? I can't find an option to change it back and I don't like it, i don't like it!
I know, its all a bit mad 🤣🤣
It's weird that the change hit you guys a week ago. It JUST happened to me today and it really does make you question your sanity. There is no warning.
hahahah, the old new reddit, haaa I had to necro just to thank you for this comment. Made me LOL.
I want to go back to the old new reddit. That's what I was used to when I joined a couple of years ago. Not the old old reddit.
That's strange. The only time it kicks me from "new" Reddit back to "new new" Reddit is when I click on notifications in the notification drop-down (and I'm considering writing a Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script to change those URLS to point back to "new" Reddit again.)

Edit: Bodged together a GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey script which works correctly (as far as I can tell) with the Notifications dropdown and as pages are scrolled and new content loaded.
no longer working for me either
Do you primarily use Reddit on a phone or desktop/laptop?
I thought I was losing my damn mind.
I was able to download a Google Chrome extension that automatically changes all [reddit.com](https://reddit.com) URLs to [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) instead: [https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1akk79r/how\_do\_i\_force\_newredditcom\_redesign\_prior\_to\_the/krexwgc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1akk79r/how_do_i_force_newredditcom_redesign_prior_to_the/krexwgc/)
What they mean is that, on desktop at least, you could highlight the text you want to quote and just hit the reply button. Reddit would then automatically paste the highlighted text into your reply as a quote for you.

Before:

* Highlight required text.
* Press Reply button.

Now:

* Highlight required text.
* Copy text \[CTRL/CMD\] + \[C\].
* Press Reply button.
* Paste text \[CTRL/CMD\] + \[V\].
* Re-highlight the pasted text.
* Press the "T" button (at the bottom of the reply box).
* Press the Quote Block button (at the top of the reply box)... **if** its visible.
* If the Quote Block button is not visible, due to the reply thread being long and the reply box being narrow, press the "three dots" button to pop up a menu.
* If the popup menu was required now click the Quote Block button.

What took 2 actions before now takes at least 7, or sometimes, 9!
Well before on desktop you didn't have to click and highlight words and then copy/paste it; it used to do it for you. Now on desktop you have to copy/paste yourself so it's more steps...
Better :D
Is there an option for Edge?  Thanks.
I needed to do [this](https://new.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1btdp6x/if_newredditcom_doesnt_work_switch_you_options_to/) in order to make the extension work.
Very true!
Erg, now new.reddit has been updated (at least for me). Time to treat the sidebar as an advert and block it. Either the whole thing `www.reddit.com##reddit-sidebar-nav` or one section `www.reddit.com##details:has(>summary[aria-controls=communities_section])`
I've literally put more work into getting feedback from 5 coworkers on an Excel training.  Using the same tool.  Honestly wondering if it's something someone set up get email addresses.
Oh, sorry, it does work for me. There are 27 in the list, then the resources sections below them. There shouldn't be a limit on that, but if there is, maybe they'll fix it...
Since Reddit went public, they need to actually turn a profit. So they're going to become far more scummy going forward.

I would not be surprised if genuine information is buried in the future, and only people who are willing to pay money to spread disinformation will be seen. Kind of like how X (Twitter) prioritizes those who pay, and genuine comments from free users are buried.
I wouldn't hold your breath.

I was in the redesign "testing" last year. I was in there for three months, despite mods here "reassuring" me that it wasn't supposed to be that long. It was.

And then now I am back. And the UI hasn't been altered. Is this another "test"? Normally when you test things multiple times, you test how things have changed.

Does Reddit's UI team want to test if slamming your foot into a door will be different the 100th time you do it compared to the 1000th time?
The only option is to manually replace www with new, so new.reddit.com. Or to use the old reddit design. Which, the latest update is so bad that I went back to old reddit, myself.

Are you using a desktop browser? I've just written a couple of GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey scripts that redirects everything back to [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) (or at least should do, it does for me) if you're interested.
Both but it’s only a problem on laptop for me, that said I found a chrome extension that fixes it for me
Please bear in mind that, at some point, even using new.reddit.com *may* stop working.

It would seem that, for some people at least, Reddit's servers are automatically re-directing any requests made to new.reddit.com back to [www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com). As this is being done at the server level there is little, if anything, that can be done about it once/if it happens.

I haven't worked out if this redirection is dependent up account age (newer accounts possibly getting redirected first?) or something else, or even if all accounts will inevitably end up being redirected to [www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com) so all I can say for certain is enjoy it while it lasts! 🤣

Edit: Interestingly, I removed the links for both the "new" and "www" addresses from this comment but , no matter what I do, Reddit keeps converting the "www" address back into a link, but *not* the "new" addresses. Seems Reddit *really* want to nudge people towards the ugly new new site!
Just paste and put > in front super easy
* Highlight required text.
* Copy text \[CTRL/CMD\] + \[C\].
* Press Reply button.
* Paste text \[CTRL/CMD\] + \[V\].  
* Put > in front
It's a real shame, as Reddit has been one of the best resources on the internet for crowdsourcing information. X is a mess, I deleted my account there several months ago.
Oh yeah I've been back and forth for a long time too. This last run was the longest for me though. One day it went back to normal and then back to testing again.. hoping that doesn't happen this time.
They switched me back to testing.. just after I sent the last message :(
This thread is making me glad I never left old reddit.
ok thanks. i don't know how i was forced into this new format and it's awful so  i'll follow everyone else to [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) !
I am on a desktop, but not one I can install scripts or extensions on
Oooh, 5 steps. Soooo much better than 2. But its still "only" 5 if you're going to town on Reddick. The reality is your "solution" is still 8 steps:

* Highlight required text.
* Copy text \[CTRL/CMD\] + \[C\].
* Press Reply Button
* Paste text \[CTRL/CMD\] + \[V\].
* Press the "T" button (at the bottom of the reply box)
* Switch to Markdown Editor.
* Put > in front.
* Switch back to Rich Text Editor (because nobody sane wants to be staring at a mono-spaced font unless absolutely necessary).

Don't be that "guy", you don't owe Reddit anything.
You have my condolences. At this point I don't think it is in the testing phase anymore. I think it's just what they're demanding we all use.

Feels very Blizzard. "What? Don't you guys have phones?"
I didn't leave old reddit either and I hadn't logged out. The thing just switched on me by itself. I hope it doesn't happen to you!
Thats a shame. I wonder why you cannot use [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) though? Apart from the odd few things I've had to write the user scripts for (clicking on a link from the notifications kicked me back to new new Reddit, so too did clicking on the timestamp of a comment) I can pretty much use [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) without the userscripts just as I did before they started rolling out new new Reddit. Strange.
Wait pressing the t button is that that stupid thing that happened to me where I was on desktop or whatever reason and when I commented and I did the whole putting a link in parentheses and putting the other word in brackets It didn't work properly and somehow it actually kept the brackets and parentheses like where you could see them visually?

Uh, that's horrible! I hope so, too.
it reverts back to [https://www.reddit.com/](https://www.reddit.com/) as soon as it loads. I'm thinking it's something on reddit's end redirecting the request
Just a moment, I'm going to test something... BRB.

Edit: To answer your question; Reddit appears to no longer remember your editor preferences and, even if you last used the Markdown editor, your next reply will revert back to the Rich Text editor. This means, to use the Markdown Editor, you have to press the "T" button (presumably means Text?!) and then click the Markdown Editor link **every single time** you want to use it. So yes, this is why you are now seeing the markdown even after you post your reply.

Edit 2: BTW, on my end at least, your last reply was posted 5 times 🤣
This was written in the Markdown editor. Will it stay enabled for the next comment I make?
Nope, the Markdown editor does not stay enabled, it defaults back to the Rich Text editor.
Cannot leave a subreddit. 
So I have tried to leave certain subreddits and it keeps rejoining them. No matter what I do, I can not leave these subreddits. Any recommendations of how to try and fix this?

For the love of God, how do you clear the laptop speaker holes?
Over time this accumulates lots of dust.... any proper way of cleaning those?
I recommend you check [this video](https://youtu.be/m5rXx8D24B0?si=hNhv0mYYfSvXcEk4) out, its pretty crazy how a lot of people don't know this
Some are real holes some are fakes.
Stupid suggestions aside, blu tack.

Actually gets the crap out of the holes instead of just making it wet or lodging it in further. 

Then do the same to all the ports, headphones, phone microphone/speaker holes etc.
I use BluTack, it doesn’t get stuck in the hole and whatever junk is in there get stuck to the tack and I pull it out, it works on EarPods /airpods as well
A very tiny, powerful elf, using an even tinier yet powerful magic vacuum cleaner.
They’re not holes
You can’t clean them without making it worse. If you use brushes, Blu-Tack, or anything similar, you’ll just damage them. Those fake grills have tiny black dots of paint stuck in each individual hole, and if you try to clean them, you'll end up removing the paint, making it more noticeable. (Source: Personal experience. I tried it on my older Mac and ruined it for good.)

Place the keyboard face down and use an electric toothbrush (dry) to clean the densely packed holes.
There is special cleaning stuff called cyberclean. It works.

soft-bristle toothbrush... it might remove paint from some fake holes so be careful not to overdo it
Use a clean dry toothbrush and clean the holes in up-down motion then blow some air. The bristles are thin enough to enter the holes and unclog them. Fast n easy.
Duct tape. Cover the holes and press down, then remove the tape.
Rodico
Gently use a toothbrush, one of those with the very fine tapered tips. Works well for me.
Isopropyl alcohol and a toothbrush. 🪥scrub-ba-dub!🫧just dip the brush in a cup of the IA. Not soak the speakers with it.
I always use a cloth soaked with a little bit of high percentage alcohol (more than 95%, don’t use one with less!). Just swipe over it a little bit, it gets clean. Last time I used it on my iPhones speakers, cause volume was so low I couldn’t hear anyone when I was not at a real quiet place. Now it’s as loud as it was when it was new.
Get a toothbrush and gently scrap away the dust particles stuck in there. It works all the time for me. Wet your toothbrush with a little bit of water or alcohol (preferred).
There is a kind of Gel like a slime for that , look at amazon for FiveJoy
Some alcohol and soft toothbrush!! Or you can hot gluegun all over the holes.. wait to cool down and peel off

I tried using a pressure washer, unfortunately it got my chair, desk, wall and floor all wet as well.   In hindsight I should have just thrown it in the dishwasher.
r/CrappyDesign
Easy. You get a new one.
I use a dry nail brush
Butter. That helps
I just buy a new one ! 😬
Water wash it brothaa
The real question is - how did you clog them?
Get a piece of bluetack, press it against the speaker grill and the dirt will stick to the bluetack.
Thats the neat part, you dont.
Have Apple clean the box.
Microfibres cloths? Just a suggestion, idk if it works

Could also try that weird putty goo stuff
You don't. You grow shrooms 🍄🍄 instead.
Just play some wind instruments music (trumpet,trombone, …) at top volume.
As if needed yet another reason to hate mac. How lame.
[deleted]
Just blast music through em for a while, should clear right up. It worked well for me
Spray IPA
So they were fake the entire time 😱
Great video. Summary for people like me who would rather just read it:

* Most of the speaker holes are fake. Only a small area has real holes. The fake holes are dimples with black paint in them.
* Usually, when people think their speaker holes are clogged with debris, the real issue is that the black paint has come out of the fake holes, exposing the aluminum at the bottom of the dimple.
* Don't use a brush or a vacuum on the fake holes. That will just remove more of the black paint, making it look even worse.
* If you want to "fix" the fake holes that look bright, use a mechanical pencil to fill in the hole. Wipe off the excess.

Not in the video: If any of the *real* speaker holes truly are clogged, just put a piece of tape on them and remove the tape.
Damn. I’ve been using MacBooks since like 2008 or so yet TIL. Thanks
ok, but the video didn't tell us how to actually clean them out when they do get debris in them, also it didn't help with this model of MacBook where the "holes" are much much finer.
interesting... I wonder if this is the case with the m3 pro macbook pro, since it sure looks like dust to me...
This should be higher up 🤔
Make something dirty to clean it. Interesting video.
i didn’t know that but that kind of irritates me. 

Apple added them because they look nice? ugh
Wow, that’s such a dumb design choice… they should just only put holes where they’re actually needed, it’ll look so much nicer like that.

Or put more speakers and utilize all the holes. That’s an option, too.
What the fuck
Well I'll be damned.  TIL.  Thanks for sharing!
People don't know, because they are painted dimples made exactly to look like holes
I might be wrong but when looking at my M3 Space black at an angle I can clearly see that the “holes” are used for more than just speakers. I believe they also house the components that tell ambient light to light up the keyboard.
OMG. I just fell to my knees. My world has been built on lies.
I was lied to this entire time
Was ready for the rickroll, committed, was disappointed
How deep does a dimple have to be before it’s a hole, though?
those are not wholes!? ohhh my godd
TIL that MacBook speaker holes are just dimples with a little black paint inside.
Damn
That is nuts… I also assumed they were holes!
If the brush is a soft one you can totally start with that. I clean everything with a brush and and air pump. Just don’t vacuum or use hard stuff. After that you can fix the rest with a black permanent fine liner.
hahahahahahah
No way, holy guacamole 🥑
Wtf!!!!!!
My mind has been blown
what about if there are real holes on it :) , how to clean them
That video is like 2:30 too long
Kinda stupid (slow n messy) idea tho, toothbrush method works much better.
for some reason I was really expecting a rick roll
So that’s why they removed it on the m2 💀
So much for 'good design is honest' 🙄
So what about if there is something stuck in the real holes. I have a 2018 MBP and definitely have a piece of something inside one of the holes, I can see it. I've tried BluTack but no luck. Any ingenious methods for this issue?

I'm gonna try using a narrow-tip Sharpie, then clean the surface with isopropyl.
i had no idea
That's nuts.
Motherfucker… My bad, I’m COLORBLIND! I got light gray, medium grey, and dark grey. All jokes aside, I think this seals the coffin for me… Anybody want a 2020? 2021? 13” MacBook Pro in silver?
I was utterly convinced this was going to be a Rick roll
Instead of adding a numerical keypad like other companies, Apple ships fake holes.
What the actual f
Hoooly shit had no idea.
TIL! Great comment
Damn, what? That’s diabolical.
No way man hahaha my life is a joke now
What the fuck
Thanks!
Shit, I feel betrayed. My life is a lie.
This is such a good answer, seems like something Apple would do...and yet no lie I won't buy a MacBook again because this is some nonsense.

Just put more holes and a bigger speaker.

I love my M1 Air but shenanigans like this turn me off from Apple entirely.
Wow! I had no idea idea.
But his take in the end is pretty crazy. It looks pretty bad with those small grills.
Whooaaaaa!! Another crazy display of "form over function"...
Thank you!
Mind. Blown.

Thank you for this!!!!
Oh yeah, I don't know where I came across this, but I have been following this technique for quite some time now. And, I am very shameless about it :D
Why, Tim Apple, why... 🤦
Holy fuck. I should have expected as much from tim apple
That persons advice is to get a tiny mechanical pencil to fill in the holes 💀
I love how his fix is pencil graphite. I worked in a private Apple repair shop and we’d write issues on the device in pencil because we knew it would wipe off when we cleaned the device after service.
No way it was makeup all along!?
Damn had no idea about this. What a shitty design
Apple being Apple
Dudes just coloring them in? i bet some mad blackhead remover stuff would probably work on them. I know its a nightmare on my MBP, been problem ever since Alu PB
Where did that guy learn English?? Or is it AI?
WTF lol. I've got corn starch all up in my vents and thought I finally had a solution.

For anyone wondering...don't do this. Those are vents. Further clogging them with pencil graphite is only going to make the problem worse.
I was just about to say that. Brushes / vacuums do work but not on these specific grill holes (in the picture). I feel those car dust remover glue gel thingies might work better than blutack though.
>Actually gets the crap out of the holes

But they're not holes.
That's a great way to remove even more of the paint from those fake holes.

Which is what they are. Only a tiny portion of those holes are real speaker holes.
Didn't know anything about blu tack, will try that one. Thanks!
Blu tack: a teacher's best friend.
Can attest to this. But with phone speaker grills be careful to not get it stuck under the frame. It’s hard to get out and you risk damaging the speaker grille with a toothpick.
Blu Tack is wonderful for any electronic device. I use them on iPhones and Airpods (just don't press *too* much...).

Revolutionary.
I just posted the same suggestion, it works great. 100% recommend. I also use it to clean out some of the earwax in the speakers of the AirPods.
Not a stupid suggestion, it’s what technicians at Apple stores use
That
But that also pulls out the little black thing they inserted to make them look like holes. I wouldn’t advise doing it!
Exactly! This one one of the best, little known uses for the stuff. A tiny piece will last a LONG time as well.
Apple wants 999$ for the elf...
So…Fixies?
perforations?
Just another reason to get the silver mac, it doesn’t really show on mine 
Compressed AIR* is so much better than those battery powered vacuums or blowers FYI.

Edit:iOS voice to text
Organic suction tools. Aka your mouth. Use a bit of tongue to tease out the stubborn parts.
Looks like blu tack, thanks :)
This is the way
This is the answer.
That would be counterintuitive in the case of a macbook, these are not holes but dips in the surface to grant the illusion of being speaker holes. Each dip is painted very thinly with black paint to grant the illusion, so trying to clean them is actually what causes them to look like there is dust in them. 

It seems ridiculous but I think it does genuinely look much nicer with the dips versus only having speaker grilles.
They aren’t holes, they are dimples
There’s always that one moron who says something like this in the comments
Tried this an now the bluetack is in my speaker holes
My logic says a toothbrush will only push those down... what am I missing?
My whole world is a lie!
“Always has been”
If you look you can see two square sections beneath the grille on the 16" MBP which is actually a speaker part. Is is about 15% of the total area.
Though not all of them.
Always have been.
That's "Designed in California" alright.
I’m SO GLAD this comment doesn’t end with “I’m an artificial intelligence” or something alike
fun fact: I have a weird lemon missing some dimples completely, making it have smooth spots☝️🤓
Birds aren't real!

Really though, WTAF
But why does the paint in the dimples fall off? If anything the paint in there should be the last to got because it‘s not on the surface and less exposed?
Thank you very much!
Without the last statement, I already thought this comment was generated by a summary video AI.
A mechanical pencil? Why would you risk graphite and other carbon particles infiltrating your internal components?
Which ones are the real ones??? Shit I have been lied to.
Glad to see someone else prefers actually reading instead of viewing an answer. The reason links are given to explain things is, I suspect, because that person cannot write clearly.
Be careful with the pencil approach, graphite dust conducts electricity and you don't want excess finding its way inside your mac.
All of the holes were "real" until 2012, but prior to then most just didn't have a speaker behind them.
best way to clean such things is actually a sticking tape (electrical tape, duct tape, etc. I've used some 3M narrow double sided tape). after you remove it - it will grab some dirt away. works for iphone speaker/mic holes as well
I don’t think you need to clean them since they’re dimples. Maybe a damp cloth can catch anything in there but anything sitting in the dimple will fall out if you tip it upside down I guess
Use a Biore Pore Strip /s
Lint roller.
I would assume a damp (not wet) micro-fibre cloth will do the trick beautifully. What doesn't come out that way is not supposed to :)
You have a laptop that doesn’t exist, I wouldn’t listen to anyone else. 

> m3 pro MacBook Air
If it goes any higher it'll escape Reddit.
Almost every consumer product has bits added to look nice.
Makes me think about the auto trend to add fake vents and grills to the bumper covers or the fake exhaust pipes. Looks like Toyota ditched the pointless rear bumper cover vents on the Camry this year, but there are still some fake ones on the front ... they certainly don't look nicer to me.
Haha because Apple has never been motivated by aesthetics.
Apple was selling laptops for *years* with objectively inferior keyboards and justified it with aesthetics.
[deleted]
The bass drivers are located in the vents on the side of the MacBook Pro
Aesthetics. I find the symmetry of having holes or dimples aligned with the keyboard to be more pleasing than just having a strip of speaker holes only where needed. The strip of speaker holes shown at the end of the eye-opening video reminds me of a [toothbrush moustache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush_moustache), once used by comedians and funny looking dictators.
It's not 'dumb', it's 'anti user'. Just like most Apple design choices.
Ask Vsauce for the definition of a hole!
He sounds like an Englishman, so probably England.
... It's a British accent
"everything I'm unfamiliar with is AI"
Well, no thanks to those who didn’t bother trying to answer my question. I checked out the YT site and the channel location says Portugal, so I don’t think it’s “obviously” an Englishman or British accent. If you’d listen you’d hear that the cadence and lilting is not the typical British accent (I won’t say English, like crappywomack said, there as many English accents in England as their are counties, it seems)… so if the person is Portuguese who learned English from some Brit, that would explain the unique sounding flow -and pronunciation of some words. Otherwise, it _does_ sound like a generated voice. Then again, if the narrator is the same person as the channel owner, and the channel has been around since 2013 I think, then it clearly isn’t AI since it predates the voice tech. Does anyone know who the narrator is?
They aren’t vents. They are just dimples with paint in them. And if you take the paint out they look like they are dirty
It does, works well on keyboards, earplugs and lego as well. Have a blob you can roll on is great, and it does not lose stickiness as quickly as blutac does
That's rather cheap for an elf.
You can get a tiny elf with a tiny peepee for much cheaper on Amazon.
We think you’re gonna love it
Aah, but it’s a unified memory elf!
Dimples, colored to look like holes.
Idk, I find compression errors to be pretty annoying myself.
But you are just pushing dirt in, then.  

So you’re basically hiding it and “fooling” your brain 😂
It’s not better specifically for mics and speakers as it can damage them
My only thing with compressed air cans like that is the cooling / moisture effect they have. Though normally I’d vouch for them on some other parts like independent keyboards, I know they can harm some hardware
I am \*not\* lipsing up a MacBook lmao
Keep your depression within you, thanks 🙏
So is your hole world.
🌎🔫👨‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀
you are getting downvotes because you posted the first comment from the youtube video.
W…why?
I'm a bit disappointed
Shoot one with a BB gun, I dare you
The rest of the surface isn't painted
I use toothbrush with IPA. Always look like new and it takes a minute.
I use poster tack for this. it's sticky and malleable enough to form to some pretty tiny crevaces and holes.
Maybe silly putty could work?
Lol sorry meant macbook pro, edited
How do you know they user tested it, is there a video? Or you’re just assuming since they’re pros at UX?
Y'know, the place where they invented the language!
Dafuq, seriously?
> does not lose stickiness as quickly as blutac does

That’s what I also felt. That product is less dry that blutac is, so should adhere to particles stronger. Thanks for confirming 🍺
As long as I get a complementary Vesa mount to hang him when I'm done, it's a real bargain!
I’m using voice to text on my iPhone- Compressed AIR* lol
It’s kind of implied that if you’re going to clean something, you’re going to open it up so that you can clean out the inside as well. Unfortunately, you have to have an iFixit kid with the proprietary screw head type. I’m sure you’ll find it a lot dirtier than you think on the inside. Again, I apologize for assuming that people know what they’re doing. There’s maybe eight screws to take out? And then the bottom just comes off and just start spraying (or vacuuming lol).
The condensation gets worse the longer you hold the "trigger".  Short bursts are going to work the best with the least chance to start getting cold, which is when you get vapor. Just use it almost like sprayt paint; short bursts. You wouldn't BELIEVE the number of people that just straight blow it through their fans for fun either (which can burn out the motor BTW) 

As someone whose WHOLE gaming rig is white (including the peripherals), I clean my case monthly, as well as my keyboard and mouse. I've tried the battery powered blower and vacuum-was almost a novelty at how bad it worked.

Also, almost anything can harm hardware if not utilized correctly, hell your morning cup of tea or coffee could harm your hardware. As long as OP does research and watches a couple of youtube videos they'll be fine.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
also because it's a stupid comment that implies things designed in California are somehow expected to not be poorly designed
I think because it would imply AI services can write comprehensive summaries of videos
There are a lot of those around. AIs summarizing articles, and I think I’ve seen them do videos also ?

I don’t really trust that an AI can summarize things correctly. I do trust a human.
I'm neutral on this matter
Isn't shooting drones a crime?
It‘s anodized? Can‘t they not anodize the whole metal slab?
Toothbrush with a bottle of Jack also works.
well, about brushes - I've bought brush looking like this:  
[https://premiumgaming.rs/cdn/shop/files/51rCEaJ0RLL.\_AC\_SX679.jpg?v=1699452138](https://premiumgaming.rs/cdn/shop/files/51rCEaJ0RLL._AC_SX679.jpg?v=1699452138)

and those thin hairs are doing incredibly good job of cleaning those holes. my phone basically like new after 1 minute cleaning, without isopropanol
This. Cheap and easy to find. Those goopy cleaning gels are awful.
That sounds like an excellent idea right there... also micro-fibre cloth seems reasonable too.
There’s cleaning putty on Amazon for phone speaker holes. I’m sure that’ll work.
I don't know what it is, but someone mentioned it below, so may be
Did you not even watch the video you are replying to?
Dude, the video just explained this to you
Man, tearing the MacBook down is obviously better for cleansing of it.

I think that OP, just like the most of PC users, are not used to dismount devices… so what OP was asking for is a clever method to clean it.  
So as upper user mentioned, a vacuum is the go-to method.
that totally flew over my head, you are right!
They can already
Honestly AI would probably be more reliable than a human
I'm both glad and disappointed
Bottle of Jack works on its own, brother.
Cause when I leave for the night I ain't coming back
It's [Cyber Clean](https://cyberclean.net/). I'm a fan. It's good for those little grills, keyboards, AirPods, and other things.
Then getting a battery powered gun is probably the best idea because OP will be doing it monthly (unless electric vacuums have become 10 times as powerful as they were last year) 

Also, OP needs to realize the reason the speakers are like that is because the insight is so dirty. If 12 year old kids are building their own rigs-I think a grown adult could handle unscrewing a couple of items. But again, your time, your machine, your choice.OP. What does know what works!!!
I do have an iFixIt kit, but my laptop is only 3 months old lol rather not push my luck with warranty issues...
We are. 

Doubt you have.
The only Tik Tok that matters.
"Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy": Yea, I'll pass on that one 💀
Yeah don’t do that
Sorry?
"New" design does not work anymore on Desktop
I am being defaulted to the newest layout / design, which sucks "a bit" because it is unnecessarily bulky. Anyone else with that problem?
Locked as this is once again a complaint fest. Commenters, keep in mind that replies to posts in r/help must be *helpful*. r/help is not the complaints department. 

See official admin announcement:

https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ehmgmr/next_steps_for_newredditcom/
Off-topic, but it's absolutely insane how people have been complaining about the new UI since they first introduced it months ago and the admins *still* went through with the change despite the massive pushback. And now they have the gall to completely shut down the previous "new" design. Though maybe we shouldn't be surprised. Admins never really cared about the users themselves, only about the money and information they create. I just fail to see how this abysmal UI will help them with anything
I hate it. Seems like every few months something gets messed up. Or reddit doesn't care about desktop anymore. Two things I hate the most. Clicking on a notification in my inbox doesn't open a new window, so I lose my place in my reddit feed. The webpages all take VERY long to load. I want [https://new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) back!
Same. [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) goes to the newest crappy design, and not the one it used to just today. I guess I'm just sticking to [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com) then, this newest one is an atrocious design and the designer should be keel-hauled in Venus.
This is a jumbled crammed mess, it use to relax me to read reddit now it's unpleasant and stresses me out.  I only do one social media, guess I'll go back to facebook.
I understand that they don't want to maintain 3 different layouts at once, but the new design is terrible.

All posts take up far too much space, so it's a slog trying to scroll through them.



Unfortunately [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com) doesn't have a native dark mode, so it's a lose-lose situation here.
ya found the same thing as of the last hour or so ... really annoying as a desktop user, its clearly designed for touchscreen/mobile interface

i keep telling myself ill eventually just get used to it like i did with past changes but ive tried it a few times and it doesnt feel any better, yet

having the entire left side of the screen filled with what used to be hidden as a dropdown is probably the most obvious/offensive bit for me visually, and then as a result of trying to conserve space for mobile UI it feels like buttons and sort options are kinda hidden away compared to what they used to be

guess im just one of those old people trying to stand in the way of progress now... my time has finally come
Can't even look at  this, it's hurting my eyes (Chromebook).
Yeap.. not just you. It looks like new doesn't work anymore.
Ah crap, this looks terrible .
They're shutting down the "new" layout. There's a temporarily workaround where if you create a subreddit you'll get to keep the old interface until they port the mod tools over.
I HATE this new look with a burning passion. I don't even want to brows reddit like this. It's so incredibly bad!!!!
ya...the new ui is so "soul-less"....its so annoying :(
The new design sucks so hard, let me go back!
This is really sad. For me this new UI is really bad to read. C'mon, give us the option to return to the older interface.
I've been avoiding this layout because they still haven't fixed the default "Sort by new".  I'm bitter and pissed that this is now forced on me in a half-arsed state.
I guess the admins didn't like how many people were using addons to redirect to the previous layout so now they're just forcing this garbage down our throats whether we like it or not.  Yay...
Same, and it is truly a symphony of poor UI design.  What a monumental step in the wrong direction.
Same for me. Just redid my redirector to old.reddit. Shame! I liked the old-new design most. Old easily beats current though.
https://new.reddit.com/user/username/followers/
looks like we are cooked
I tend to use Google to navigate Reddit in terms of finding communities and even posts. I fail to perceive benefit of the left bar and making things harder to read by making the text smaller. It's slightly annoying to read comments while left and right sidebars are so near center of field of vision.

Twitch uses simple colored background for its left bar so it doesn't annoy your vision.
Dark layout is garbage, left panel cannot be hidden. This looks so bad.

  
edit: also comments are sorted by best and not by TOP and I cannot see the option to change it in Settings
Bring back the old new reddit!!!

How could anyone with eyes on desktop possibly look at the design and sign off on it as being functional, it's absolutely horrendous
Same here, the extension I use isn't allowing me to change the UI to "new" both in Chrome and Firefox, only to the latest design (sh.reddit) and the oldest Reddit design, which I admit I'm not familiar with, but this latest layout is a terrorist attack to my eyes, I hate it.
Cool, it's not just me. FFS.
The shitifcation of tech and apps is just relentless.

  
i can live without Reddit truth be told. But others cannot so Reddit is free to do as they please because we’re not even customers anyhow
Beside the fact that this newest UI is horrible, it's bringing me a ton of problems because of the resources that is using, it loads terribly slow and I can't open more that 2 tabs like I used to do with the "new.reddit" design. Is anyone else having this issue regarding to resources use?
*Anyone else with that problem?*

Better to ask if there is any Redditor who does like it!
Same thing here, it worked fine yesterday and today it isn't even a redirect apparently they combined the two address since [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com/) opens the new UI and doesn't redirect like before.

I just got a new laptop a couple weeks ago and the first day on Reddit was the 3rd gen and somehow the next day I got the second gen reddit.

It wouldn't be all that bad to me if they would fix the HOT topic issue thing. I have my subreddits set for new, this new format open with HOT all the time even though you have it set in preferences.

I also prefer a window opening when I click on the topic and not to a new page, it made it easier not having have to use the back button.

REDDIT JUST FIX THE HOT/NEW SETTINGS SO IT WORKS LIKE IT SHOULD!!!!!
Same here. It wouldn't be as bad if the newest design wouldn't be so functionally broken.
D
New design was still working for me a couple hours ago, now I'm stuck here too.

Honestly if I could just get rid of the left sidebar, I wouldn't mind this layout that much.

I do like how I could see more things on the screen on new.reddit than I can now though. Seems like too much spacing between everything to me. I mostly don't like the view when scrolling through posts, on individual posts it doesn't bother me as much.

"new.reddit" felt perfect to me, "old.reddit" feels more cluttered but the other one had some nice dividers between posts and things like that.

I really hope they change this, at least make the sidebar optional again, that is such a waste of space. And "recent" still shows me a couple things I went to months ago and not all of my recent things...!!

Definitely going to be browsing this place a lot less now!
old.reddit design can be used with an extension [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/old-reddit-redirect/dneaehbmnbhcippjikoajpoabadpodje](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/old-reddit-redirect/dneaehbmnbhcippjikoajpoabadpodje)
Google Material Desing...
Steady on old chap!
It just feels unnecessarily crowded, the old .new was way better, I just don't understand why they would change that.
It's funny to me they designed this new UI for mobile, because I mostly use my ipad these days, and the older (well, new) way was easier and more comfortable for me to read.
That's exactly my issue, too. The colour combination is very aggressive and hurts eyes. The "previous new" design was very eye-friendly. While the Starter/Original Post colours of the text body (ecluding headings) are still acceptable, the comments are very hard to read for the eye because of the colour. Addirionally, the font looks so thin now, which makes it double hard to read.
I feel like am back to Windows 98, when it comes to the UI feeling
This is Google's material design as seen on Android 12+

And yes, it's horrible.
I hope not so. Is this a joke? Oh no this will be tiresome to set up
Ditto that. 

The old-new layout was tidier, easier on the eye and easier to navigate around. The new-new version is an offence to the visual senses, messy, and cluttered. So it's old.reddit for me now.
Why did following that link fix the design for me?! Thank you!
i just assumed thats what its geared for, i dont use mobile at all for anything like this. if thats not who its meant to benefit then yeesh i really have to wonder what they are thinking.

now that i think of it, there is an app for mobile devices anyway isnt there? so presumably most mobile users wouldnt be viewing reddit via browser anyway...? or are these browser layout changes reflected in the app as well? making less and less sense the more i think about it.
I agree, it doesn't sit well at all, looks horrendous if truth be told...
It's not a joke. The official announcement new reddit is being shutdown.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ehmgmr/next\_steps\_for\_newredditcom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ehmgmr/next_steps_for_newredditcom/)

If you create a subreddit to use the workaround you don't need go through every setting like a real community. It just has to exist as a community you're a mod of.
Nope, it is quite confirmed.  No doubt they will close that loophole fast as well.. :-/
it did! weird.
Another way: [https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1f33rr3/comment/lkcoso4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1f33rr3/comment/lkcoso4/)

But the downside is you switch to the new UI on new tabs and refresh, so you gotta stay in one tab.
pretty sure once mod tools are completely migrated over they are gonna close that loophole.
this one isn't working.
Yeah I mentioned in the beginning that the loophole was temporary.
You don't need an AIO for 7800X3D
Just installed 27$ CPU cooler on 7800X3D, applied Honeywell PTM7950 instead of conventional thermal paste. Temperature is 75°C under full load in open standing motherboard. Fan is not even 1500RPM. Good luck Intel getting on the same level.
As long as your cooler is rated for at least 120W of cooling then it will be fine for a 7800X3D. That's one of the great things about AMD chips.
Obviously you don't, that cpu pulls like 100w at worst
I used a $30 Peerless Assasin, with MX-6, and the hottest I can get it is 78C if ambient is 20C.

7800X3D could use bargain bin paste and a considerably smaller cooler and be fine.  Its not like its going to have a problem running at 85C.
All hail thermalright
would had been interesting to measure the temps before applying the Honeywell PTM7950
i use a noctua nhu12s, and it works really well, never get pass 85c 19000k+ Cinebench with neg co.
where do you live? i live in a region that has a normal weather temperature around 35-45C
I did my original open build of a 7800X3D using the Thermalright SI-100 which I got for $25.
air con + open room so heat never builds up = not a good example.
[deleted]
I run a 47mm cooler with no issues. AMD 65W Eco Mode, and 87C thermal limit in the BIOS and I only dropped like 500 points in Cinebench R23. Stays between 60-75C doing anything besides stress testing and shader compilation in games.
went overboard and are using a noctua u12s on my 7800x3d  
May use it on 9800x3d or downgrade...
Looks like an actual model done of downtown Denver or other metropolis
It’s god damn beautiful.
Ouga bouga fellow PTM fan, I approve and appreciate, may your system run for decades.
i got a big ass dark rock elite though just incase =P
I have a Peerless Assassin on mine and it never gets over 83-85 even if you're blasting it with Cinebench or something for a prolonged period. Why in the world would I pay $299 for a 360 AIO or whatever? PA was $35.  A large part of me still thinks AIOs are completely unnecessary and a marketing scheme. If your CPU requires an AIO its a bad CPU.

Not to mention tower coolers just look fucking metal.
With the right cooler/fan/thermalpaste combination, you don't need any AIO.
Thermalright <3
im running 7950X3D with noctua dh12a, its awesome.
This convo has been had already, top-end tower coolers can match the performance of water coolers, you never need one.
Well dur.. We know. Stop flexing
Nobody needs one on that chip.  I have an Arctic 360 AIO on mine, and my setup is tuned around noise.  I barely keep the fans going and don't let them auto rev, and the highest I've gotten while gaming (bg3 and wow both make cpus get hot) was 84c for a split second.  Use case is everything, because there isn't really an air cooler that let's me ride the line like I want.
That thing looks like Trump towers
You don't need, but I want.
i just think they're neat ok
Last pic is clean 👌💯
My AIO definitely outperforms my Noctua with my 7800X3D, but you're right. It's not required.
You don't need AIO for even 7950x. I m using noctua D15, and it's good enough.
You don't /need/ an AIO for any processor worth using.

It really isn't until you get to ~200W+ that there starts to be a meaningful advantage, perhaps with a slight exception for chips that get particularly hot in a small area, like overclocked single-CCD parts running 1.35v+.
But: my AIO blows the hot air directly out of my case.
It is ridiculous that things got to the point you would assume AIO is needed by default.
You dont need this cooler either. Slash 2 cores, set cpu to ~80w and you can cool it with low profile cooler easily. Games could care less about 6 or 8 cores of 7000 series.
I woke up, starring at my phone, half awake ....... wondering why in the world my city planning boards mini model of the newest skyscraper to be built was on r/amd. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 .... nice !
No lie, when glancing I thought this was a tower being built up in our city when scrolling through my feed and didn’t realize it came from AMD 😂
Pretty sure I didn’t need to spend $120 on a Noctua Nh-D15. My temps while gaming only reach 60 degrees.
This is The Way.
The pic looked like an aerial photo of some city or downtown
Throwing shots at intel makes this 100 times better
Naw obviously you need the ai thermal paste+10% CPU performance
Peasants. I still have my stock fx 8370 am3 cooler sitting on a 7600X, FEAR MY POWER.
/s

Fr though the newer phantom is that same cooler and *still compatible* that's intense for a 15 year old part
My noctua still going strong on this chip. Didn't want to go for the overpriced AIO and this noctua is performing heavenly.
Dang, I live in 31C.. Lol guess I'll have an excuse to use an AIO
You does not need any fans too.. 🙈
At normal watts it's very easy to keep an intel cpu cool. I have the same temps with a 16year old Thermalright true black and a 13600k at stock \~150watt. I am using it at 4.6ghz with UV(\~97watt) and it's 10C cooler. I just made an account to flex about my old thermalright:P
Idk about that, i used to have a Thermalright PS 120 SE on my 7800x3d and indeed, it was doing just fine. That was until summer arrived and the average temperature outside went up to like 35-40c, with my room at around 30-31.
My idle temps were around 60c which was pretty high for my liking and so i got a 420 aio from arctic. Temps while in idle went down to 49-50c and i rarely see it go up to 80c while loading games or new areas within games. 
You can definitely use an air cooler with this cpu but it depends on your ambiental temperature for sure.
I assume you're not stressing it properly if you're getting 75c with that cooler.

The hottest my cpu got was around the mid to high 80s (prime95) and that's with an nhd15.

I was running heaven in parallel to stress the gpu which does kick out quite a lot of heat.
AMD has problems with idle power consumption though.
[deleted]
Considering how precisely PTM7950 was applied on the 4th photo - I guess it was in a thermal pad form?
My 2016 NHD15 handles me 7950X3D just fine lol. Absolutely not as cool as some of the older chips it cooled (such as a 4790k once upon a time) but certainly cool enough.
I mean, there's a reason people are making a fuss about Thermalright. Their Phantom Spirit 120SE is currently, dollar for dollar, the best air cooler you can get for AM5 CPUs. I know I probably sound like a bot or that I get paid to say this (I wish), but it's genuinely a stupid good cooler for $35. 

Meanwhile, Noctua needs to do 5 years of R&D to gain 0.4% fewer decibels on their revised NH-D15 that costs $150! Pay 1/5th the price and get 95% the performance? Seems pretty obvious to me.
120-150 TDP heatsinks are a must for this CPU
I rolled with a nh-u12a chromax for over a year with my 7950x. Sure, it ran warm but didnt ever hit the thermal limit... that was until i got into video editing (drones) and would see it shoot up close to 95c rendering a few videos. Recently upgraded to a larger case for i could use a 360mm aio. 

Im sure a bigger aircooler would be fine, especially for a 7800x3d.
I'm cooling an FX-6350 (125W) at full load (Handbrake encoding) with a be quiet! Shadow Rock LP with no issues. The issue is getting the heat out of the case because I like quiet cases (be quiet! Pure Base 600).
You don't say! I thought a 120w tdp CPU would require a 420mm aio
I slapped a peerless assassin 120 on mine and the temps are insane. I rarely see it go over 60 degrees. Idles in the low 40s, I've seen upper 30s on a cold morning. I could never go back to standard cpus and definitely not Intel cpus, lol.
I guess it was kind of obvious, it uses like 100W. You need an AIO at way higher power consumption.
my nhd15 runs whisper quiet and keeps temps fine
Which ssd cooler is that, please?
you don't pay my 7800x3D
True, but it overheats sometimes. I don't have bad airflow, it's just the summer that's killing it..........  
Anyway, 75°C+ while gaming 2k hurts to see sometimes xd (also because it peaked at 86°C)

Horizon Forbidden West peaked at 86°C
[removed]
The use case also matters a lot.  

I'm typing on my kitchen computer for example, and while its nice to have a snappy processor, its not working at 100% work loads for long periods of time, so its not going to get heatsoaked.
Back in my day AMD CPU’s ran “hot af” and Intel would run cooler.
Also Intel was much better than AMD.

Times have changed
if aio 78x3d can run 4.8ghz at 75c

  
then air cooling will be 4.4 or 4.5
Is that a pad? Or a different kind of paste?
Marketing for AIOs has been insanely effective. People with 7600(non x) are out thinking they want liquid cooling for their basic ass CPUs. 

They end up paying 5-10x the price for equivalent (or sometimes weaker) cooling. It’s sad.
Ikr, just because it's a fast chip for gaming doesn't mean it needs a 360 aio or a 3 fan dual tower air cooler. It has a low tdp. But to be fair, some people like the look of aios, including myself.
I call bs on this one. I get higher temps with a similar cooler on a 5800X3D. You're even reporting better temps than people in the comments with the same CPU and better coolers. "Full load" doesn't always mean the same thing. I get higher temps in OCCT and Prime95 than in Cinebench.
No more intel for me, embrace AMD
i dont use an AIO on my 78950x. Just a good air cooler. It works wonders
Tbf the Thermalright coolers are around the $30 card. I returned the D15 for a PS120SE which is like $100 less lol
Dont need or benefit from an AIO for any AM4 or AM5 part, that is old news.

That is a slim little one, though.
Both people who've made that claim will be astonished.
Hey, I’m using some super quiet AIO from CoolerMaster with my Ryzen 7800X3D and the temps are <35C during long rendering sessions with DreamWorks’ MoonRay and Pixar’s RenderMan + AI denoiser. Although my case is Corsair 2000D Airflow with meshes on each side and missing front fans.
I think you should find a bigger heat sink. Maybe you won't even need the fans.
I cool it with a AK500, never gone above 80°C
I use the liquid freezer ii. My temperature is 55c on load and I cannot hear any fans. It’s just my preference!
That this post is even necessary is confusing. AIOs have been marketing for anything sub ~180w, as it can be cooled by air easily. Most of the PCs out there do not require water cooling. 
I'm still on my NHD14 from like 2009.
I miss good overclocking
Bruh I dont want to spoil you, but cooling Ryzen non X3D chips (7000 series) to normal temps is harder than on 13/14th gen Intel
Why is nobody talking about that hideous m2 heatsink with rubber bands around it ?
If your doing this out of a case it may well be that it's a cooler environment and your temps are lower as a result. Certainly my 7700x benefits a lot from a water cooler, but it is a hotter chip. If I run my cpu flat out in a torture test it won't throttle, but how much use that is when paying a game is debatable. Ambient temperature of the case does have a direct impact on cpu temps. 
75C under full load? Mine has a phantom spirit 120 SE and went to 90C on a stress test. Hovers at mid 60s while gaming.
I use a cheap Idcooling slim air cooler in a sffpc with a 4090 and a 78000x3d and i have no issues
Tell us you're a noob without saying, no one said you needed needed an AIO for a 7800X3D. Randomly just gonna throw out intel insults because baby got an AMD? Grow up. Also..75 is starting to get warm, it will prob be fine and not throttle but you're getting into that territory.
My 5800X3D is whisper quiet cooled by my Assassin IV
Was anyone saying that you did?  The very moderate power draw is one of the best features of the X3Ds.
Deepcool AK500 on a 7950X (non-3D). No throttling issues so far.
This cooling brick can easily considered as a weapon
[removed]
$20 cooler, $15 thermal paste. The $30 PA120 cooler with the stock paste would probably be running 700rpm for similar temps.
Personally I have no idea why people use AIO at all for home PC's - I wouldn't even consider it
Get any hexa tube and it will work, this is not a i9 that draws 250w.
Me with a 360mm for a 7600x hahahahahahaha
Germany's No°1 computer magazine, the "CT" (Heise\*de), publishes a yearly DIY-build. This year's edition suggests an Endorfy Fortis 5 for the AMD 7800x3d. 

I took an old Pure Rock2 and put a better fan on it for 20$. It is already too much cooling\^\^
You don’t need to put the board in a case either, but it works better that way…
Ok.
Unrelated but what are your thoughts on contact frames for these long CPUs?
I have a AK620 digital works great
Who said you did... It's not a 14900k space heater.
Jokes on u, I got 7800x3d with Noctua NH-U12A with Thermaltake Grizzly Kryonaut thermal paste. I avg 40-50 during idle. 50-60 during gaming. 70 at max utilization. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|laughing)
Main problem with Intel is you can end up with better temps at the same if not slightly higher power but more heat dumped into room. Even so, Zen4 CPUS don't even need half the full power limit to hold 95% of their performance anyways. lol

So you can have a cool room and monster performance CPU while running totally fine temps with proper tuning.
Using the Thermalright Assasin King 120 on my 5700g, won't get over 68-70c under full stress

Amd ftw temperature-wise
Don't forget the fan
You don’t say?
i run PBO 90 5 on air. i will crash if my AC is off in the summer.
I do not have AIO and temps are always usually between 50 and 70°C, right now we're on summer at 35/40°C as reference and i also do nit have AC in that room.
You don't need an AIO for any CPU. I'm using a 13900k on a u12a, no issues
Yeah, my 5800X3D (105W TDP, no OC) runs perfectly fine with the tiny Noctua NH-U12A.
Never took a liquid cooled CPU cooler. Never. And I think never I will.
it's easier to cool a 7800x3D than it is a 5800x3D... mostly due to the fact that a 7800x3D often draws less power and is more efficient therefore... thermally puts out less.

  
Even a AMD Wraith Prism/Max is enough to handle a 7800x3D
This makes me think i need to reapply my TiM on my 5800x. My Dark Rock pro 4 can hit max temp during stress tests on my 5800X when stock; ive tuned it to 115W so it maxes out at 80°C
My $70 aio keeps my 12700k below 50° always. Good luck getting on that level. 🤣😂
I have an AK620 on my 7950X3D and temps are great, so yeah a 7800X3D is pretty easy to cool.
Looks like a micro center combo
At r/sffpc plenty of people cool it (for gaming loads) on a noctua l9a (rated for 65w).
What are your idle temperatures like ?

My Phantom spirit se with thermal right paste on 7800x3d idles at 45-47 and goes till 87 on full load.

Should i use a different paste ?
You never need an aio. An aio is an aesthetic choice foremost, and sometimes a quieter option.
You don't need an aio. But it looks aesthetically pleasing
So I should take the water block out of my cart? :D
Im running my 7800X3D with a deepcool AS500 Plus....and he is soooo cool....solkysmooth.
i dont get aio because i need it

i get it because of the drip
Dont know bro mine reaches up to 90C  with 360 AIO on games with very high cpu load like Battelfield.  
The TDP is low but the temps are still high
i still want a bad chip to play with. sorry. 8088 gang
I thought i was looking at a building
would’ve spent the extra $10 for a dual tower cooler
Installed one in my stepson's build with a Peerless Assassin and it works just fine.  As long as the case had decent airflow there are tons of air coolers that will keep it cool.
No, you could always install a behemoth of an air cooler instead.
there are  better cheap air coolers for $10 more. Anyways, show us your cinebench scores
No one's said this yet but did you take these photos with a professional camera? I would be surprised if you took them with a phone.
You can buy a TR AIO for $50 bux. No point not to get an AIO and keep your room cooler. /Shrug
a crucial difference to remember compared to intel chips, which also are broken unstable degrading garbage sadly....

air coolers also last forever and are cheaper compared to aios.

now personally i am very excited to move past tower air coolers and move to flexible metal tubes, braced, thermosiphon coolers, to have air cooler reliability with aio performance, but that is still at least half a year away.
You don't NEED to, but you would highly benefit from having it.

Sure CPU will run just fine with pretty much any cooler, however the performance of Ryzen CPUs are directly linked to their temperature... obviously there is little bit of silicon lottery, but CPU will boost much higher and will be much stable if you keep it at 45C compared to 75C. Basically, instead of "thermal throttling" Ryzen GPUs "thermally over-clocks" automatically if there is thermal headroom. And at 75C there is no headroom. 

Also I am sure acoustically there is a difference as well, there isn't really any speculation here - it is fact that say 360mm AiO has higher thermal capacity than even best air cooler. Higher mass and higher surface area can dissipate more heat and one does not need to be genius to understand that more heat dissipation = equal better.

I would point out that your testing "methodology" has one big shortfall - open standing motherboard. Basically, it does not reasonably represent heat soaking of the close case, unless you planning to keep the motherboard "open standing". 

Besides - again just simply load testing CPU you are not getting full picture. Okey so you have CPU at 100% load in synthetic application, this proves that your system not going to overheat an shut down... good result, but that is bare minimum. It doesn't prove that processor achieves same boost clocks and same computing power running at 75C... which is high, even ignoring the above fact that you not exactly running realistic test of motherboard in closed case.

It's funny how it used to be the opposite a decade ago, Intel used to be a no-brainier due to power-efficiency, nowadays that's for AMD.
I remember the days when it was the other way around AMD were famous for running hot.
My hyper 212 is rated for like 150-180 w and can’t even cool my 7600x, which has a 105w tdp and 142w PPT. I had to limit it to 110w so it doesn’t get too hot. I meant it was okay for games but not in stress tests
Yeah, just any reasonable cheap cooler should do, I designed a $2800 build for someone and i didnt think any more than a $50 cooler would be useful.
I don't think I've ever seen 100W load on it even torture testing.
I haven't been able to get mine to 100W with any load.    OCCT/CineBench get 80W or something -- it was higher when I had higher IOD voltage though.   Gaming it is usually 55W to 70W.
Yes and no. I wish 100W was just 100W on every CPU but due to differences in the layout of the components that generate that heat the cooling can vary wildly. The 7800X3D is a single CCD chip so all of that heat is coming from a thumbnail sized spot on the IHS and it's also coming through a layer of the V-cache memory, so the same 100W from the 7800X3D is a lot harder to disperse than from, say, a 13600K.
Most people don't realize that the TDP rating has nothing to do with the actual wattage that the CPU pulls. It's what the manufacturer expects to be the required dissipation capacity for the model.

The reason the 7800x3d is rated for 120w TDP is because of the 3d V-cache layer that sits between the cores and the IHS, and also because the IHS on the 7XXX series is thicker to accommodate older coolers.

The chip draws up to \~85W or whatever it is, but AMD recommends a cooler that cools 120w TDP or more to "keep up" with the extra "distance" that the die has to the cooler itself.

It works the same in reverse. If we de-lid, we get lower temps because there is less material for the heat to be dissipated through, we get a more efficient cooling system, and can thus get away with using a worse performing cooler. In other words, we have lowered the TDP.
142W if it's like the 5800X3d, and that's a lot to cool on air.

Maybe I should try that PTM pad thing
For me it's Thermalright Assassin X 120 V2 Plus. I will be much worse with GPU installed, but I see how it well it is.
it's the Honda small engine of CPUs
> bargain bin paste

How dare you come after my Arctic silver 5 like that
Was true in 2002 and it's true today!

Just don't confuse it with Thermaltake.
May thermalright bless our pcs for years to come
you're damn right
Behold the mighty monoliths of cooling 🗿
My Phantom Spirit Evo keeps my 7600x at around 58° while playing warzone and a bit higher on rust lmao
Can't do so for now, but I suspect it will be around 3-5 degrees higher. AMD CPU dies are really small, so it's worth it. Also PTM7950 will just last longer (probably infinity).
From what I've measured with my 2080 Ti, a high performance paste like NH-T1 will perform about 2°C better with equalized fan speed and load for the first month. Though, many high performance pastes are too thin for bare die usage and pump out after 3 months of usage in my (and a friend's) case.

That said, PTM7950 supposedly increases its thermal conductivity after several heat cycles, and that appears to be the case. After several months, my card still stays under 85°C and hasn't hit any thermal limits.

With CPUs, pastes will last longer (1 - 8 years, depending on thickness and load), though in the long term, PTM7950 should perform just as well, if not better than paste.
Are those PTM pads reusable?
Didn't know this was a PC brand, and my mind immediately went to the engine in an M1 Abrams tank.
I have an AC, it's 25°C in the room.
India ?
45 Celsius is "normal"?
That implies the average is around 40C. Nowhere in the world is 40C on average.
I could agree, especially with a hot GPU underneath. But the fact is, this CPU power consumption is like 5 times lower then competitor's and a common cheap tower cooler can handle it in most use cases.
AMD themselves actually: "Liquid cooler recommended for optimal performance"
 https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d.html#:~:text=Liquid%20cooler%20recommended%20for%20optimal%20performance
Imagine a pleasure transferring to this after a "gaming" laptop.
Thanks! This stuff makes laptops and GPUs much better then stock.
>If your CPU requires an AIO its a bad CPU.

True.
Google Pixel does the job!
No way for me to miss the opportunity.
Haha it's in the process, no worries.
Welcome! 

Yes, Intel is manageable too, but with extra effort and performance loss, especially in multicore workloads.
If I were you, I invested these money in AC, to kill two birds with one stone.
Why would they need to stress the cpu "properly". Prime 95 is mostly unrealistic load, there are other ways to test full load temp without doing a torture test.
I will try to push it, and indeed it will be worse with GPU installed. It still will be within 95-99% of maximum performance.
Actually this can be changed by using Best Power Efficiency Power Mode in Windows. Idle consumption will be far less.
Because the thermal transfer on the 7800x3d is bad because of the poorly designed IHS...basically a normal air cooler would provide similar results .
Which is a great thing if you figure that out before buying
27??? Jesus hell! How do you live like that?! 🤣
Did you do the -30 pbo?  Mine probably hit 70-75c full load with that setup and ambient temp.
You have a beefy GPU and a little bit of dry thermal paste?
Yes, it is. I just cut the proper sized rectangular by a scissors. Went really really well.
Same here, I set my 7950X3D to never go above the 120W default TDP and the NH-D15 handles it perfectly fine, a lot of performance and silent operation.
To be honest I went with Thermalright Assassin X 120 V2 Plus as it was the cheapest one in PCpartpicker for my filter. And I don't like coolers be too bulky and heavy, just a preference. I think my friend have one you mentioned with PTM7950 on 5700X3D - that thing is cold AF.
Only a 420mm? 

[https://www.techpowerup.com/324682/watercool-announces-the-mo-ra-iv-radiators-for-200mm-fans](https://www.techpowerup.com/324682/watercool-announces-the-mo-ra-iv-radiators-for-200mm-fans)

I think we all need this!
you joke but i've seen shitloads of 7800x3D builds with 360/420mm AIO's for whatever reason
Too be honest I can't specify the name, a cheap no-name one. It's basically a piece of uncoated cooper, I bought it as it's thin and fitted well in my laptop. Look for marketplaces like AliExpress or Amazon.
Damn, mine peaked at 93°, and I ise an Ak620 on it.
Ambient temps are around 35-40 though, summer is a bitch.

And it was in Far Cry 5 of them all games, nuts! Peaked at 70 in Division 2 though
It's a Thermalright Assassin X 120 V2 Plus. A little bit weird one with reversed second fan.
This coins flips every 2-3 generations I think.
A cut from the sheet of Honeywell PTM7950. Phase changing thermal compound. Soft when hot, solid when cold.
We are in the undervolting era.
Yea it's cheap no-name one. It's basically a piece of uncoated cooper, I bought it as it's thin and fitted well in my laptop. Cools this 980 Pro well by the way, from ~70 to ~50.

Sounds reasonable to be honest haha
Actually I see no reason to use them, but maybe just to prevent thermal paste to get into the CPU heat spreader gaps. 
But Noctua's offset brackets can be effective, as the CPU hotspot is not in the middle.
The fact is with the Intel i7/i9 CPUs you loose a lot of multicore performance without a beefy cooling. With lower TDP like 125 watts it will be only like 80% performance, while the Ryzen will be at 95% with a 4 heat pipe tower.
Pretty sure it's a thermal interface issue so yea, try PTM7950 too.
Pretty sure it's a thermal interface issue so yea, try PTM7950 too.
Oh it's not, just me using pcpartpicker to cheap out.
That's fine. Mine is idling at \~50.   
87 is kinda toasty tho
You have an issue with the thermal interface or airflow. Or it's really hot in your room.
Decided not to, as they are too bulky not easy to manage. Decided to cheap out in this and don't make too heavy and pricey.
Thanks, it's just a Pixel 7. Google camera software is really good.
Actually the room will be the same or even hotter if I am gonna use AIO ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
I wish Intel didn't have degrading chips because its unwitting customers are the ones who get the shit end of the stick.

Regardless, we need more competitive fabs out there than just samsung or tsmc. Competition is always good, and this defect crisis doesn't bode too well for intel foundry services.

One day, AMD might start fabbing its chips in intel foundries, using intel process nodes if tsmc tries to price gouge them.
You explained it the best
Tests with fully assembled system are to be done, I expect it to be worse but still acceptable.

 If not this very cheap tower cooler, but another bigger one can handle it even in worse conditions.
Which one exactly? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry) It's not finished obviously.

I remember a friend of mine had a 1600AF and eventually it went bad and it wouldn’t boot below 1.4V regardless what frequency it was at so I give him my 5800X as a gift since I upgraded my computer to a 5900X, also this was years ago and the AMD stealth cooler is terrible
I had my 1600 OC to 4025 ahah, using a crappy 120mm AIO from CoolerMaster, with a 1.325v. I could run Prime95 on it for 12 hours without crashes, and the temps never went above 68c.

When I upgraded to the 5700X, I couldn't just sell it or give it away, so I kept it. That CPU was so much fun to tinker with!
It would need to be underclocked somewhat and TDP-limited pretty low. The power draw is similar, but the heat density is way higher and harder to transfer.
Instead of wraith stealth, I would love to a wraith spire/prism being tested on these cpus
I pushed mine to 3.88 lol
coming from somebody who's done this. DO NOT TRY AT HOME. under normal load the stock 1600 cooler is sufficient for desktop and MAYBE some very very light gaming. I did this and tried to play whatever the new call of duty game was at the time (MW2 2022 I think) and halfway into a match the computer would just start to thermal throttle and sometimes even blue screen. 1600 cooler is definitely impressive for a stock cooler but it's for sure worth the extra 100-200 for a decent cooler for your 7800X3D 🫡
i never understood going intel for a 20W difference on anything that doesn't run on a battery. nowadays you go amd for a 200W difference. _that's_ a no-brainer.

seriously my rig would have to be very different if it had to accommodate a 250-300W 14900k instead of the 75W 7800x3d that's currently in it. and that's assuming i don't get one that has rusted vias. the cooling considerations alone would make it far more bulky and loud.

(>!yes i know copper oxide is not _technically_ rust but then again neither is the unoxidized iron alloys of "spinning rust"!<)
They never ran that hot tbf people just always joked about it with amd hardware but between amd and Intel I think they were about the same.
Time to upgrade to Arctic Freezer 36 then... hell if you sell that Hyper 212 you will probably break even (it's $20 cooler :) )
Hell the highest i’ve gotten my 5800X3D has been around 85w averages closer to 70w after pbo tuning though.
Yeah I can't confirm directly because I don't have one myself but for the testing I've done on clients PCs it's quite right
I can hit 96w or so in prime95 with a 360mm aio and 103mhz bclk. So yea it seems really hard to hit 100w


Edit: why would someone downvote this lol
Yes but it also means having a 420mm aio won't help much compared to a normal air cooler , on the 7800x3d. Issue being the IHS and thermal dissipation
High end air coolers like the NH D15 are rated for 200w give or take. You gotta get a large air cooler for over 175w which is even more than a 7950x3d. 

The PTM7950 isn’t as good on CPUs as it is on GPUs or anything that you would debate between using thermal compound or Liquid Metal. Its benefit is from being very resistant to pump out. There’s a range of temps that it will just flat out perform better but its temp specific. Someone made a long post around 6-9 months ago doing testing and the only time that it was beaten was by the pastes that dry faster like KPX or kryonaut extreme when the package is lower than 80c or something along those lines. 

I have used both and landed on sticking with kryonaut extreme or KPX for my CPU since replacing paste is fast and easy and I don’t need to like drain my loop to do. Every other component that I put paste on uses PTM7950. 

You just need to make sure that you get a proper Honeywell PTM7950 and not a knockoff which usually means buying from a site like MODDIY and having it shipped from china. Most sites just had knockoff components.
I've read it will get a bit better too once it's heat cycles enough. Seems, though it doesn't have a traditional cure time like some of the old pastes do, like arctic silver did with 90 hour cure time, it still has some kind of cure time as it needs to heat up enough a few times to really spread out and hit it's potential. Also told it likes lots of pressure, so it might be one of the first thermal compounds that will benefit from the user having a torque screwdriver to get the perfect amount of pressure and not overstrain the mobo mounts.
Longevity is not really a concern on desktop CPUs. It's a concern on laptops and some GPUs (both are direct die).

PTM7950 performs the same as regular good thermal paste.
The main reason to use PTM7950 is longevity tbh. It's fairly (if not totally?) resistant to the pump out effect that plagues a lot of modern GPU's. CPU's have an IHS so it's not as big of a deal but should still be nice.

On my 5700XT, I repasted it damn near a dozen times with different pastes, including NT-H1, but every time after a month or two my hotspot temps would shoot back up. Stock settings we're talking going from high 80's or low 90's hot spot under load, to low-mid 100's, after a month. Still within spec technically but not comfortable. My card is seemingly the GOAT of pumping out pastes lol.

With PTM, I put it on a few months ago now and my hot spots are the same as when I put it on if not lower, in the mid 80's depending on the ambient temp and shit. With the undervolt I normally run, I can set my fans to not go over 30% and the hotspot barely touches 90 unless it's hot out.

I seriously don't think I'll be using another GPU without PTM7950 on it, it has made my experience so much more consistent lol.
Not reusable since they turn solid-like at room temp. The pad will become flaky when you remove the cooler.
I live in India. It used to be 25 to 35 C. Now it is 30 to 40 C average. Temperature has gone up considerably.
A tropical country or somewhere in the Middle East?
Pretty normal in central valley in California for the past 2 summers!
Not normal for Serbia, but last week it was over 40c every fucking day. It never goes below 30c. Even at night, you can't even sleep. It is horrible.
in a world with a climate change, yea.. kinda is nowadays
It isn't in most places but the heatwave all around the world is making the weather go bonkers
wdym? have you been in a tropical country before? if we get 25C here we're already freezing while 25C on other region are considered hot
Look, there are shitty and good air coolers, some are great ones, but the worst ones will not be able to cool 7800x3d properly.

The worst AIOs are still a lot better than the worst air coolers.

AMD is just playing safe, that's it.
Yeah liquid coolers are recommended for optimal performance? What’s wrong with that lol
AMD recommends it because the 7800x3D can hit 95c with some air coolers under 100% workloads, and thus thermal throttle the boost performance.

It's easier for them to say 'we recommend an AIO' rather than 'we recommend a good air cooler' and consumers dont know what constitutes a 'good air cooler'
Recommended isn't required. And optimal also doesn't mean required. It just means for absolute best case for performance and experience. It's just because not all air coolers are good or sufficient and most aios would be.

I recommend you go straight to the objective. It doesn't mean you need to or can't go in a whole ass circle around it.
Okay. 😁 Have a good job / play 👍🏻
In other countries, like germany, energy is so expensive that an AC is definitely a last resort only
i found the aio open box for around 55 dollars and they had a lot of open box units, probably people buy them without realizing 420mm aios dont fit in most cases and then they just return them.
Prime95 is useful as a worst case scenario, for example my cpu peaked at 88C with prime whereas while playing gta online at 4k and max settings while listening to the custom radio it got up to 87C.

Most games have me hovering in the high 60s to mid 70s but gta seems to be special for some reason.

Also doing heavy decompression also got me to 88C.
With a fan you can cool yourself just like your PC!
Thank you. Does this cool the SSD and works well?
be careful, i had 5 of them and none survived for longer than 2 months (copper itself is fine, but those rubbers just cracked and popped eventually.
Reading this I feel lucky with my temps not even going near 90°C... glhf with this summer, Winter will be a blast for it tho, we won't need to turn on any heat in the room, just need to gaming a bit xdd
[removed]
Is this more suited for certain processors or can this be used in stead of paste in general?

I’m over the paste anxiety but I’d like this even more
Ah thanks
Im scoring 41200 on a stock 13900k and a u12a. Hits 85c. Im not sure what you are talking about
i have some Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut, but  I dont think i applied it to it when i built it at the time  
I do want to get some PTM7950 though, especially for my steam deck
Yea i switched the CPU cooler 3 times with aircoolers and Aios. i have 4 intake and 4 exhaust and the room temp is around 20-25C. after looking trough many forums i found out that the temps i have are pretty standard maybe 5C difference. SO what i learned from that was that the 7000 cpus are running very hot.  
Interessting to see that you get such low temps with that small cooler. i have 45-55C Idle temps and 75-85 gaming temps. unless its a game like BF.
I phrased it incorrectly. You can get better performance with the same ambient room temps. You are not accounting for CPU hot spots, thermal throttling, etc.

Sure you can cool AMD chips with air coolers without issue and be perfectly fine. I am not arguing that. However, water cooling is far superior in every way and allows for more performance tweaking. AIO's are not even that expensive anymore thanks to thermal right.
>out there than just samsung or tsmc

samsung isn't competitive at all sadly.

it is rightnow tsmc or.... tsmc.

and yeah if the gamersnexus  video of the ongoing investigation turns out correct:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTeubeCIwRw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTeubeCIwRw)

and the issue is oxidation due to a screwed up anti oxidation layer application, then that is pretty much as bad as possible as it is a foundry fail and not a chip design fail.

who wants to get billions of dollars worth of chips fabed at intel, when that could destroy your company, because intel couldn't manage to not frick up the process and now you got millions of failing chips after you went through the pain of dealing with intel to save some money in the first place.....

if that is true,

then the thought of going with intel foundry isn't just:

"yeah let's risk the much higher work to get our chips done by intel vs tsmc and the potential new node delays."

to

"let's risk our entire business, because intel might screw up the process node and leave us int he shit as we both go bankrupt.... "

:D

and amd would be quite unlikely to use intel in the future. amd has quite a tight connection with tsmc.

i see nvidia going with intel before amd and for that nvidia probably wants to see intel arc to no longer exist in the first place...
Again - that is irrelevant. 75C is not good temp for Ryzen, especially X3D. That your PC does not overheat, does not mean it get's to it's full potential.
Good ole CPU lottery
That was bassicaly my 3600x it did run a 100mhz boost on all cores for about a week before randomly deciding to become majorly unstable when in game so i turned it off and it worked fine after that sold it to my cousin so he gets to deal with it now got a 7700x now
Same, by some miracle, I managed to get it to an all-core 3.9ghz clock in Bios but my RAM that was rated at 3200mhz refused to go above 2933mhz.

1st gen Ryzen stability issues were an absolute bitch.
My 3900x would not OC for shit either. BSOD then the ram would reset XMP.
[deleted]
IIRC the Ryzen 7 7800x3D takes 120-170w, which is alot, but it looks cooler and more efficient than the Intel i9 12-13-14th gen, my old Intel i3-2100 and the recent ones take around 65w, which is a fair amount for these CPUs, but a high-end CPU Ryzen 7 7800x3D using 75w while delivering great performance is incredible.
As someone who had an FX 8150 and 8350 overclocked to 4.8GHz and 5.1GHz 24/7, they def ran hot ahahaha
lol they absolutely were not, the excesses of Bulldozer were equally as absurd as i7/i9 today. When you see 200w as less of a limit and more of a starting point you know somethings gone very, very wrong.
y-cruncher will get it up there. I've seen it pull 120w on earlier AGESA versions.
Used to have a regular 5800x and I still have my AIO on the x3D. Sure it’s overkill, but it was only $70 for a h115i platinum refurbished anyways.
meanwhile my 5600X does around 110w on Cinebench R23 with auto limits
Idk, I’ve gotten my 5800x3d to 96w and 88c on a 360rad
Yes, you don't need more than a single tower AIO for the 7800X3D if your room temp is below 25°C. I remember when the chip first came out buildzoid was running it flat out without throttling using AMD stock cooler.
They have some up in Canada

https://www.lttstore.com/products/ptm7950-phase-change-thermal-pad?_pos=1&_psq=therm&_ss=e&_v=1.0
I'm using a Dark Rock 4, so it's 180W iirc, but it just can't follow up, the CPU throttles at around 122 watts in a power virus.

Maybe I should upgrade the case's fan, looks like 3x120mm 1200RPM ones are not enough anymore
I applied it on my GPU and gave it a decent amount of pressure, temps got worse over time (120c hotspot) as the paste on the middle thins out (to the point where it's bare metal contacting on some spots) and accumulates on the side of the heatsink.

I scraped all of it and placed it back in the middle and just screwed it in enough to not come loose, now temps are 25c cooler. After that experience I figured that it just hates pressure.
There are multiple charts out now demonstrating that PTM is the closest thing you can get to Liquid Metal cooling-wise with so much less hassle.  I’m never doing another build without it
Actually you can put these dry pieces in the pile, and they will melt again. So it's reusable at least to some point.  
Me and my friend did this and it works well, the same as new sheet.
Yea i don't live there but i got a buddy in new delhi and its been looking rough for him lately 😅
43c in Phoenix AZ every summer for 50 days +
I live in Thailand. Nowadays weather tops out at 33C, but in summer it maxed out at like 39C or so at peak time. Always dips below 30C at night. In the rare case 25C comes around it's not "freezing". It's just a nice day where it's not hot for once. A lot of people who live in tropical countries blow things out of proportion.
Sure, but for $10 less than the cheapest AIO you can buy, you can probably find 10 different air coolers that *out*-perform it. Single block AIOs are actually quite shit, especially if they need to handle a steady state load. Say, a quite normal task of setting your 8 core CPU to do a video transcode for 10 minutes. The cheapest ones are also most likely to fail.
Thanks! It's a pleasure to get back to the desktop after two years of laptop only suffering.
Tbh, I'd still suffer. 😭
Yep, pretty much. It's an OEM 980 Pro, temps dropped significantly. From 70ish to 50ish.
Thx, yes this happens with those. Luckily the dual sided tape there holds really really strong, it will not fall off even without rubber bands.
We're getting back on the "buy amd if you want free heater" train again, huh 😂
This means you need to install both fans with the frame facing the heatsink. So they will blow in the same direction.
This can be applied everywhere where a generic thermal paste can be.
Sounds good
Try PTM7950 too. Thermal paste is really important for these CPUs.
Gloflo 14nm was basically a beta test node that got refined over the lifespan of the 1000 series. Which is why the silicon quality for core and imc is all over the place. The real 14nm thats ready for production is the "12nm" node that zen+ used.
Wow, I kind forgot which type of AMD cooler goes to which cpu
True, although Ryzen 1600X came with the Wraith Spire while Ryzen 2600, 3600, 5600 were the Wraith Stealth. The 2600X and 3600X still came with Wraith Spire, but they took out the copper slug.

Didn't know they revised the Wraith Stealth.
welp i could never get mine to go over 75W, not even with torture tests. is there a setting i just forgot to use?
It shouldn't. That has to be some PBO / Auto OC stuff going on.  
Unless you're calculating from the wall?
You sure about that? My 7800x3d rarely goes above 40-50w when gaming and might hit 90-100 during a torture test. It might pull 120+ with the igpu enabled but why would anyone leave that enabled?
I had an 8350 and temps never went over 60c
Bulldozer was proper hot.
As someone who owned one I beg to differ.
Mine does close to 130w in cinebench.
I’ve had an AIO from my 1600 to my 1700X to my 3900X but then it stopped cooling my 3900X and I went for a Dark Rock 4 and it’s cooler and quieter now
My steam machine has a 5600X and when I OC it it can pull almost that high if I set it to the “motherboard” auto limits setting in bios. But 90% of the time its around 50w in ecomode because im too lazy to change the paste that is desperately needs lol.
Yep. And I mean if you know that before you buy a cooler, it's very good for saving money
Theres a ton of things that can go into that equation. You can’t really diagnose much with just knowing the power consumption. You’re either getting voltage locked, thermal locked, or your LLC can be adjusted from just the CPU settings. Case setup if you have bad airflow would prevent the CPU from cooling. Finally ambient temps would make a difference. That’s more of a watercooling thing but if you use your comp in an oven like me having your room at 35c will make all temp changes more drastic than someone in a 20c room. 

My gut thought would be relatively poor airflow due to dust, LLC could be set to be more aggressive with a steeper offset, or the thermal paste needs to be replaced.
No: [https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-thermal-paste](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-thermal-paste)

On air cooling it was \~0.5°C better than regular paste. On water cooling it was \~1°C worse. Overall it's the same.
Frozen notte 240 is like $50 compared to $35 phantom spirit which has basically the same performance. Ur basically paying $15 for aesthetics
You should try it. You might acclimate. For some reason, I went from 25C to 27C and felt more comfortable, especially with a fan if I need it. I lower it when I need to sleep since beds are hot and it's cooler outside so AC is more efficient.
ok i will check that out thanks
My old R7 1700 was a bitch for memory stability.
When I finally got things (relatively) stable at 3200mhz CL14 I was ecstatic.
I was basing those numbers on the Ryzen 7 and 9 7000x since they're powerful and never mentioned since they're powerful, so I thought that the Ryzen 7 7800X3D would get a decently high amount of power to deliver great performance, I don't have much experience with AMD CPUs, or at least not the High-end ones since I've mostly used Intel PCs, so it would be great to learn about AMD CPUs so I can buy a laptop or a desktop.
Well in a stock form they weren't that bad, if you OC'd them, you'd quickly find out why. Pretty sure 60C was without messing anything...
I suppose it greatly depends on radiator size. My 280mm rad has only a 4-10degree in coolant temp. It’s not very instantaneous however, I have noticed that.
That was compared to premium pastes.  I was saying it’s the best you’re going to get cooling-wise aside from Liquid Metal and because of the longevity I stand by it. It’s a set and forget solution

Edit, that same article reflects my original statement. Just look at the bar chart :)
3D chips tend to consume less power as they have lower clocks and those last few hundred mhz demand more voltage and exponentially raise power draw.
Most people won't even touch overclocking especially on a stock cooler.. so that's a minor issue. 60c without overclocking is actually pretty good compared to today's standards.
Mine was a 240mm radiator from Deepcoolb(Captain 240EX White edition) love the thing but it’s like 8 years old now lol.

Off topic but damn still running a 1080Ti eh? You gonna upgrade to AMD or Nvidia? I love my 3060Ti, upgraded from a 1060 6GB so massive upgrade
Im pretty sure that's now, as overclocking is basically dead nowadays (as the new thing is undervolting to achieve higher boost clocks), back in the Phenom/FX era most people would def touch overclocking.
I don’t even know how old mine is honestly, probably should get replaced in another year or two. 

I haven’t update my flair here. I have a 3080 FTW3 now lol, with a 5800X3D.
It may seem like a lot of people overclocked back in the day but that's mostly due to them being the only ones talking about it. overclocking isn't exactly for just anyone to jump in and do as it was still a dangerous process and would scare most people away from trying from what I remember. you'd also have to keep tweaking and running benchmarks to ensure everything was stable and most people didn't have the mindset to be capable of doing all that back then.
Oh good haha. The 1080Ti held up a long time but not THAT long haha. FTW3 3080 is a great card. I really want to get an EVGA card now that they are out of business. Wanted a 40 series card but a 12GB 3080 from EVGA would be great too. My sister wants a new GPU she has a 1060 so I might give her my 3060Ti
Yeah I loved EVGA so it’ll be my last card for awhile. I’ve been buying strictly EVGA for years now, never once have I RMAd a card from them. So I was a little disappointed the seller didn’t have the box. But I still have my 3070 FTW3 I gave to my GF so not all is lost (yeah I went from a 3070 to a 3080 FTW3 lol). 

I got my sister a 2080 Super I believe, off a friend I made on Marketplace
How many editors does it take to change a light bulb?
Why do you want to change it?
If we change the light bulb, we have to change everything else.
We can change it, but you won't like it
I think that's a change we can push back on
I like the lightbulb, I do.  Great beginning lightbulb.  Just wondering if there is a more anthemic lightbulb we could try.
Editor: *Doesn't change the lightbulb*--Here's the new lightbulb!


Client: Looks great!
Okay in my contract it says you will have three changes for free. But that doesn't cover for the lightbulb tho.
If you really want, we can do Lightbulb_v17, but it’ll be another overage charge. And I still think v2 was the strongest.
This is the fifth time you've asked me to change the lightbulb, and you do not like any of my replacement lightbulbs. If you can not articulate what type of lightbulb you want, I can't do my job.

You are now out of revisions as per the contract, and future revisions will be charged at $100 per hour.

OH, you wanna go back to the original lightbulb? Sure thing...
Can we please just present the light bulb to the client as is and not proactively auto-censor ourselves all the time? Maybe then our output wouldn't always be shitty by committee.
You want to change the music too?
Did you use the best lightbulbs?
Editor: sure we can change the light bulb. What bulb do you want?

Producer/Client: What do you mean?

Ed:  What color temp, how bright, where should I place it in the room, want a dimmer switch, on/off or always on?

Prod: can you make it look... magical?
Can we change it more dynamically?
I actually tried changing it. but put it back because it didn’t really fit the narrative and I figured you’d not like it. We can try again if you’d like but dark is pretty zeitgeisty right now. Oh, what did you want for lunch? I feel like sushi or tacos.
We work in the dark. There’s a light?
None.

It’s the post managers duty to find a suitable workforce for that. 

He wouldn’t want to deal with the union…
All these replies are cracking me up and raising my blood pressure at the same time 😆
Its not my job, either so it in online, or hire a VFX specialist to do it.
That’s damn funny…!!! 🤣
There is only one editor good enough to change final_final_final_pleasegod_makeitstop.prpro (recovery)
The lighting would be inconsistent, we would have had to change all the light bulbs a week ago.
Me - “rotates the lightbulb slightly” 
Client - now it’s perfect!
1 editor can change the lightbulb, and the homeowner’s cousin’s wife’s friend’s daughter who “works in the industry” can provide some valuable insight along the way.
That’s actually a really industry-standard piece of knowledge, you should be posting this question in r/videoediting
Is there a better lightbulb?
1, whilst 99 executives argue about how best to do it
How many producers does it take to change a light bulb?

Can we make it a flashlight instead?
I changed it already, you didn't even notice.
"None, it's fine the way it is"
Never mind, my nephew is going to bring in his own light bulb and do it better than you could and cheaper too.
The whole show is edited to the color of the lightbulb. If we change the bulb, we have to start all over. Please sign this change order. Plus, it's your responsibility to get clearance of the lightbulb's color, in writing.
Is this the best lightbulb?
This whole thread is cracking me up
You need to get me the lightbulb that you want in there
“Actually, can you just give me the lamp and teach me how to change the lightbulb in case I need to change it again in the future?”
None, that's what AEs are for.
What’s wrong with cutting to black? It’s a creative choice
Any way to make this lightbulb more cinematic?
I put that lightbulb in the scene that needed to be changed so they wouldn't ask to change the music.
I think it’s fine the way it is, but we can try the change if you want.
Depends on if the bulb has been transcoded.
Editors don’t need lightbulbs, we work in the dark
One but everyone will tell them to try it 100 different ways
The lightbulb provided is not compatible and does not work. I can make a suggestion that presents similar results but incompatible. Again, my suggestion isn’t because I don’t like your lightbulb, it’s because it does not work. Dont like it? So THATS why you want another editor to change the bulb? Be my guest, they will say something similar
It depends on the finishing schedule
That’s the assistant editors job
Yes, but only with the latest update installed
So by new lightbulb you mean adjust the brightness?
I love it, but can we make the lightbulb just a little more blue?
It’s giving brightness but the luminescence is lacking
Pond 5 only has so many lightbulb change clips I'm going to have to ask the AE to change it
Ehhhh I don’t really do that stuff (I absolutely could though) - but I know a great vfx guy we can call.
It only takes one editor, but that editors has to be the one who gets the rest of the room to say yes at the same time.
2. One to run around screaming & the other to shag the electrician.
Updating....
Depends on how dynamic you want the lightbulb to be.
My nephew who just graduated high school can change that... He's pretty good in FCP.
"We like the light, but can we change the color?"
Well ackhually 🤓☝️
Client: this is a good start on changing the light bulb but we will need to change it. 

Editor: sure what light bulb do you want to see?

Client: I’m not sure but we will know when we see it
Ya know what? Just sent me the glass and the wires, my cousin who started Tik Toky College 101 will put the light bulb together
How many Creative Directors does it take to change a lightbulb?

🤷‍♂️ Does it _have_ to be a lightbulb??!!
How many Script Supervisors does it take to change a lightbulb?

“_The lightbulb can’t change!!!”_
What if we take two frames out of the lightbulb?
Could we just look at the box of second unit lightbulbs again?  Maybe we missed something the last 6 times we looked at them.
The lightbulb is working really well now but client has some new music options.
Three. First brings the chair, second stands on it and third kicks the chair out from under the second
Extra charge if you watch the editor over the shoulder or give him advise😂
Just fix it in post!
Can we just fix the lightbulb in post?
I first heard this joke as:
Q- How many online editors does it take to change a light bulb?
A- Only one, but are you sure you really want to change it?
That's thebone I've always heard
You also felt it lacked energy and a certain pop?
I think the lightbulb can be more rustic and modern.
We just really need this to be a high end lightbulb
💀😂
Or the opposite - I’ve changed the lightbulb and adjusted the dimmer, and went ahead and opened the curtains as well to let even more light in.

Client: it still looks the same to me. Can we try a different, brighter bulb?
Trim In - 0 - Enter
After you’ve been through all the lightbulbs please change it back to the original lightbulb
oh my god I am triggered
This is the best response.
i am laughing my ass off thank you :))))
I think he meant to make it "viral"
(if they really insist on changing the light bulb this close to lunch...) It's Sushi!!!
LOL stressful
Editing teacher here. The (recovery) at the end makes my eye twitch.
This one 🤣🤣🤣
I thought it was supposed to be fake answers only!?
How's many art directors does it take....... 
.... Who said it has to be a light bulb???
Same
I wouldn't mind if the bulb had a little.....pop.
Damn.... You beat me to this!!!
>:)

:)
😅😅
This made me shoot milk out of my nose.... Funny thing is,  I'm not drinking milk right now🤔
haha thank you!
I think we should warm it up a little bit.

Hey Mac Users! No, you should NOT upgrade to OSX 15 Sequoia
Yeah, it should go without saying…but I'm counting the days before someone posts Avid/Adobe/Whatever has stopped working because they upgraded the OS.

Wait. *Wait some more*.

Wait until *at very least* Apple has released at 15.0.1 **and** (whatever tool you use) has done a dot release.

Taking your working system and making it *"not working"* just to have the latest OS…is nearly always a mistake. Let someone else make this mistake.

And if you can stand it… Please go into your Mac's settings and turn OFF Auto Update.
no. i want to run a beta on a beta and then complain why nothing works. and you can't stop me!
Gives me bad flashbacks to when Microsoft pushed an update that forced my remaining windows computers to "upgrade" to windows 11 even though autoupdate was disabled. 

Waking up to that was an Invasion of the Body Snatchers moment.
It should be standard practice to just look at the [Media Composer Version Matrix](https://avidtech.my.salesforce-sites.com/pkb/articles/en_US/compatibility/en267087) and stick to that.
This is excellent advice.

That said, I tried Avid Media Composer on Sequoia and it works just fine.

Adobe Creative Cloud seems to be a little finicky, however.
I never allow work machines to update to anything but seemingly finally versions.

When Apple finally releases MacOS 16, that’s when I’ll be updating from the last update of 14 to the last update of 15. I do the very same with Adobe. I avoid the vast majority of bugs, and waiting a single year for new features just isn’t that big of a deal.

This also means that I’m usually only updating once a year instead of every couple of weeks.
Can’t wait. I work for a massive company and their computers are all managed. They’ll stop working if I don’t upgrade. So I’ll see what happens and report back
I usually update Mac OS about 8–9 months after it first comes out. Unfortunately it takes at least that long for all my software to update for it.
I updated
LoL, I’m on 13.6.1 with no plans to upgrade anytime soon.
Wut? you mean the update wont allow me to put 6hrs of 4K .mp4s in a timeline and have it play in RT?
lol I still have an old MacBook running SNOW LEOPARD so I can still author the odd DVD, I never update UNLESS I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. My new MBP works great with whatever is just before this latest OS update, and will stay that way for a while. Wise words, OP. Let someone else break their workflow, this guy’s got bills to pay.
I’m on 15 as currently didn’t have any active projects going, went smooth. Using davinci and everything is working. The upgrade is so basic this year, don’t think they have even changed anything much under the hood. At least my Mac Studio M1 Max feels a bit snappier now. Just don’t use their new dynamic wallpaper, I was seeing about 600mb of ram usage with those
My standard practice has always been to stay one version behind. New OS comes out, upgrade to the previous one. If I have to break that rule, then I'll do a complete system backup on a separate drive and then run the update, just in case it breaks anything critical. It's just not worth the gamble. Is that shiny new update reaaallly necessary? (It's not.)
Always stay 1 macOS version behind, and/or only upgrade if they force you because you bought new hardware that requires it

macOS has been hot trash since 10.7. they prioritize new features and bloat over bug fixes and optimization, because of shareholders who demand constant growth
Eh I'm a sucker for a new OS on release day. I've done it for as long as I can remember and I've never lost so much as a render file.

Yeah I know it's not the super professional thing to do but fuck it I'm a freelancer, no one can stop me 😃
Corporate editor here. I’m doing the upgrade as we speak. Then if nothing works, I get to use that as an excuse to be lazy for a week. But if everything goes well, then I can report back. 👍
We're using the release of Sequoia as an excuse to put off updating from Monterey.... No point going to Sonoma now, right? We might as well wait until Sequoia is stable....
Work says I have to!
I'm still on ventura and pretty happy lol
Yeah.  Never update the OS or any application on your work computer for a long time after it's released and you've searched for issues. **EVER.** Every time someone does this they get screwed...

On my personal laptop, on a different system: sure if you've waited a few days and looked around.
wow this is quite the public service announcement!
100% I wait like 6 months after a major OS upgrade.
Constant battle between a new Mac OS release, other software like Blackmagic desktop and the premier/avid bugs. Never ends But we do see some interesting quirks.
I upgrade on a non mission critical machine as a way to test compatibility with different apps, drivers, hardware, etc, in order to catch problems before upgrading the rest of my computers.
Personally I’m still rocking MacOS 12 to be honest. I could go newer and it would work fine but I don’t like messing with what works. There’s really no groundbreaking features in MacOS releases that I tend to care about at the professional level enough to upgrade. At home sure but not on my work machine.
I’m running Final cut 7 on Mac OS XvTiger. No problems here
Installing OS X! Aqua chic.
I never update anything until minimum 6 months after for bugs to be fixed, that includes the editing software
Weird then that I've already switched and have encountered exactly zero issues with Adobe or anything else
It always happens and I almost fell for it this time again but then I got reminded ;)
I'm glad you finally understand how macs work; now you just have to realize how mac users work..😂
I dad it, and now I has regerts. Safari is in the corner rocking back and forth from the trauma, and display manager is fussy. Even duck duck go flew south. Chrome surprisingly did not break. And now I have a glorified mac waiting on for it's fix like the junkie it is.
I still have PTSD from Avid XpressDV and a Windows “hotfix” circa 2002 that broke exporting or something. 

I’d get every system back-revved only to have the “chief technical officer” come through a few days later and turn auto-updates back on. One time I heard him yelling at a newer editor about “who keeps turning auto-updates off?” and I ran to the suite he was in and I, probably not so politely, explained why we shouldn’t auto-update. He flustered about trying to tell me about viruses and all that and I told him that we could either leave the systems set the way they were (working) or he and I could have a meeting with the owner and he could explain why none of our projects were getting exported.
I installed it and Premiere works just fine.
fuck it we ball
The problem is that Adobe and Final Cut users have been complaining about 14.6.1 since its release.   The real question is, did Apple walk back the change in Sonoma that created so many issues or is Sequoia going to make it worse?
Thank you for this. I am new to using macs (Only got one for FCP.)
The geniuses at the genius bar upgraded by system and now my $3000 Adobe licensed Creative Suite software doesn't work. Nothing I can do. I am super pissed.
Rule #1 as an editor: Never update your system in the middle of a project.  

When I decide to update Avid i run a dual boot. I create a new volume on my Mac. Then I check the avid version matrix for a Mac osx version and the version of avid that is compatible. For the .dmg files I go here as they have the individual point releases. 

https://mrmacintosh.com/

Once I’ve got my volume set up I launch the installer from my current osx and point it to the new volume that I created on my system drive. Once it installs you can open settings and type “start up disk” and it will allow you to choose which osx you boot into. That way if the new osx and avid are not behaving I can revert to my working set up.  You don’t have to do this in premiere because it keeps the previous versions of the software installed so you could just launch the last known working version if there’s an issue. Hopefully this helps someone out there.
One of my mac's on 13.6.9. 

Any way to upgrade to 14.x instead of 15?
There is a workaround with Mac OS Sequoia if you are having a WiFi and or vpn issues.
I made a huge mistake and I upgraded from Sonoma to Sequoia yesterday, because it popped up on me in notification. All day I say to myself: you idot, why? Today a repaired it about 16 hours (back to Catalina, all upgrades back to Sonoma — don't know why, but nothing went as it should have), because computer didn't boot, stuck in bootloop with black screen and some white text. It was destroyed, I had to much work and couldn't do it all day, it was big problem in my job. Uff, Apple is worse than windows now, many dirty words I said per day.
I’m still waiting. I need 15.0.3 or 15.1.
i need to run xcode but it require higher os ehat should i do
Damn
I still wish I never upgraded to Sonoma. KILLED my battery :|
Can anyone help with a WiFi fix for sequoia , unfortunately updated in the hopes of using logic pro X now I can't even see available WiFi connections
Hello everyone! Can I have your advice? I’m really tech excluded. 
The last update I made to my (very beloved) MacBook Pro (13 inch Mid 2012) was to Mojave, version 10.14.6. 
I really need my computer as I have everything for my PhD here and can’t afford to have it stop working. A few years ago my computer was becoming extremely slow, so “I” (lol) replaced the CD reader with a second memory disk/thing and the performance improved extremely. I’m sorry if this is useless information and also sorry that I don’t know the proper names for these things!

I see on your post that I shouldn’t upgrade to OSX 15 Sequoia. So my question is, should I have upgraded earlier to one of the versions after the one I have at the moment? Will my Mac become obsolete and will everything stop working soon? I’m stressed!! Thank you in advance
To those of you relying on Firewire for Audio or Video, be careful before upgrading.  Firewire for audio has already been phased out, and there's no telling when Apple will remove support for video as well.  I am currently with Sonoma 14.7.1 and I don't plan to upgrade to Sequoia.
It's macOS, it was OSX almost 10 years ago.
never update a production machine
This kind of thing is the exact reason I switched to windows. I hated upgrading to the new OS and losing functionality on my apps, then having to wait or pay for newer versions of them. I recently upgraded from windows 10 to 11 and literally everything still works perfectly.
The bleeding edge is the only edge I want to live on!
What I do to avoid any auto updates is make all of my internet sources "metered connections" then set the update settings to "Never on a metered connection." Since doing that, I have had zero auto updates.
This is why I run Windows Update Blocker. Can't force an update if the service is disabled
Avid 2018.12 and MacOS 10.14.6 is the latest combination I'd fully trust there, and I'm presently working with Avid 2023.12 on MacOS 13.5.
Can you give me a TLDR (too long didn't research) of what Avidtech/the media composer version matrix is?
I think finicky is Adobe-speak for "normal."
The person who reminded me of this advise - Chris Bové - meant it for Avid (amongst other tools.)
Yeah but the second it’s not fine and you go to acid they’ll just point at the “not qualified” sign and say it’s your own fault.”
You might loose on the major security updates though which could’ve not been fixed on the version you’re in though it’s the latest patch of a major version?
That's very sensible but you might be overdoing it.

I'm from the opposite end of the spectrum in that I run public betas of OS's and Apps and tbh I've never lost anything because of it. Might get the odd plugin playing up but other than that it's been plain sailing.

Everything is backed up, Time Machine, Backblaze, Nightly HD cloning. If the worst does happen I can be up and running again in no time.
Do you usually have problems??? I mean if you have no control. How do they enforce this? It just seems like IT people would have a clue about things like this.
did it work?
12.6 babyyyy
Same here fam. I forgot you could update your OS beyond security updates.
Tell me you have FCP “classic” installed and I’ll have people send you projects for XML conversion.
I haven't "upgraded" yet. I looked at all the improvements they bragged about, and thought, There isn't ONE of them, I'm going to use. Also, I've been burned on automatically upgrading and finding out a bunch of my programs will not work. So I'm waiting for everyone to figure out what runs, what's buggy, what is SOL.
![gif](giphy|gVoBC0SuaHStq|downsized)

Welcome to the men's group. We live dangerously. Currently downloading update.
Reporting back. I haven’t had any breaking issues resulting from the upgrade. Permissions are getting on my nerves though because I haven’t to give premiere permissions every time I open it. There’s probably a setting I haven’t found yet for that.
Same I am worried to update my Mac Pro M1 to this update tbh
That's great. We've seen multiple version upgrades of software and system software completely screw up everything - especially in the first days of a major change…you don't hear about the problems until the first week is out.

Still, it pays to be conservative about upgrades.
+10 for Xpress DV.  Sigh. Along with Avid3D (part of their suite at the time.)
I've been fine on 14.6.1…and so have the various people I deal with who are using the four major tools. None of it has been linked to the OS so far.
Between the smugness of Apple Store managers and increasing number of employees who aren't equipped to handle basic issues, the "Genius Bar" needs to be renamed.
Thanks to /u/Weenyhand - https://mrmacintosh.com/

Take my upvote to even out the down vote. 

I run mac and pc clients and PC updates are a pain when they happen  unexpected, but rarely break things.

Granted I had a number PCs with Mojo / Nitris DX boxes loose their shit because of a windows update once.
Unironically me
Now the term "the bleeding edge" makes sense to me! This is the edge of the version spectrum where you bleed...
This is why I stop using Windows all together. I hate it when the OS shoves the updates and rapes my computer.
I’m working on 14.5.1 and MC 2024.6 and haven’t run into any issues out of the norm.
Seems the latest version do not have support for macOS 15 yet what I can see...
[removed]
I think Adobe is normal-speak for finicky.
Well, given that my current (long) gig is remote using a production company’s Avid, I have the opportunity to experiment with updating my own Mac and seeing if Avid works.  (And it does.)

Obviously, if I were working on a project locally right now, I wouldn’t dream of updating until the project was finished.
That’s not an issue on any popular OS in recent memory. Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc., they all push security updates to older versions of their operating systems even after they’ve moved on to newer ones.

Apple just released a new security update in July for Monterey for example, and that’s 2 versions prior to the current version at the time, Sonoma.
>That's very sensible but you might be overdoing it.

If companies like Apple and Adobe weren't on pretty standard yearly product cycles... I could see why you'd feel that way... but since they are? I don't see it as overdoing it in the slightest.

There are *tons* of people in our industry that regularly use software that's several years, sometimes even over a decade old. People still use many years old versions of AVID, for instance. I'm talking about using software that is 12-13 months old, at most. That's still quite current.

>I'm from the opposite end of the spectrum in that I run public betas of OS's and Apps and tbh I've never lost anything because of it. Might get the odd plugin playing up but other than that it's been plain sailing.

In my personal life, I'm right there with you. I have everything on auto-update. Software, hardware... everything. And it's pretty much never an issue.

But work? Hell no. I don't have time for that.

>Everything is backed up, Time Machine, Backblaze, Nightly HD cloning. If the worst does happen I can be up and running again in no time.

Data loss isn't the concern here. Loss of time is the bigger concern. When you say "up and running again in no time" just isn't the case... it does take time, and we don't have time for that.
Well the issue is they are deploying computers and software across like, 90,000 people. So to keep things secure, they need to limit the number of OS versions they have to support. It is what it is in big corporate. 

I very rarely have significant issues. I’m always faster than the computer I’m cutting on anyway. I’m always waiting for something, so that’s not new. I’ve had a couple things with Premiere and resolve that made me scratch my head, but nothing that can’t be mitigated.

The biggest thing to do is to remember, any old projects opened in the new version, may act funny. Even if they upgrade to the new version. So best practice is to create new blank projects, and import your old one into that. Solves some issues.

Also delete like everything in your cache. Dive down into the system files and get it all there. Restart a few times.
Monterrey team here up and running as well!
I updated from monterey a couple days ago to sonoma and regret it so much 😭
Team Monterey 🤙
It’s running FCP 6, but I don’t want to use it for anything other than emergency stuff. XML file conversion? Now THAT takes me back!
I still have it! lol

I get the impression from Windows, especially Windows 11, that it's a gamer OS and that I should probably run it with a joystick or something... This is very ironic for me since I'm using Windows at work and macOS at home... though, I'm not a gamer, not even at work, so maybe I'm totally wrong... :)
But you don't really have a functional title tool, and that's an issue.

That’s fair.

Generally unless it’s the scale of Catalina that removed 32 bit support avid actually will run pretty stable on new versions; it’s just that they don’t get advanced builds so they make no guarantees which I guess is also fair.

I will say given how much of their user base is MacOS based and the fact that you can’t roll a Mac back further than its release version you’d think they would get in the beta program to start testing things in advance so that people don’t have to wait 6 months to use their new Mac but avid is still sadly a pretty small team.
Aight then you’ve made total sense there
Yep. A few months ago I checked an iPhone 6 Plus and it was still getting iOS 12 security patches (the current iOS version is 18).
No I do get it, your approach is absolutely the more sensible option and I’ve worked with many folks who are operating on years old software, whatever gets the job done works.

I’ve never really seen a work stopping bug happen after 3 months of a new OS or app tho. Doesn’t mean they don’t exist but they are a rarity.

As for the time thing I totally get that. But last year I had the nightmare scenario of my Mac just flat out dying (not as a result of software updates), but thanks to Time Machine and a cloned hard drive it meant that I had lost at most 30mins of work in progress and was up and running again on a replacement computer within 3hrs.

Yes in an ideal world we’d never lose the time but it can happen and I think as long as your backup process is robust and continually updating then you can minimise that time lost to almost nothing. Tho it does help if you’re 10 minutes drive from the nearest Apple Store 😄

I don’t really use title tool a ton for what I do so doesn’t bother me.
I’ve learned to use after effects as well but I’m not happy about avid no longer being a complete editorial suite.
How do I force "new.reddit.com" (redesign prior to the current newest design) completely?
I got forced to the newest reddit design, and it's genuinely worse in every conceivable way. It is as if I loaded it on mobile, but here I am on a 1440p resolution, with likely more than 50% wasted space across the whole screen.

Meanwhile, the actual content of reddit (which used to fill up almost the entire space) now fills up a tiny portion of the middle, surrounded by non-removable side panels which are also useless during most of your reddit usage experience. Also, the font is harder to read.

I just want to get back to the previous design, but whenever I click a notification from new.reddit , like a comment reply, I am taken to the bad UX again.

Whoever created the newest UX does not care or understand desktop users at all. It's insulting, I feel so sad if this is the direction of reddit. Might have to get used to old.reddit again (edit: links are randomly disappearing when I edit on this new design. It's also buggy like that)  again and if they take that away, after also taking apps like apollo away, I think it's officially time to quit it for good.

Over and over again, we are forced to jump through hoops to maintain some level of functionality. Took me a while to get used to the previous design, but I'm just not going to bother with the newest one. It might as well be 9gag or ifunny.

edit: after editing this on the new UX, all URLS disappeared. Great job on QAing this.

EDIT 2: You can find extensions for your browser that can force new, or "old-new" reddit. This is the ONLY consistent way I could find. Personally, I think I am just going to get used back to old.reddit (with RES) and be done with this nonsense! Thanks for the help in the comments :)

edit3: I am using Redirector on Firefox btw. You can find instructions how to set it up within the comments below.
I have the same issue. Logged in and it's all changed. Wtf? This is terrible. I HATE it. Either they change it back or I'm going to have to find another website to waste my time on. Who thought this was a good idea? All the extra crap on the sides is overwhelming. I can't stand it.
I looked everywhere and can't find an option to go back to the old, better reddit.
I agree so much the new ui is really terrible and I will quit desktop reddit entirely I think I tried to set up a redirect lb Firefox but it did not work also why should I tinker with extensions just to use the functioning UI at least I can still use 3rd party apps on mobile with some workarounds
Here do this but instead of old.reddit put in new.reddit

[https://new.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/93k9eh/here\_is\_how\_to\_automatically\_redirect\_new\_reddit/](https://new.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/93k9eh/here_is_how_to_automatically_redirect_new_reddit/)

EDIT: the solution above doesn't work for photos outright, you need to click advanced options and add in the exception "[https://www.reddit.com/media\*](https://www.reddit.com/media*)" on the Exclude Pattern area. Or just use this the Old UI Enforcer for Reddit extension.
I got used to the "old redesign", and I was somewhat content with it. Not only is this dumbfoundingly amateurish (I say that as UI and UX designer), because why do they want to get closer to something like Twitter is beyond me, the content and formats are very different, but they keep removing useful features and taking control away from me. This is clearly not done with user's best interests in mind, as they remove the favorites section, which is now replaced by recent, and they start pushing latest posts to us more and more, trying to get us to scroll more and spend more time on the website.

And I guess I don't mind, as they are making me spend less time here. If reddit wasn't the only decent source of information at the age, where google is absolutely useless, I wouldn't really have the incentive to come here very often at all.
Struggling with the same problem. I'm not one to reject something new just because it is different but this redesign is openly hostile to the entire reddit experience. Just loads of wasted screen space and a complete compression of the actual content people log in to read. Also quoting is broken.

This isn't making me want to browse on the mobile app instead of the desktop, it's making me want to not browse reddit at all.
You can use an extension to automatically redirect you to new.reddit.com
You can leave feedback on the new UI with this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf8Cx6LszflP8gSslmMj1lSh4Rt6QKEytLaxG9bE-o0PkT6Q/viewform).  There is an extension that can do what you wish for your browser but I do not know the name.  Check a few of the other posts on the new UI today and you should find it.
I think reddit just wants us to switch to the app,and they are kind of trying workarounds to create such a scenario.
I kinda like the new UI, but there is a very big problem - when you open a post there is no option to go back to the feed. You have to use the back button on the browser. And sometimes that works - it returns you where you were. But most of the times it just shows a completely new feed with different posts.
Does anyone here know how to use old reddit in a minimized way on mobile devices?
Workaround:

To use previous new style (not the newest), type `https://new.reddit.com` in the address bar.

For links in the notifications and using previous new style (not the newest) everywhere, use extension Redirector - for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirector/), [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd).

Use these options:

- Description: `Reddit redirect`
- Example URL: `https://www.reddit.com/`
- Include pattern: `https://www.reddit.com*`
- Redirect to: `https://new.reddit.com$1`
- Pattern type: `Wildcard`
- Pattern Description: `Redirect reddit newest to new.reddit.com`
- Click to "Show advanced options..."
- Exclude pattern: `https://www.reddit.com/media*`
- Save

Known issue of Redirector: opening the image in new tab does not work, therefore using exception for images, these are opened with the newest style, but everywhere else previous new style is used.
Came here looking for this. The forced design update is atrocious. Usability gone down the toilet.
Terrible new UI.
for some reason my profile picture appears misaligned in this new layout -_-
Before I favourited the URL [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) but now it doesn't work. Seems like it's been wiped entirely.
This is the best I've come up with until I can get an extension that ignores the forced re-direct:    
[https://new.reddit.com/?redirect=disable](https://new.reddit.com/?redirect=disable)
Just got it today, for the moment thought that I had un-logged, or that it's some sort of bug. The worst to me is the changed smaller font, which is painfull to look at, and lack of an option to close the post and continue reading the sub I was reading. I mean..yeah, I can use 'back' in my browser, but why would they remove that!? new.reddit brings back the layout, but it does not fix it, from what I can see. I'm on the most recent version of Chrome.  Never thought I might say it, but now mobile app looks better than main site.
new design is awful
I had this problem since April 1 and makes reddit less enjoyable
this sucks
Addons help.  
Firefox: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-reddit-redirection/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-reddit-redirection/Chrome)  
Chrome: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/reddit-ui-redirector/nkoapgdkoheaadbeijfdlnogkjlgcimc?hl=en&authuser=0](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/reddit-ui-redirector/nkoapgdkoheaadbeijfdlnogkjlgcimc?hl=en&authuser=0)
It's onestly a waste, I'd prefer the previous design... 1440p here too.. I need to use +120-150% zoom to be able to read and even then it's a waste of space... I don't know who the heck they were thinking-...

  
I will try to use the url of new.reddit.. I will keep the firefox addon disabled.. unless I see issues, this is for the best tbh
I asked our AI overlord to create a [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) script for this. The result: https://pastebin.com/6ftaCuXL
I use Opera (on windows) ... so the chrome and firefox methods won't work.

&#x200B;

I was thinking ... I wonder if could just do a re-direct in my hosts file ?

Otherwise, I see a switch to Chrome in my future.
The thing that I miss from the previous version ...

I could make a reply like this:

1. highlight some text in the post being replied to
2. click 'reply'
3. The reply input box opens with the quoted text at the top, and available for typing.

&#x200B;

With this 'new' interface, I can find any easy way to quote a sentence from a reply I am following up to.

I can do it: quote & copy to paste buffer, reply, paste, highlight text in intput box, and click the " '' " tag to make a quote.

&#x200B;

This is more steps, and a lot more inconvienient than the previous way...
Yup, its super annoying.
I think it just conked out for good

  
Have not been able to get good layout for at least a week
It is ugly.  OK, I can deal with that, but it is full of bugs.
Thanks!
There are also some userscripts redirecting to either the old (older now) or "new" (previous new/new old), to be used with script extensions.

I used reddit for a while in the old-new redesign, and while I got used to that, somewhat confused with the old-old the times I tried, even it has some significant annoyances. Find some particular message on some web search engine, and it will still take you quite some time to find out where exactly it is, because all the threads are collapsed and you can't find things with control+F.

I simply hate this kind of message-board system, it would be infinitely better if they were chronological and paged, like good old phpbb forums and the like. No gain whatsoever from this ranking reordering of messages, if that's of any value, it would be better replaced with something like "filter out messages with N dislikes" or "only show messages with N likes." Or from users with N magic energies or whatever.

And now there's even notification for likes, next Elon Musk will buy it and transform in xexxix or something.
On chrome there is this extension:

[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/old-reddit-redirect/dneaehbmnbhcippjikoajpoabadpodje?hl=en-US](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/old-reddit-redirect/dneaehbmnbhcippjikoajpoabadpodje?hl=en-US)

Get the .CRX file of it with [https://crxextractor.com/](https://crxextractor.com/)

Then when you downloaded it, replace .CRX to .ZIP. Open in the zip rules.json and instead replace every text with "old." to "new."

Now it asks if you want to modify these changes (on WinRAR) press yes.

Convert it back to .CRX extension.

Then enter chrome://extensions in surfbar.

Enable developer tools.

Drag the .CRX file on the page.

Install.

Done.
I'm sure many solutions exists but I use this Tampermonkey Script that's litterally a single line of code long, it works kinda well. It adds a little delay caused by the redirection, but I'm satisfied with it.

[https://github.com/TheophileECE/redirect-to-new.reddit.com](https://github.com/TheophileECE/redirect-to-new.reddit.com)
Here is a simple tampermonkey (chrome extension) script:

// ==UserScript==  
// u/nameRedirect Reddit URLs  
// u/namespacehttp://tampermonkey.net/  
// @version      0.1  
// @description  Redirect Reddit URLs from www to new subdomain  
// @author       Your Name  
// @match        https://www.reddit.com/\*  
// @grant        none  
// ==/UserScript==  
  
(function() {  
'use strict';  
  
// Get the current URL  
var currentUrl = window.location.href;  
  
// Replace "www" with "new" in the URL  
var newUrl = currentUrl.replace("www.reddit.com", "new.reddit.com");  
  
// Redirect to the new URL  
window.location.replace(newUrl);  
})();
I saw a userscript recommended [in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/18oa3y4/comment/keggb20/?context=3), it's called [Old New Reddit Redirect](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/482716-old-new-reddit-redirect) (I use it with [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)). It's not super fast but gets the job done. Also certainly more lightweight and safer than adding an extension.
I wrote this post that might help: [https://new.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1aoziqv/tip\_to\_keep\_using\_the\_newredditcom\_design/](https://new.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1aoziqv/tip_to_keep_using_the_newredditcom_design/)
r/apollosideloaded
I am confused. Is this a "new UI", and not a bug? u/weedcommander

Please see on this post I made if we are talking about the same thing.

[https://new.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1ayfcr5/desktop\_web\_nonoptimized\_ui\_apparently\_one\_made/](https://new.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1ayfcr5/desktop_web_nonoptimized_ui_apparently_one_made/) 

Because if this is the same thing?

This "new UI" is so horrible, I thought it could only be a bug involving a "downgraded for small devices" or a beta glitchy junk interface improperly popping up.
what a mess, got "blessed" with it today, already hate it
Just getting here after they changed mine yesterday. It broke mod toolbar. Can't moderate my sub now, great job Reddit!
Just echoing this. Got forced in yesterday and it's just awful. That left side bar is a huge waste of space, and that's before mentioning the removal of the 'Compact' view.
I honestly don't know who they are making these changes for. They literally went against everything good about it. At this point we should just make a carbon copy of old reddit and start fresh with a new name.
I'm usually pretty open minded about website redesigns, but this one just sucks. 60% of the screen is wasted space. There are half as many posts in Classic view. I can't expand a media post in Classic view, I have to click on it and it takes me to a new page. I can't go back to the subreddit just by clicking on the empty spaces on both sides of the post. It's like it was built for mobile only
Three or four days passed... I wanted to give it a chance, but just can't. Horrible unreadable mess.
I have same issue it's so painful :(

This worked for me on FF, although I am not sure how we can know if these addons are clean or not.
r/apollosideloaded
The sad reality is that having to use workarounds to use 3rd party apps is just the same - extra tinkering, extra steps.

Enshittification has fully caught up to reddit. Once this new UI gets pushed, that's pretty much it. You are forced into a horrible desktop experience, and a pretty sub-par mobile experience, miles behind what Apollo already offered. 

We truly need something better, as much as reddit is an ingrained habit. They ruined everything good about it and it looks like it's only going to get worse, and worse.
this is pretty good, thanks!
not all heroes wear capes! Thank you !
This needs thousands of upvotes!!!
works like a glove

&#x200B;

here have a kiss 😘
Thanks a lot mate, you're a life-saver!
YOURE A SAINT. I wish we still had awards. I wonder how long it will take to transform reddit into something that cant be fixed anymore
Thanks, I found one and it works, however it feels like it slowed reddit down. Using this platform gets harder and harder every day.
Thanks. I just filled out the form. No doubt they don't care and will continue with the awful new layout. Just like they didn't care when people were mad about them getting rid of awards, free awards and third party website access.
Already wrote there, thanks. I found some new extensions but using them may be a risk. Ugh, I'm just going back to old.
[deleted]
But the app is garbage. I'm really starting to dislike this website...
While I also prefer the "old new" UI to the newest one (sh.reddit.com) for purely aesthetic reasons, my biggest gripes with the latter so far are the missing bell at the upper right of a thread to quickly subscribe to it, and that many editor icons are now hidden behind the "T" (?) button on a mostly empty icon bar at the bottom of the editing box.

Besides that, [sh.reddit.com](https://sh.reddit.com) seems to ignore my setting to make Markdown Mode the default for a new editor box. In the short time that I used it until I installed the UI Changer extension, it always started in the Fancy Pants mode.
Thanks, this is precisely what I did after someone suggested it. Indeed, opening photos is still affected, but that's better than nothing. 

It was too difficult to get back to old.reddit. I've spent so much on it but I guess i prefer new-old now. new-new is a blasphemy, though.
You are an absolute GOAT. Thank you!

Also to those that hate the reddit media overlay, you can use [Reddit load images directly](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/reddit-load-images-direct/fpimmmjbglpnlpbfikgekaaeinminolo) extension to simply open the image directly without reddit overlay.
Thanks mate!
Aaand I got my new-old reddit back! Thank you so much. The text and everything was so small that using the site was a pain.
Thank you so much for this
Good lord! Thank you so much. 

Last 2 days on reddit have been awful.
Excellent, thanks.
THANK YOU SIR!!!
Thank you, just got moved into that new god awful layout. it feels like it was designed for a tablet or mobile.
thank you so much! if the reddit api thing didn't happen i would give you an award but i am not going to financially support reddit after what they did
clicking on a reddit link via google search doesn't seem to work though
>I had this problem since April 1 and makes reddit less enjoyable

Maybe this was an april fools' day prank that some prankster forgot to revert ?
yeh :/ gladly the previous design still works. I'm using Redirector on firefox
The Firefox extension you linked no longer exists however I found a different one that works for me:

[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-new-reddit-redirect/?utm\_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm\_medium=referral&utm\_content=search](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-new-reddit-redirect/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)
Hm. Isn't opera chromium? Chrome extension should work
Thank you! I always prefer tampermonkey solutions, since I can be sure of the code content that way without a lot of work picking the contents of an extension apart to examine its source code.
Are you implying I should use xcode and emulate iOS on my windows desktop?
If you haven't fixed it already, you could look for browser addons like the **UI Changer for Reddit** [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ui-changer-for-reddit/) and [Chrome-based browsers](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ui-changer-for-reddit/bfcldjodnnkndfccfjndmdlppfkmccgh).
>and that's before mentioning the removal of the 'Compact' view.

On top of how even *less* compact the new "Classic" view is. I've gone from 12 posts in a 1440p screen height, to about 7½.
anything for chrome/opera? 

i hate the new design
I would have guessed mobile versions, but they already have the app

perhaps to make it more appealing to new users?
I imagine that's what this is for, instead of having a different setup for mobile they just made desktop look like mobile. I know that I hate where the vote buttons are because for just about ever they have been at the top of the post by the title, not at the bottom.
Mobile flagships*

&nbsp;

I can't reply to a comment using a lightweight browser+keyboard without the phone having to give everything it has.

&nbsp;

They'll probably force their App upon desktop too. Ot certainly will be thrice as bad as browsing through their site.
Another thing is that when I read an op I'd read some comments. When I wanted to leave the thread I'd click to the left which took me back to my list of threads. That's no longer working so now I have to go back a page and I end up at the start and have to scroll down until I come to a new thread I haven't clicked on yet. I don't know if I'm explaining that right for you to get what I mean.
it's physically migraine inducing for me
OMG THANK YOU. 

It's been less than an hour and I despise the new layout. I guess I'm a firefox user now lol.
thank you
God send.
You saved me, I love you so much thank you
Maaaaaannnnnn.... TYSM!!!!1

Now this is how it should be.
Thanks friend. Saved some grey hair. The newest new design is utter garbage and had to get back to what works.
I'm not sure about others but Chrome Web Store has a pretty extensive verification process. They manually approve every single update of my extension which can take up to a couple of days.
Ha, noice! Installed 5 sec. ago, back to the roots straight away.
Two clicks and we were freed from this horrible sight.

Thank you, dear sir!
it finally happened to me and DEAR GOD THANK YOU FOR THIS
Nervous about "asking for access to other sites" disclaimer though.
Thank you! The new layout just got pushed for me today and it only took 2 minutes for me to despise it. This add on worked exactly as hoped. Thank you.
thank you very much sir.
Thank youuu
THANK YOU
>We truly need something better, as much as reddit is an ingrained habit. They ruined everything good about it and it looks like it's only going to get worse, and worse.

We might not ever all migrate to Lemmy or whatever. The network effect has us trapped.
also ironic enough i am pretty sure even with the slight delay of the redirect it's faster than the new design vanilla
can you please link it? this redesign is so bad, i'm considering moving to twitter lol
We legitimately need to find something before they take down old reddit too. I can imagine these current devs doing that.
> The decision has been made;

I agree.  What proper constructive feedback can do is provide info on what a user feels is missing or what they would like to see. Or see improved upon. Going in there with "New UI bad, Rawr. Remove or I leave" is not going to lead anywhere.

> They are doing this because of the coming IPO.

I have heard this narrative about every single change they have made since at least last spring.  Yet those poorly communicated and managed big changes have all cost them users and with it user data and as such devalued Reddit.  

* The API changes and the way they were communicated and rolled were obviously going to cost users
* The barely functional chat system that was rolled out another negative
* Removal of the awards and coins system with a system that most anyone should have known was not going to be popular cost them money 2 fold.  First, it was going to cost them money in premium subscribers who lost a perk in the free coins and dropped premium.  Second, everybody dumping there coin stockpiles was also going to cost premium money as there are so much free time built up.
* The new UI first started on desktop, then the mobile web a month later.  The fact that they did not communicate either until a few weeks after us helpers here figured it out was done poorly.  The tone deaf way they announced it.  The fact that development has been non existent for months. And so many more things are costing them users and engagement.
* CSQ and "more established account".  They have been completely secretive about how they work or even how to improve your scores. The information we do have on more established account was stumbled upon and provided by Reddit.  On the surface it seems like it would increase engagement by forcing users to interact more, it is also going to cost them users who primarily just use chat.

So, they are already working to devalue Reddit on their own.  Which is the confusing part to me even though I do have my theories.
You're welcome.

BTW This is updated version of the tip, with easier opening of images in a new tab, in the first version incognito mode was needed.
You're welcome.

More tips for reddit:

[Workarounds for multiple Reddit bugs and issues on Windows](https://new.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1anjha8/workarounds_for_multiple_reddit_bugs_and_issues/)
Can't confirm, here it works good.

Are you sure, you're using the correct options for Redirector, as above?
Looks like it got reverted for me
Dont know what to tell you. it still exists and has over 3k users [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-reddit-redirection/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-reddit-redirection/)
>Hm. Isn't opera chromium? Chrome extension should work

Thanks for the advice ... I'll give it a try!

Anything is better than the new-new interface.
lol I guess so
You and the guy that made the extension just saved my reddit web experience
Very useful plugin
Actually, I can't rly find any for chrome which surprised me. I can only see outdated ones.

What I did was follow a comment about using Redirector and i think it's the same on chrome: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd)

You can find explanation on how to set it up in the comments from this thread.

With this, you still have to open images in the newest UI, and also you lose the ability to open posts without loading a new page and having to click Back to return.
It's crazy how much it makes my tablet struggle to open up a freaking image board. These are 2006 level features that need a high end 2024 device to run properly.

We've gone full circle from: 

1) the internet is slow, wait times are expected,

2) if your user needs to wait 5 seconds to load your website it's broken,

3) basic websites are big enough that wait times are to be expected.
I made one for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ui-changer-for-reddit/bfcldjodnnkndfccfjndmdlppfkmccgh) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ui-changer-for-reddit/). It should work with every single Reddit link including image links and share links.
Haha, there is a higher chance Chrome has an even earlier variant, FF is highly unpopular overall. But you won't go wrong with FF, it also has an amazing "Enhancer for Youtube" that I love with volume boost. Golden. 

Tbh, I have decided to go back to old.reddit. I am done with this. Old reddit works so well. You can still resize live videos and photos flawlessly, it's butter smooth.

It's actually insane to think about how they couldn't fix the new video player ever since old reddit became old! Until today!
People should be using firefox anyways tbh
In the FF store you get written warning if an addon wasn't verified yet
Let's hope they don't kill new.reddit completely!
That's pretty much every extension out there, for good or for bad. It seems to be asking it just for reddit:
> considering moving to twitter lol

Don't
[deleted]
Just wanted to post that because when I follow your original link, it brings me to a page that says “Oops! We can’t find that page.”

For some reason, even though it looks like the same URL, the link in this comment works fine 🤷🏻‍♂️
I mean yeah that beats the new redesign
My pleasure! 😁 He did that for me, too.
It asking me to allow access to everything on all my webpages, though, is it safe?
The only problem with this is that Google Search/YouTube links (the ones that include garbage tracking in them) lead the site to the newest [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com) \[without redirecting\] and it only goes to the [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) when refreshing, using the address bar or using the direct URL from other search engines or providers.

Other than that, it works.
Here is a working redirect.

1. Copy the following code into a file called "Redirector.json":
```
    {
      "createdBy": "Redirector v3.5.3",
      "createdAt": "2024-06-02T22:23:22.734Z",
      "redirects": [
        {
          "description": "Newest Reddit to Previous Reddit",
          "exampleUrl": "https://reddit.com/",
          "exampleResult": "https://new.reddit.com/",
          "error": null,
          "includePattern": "https://reddit.com/*",
          "excludePattern": "",
          "patternDesc": "",
          "redirectUrl": "https://new.reddit.com/$1",
          "patternType": "W",
          "processMatches": "noProcessing",
          "disabled": false,
          "grouped": false,
          "appliesTo": [
            "main_frame"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
```
1. Click the Redirector extension in the toolbar and click "Edit Redirects".
2. Click import and double-click the file called "Redirector.json".

That's it!
For Chrome users, I found [this extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/best-reddit-redirect/jclhpbepnmagnghkmlhndajahfpimigm) that has similar functionality
I've saved this post and am going to give the link to any other posters who hate the new reddit. Keep up the good work!
Careful, he's a hero
i love you.
You, kind stranger, are a LEGEND
I could kiss you
I.... love.... you

thank you man

I've donated 5 bucks, sorry can't do more, but I wanted to thank you properly
Thanks so much! I love new.reddit but hate the other two so I was deeply saddened when all I could find were old.reddit alternatives you're a life saver. sh.reddit is so bloody slow horrible forced beta.
You're the best <3
Jesus Christ, you are a hero. Thanks man.
Ohhh! Thank you!

Only got shown the latest abdomination last night. Half of my screen wasted, and frankly, with the list of subs on the left, useless at work. Also, less readable font.

I mean, unremovable list of all that I subscribed to - that is not quite what my colleagues have to see.

And I've got my karma back on the main page.
Thank you! I just got forced into the new design today it is GOD AWFUL! 

You are my personal Hero now!
Thanks a lot man, also for anyone using opera or operagx, if its not working for you go to te extensions tab and enable "Allow access to page search results", that did the trick for me at least.
you're my hero!
I love you so much. Thank you. The newest design is god-awful, this genuinely saved my eyes and sanity.
Oh my god thank you so much for this. The new UI was making my computer so incredibly slow.
OMFG! Thank you. found this post on google after living with this shitshow of a UI for a week
Thank you so very much! This new design was a complete travesty!
Thank you! Commenting just so more people can see
respect
Thank you my child.
OMG . . . Thank You. the newest design was driving me crazy.
thanks so much dude
Thank you so much! I'm using your Chrome extension now!
THANK YOU!!!!
Thank you so much for this.  The ridiculous sidebars taking up half the screen were driving me crazy.
Redirector stopped working for me recently and I went looking for a new fix. Thank you for this. I hate this mobile-focused format so much.
Necroposting this to say that you are a god among men.
Hell yes! You have made the world a better place. Thank you so much!
>LEGEND

Thank you so much!
Thank you, it works perfectly. I gain have the functional gen2 Redditt. Thank you so much.
Thank you so muchhhh
Worked like a charm, thank you!
Thanks for this, I've been using it for the past two months, but reddit seem to have counteracted by denying me access and I have to clear all my cookies. Any ideas to get around it?
Can you please share the link or how to best find it on the Chrome store?  Thank you.
Can you make one for Safari?
doesn't seem to work for me anymore. I'm redirected to "sh.reddit.com" and it's the new UI.

edit: I'm using this for now [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/best-reddit-redirect/jclhpbepnmagnghkmlhndajahfpimigm](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/best-reddit-redirect/jclhpbepnmagnghkmlhndajahfpimigm) can choose between all the UI's
Thank you so much 👏👏👏👏

YOU ARE AMAZING 🤩🥳👑🏆🥇
Hey how do i use it?

&#x200B;

I installed it and clicked on it and picked the new.reddit middle option, then i hit apply changes.

But whenever i enter reddit from any link or any source it still shows the newest ui. I even tried the other options but nothing changes. i assume its not working on my pc or i missed something?
the UI is so horrible basic. I love it.
dude thank you so muchhhh
THANK YOU
Thank you kind sir.
Have my babies please.
Thanks, I'm trying it out now
it doesn't change anything when you hit apply
Thanks, this kinda works in a way. But the new.reddit will redirect post you click on, instead of making an in-page popup so it's still not quite as good.
>it also has an amazing "Enhancer for Youtube" that I love with volume boost

Ooooooohhhhhhhhhhh I'm off to google to find this. Thanks for the info.
Firefox isn't unpopular, Chrome is just extremely popular by a wide margin ahead of every other browser by miles and miles.
>Any constructive feedback I might have been inclined to provide died when I wasn't given a choice in whether I wanted to be a tester.

Agreed. Like, I was an avid user of the redesign when it was first being tested and launched — even to the point of being marked a helpful user in r/redesign — but at least that was optional and I went into it knowing I was using a product in progress.

This new UI was literally thrust upon me two days ago with no consultation or ability to revert and it has seriously negatively affected my ability to moderate effectively; from the feeds not saving my sort correctly, to the lack of mod note symbols, and very unintuitively hidden user moderation tools.
Its Reddit it breaks hyerlinks sometimes when posting. Its odd but I noticed that a few times myself as well.
I can speak for the Old Reddit Redirect (since the new version tanks the performance of older devices and forces you to leave a thread just to make a reply!).

&nbsp;

Old Reddit Redirect only asks for permissions among Reddit domains and it has a ton of downloads (and this comment is starting to sound like free publicity).
God bless you
This works perfectly to return to the old layout.  Thank you!
Hey any chance you could hook me up with what I can gather is an extension to get perma-new reddit? Seems the mods didn't like that message lol
I'd suggest saving the text. Reddit isn't trustworthy as an archive now.
The new UI just hit me today.

It was fine this morning and then changed to the new UI for me when I came back to the site.

Omg!

It's God-Awful. Just terrible!

The extension works perfectly.

Thank you OP!
Hero got deleted.
Thank you!
You are welcome :-)
Thank you for the feedback! Please be more specfic about the problems you are having either by sending them here or by contacting me privately.
You can find it by searching for “UI Changer for Reddit” on the Chrome Web Store. There is also a hyperlink in the previous comment that leads directly to this page.
I'll see what I can do. Porting it to Safari isn't as easy as porting a Chrome extension to Firefox and I don't have much free time at the moment.
Have you thought of clickling on the extension? :-)
This sounds unusual. Are you refreshing the page after you hit "Apply changes"?
It should. Try navigating to another page and see if your UI changes.
The overlay function has been behaving weird lately. It has nothing to do with the extensions you are using.
I even tried it for a while but the new UI is just absolute garbage, it's like a worse version of Twitter. The colors are terrible, it's an eyesore. Everything feels like a downgrade.
As heroes are.
Reddit just doesn't load and i get a message saying, site redirected too many times, try deleteing your cookies.

I've tried setting my browser to allowing reddit's cookies for 'sesion only' on vivaldi. I'll see if that works.
I didn't think of that because it worked previously without fiddling with it, and then it stopped working. I just assumed something went wrong and found a working one. I didn't have it on my top bar to click on anyway.
I did, but ui stays the same idk why, im on operaGx
At least you tried it for a while.

I thought I accidentally did something to change it.

I had gone to Reddit in the morning, then came back later in the afternoon, and it had changed to the new layout.

I agree. I couldn't see one area where I thought it was an improvement. But I suppose the UX (UI) designers need an excuse to keep their jobs and/or show they are doing something to earn their salaries.
Make sure that you are logged in while forcing the 2nd generation UI. Until you are, you have to pick from the other two options. Deleting cookies also logs you out so that could be the source of the problem.
I get that. Since the previous UI is only served to logged in users, I decided to make the newest one the default. Might have to add some sort of note on the installation page about that.
https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1akk79r/comment/kr9ffcp
So disable the extension then log in and enable it?
Do that and let me know if it solves your problem.
Bye Nvidia, Hello AMD (1080ti » 7800xt)
My local Canada Computers had 1 nitro + left in stock and I managed to sell my 1080ti for a great price!
Check your Canada computer receipt for a code to get some free games.  I got Warhammer 400k Space Marine 2 with my 7800xt
The 1080 series was just so damn good, I just had someone recycle a 6700XT that I'm getting ready to retire my 1080 for it lol
Props to that 1080ti for putting in one hell of a shift. 10/10, best consumer GPU of the last 10 years.
I just bought a 7800xt yesterday.   It will be here Wednesday.   It's replacing my 1080ti liquid cooled.
Those Sapphire Nitro's are such beautiful GPUs
Could your 5800x3d stand a cooler upgrade? How are temps?
Been really happy with my 7800xt

Runs cool , all things considered.


My only complaint 
The 7900 GRE came out a few months later. 
Was supposed to be a china only thing. 

Otherwise I would have gotten it probably. 



There was one driver hiccup. Which AMD admitted to. 
I just had to roll back to previous version and was fine. 


Ya it doesn't have the best Ray Tracing.
But there's nothing I play that uses it anyways.

Looking at adding it to my water-cooling loop on my time off over winter.
I did the same last Christmas well worth it. I still use my 1080ti in another build paired with a 5600x🤙
How is your CPU surviving with that card in there? I've upgraded my GPU from an RX6600 to an RX6800 and had to replace my stock cooler with an aftermarket cooler for my Ryzen 5600G because it couldn't handle the furnace. This was something I didn't realise would've became a problem.

I highly recommend purchasing an aftermarket cooler. Your CPU will thank you.

Nevermind, I saw in the below comments you've done just that! Enjoy! Aftermarket coolers are awesome and I wish I had done it sooner!
I have the 7900XTX and am sad if the news is true that AMD will not be making high end GPU'S anymore... bummer
Nice! But that box CPU cooler is really bothering me, those things get loud and not very effective
GTX960 to RX6800 at 1440p. Do not know myself. RX6800 is great on power too, got it on a clearance sale. So, price to performance it was a clear standout.
Seeing EVGA makes it much harder...
Oh great. Now you just have to deal with SHITTY drivers, SHITTY OPTIMIZATION, AND OVERHEATING GPU- oh wait it's not 2014 anymore.

Enjoy the 7800XT. I know I would. Very worthy upgrade to the legendary 1080ti.
1080ti still beast damn that powerful gpu

Nice. I went from a GTX 1650 OC to the nitro+ about a year ago and I love it. Enjoy.
Welcome!!!
i nearly  choose the nitro+ aswell but then pivited to the 7800xt hellhound sakura. cause im a sucker for AESTHETICS. Not that the nitro+ looks bad. its the 2nd best looking 7800xt card ive found. 

Sick built!
The 1080ti is such a beast.
I had 1080ti Strix, amazing GPU. 
I upgraded go 4090 (FE) and haven't looked back. Enormously powerful card, it was the right choice to replace the legendary 1080ti
Amazing upgrade, you'll forget Nvidia mate.
My condolences. 1080ti is a beast.
Are you keeping the 1080ti as a show piece or sold it?
That's a long boy.
Nice.  I went from a GTX 1080 to a 7800 XT.  PC gaming for me has never been better.  :)  Wishing the same for you.
I would put that 1080ti in a display, like a trophy... Das a great gpu
welcome on the good side, enjoy the adrenalin software especially the AFMF2
Honestly I bought a 4070 instead of 7800xt. And I think will go back to AMD next generation (I upgraded from an rx 480).
Good choice.
I’m an and fanboy but dumping your thx 1080ti should be illegal and should be punished with 50 years in jail and then public execution
i still have my 1080ti but it seems if i want to upgrade i will need to upgrade my psu which is only a 650watt sooo mostly just been sticking to console gaming lately. Would really like to get a 7900xtx.
What cpu are you pairing this with king?
That’s my upgrade too. 
1080ti is now in a spare PC.
Wise choice you made.
CG, that card is a beast :)
Just change that stock AMD cooler for the love of the gods :D
I also recently upgraded my video card - switched from HD7870 to Rx7600. Rx7600 is great :)
Last time you will get away with a card that gives you that much value.
Do you use the support bracket with it? I don't, it was fucking with the fans.
[deleted]
Nice GPU, now you just need a better CPU cooler, unless it's a low spec CPU anyway.
I use my 1080 non ti at 2160x1080, the TI can do 1440 can't it?
[deleted]
Farewell 1080ti. The last great option for gamers from NVIDIA since.
Hello dxnavi stuttering
 you guys realize amd`s graphics division entirely gutted right?...
Terrified choice 😌, and lol 3 generations of technology 😉
I wouldn't do that if I was u honestly, I'm suffering from terrible choppy gameplay with amd, with a very noticeable latency
7900 Gre would have been a better investment, but nice card, congrats!
Bye Quality, Hello Mediocrity!
[removed]
I wouldn't be changing a 1080ti rnow
Yea I saw that offer and got them as well. Super happy with it! Can't wait for Unknown 9 Awakening, it looks really promising. In the meantime, I'll be playing my first ever Warhammer game!
Wait what,I got a 7800xt this august did I get something?
WARHAMMER 400K
The 6700/6750 are so great, best bang for the buck at that price range, especially with new games needing VRAM.
I got a 6700 XT. It's awesome. Quite a night and day difference from my old RX 480.
All i play is pubg and I can say that I experimented with a 6700xt and found that my gtx1080 outperformed AMD by a long shot. Not sure about other games but thought you might like to know.
-on paper (benchmarks), the 6700xt looks better but that's not the case for pubg
Definitely. That thing is still a beast to this day!
1080ti aka the G.O.A.T
I've still got mine. I plan on running it for another year or two yet
Agree 100%. I’ve put my old 1080Tis on a shelf for nostalgia.
My 6800 xt will challenge that 😁
Sweet! I wish I could go for a 7000 series but I'm on a b550 stuck with am4 for now lol. Maybe in a few more years.
It definitely needs and upgrade, it's hot in there. I have a Noctua NH-U12S coming in tomorrow.
This!!!! It haunts me every day 😂 built my first PC ever and was seeing the GRE was China only and it had so many bugs so we weren't missing out anyway. So I got a 7800xt and bam ! 7900 GRE lands and is great for 50 bucks more 😤
Same here when I seen the GRE. 
I’d already got my 7800xt months before but I would’ve waited if I’d known. 
Oh well, the 7800xt does everything I need. 
I upgraded from a 1080ti as I do flight sim with X-Plane and need as fast a card as possible, in my budget, and with the biggest amount of memory.
My old 1060 6gb is powering my fiance's PC for Balders gate. 

Still fine for a lot of 1080p gaming
AMD will make high end GPUs in the future, don't worry, they just stated they would not for this specific launch.
No high end only for RDNA4, anyway RDNA4 gonna replace whole N31
Well, objectively speaking 7900 XTX can "compete" with 4080 and not 4090.
Features are noticeably better on NVIDIA - DLSS is better, so is RT performance, RTXHDR, Reflex is more widespread, CUDA and so on.
That said, if they(AMD) can make mid segment GPUs with decent RT performance and FSR 4.0 which is going to use additional hardware - it's amazing news for most of the customers, because the majority of people are buying mid-tier GPUs.
Yes I'm aware. Noctua NH-U12S is arriving soon haha.
I've been using the 6800 for a few days, and it's definitely a fantastic card and my first midrange card. I love it!
Some ppl have never used an AMD card and it shows lol. Thank you bro.
I wanted to personally get a red devil variant. Because I have a black and red aesthetic going with my build. Unfortunately it's been sold out everywhere.
I have nothing against Nvidia. If it weren't for the price I wouldn't mind going for either brand. I love their GPUs.
Sold it, put it towards this big boy.
Lmao, it definitely hurts. But I needed to sell it to put towards this big dawg.
5800x3d, I'm on am4
There might never be another 1080ti :(
I used the support bracket, it was pretty easy to install.
No mesh shaders and outdated drivers will kill it in like the next three years lol
Yesir. My Noctua NH-U12S black is coming in tomorrow.

Here's my [full build](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ymcDpB).
It can ofc, any card can lol, but the fps is not great. It can handle basic tac shooters like CS2/Val etc, but not AAA rpg/fps or racing games at max settings.
Perfectly stable performance, zero driver bugs, no stuttering at ultra 1440p, and I'm not using ray tracing lmao. All modern GPUs have high power draw doofus. Have a good day.
Haven't had any issues with dx11/12 games so far...
I haven't seen any of those issues with my current XTX.
Why?
Stop telling lies.
I wanted to upgrade to 1440p so I had to upgrade my GPU. Otherwise the 1080ti was still going strong for 1080p.
I wish Iv got WH40k. When I bought my 7800 XT new Avatar was gifted and this game is trash ngl 😂😂
I would call the Canada computer location and ask them if they can reprint your receipt or give you the code.
Wonderful card, made similar switch 2 years ago to a 6800XT, had the 3080 in mind but the combination of higher price and actually going down in VRAM from the 1080Ti felt insane so I jumped on the AMD card. 

 Enjoy!
I think he meant video card. Haha

They really need a better naming system. 

Next few years will be painful. 
With 8000 and 9000 series of CPU and gpu
I have the same cooler, in summer it needs curve optimizer

and a 105 PPT limit if you use heavy workloads
Ya the 7900xt was a big leap in $$$
For the performance gained.

That GRE filled a bit of price/performance gap.

Either way I'm happy with the card. It will be in my PC for a long time. 



I understand your frustration though.
Considering it seems they fixed the issues with the card or drivers.
Me too! I bought the 7800xt in feb 24 just to see the gre being launched like 3 weeks later... big tears til today
Exactly. I would have waited too. 

For the price/performance increase would have been worth it. 

I don't try and get the best card. But near 80%+ of top cards.
Based on my opinion of what an acceptable price is, to me anyways. 

7900xt was another $500 , wasn't happening.
The 7900xtx competes and beats the 4090 in exactly one thing.


2D rendering. And it's close. 😂

It's nice and competitive with the 4080 super though.
I heard someone saying they had an RX 4900XT and talking about how much it sucked.
Cult green fanatics be wildin.
Yeah the power Color cards are nice. But the nitro was my 2nd choice. So I don’t think either of us made a wrong choice.
That's fair mate, I've had some serious issues with their cards in the past. AMD has been a heaven by comparison. I like how we have the same type board and the CPU haha
Niceee

Im on am4 too! 5600x

Are you noticing any performance issues?
There's probably something wrong with mine. I followed all of the guidelines and it obstructs the 3rd fan in the graphics card. It doesn't seem to sag too bad, so I'll take my chances until I can afford a better support bracket.
Solid build, sweet!
U12S is a really great choice for it's price range. I've used the both the U14S and U12A, which granted are both a bit more performant but more expensive than the U12S, and I plan on reusing them forward in future builds until... well, I dunno, I guess the heatsinks start to rust or something? Noctua provides lifetime replacement mounting brackets as socket types change over time and require it, so you can really just use them indefinitely.

Really great coolers and I'll always recommend Noctua.
What are you playing?
I just think Nvidia might be easier to deal with down the road.
I think what he's getting at is the 8000 series is right around the corner, and the rumors are almost 7900xtx performance at 7800 XT prices.
Same 😆
I'm European is it the same?
Same, lol. Now my friend who inherited the 1080ti wants to upgrade, too. He's considering the 7800XT. It's crazy how stagnant the GPU market is these days. We had huge jumps in hardware every other year back then.
Oh mb, I read that wrong lol.
Noted 🫡
Happy for ya. I don't even know what to play , CS2 😂 I built a PC to not know what to play ,Makes sense. 7800xt & 7600x
Hey for a card that’s like $600-$700 dollars cheaper I’ll take one thing over none lmao
I currently have a 5600x in as well with the stock cooler. I ordered my 5800x3d and a cooler to my home address.

I'm a student, so when I head back home for Thanksgiving I'll swap in my 5800x3d and my Noctua cooler.

Atm, no performance issues. Everything runs fine with an aggressive fan curve. GPU stays below 60°C and CPU stays below 82°C (little hot). Nevertheless, I get at least 90fps at 1440p max settings on every game with native rez and fsr off. With FSR 3 on I get over 100 fps consistently.
Is your bracket hitting the fan itself? Or you mean to say it's partially covering it?

Mine goes across the first two fans near, the outside, and the end contact point sits right in-between the second and third fan from the left.
Yeah I always hear great things about them. That's why I wanted to go with Noctua.
DO YOU FOLLOW THE CONDUCTOR’S LEAD?
Too expensive for my budget, unfortunately.
I was just impatient. I definitely could've gotten a better deal if I waited a few weeks. But I'm also on am4, so going any further would just result in cpu bottleneck tbh.
yes
The 4090 is one of the biggest jumps we've seen in a while, unfortunately the price also went up so the value did not improve over the 3000 series.

Nvidia knows they can price it however they want because people would still buy their products as they've got them locked into their ecosystem with proprietary software features like DLSS and CUDA. Not to mention both Nvidia and AMD's shift of focus to datacenter and AI where the margins are larger.
😁
Helldivers 2 



I run a 5800x3d with mine.
Nicee! I was thinking the 5800xd would be getting pretty hot...


What coolwr did you buy?
Oh it's hitting the fans, and no matter how I adjust anything it obstrucs at least one of them. I could be stupid, but it could also be messed up. IDK.
I can't find it on steam, is it an Uplay title? Think I'd have to "forgot my password" that one
70$ is a small price to pay for stability.
They'll get more expensive before they get cheaper.
4090 is massively over priced.  It wont even be able to play PS6 ray traced games.  Huge waste.  Marketing has captured the PC gamer market and they all buy over priced nvidia.

AMD is gonna abandon the Discrete GPU market and move to high performance APUs if the next RDNA fails.  Thats my guess.

1 high margin product that performs like a 7900xt/4070ti.   Thats what the future holds.  (Likely with higher performance than that.)
Noctua NH-D9L. I also have a be quiet case with silent wing 4 fans allowing tons of airflow so that also helps.
i have a 7900xt that’s tuned pretty aggressively and i haven’t ever experienced any stability issues personally
According to several benchmarks (I've been looking at Tom's Hardware in particular) the basic 4070 performs slightly worse at 1440p max setting compared to the 7800xt. It would be a downgrade. 

The closest equivalent would be a 3090, 3080ti, or a 3080 12gb. The 4070 Super is a slightly better gpu than the 7800xt, but still closer in comparison than the basic 4070.

Nonetheless, any of those Nvidia equivalent GPUs are more expensive where I live, by at least $100. Definitely not a $70 difference lmao. At least not where I live.

I already over stepped in my budget getting this variant of the 7800xt (originally I didn't want to go past $700). Where I live (Canada), the cheapest 4070 super is $799 (as of now). Paying $100 more for a <10% boost in performance and less vram is not worth it imo.

You also haven't mentioned why this card would be less stable down the road compared to an Nvidia card. You're just trolling atp.
Dude I have had a 7800xt for a year now.

ZERO issues.
More like a high price for a card that runs out of VRAM.
I spent 2 years dealing with consequence, I believe you will be happy if you traded it in besides a 4070 super is barely 100$ more and 20% faster.
Noctua is epic! 

Good choice
The nvidia equivalent is a basic 4070 which should be cheaper. I would still take the 7800xt over it, especially at a lower price.
I had a 6800XT for almost 2 years and it was good enough, I had compatibility issues with vr, so I ended up trading it in for a 3080 and all my troubles ceased far beyond just the incompatibility’s and I would do it again if given the chance.
4070 Super is $800 (sale price) and it's not 20% faster.
According to what ?

https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-vs-amd-rx-7800-xt/
4070 super performs the same and has less vram while being more expensive
Sorry you had issues. 

May have been a faulty card. 



It's like me and Asus boards. 
Won't buy them anymore.
The 4070 Super is $600. That's the MSRP and can be easily found at that price or below. https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#sort=price&c=565
It doesn't perform the same. The 4070 super is faster. https://tpucdn.com/review/galax-geforce-rtx-4070-super-ex/images/minimum-fps-relative-3840-2160.png

Also, games will look better thanks to DLSS and takes a lower performance hit with RT.

The 7800xt is clearly a step below it.
$800 CANADIAN.

OP is from Canada.
They’re definitely the same tier in terms of price/performance, and that DLSS/rt claim doesn’t matter because that’s true of any graphics card. Also DLSS isn’t in every game and neither is RTX, if you compare their raster performance it’s about the same.
Mac meme
No it’s not analogous apple
It's just another way they try to upsell and it sucks. 16 needs to be base in 2024.
There are quite a lot of people still justifying 8GB of RAM on Mac.

1. Macs are expensive and yet, they start from 8GB RAM.
2. Each memory chip cost less than $15. Is it really hard to put 16GB? No.
3. It's not upgradable as they choose not to allow that.
4. Upgrade fee sucks which is $200 to 16GB while the chip itself cost less than $15 each.
5. 8GB is totally not enough in 2024 and it will swap SSD too much.   


Whoever claims that 8GB is totally enough, many surveys already prove that 8GB cause a lot of problem and even Windows now require YOU to have at least 16GB of RAM. Get lost.
12GB ram should be the absolute minimum since Apple loves their weird numbers now. 16GB ram makes a world of difference compared to 8, both windows and MacOS
It’s not exactly the same but 8gb on a Mac is definitely better than 8gb on a PC. 
I feel like most people getting the base models don't care about specs or don't need more than 8GB. I just wish it wasn't $200 to upgrade.
8gb is enough for average use but not enough for apples prices if the MacBook Air were 500 $ it would be fine but not 1000+
Regardless of the validity of the meme. OP is insufferable.
It’s not analogous but still 8gb on Mac is far better than 8gb on Windows.

But also this should not be excuse for selling base MacBook (especially the Pro) with only 8gb of RAM

Apple must choose either one
- Significantly lowering the price for RAM upgrading at purchase
- Offer at least base 16gb for every Mac
What would settle permanently is a benchmark comparison of Macs with 8GB vs 16GB and apps with datasets and workloads of various sizes. I have an 8GB M2 MBA, and my memory pressure is never in the red. It rarely goes beyond 65%.
I’m so fucking tired of seeing the same thing said over and over again every single day in this sub. For fuck’s sake.
I feel a bit confused by the hate for this. I mean of course it would be great if Apple just gave more ram at no additional charge. 

But my og m1 computer with 8 gigs of ram still feels incredibly fast for my admittedly low end needs and still has clear selling points against Chromebooks and Windows machines.
Having asked about and then subsequently bought an 8GB M2, I can honestly say I’m pleased with the performance. It’s easy to spend other people’s money and tell them that they “NEED” to pay more for RAM. 

Besides, there is a return policy guys. Start with the 8GB, bring it home, and push it to the max—do everything you want to do and then some—open tabs in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc…play music and vids, the max. Give that computer the Worst Case scenario. If you notice issues, wipe it, pack it up and bring it back for the 16GB.
It's so true. Fuck 8gb of ram. So cringe.
Can we please stop this? It is every stinking post.
Maybe I’m a little slow, but what’s analogous?

EDIT: nevermind, got it
Wiser men than me have pointed out that the speedy SSD is being used as cache to make up for the shortfall. When it quickly fails due to millions of I/O events it will take the whole computer with it.

8gb sucks, but a non-serviceable SSD sucks even more.

For a reference, my 2009 15” MacBook had 16gb of RAM and additional dedicated VRAM.

8gb should only be considered by very light users that primarily do office work and single-task; It’s nowhere near 16gb, especially when the RAM is shared with the GPU.
I truly feel this is a hardcore vs casual argument. Every time I see threads like this I sneak over to my wife's M1 MBA, which is a base model.

50+ tabs, two steaming services, doctoral stuff....zero complaints about slowness. I heard the gambit of complaints with an older Surface. This? ZERO COMPLAINTS. 

So what are we talking about here? That Apple COULD make the base 16gb just to appease folks who likely aren't buying the base config anyways? 

Apple would be damn fools to actively sell a configuration that doesn't "work". Even the 256gb SSD "works" as life has moved away from actually storing items, and those who do have large files are....once again likely someone buying a higher config anyways. 

What are we talking about?
It’s hot garbage in 2024. At least update it to 12gb and 512gb of storage.
16GB should be the minimum. 8GB in 2024 is just laughable, especially for Macs, which are obviously very expensive.
I got a Mac for the first time recently. I got the 8 gig because they said I wouldn’t need more and they didn’t have 16 gig models in the store. I got it home, opening my browser, my IDE, and a small 2 gig VM. It almost instantly gave me the out of memory error as soon as I started playing a music video. I was able to return it no questions asked though and got a 16 gig MBA M2.
Exactly. They need to stop getting away with it. It’s a 1200 dollars laptop at minimum. 8gb is inexcusable.
I fucking love having to wait for the animation to finish before I can click on the desktop I just switched to
Typical smh
Bought my wife's 2020 27" iMac with 72gb of extra ram and installed it the same day it arrived, she can run with literally every app open on the machine and runs with over a hundred tabs open in chrome.
I come here just to see the PC users raging out about base level RAM on the Apple Silicon machines.

Note: I use both.
Wow, let’s keep bitching about how base model MacBook Pros only have xGB of RAM like it hasn’t been that way for almost 20 years and that’s exactly the model that’s been the best selling computer in the world for almost as long.
My first Mac was the 128k in 1984. My M1 Max has 32 Gb. 😊🕺
Apple should be investigated and shut down for scamming their users
8GB is only acceptable if you’re in 2010
Not 2024 or whatever year this is
Yea I fell prey to the “8gb is enough” thing when I got my M1 Air a few years ago. Was great at first but after three years of constantly swapping to my disk it started crawling. It’s really not enough for anything but light web browsing, media consumption and basic office/study use. But probably not even all three of those at the same time.
Apple in 5 years: we’re ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ now ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ shipping ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ the✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨base ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨model ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨with ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ 4GB ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ ram ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ and ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ 128GB ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨Storage.
You’re making fun of people who actually own products and they actually are fine of them. I have a Mac Studio with 32 gigs of RAM and an M2 air with 8. For every day tasks they feel identical. If you’re using demanding apps it’s your responsibility to know what your needs are. If you want to speak authoritatively about Macs it’s also your obligation to not be so asinine as to think people your needs are identical with the majority.
With that statement, Apple confirmed its Macbook is a fashion statement. Get a chromebook with half the price and double the amount of memory and slap Apple sticker on it.
Stopped by to tell you all Debian Bookworm is amazing. Have a wonderful day.
Didn’t intel recently pull its head out of its ass and make a decent m2 competitor cpu recently? Add in that windows laptops come with 16gb ram most of the time for that price point, maybe Apple will feel the pinch.

I don’t really believe what I just wrote because Apple is Apple…
I always max out the ram of every Mac I buy.
siri play love the way you lie
Just FYI, this meme format and style are annoying when they are the only we see.
If you surfing 16gb is over kill, if you trying to do something more 8gb is not enough, you stupid if you buying 8gb for video editing
"Or is it?"     
*cue VSauce theme*
Just downloaded more ram ㅋㅋㅋ /s/
you know, each of our bits are actually double the size when compared to last years bits
I absolutely love how pages still doesn’t allow un-contiguous selection!!!!
At least the could make the disk swappable…
Did you notice any noticeable performance improvements having it soldered ?
Also 256gb base model for in 2024 it’s not acceptable on a laptop
It’s more like 12GB of RAM!
We think youll love 8gb of ram
watching a youtube video from my firend's macbook air: mid 2011 (4gb ram, with catalina): pretty fast overall but i noticed some tiny lags; fan was at idle, a bit warm only at the bottom but normal overall... "let me check" and i launched activity monitor: 

- 2.5gb SWAP!!! 
He was keeping open "for work" another chrome window in fullscreen with 10 tabs, 2 pdf, mail, 1 ms word and 1 excel. 

All while playing youtube... in a 4gb dualcore old macbook air... I was really really shocked. 

Try to do this on a windows 🤣
It’s soooo not

And what happened to writing to the hard drive? Now they just fall on their face and freeze when you run out of ram.
More like 4gb...
I recently moved from windows to Mac, I can run all the same applications as my 16gb of RAM windows PC on the 8gb Mac with Ram to spare. My windows PC regally runs out of Ram running those applications. I have found the MAC's RAM management to far superior to windows
But it isn’t
You mean Unix
A few years ago I bought the m1 air base model with 8gbs (which I still consider a fantastic deal). It runs great, but the ram is for sure the bottleneck in many cases. I notice it when programming with multiple apps open, and during music production. 

Swap is nice and yes it's a little better than 8gbs on windows, but it's for sure too little for modern day computers. Ram would be my primary reason to upgrade but few options exist without climbing Apple's steep pricing ladder.
anal
16 gigs is the new 8. I have a wild prediction that within 5 years 8 gigs will be not only a dying breed of computer, but almost unheard of.
If your 8GB Mac beachballs you literally die
Like, at least have a couple of high-end configs available in store. Having to wait weeks when your machine dies sucks
.
32 GB Ram in Mac should be like Sci-Fi.
Apple is a scam.
It’s a shame because MacOS really is consumer friendly but the machines are basically sold at extortionate rates. I only buy off the secondhand market because of this
Apple have been shipping their base level machines with far little RAM since the year dot.

My one concession to them, is that for 'regular' consumers and business people (with the base level MBP), 8GB of RAM is probably fine for light photo editing etc., light productivity, Microsoft Office, Google Workspace and a few browser tabs etc.
This is why i will never buy a mac, this price for 8gb of ram is just unjustifiable. Cmon the newest iphone has 8gb of ram. And also a weird comparison byt 256gb ssd? Gta 5 itself is like 108 right now, lets say someone uses it for video editing then they will run out of storage in no time & walking around with a detachable drive is inconvenient to say the least when Ur paying this abount for a laptop
installed a jet engine for my cooler and 512 terabytes of ram, wow now youtube loads in only 1 hour
I also love that I can't see the size of my files. It's just relieving not knowing how much free space my 256 gb SSD has.
It sucks in countries where upgrade from Apple is not an option. 
Like here in KZ (only store that didn’t fuckup):

MacBook Pro M3 base 8Gb: $1960

MacBook Pro M3 Pro 18Gb: $3070

MacBook Pro M3Pro 36Gb: $3560

And there’s NO in between you either going $1010 more for reasonable RAM or go to shady stores with non-functioning warranty.
Just received my 128 gig kit for my 2020 27in iMac. Pretty fucking stoked for this.
In 2024, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD should be BASE spec. And a 4 year old model shouldn't be thousand freaking bucks in their base spec (8/256).
8gb ram on Apple silicon was comparable to 16gb on intel because its unified ram. There’s videos doing lots of performance and multitask comparisons and it’s actually true
This is why i have 32gb in my mac
haha even raspberry pi have 8gb
Sure, 8GB of unified memory = 16GB …. 😉
Apple is marketed mainly at non savvy customer's with money. Whoever was putting together their own PC from whatever was leftover in the house must feel like they're mocking people by charging 300 € for a 8 GB memory upgrade.
Class action lawsuit
At the very least if it's not, they should charge no more than like $40 for the upgrade. 8GB of ram is not $199 and please don't bring up 256GB SSD unless you just wanna piss me off.
Who downvoted this? It’s one of the most sensible comments I’ve seen on this sub.
16GB and 1TB storage base config on all Mac's.. would cost Apple next to nothing... and remove 95% of the criticism of their products.
32 honestly should be base. Ram is cheapest and easiest upgrade and there’s no reason to not have more
This is the company that sold a 4gb of ram HDD model into 2016…
I just bought a new 24 iMac and this thing with just 16 gigs Ram and 1 TB storage is 2,00,000!!!!! Like FR this shit is overpriced
Even 12GB is fine as base on the Air.
It is for the Pro machines lol
For a premium product that has such a good processor? Absolutely.
Note: 8 gigs is for light use cases (MS Office, Zoom Calls, Surfing web, etc.), but if you do heavier things (like Gaming, Editing, 3D rendering, etc.), 16 gigs or more is better
16 GB as base and replaceable storage with NVMe.
Talking about upsell, I think their worst upselling trick is that only the M2 Pro/Max chips can connect to more than one external displays. It's like going back to the 90s. They're forcing people to upgrade by $800+ if they don't want to deal with expensive docking stations for connecting to more than one display.
Weirdest thing is that iPhone RAM has been going up for years.

But Mac base RAM has stayed the same like 10y
8GB is technically still usable for light everyday workloads which is why apple keeps using it. I could look the other way for keeping it base in MBA to keep costs down but on a mbp it's inexcusable. 

Ultimately I see their reasoning for keeping it as the scam is win/win for them, people will still buy them anyway and it won't hamper sales. Either they get an 8gb model and have to upgrade much sooner, win. Or they "upgrade" to 16gb for $200 which is basically pure profit, win. 

Only way to stop this is to stop buying their laptops all together. I wanted a mac but because of stunts like this, zero repairability/upgradability I opted for something else and saved a ton of money.
I’m not saying I disagree with you. The base should absolutely be higher than 8GB, but I hear the “the chip is only $15” argument a lot and I want to comment on that, even at risk of getting downvoted to oblivion. 

It’s not only about the part cost of the chip on the BOM, but also the operational cost of maintaining multiple configurations.

Soldering the chips requires a completely different PCB that has to be built and run through the SMT process. MOBOs that let users drop in RAM do not have to have unique PCB SKUs. They are populated with the same RAM slots (and those connectors are dirt cheap compared to an actual RAM part) and then different chips are installed in during final assembly. That strategy still has some operational burden for custom configs but all the expensive custom part can be kept the same. 

This is partially why the delivery times on anything other than the base model are longer. There isn’t as much of a stocked inventory for customized specs. They probably keep a stock of the common configuration changes (like one step up on RAM, one step up on storage, or the combination of both), but they build these configs at lower volume and sometimes as a one off for the really crazy configurations. That means they have to hike the price to make up for the burden. To be clear, This isn’t just an Apple thing. The Apple specific part of it is making the base model so low to begin with, the overall strategy of integrated memory, and what they choose to set their profit margins at.

There’s a real operational cost to multiple configurations. Does that justify the premium? The prevailing sentiment around these parts is no. But just keep in mind that piecewise BOM costs don’t tell the full story.

Companies have to factor labor cost and part cost into profit margins. The profit margins are likely way higher than we want them to be as a consumer, but there’s not much we can do about that. I personally think there are performance benefits to the unified memory approach and don’t condemn companies for not making everything user upgradeable. However, I don’t agree that 8gb is analogous to 16gb all the time. At a certain point you will always be limited by the absolute capacity of the storage. Most people will
Never find that limit based on how Apple manages RAM, but in some cases (using large sample libraries in music production, for example) the absolute capacity still matters a lot. I ALSO think the price to upgrade is unfortunately high but it’s not all arbitrary. Only part of it is arbitrary.
I am using my 2021 MBP M1 8GB daily for light Photoshop and Davinci Resolve and it works great. Can switch between tabs without issues and can Listen to Youtube/podcasts while doing that. 

"8gb iS NoT EnOuGH"
Having a OG MBP with 8GB, I agree with every point except 5. You don’t know my usage and I absolutely don’t have memory swapping. Even when heavily using it.
I was pretty disappointed that they didn't go with 12 for the M3. They'll somehow figure out a way to stick with 8 for the next decade lol.
I’m not defending it, but all I’ll say is my 8gb Mac Mini is more than enough for me, as a somewhat casual user (which most people are). Hell, I even fired up Photoshop today and it didn’t miss a beat.
My 8GB M1 has been amazing for everything I’ve tried with it (I’m a software dev), what world of difference would I get by upgrading to a 16GB model?
8GB on a Windows PC\*\*

FTFY. Windows is ass when it comes to resource management.
8gb on apple silicon = 8gb ram+vram combined

8gb on PC = 8gb ram AND whatever their GPU have
macOS is *infinitely* better with 8GB than Windows, it’s not even close. My company is forced to upgrade all 8GB PC’s because they **will not** run anything on top of their management software. Our base M1 machines run laps around even our 16GB PC’s. Memory management is such a fucking joke on Windows it’s pathetic. These memes are funny to only to those who have never even used Apple silicon.
This.
That is the point. So of course a 16gb of ram machine (windows) performs a little better than the mac at 8 gigs.  But it keeps up with windows 16gb, so i’d say their claim is correct.
Windows will give you 2 chrome tabs, best they can do lol
This is a more reasonable opinion. My wife daughter and mother have 8GB models and it’s plenty for their use cases. So do many other people. Most of them don’t post on Reddit. 

Memory upgrades are so overpriced. The base amount available is not relevant
stfu apple shill
shut up and stop censoring yourself, say fucking like a real man/woman
A word in the English dictionary
You might have put 16gb in that 2009 but that doesn’t change the fact that the processor can only use up to 4gb per slot, so 8gb total.
U lying
Uh oh now you have me worried. I got myself a 13" 16g M2 2 months ago and love it. I just ordered an 8g with bigger screen for my wife hoping that it would suffice for browsing, emails, and Photoshop. It delivers today I'm gonna have to "push it" and make sure it's good enough.
For real. I switched from windows to Mac two years ago and the (slow) animations still drive me nuts to the point where I avoid MacOS native functions where ever possible. Like Alttab instead of Mission Control etc.
Typical necro poster
Lying
It's best selling because people buy what everyone else buys.
stfu, you could buy tb's of ram on a intel mac in 2019 it hasnt been this xGB of ram way for 20 years now the max is 28gb headass, r/thisguystupid
How long did it last before you upgraded it to a 512k fat Mac?
Also to the person who disliked I’m an apple fanboy but still I genuinely think they will do this.
Anything but debian… debian is just unfinished ubuntu
isn't apple on m3?
Intel is just uncompetitive for power consumption at this point. Both AMD and apple have significantly better efficiency than anything Intel can put out.
That’s the whole point.

They make you pay 200 bucks for a 30 bucks upgrade.
Ok
No, he means macOS.

Apple based Mac OS X on BSD Unix a very long time ago and I'd be surprised if the amount of BSD code they used accounts for even one percent of the entire operating system nowadays.

It has a custom windowing system, desktop environment, many custom drivers, many custom command line utilites, and many other components made by Apple.

Modern macOS is definitely well over 100 million lines of code, or close - as OS X tiger was \~85 million lines of code. While FreeBSD - a direct derivative of the original BSD Unix with also a bunch of custom code added is \~nine million lines of code.

The term Unix-**LIKE** exists for a reason.
The real SCAM is people thinking they need more RAM when all they do is browse the web, post on Reddit, and create low-effort memes like this.
Do macs not show how much space you have left?
You =necroposter
Necropost
I think the worst is actually not even the amount of storage but that they cheaped out on the components and only put one chip in these models which makes it very slow and breaks it a few years down the road due to wear leveling.
They are apple. What do you expect
yeah... 256 gig ssd is a little iffy, i made it work in my windows machine for a while (with a 4 terrabyte hard drive for my games) but it was absolute pain
Have you not seen many comments here? That more RAM should be standard is the consensus lol. I mean [this is the first result I get](https://reddit.com/r/mac/comments/17kce8u/come_on_apple_8gb_ram_must_be_a_joke_in_2024/) when I search "RAM" on this subreddit.
I just don’t get why I need 16GB..? I have an M2 with 8GB and it’s plenty for my usage.
Sponge Bob
I'm curious how much it would boost their sales if they upped the base config of all macs to 16Gb RAM and 1Tb storage but keeping the current prices. That would cost them pennies but make their products 9001% more desirable.
It would cost profits.
Not for Apple. Its RAM & SSD must be made of gold.
[deleted]
My old 16gb MacBook was more than enough for major tasks.  I upgraded to 32gb, much better not using swap. But, I would say 16gb should be the smallest amount. Or because we are doing weird numbers 18gb.
Why stop there? I don’t want anyone to be able to buy their MacBook with less than 64GB.
[deleted]
Yeah exactly. iPhones now have the same ram as a base Mac… as a mac should only do one thing at the time…
Pretty sure iPhone ram was 6GB for like, 5 years straight. It’s just the lowest number that still is functional for most users, why would they increase it if it still works?
Same reason here, i will stuck with older hw for the moment.
I really like the new architecture but find unacceptable this politics against upgradability and repairability, they are shortening the life of their products and producing lot of future e-waste which will be disposed in very few years
Yours is the best summary of the current state of affairs. Tim knows the base price is just the start of the conversation and the share of the customer base that will balk at adding $200 or $400 is a lot lower than the vast majority who will click the button and merely resent Apple that much more. 

College kids who view a 13” MBA as an aspirational purchase will just be glad to have one, and pros checking out with a 16” MBP can absorb it, even if it makes them 5%-10% more willing to consider PC life the next go round (as a lot of their coworkers already have, probably).

They have to know their loyalty among the Premiere/Lightroom and Ableton/FL Studio crowds is coasting mainly on familiarity and personal preference these days. iPhone Pro marketing seems skewed more and more toward Content Creators™️, which is probably a very canny bet since something like 70% of teens aspire to be one. I just wonder how long wealthy grads with arts degrees will sustain this strategy for them on the desktop side; even people with unlimited tech budget know +$1600 for ram and storage is just a middle-finger.
Will you save money in the long run though? My Mac will still be rock solid after 7 or 8 years, where most PCs need to be replaced in half that time. Did you save over 50% by not getting a Mac?
yeah lol like my m1 mac is still faster than my work lenovo which is current with an i5 and 16 gigs. Like I also believe the mac should be updated to have a higher base but its honestly not at all as bad as reddit says on here its fine.
Agreed. I suspect that Apple know that 'most' consumers use their MBAs for Safari, Netflix, Music playback, some email and Apple Photos storage and editing.... And not much more.

(Maybe these people should have an iPad instead. But I'm sure that Apple would rather they buy an M2 MBA).

So if you're not task switching back and forth, 8GB is probably fine for most people. 

Though in 2024 I'm not using my own money to buy a 8GB MBA (as in 16GB future proofs it).

As for the base MBP with 8GB - only corporate purchasing departments should ever buy this machine for those who are running Keynote, Safari/Chrome and MS Office and not much else.
Do you even aware that AS Mac doesn't even use regular RAM which has way more process and memory chips? It's not the first time that Apple tried to lower the cost by all mean necessary with SSD and RAM. You only justifying their premium while others with proper RAM structures cost way less than what Apple charges. Like I said, Apple used only a few memory chip while PC has proper RAM with multiple memory chips at once. And Apple used to have a regular RAM just like others and yet, still cost $200 to upgrade to 16GB. 

&#x200B;

Beside, there are many people who upgraded RAM so easily with soldering that Apple has to block it in software. How come soldering is difficult when people with ability to solder can upgrade by themselves? Doesn't really make sense.
I use the same machine for Adobe PS and AI. And it… it struggles a lot… idk man maybe your files don’t have a lot of layers and shapes, but my 2019 MBP with 5500M overperforms MBP m1 with 8 gigs in daily real tasks. However, it heats af
8 is fine, just not fine at apples entry price points.
Agreed, when they made a 24gb option on M2 it seemed clear that it was a step to do 12 and 24 options on M3. Now that the M3 Pro and Max are using 6gb step ups and starting at 18gb, 12gb for the base M3 seems even more obvious.

Surely that 6gb increments is coming to the base processors as well and they just hit a time constraint on M3, so it'll likely be 12gb on M4 a year from now.
for people that use a computer as a big phone/tablet, you won't need much. for people that use a computer as a computer, and actually multitask, that's where the problems start. 

My 8gb M1 Macbook Air (2021) is already halfway thru it's life because i underspecced, now the TBW (TeraBytes Written) for the SSD is at 60% of it's life thanks to it. Only had it for 2 years, so if i kept using it the way I was, it would've only lasted me like 5 years max before the SSD failed. That's the side effect of underspeccing ram, you use more SWAP (the process of using your storage medium as temporary RAM), which since macs use SSDs (and they have a limited amount of times you can write to them), you can quickly make a computer which should realistically last 8-10 years only make it about halfway thru that lol. 

This is why people are calling for the minimum to be 16, because even though there are people like you who don't need 16, apple doesn't tell you what I just told you about. They just sell it to you, and then you'll find out the hard way (and be out repair costs at minimum). 

I agree with /u/GamerNuggy that 12gb should probably be the minimum now, it's a good middle ground that still gives people upward options, while not being underpowered. It's important to remember that Apple intends to have all of their devices usable for *anyone*. And I think with the current computing world, and the shitty devs who don't care about memory management anymore (thanks OOP), 8GB just doesn't cut it as a "minimum general use case" spec, for multitasking computers at least.
Yeah, I’ve found that I leave loads of apps open and multitask while playing games, so 16GB ram is very much a must
If you multitask even a little bit
same exp. I have an M2 pro mini with 32gb and an M1 air with 8. of course mini is faster. but the air is fast enough also. safari, chrome, vscode, docker(!), mysql, msft office, affinity. ive had it for several years now. it has never let me down. incomparable to an 8gb windows pc ofc.
If you were to get a 16GB or 32GB model, it would be even **more** amazing. And that's the point - for the price you pay for a Mac computer, you should definitely be getting that extra performance.

My 8GB M2 Mac Mini works for software engineering, too. But it completely falls apart for multitasking Blender, 3D games, movies, and even multiple windows of non-performance intensive things.

Luckily, I barely ever multitask that much. But when I do, it's extremely painful.

Also, It's worth noting that my mac mini is literally the cheapest mac computer you can get right now, so it's not as angering as the 8GB on the new 8GB of RAM Macbook pros which are well over $2000 in Canada. But then again, it hasn't gotten the M3 yet.
thank you for specifying 8gb  on linux is good
Windows 11 feels better than windows 10, it utilizes a ton of ram like macOS to preload tasks. However, it’s obnoxious that every program wants to start with every boot. Some even refuse to start because its startup wasn’t on during boot time.
Isn't the big thing that Android is the one that's hot garage in ram though? Windows seems to use ram better when it's available.
honestly yeah, on my 64 gig system a single day later it commits and holds in cache 54 gigs of ram when only 3 tabs of chrome are open, steam, discord (1 stream running) and 3 background apps(wallpaper engine and stuff like that)
Even a Linux PC. My Mac Mini with 8 GB of RAM runs infinitely smoother than my Linux install with 8 GB.
Agree, Windows could work with 8GB decently in Windows 7 and even 8.1 (used both systems from start to end of life). But Linux still goes hard xD
Most people with only 8gb ram probably don't have a discrete GPU...
it’s still dogshit
hey man cmon, my work pc is 8gb and I keep 12 safari tabs open and it only takes me maybe 4 to 5 minutes to switch from a google sheets tab back to my email.

if I had more ram I would miss out on that down time
it’s such an enormous difference, night and day.
Yeah but an additional 8gb ram upgrade doesn’t cost $200 on a windows machine?
anything is better than windows pc's running corporate bloat. corporate bloat ruins windows for work.
Op has smooth 🧠
I wasnt sure if i would be banned for swearing lol
I don’t know why this is being downvoted, it’s technically true 😂
OH MY GOD I NEVER KNEW
I wish I could borrow one of those for free. They should make a place that you sign up and just borrows books and return them in a set amount of time. Imagine how smart we would all be with unlimited reading?
Nope
100% do this.  Those 8 gig macs rely heavily on swapping and when you run out of swap, you just have to terminate an app.  Just opening a few browser tabs can push you in to the swap if you have music or something going.   Open all the apps she uses and see if its right for her.
And? You don’t hear many complaints from that crowd, do you? It’s ok to need something more than the base model. That’s not these people.
[removed]
You are criminally stupid.
Yeah I read something about meteor lake… or something. A 2024 competitor. Actually it probably is to compete with m3
They are assholes and Tim Cook is a complete downer
Good data points. Thks!
I wonder if low level memory management changed a lot.
The logic will be the same until 2nm 2025-2026....after that, we'll see
No. 

The worst -- they put the BIOS on the SSD. And the t2 is PAIRED to the SSD and CPU and the computer won't boot without either. 

So the computers can't be fixed even with new parts and a hot air station
The worst part is now they sodder it together so you can’t upgrade it yourself
I dunno, I opted for a 256GB model because I use Nextcloud and NAS. Practically nothing I do needs to be stored on the drive. I very much doubt this drive will fail before the laptop is essentially useless for other reasons anyway. 

The cheap ass 1TB cache SSD on my server, on the other hand, gets the shit pounded out of it and will probably need to be replaced next year after a two year service life.
Depends on the day of the week and time of day. 

"acKshUALLY, 8GB IS FIne." gets plenty of love around here too.
I get downvoted anytime I point out when someone's use case obviously calls for more than 8GB... because Apple can defy physics and magic away mathematics.  

Seriously, it's a simple math problem.  Sonoma consumes 5.5GB.  A loaded browser (which we all have, c'mon) is 1-2GB at load.  Any media creation or office software is going to take another 0.5-1GB.  So a very basic workload pushes up against 8GB.

BuT itS UnIfIedMemOrY!1!!  Okay, so thrash the SSD for thousands of read/writes everyday, and see how long your $1k+ laptop lasts.
It's not that you "need" 16GB, it's that a $1000 laptop with only 8GB of RAM is poor value because it is bound to get way more bogged down by later OS releases than 16GB systems. Plus, adding another 8GB of RAM is only about 20 bucks for Apple, so they are just being stingy.
Then why are you buying a MacBook. A 500 dollar laptop would do what you need just fine
Really? Then you re not doing anything mid heavy prolly email office and yt.
Why not giving them for free? they get free market share
Depends on their margins and the impact to sales, they could sell more units due to the spec bump and good press, with less variety in sku.. (e.g more people buy the same item). That would mean a faster and simpler fulfilment and supply chain. Also it might reduce returns and support cases (overhead costs decrease), as each device sold will have more RAM and therefore a smaller impact to their built in disk storage lifespan.
Ya $400 for an extra 16gb its gotta be
I mean, most components are (or a least contain it to be more specific)
But then nobody is gonna pay 240€ to go from 8 to 16GB RAM. Because... for DDR5 modules you can get 64GB for that.

Yeah, they use LPDDR which is more power efficient than regular SO-DIMMS and put them onto the package. If apple wanted to make them upgradeable, they could. But it is to their advantage that you cannot upgrade the thing.

It's probably to nobody's surprise that Apple really likes money.
You’re being facetious, a lot of games now require 16gb Ram minimum so 32 should be base for gaming
nah fam the 16gb upgrade kit is overpriced, i had to buy it cos the old iMac slow as hell
X - 3gb

Xs Max - 4gb

11 pro max - 4gb

12 pro max - 6gb

13 pro max - 6gb

14 pro max - 6gb

15 pro max - 8gb

So in 7 Years iphone ram has over doubled. Even when 4gb still performs well . (Xs got ios 17 and runs perfectly fine)

But why not macs? Which does wayyy bigger and heavier things than phones.
It unfortunately isn't going to change and old mac hardware that was upgradable/repairable are all now obsolete/end of life. 

Options now are get with the program and buy a new Mac or switch to a windows / Linux based device that better meets your needs. I switched to a premium Ryzen 7, 16gb machine that I can upgrade SSD/ram and saved almost $800. Dual booting windows and Linux also lets me choose what os meets my needs better for the task.
I studied CS and around 80% of my class had macs too (which they ironically used in bootcamp most of the time because our course was windows heavy). There is a large following in all college courses. 

I do think macs are amazing powerful computers and better for some use cases, but there is a partial fashion/status symbol cloud around them (amplified by influencers) and thinking that they're simply better than any windows laptop. From my experience this is because 80% of windows laptops in the wild are e-waste junk and all apple machines are premium quality machines. When your only experience is jumping from a $300 Acer to a MacBook Pro it is going to be amazingly better.
Short answer is yes I will, but for others it really depends on what you're doing. 

Your logic regarding how long a pc will run for is flat out misinformation and from my experience a common justification for many buying a Mac. 10 years ago you would be more right as then macs simply were better for the money. Now a $300-500 laptop will likely only last 3-5 years, a premium $800-1300  laptop will last 7-8yrs easily. 

My old windows laptop that I just replaced (and is still 100% usable for every day tasks) is a 2016 HP Spectre (i5-6200, 8gb RAM) that I bought on sale for $800. My main reason for replacement was the battery no longer lasts a full day and I now need 16gb ram. 

After 8yrs your Mac will likely not be rock solid. Apple only supports their laptops for 6-8yrs, after 6 they go end of life and stop receiving new OS and feature updates, 2yrs later it goes obsolete and no longer gets security updates (which at that point you shouldnt use it online). I do hope they extend this though. And my spectre also is hit with something similar, next year Microsoft will kill win10 and I can't upgrade it to win11 due to it being incompatible, but can't complain at 9yrs of good use for $800.
Remember ram has nothing to do with core speed, it's just active memory. Your m1 will be miles better than any i5. 

Unused ram makes zero difference, I've seen people on here spend silly money to upgrade to 64gb to make their laptop faster. However if you don't have enough ram to run your apps you'll see issues with paging cache and potentially longer loading times for apps.
It’s not difficult per se, but someone desoldering then resoldering by hand one time for themselves is very different than the operational burden of maintaining multiple motherboard configurations and building unique configurations at scale in a manufacturing context.

Tech manufacturers use automated SMT lines, so any different configuration requires a different SKU, and potentially unique SMT Programs depending on if the chips are exact footprint matches or not. They also then all need to be bundled and tracked in separate job orders. 

Like I said, I’m in no way defending the absurd price. All I’m doing is sharing some more insight that it’s not just about the BOM cost or what you may pay to buy the same part and do it yourself. 

I agree that it’s too expensive. I’m not sure how what I’m saying is justifying the premium. All I’m doing is saying it’s not accurate to say “they’re charging $200 for a $15 part and making $185 profit”.
Agreed, if you're buying a dirt cheap Windows PC, or even a $600 Mac Mini, 8gb is fine. The $1k+ level has long been 16gb standard, and Apple having the gall this year to effectively move up the base level  8gb on a MacBook Pro  to $1600 is horrendous when that's entering 32gb standard territory.


All that to add if Apple was charging $50 to upgrade to 16gb, we wouldn't be as concerned, but no they're scalping be $200 for it.
8 is fine only if you have another free RAM slot to put another 8 down the road
I won’t argue- you sound like you know a heck of a lot more than I do. I’ll just say that in my case, a 5 year life span sounds fine. I wouldn’t be interested in using hardware much older. My Mac was like $500 and the 16gb version is like 50% more so the math is acceptable with me.
I must have a magical Mac then because the **only** time I've had an issue was when running several random search algorithms at once, and even then it was fine for the most part. I think most people here are just trying to justify the fact they spent more when they probably didn't have to.
As a reward…
It’s still worse than the Mac.
2GB fine on Linux
[deleted]
How even?

I got 64 gigs for over a year now and I've yet to see >45gig usage, even while allocating 16 for a Minecraft server
No it doesn’t. But on a Mac, upgrading to 16GB more closely compares to a PC running *much more* than 16GB… you cannot compare the prices of these machines because they are not made equal. I mean hello, iPhones have always had less RAM than any other flagship device and yet they have never *not* placed 1st in benchmark scores. This isn’t new stuff. Not to mention, you can actually resell MacBooks for hundreds. You wanna talk about throwing money away? Let’s talk about how terrible of an investment Windows machines are 😂
Stinking is funnier imo
It's been a rollercoaster of a day for you.
You mean like….disappearing ebooks? Bruh that’s WILD.
[removed]
You should consider that os where 32 bit in 2006 -> you could only address a maximum of 4gb of ram, so you got 1/4 of the maximum ram…
Now you got 8 gb on a an architecture that can go beyond 64 gb … 8gb are at least 1/8 of the maximum ram …
Proportional to the price tag which has been always “premium”, you are getting less value than in 2006.
there already was an m2 competitor, its not an apple or an intel, amd threadripper
I'm not sure, one thing I've always wondered about in macOS is how many lines of code the Finder is. Though I can't find this information anywhere.

Also I'm sorry if my earlier comment was rude, really didn't intend for that.
😱
I thought Apple Silicon Macs didn't have T2
I think you will probably be fine as long as you have enough RAM to avoid swapping.
For many people it actually is. 

For most on this sub though, it won't be and that's where we get the confrontation. A lot of people get stuck on their own use case and can't acknowledge that there are students using them for note taking, email, web browsing and Netflix. And for such users 8gb is fine. 

People forget that a 16gb MacBook is $200 more than an 8gb model, so even if the base was 16gb, it would still cost that $200 more. But these same people still seem to want to have the student pay $200 more just so the base model satisfies their own criteria.
> Okay, so thrash the SSD for thousands of read/writes everyday, and see how long your $1k+ laptop lasts.

Drive last much longer than the supported life of the device. Modern SSD are much more robust than the early ones.

https://www.ionos.co.uk/digitalguide/server/security/ssd-life-span/

>  According to current failure statistics, SSDs are generally more reliable than classic HDDs in practice.

> ‘total bytes written’, meaning the total number of bytes that can be written onto an SSD. Today, SSD manufacturers often state a service life (guaranteed write volume) of 256 TBW. With average PC usage, for example, around 80 TBW can be performed within 10 years. In the usage scenario ‘moderate, eight-hour, weekly use as an office PC’ (word processing, surfing the net, checking emails, occasional streaming, a few larger downloads, as well as smaller backup and copying actions, but not a high continuous load), the hard drive would have a predicted life expectancy of approximately 32 years.

> However, if you record a large image backup on an SSD every day (e.g., 170 GB on a 180 GB disk), it can actually get tight after a few years. With a view to greater continuous use, a DWPD value is often given for SSDs: The manufacturer Kingston specifies a ‘Drive Writes Per Day’ value of 0.30 for its DC400 DW SSD model (480 GB storage capacity). The value is calculated using a formula that includes the TBW value (Kingston adheres to a standardised calculation method based on JEDEC workload when determining the TBW value):

> TBW of the SSD * 1000/365 days * Number of years * Storage capacity
In this specific example for calculating a DWPD value, the guarantee period of 5 years flows into the ‘number of years’ (meaning the life span of an SSD that is guaranteed by the manufacturer):

Even if you're writing the entire disc every day, it will probably still do 5 years. So in short, SSD life is not an issue in these discussions.
Unified memory means CPU and GPU share same RAM, it is actually a negative in terms of capacity usage for the same reason. Using page/swap is a separate thing.
for every other reason people state they buy mac. hardware, design, ecosystem, trackpad, battery life.

why are you trying to gatekeep entry level models from entry level users?
That comment makes zero sense
For Garageband. Port that to windows you filthy casual.
??? I don’t even know how to answer this. You’re saying that 8GB isn’t enough but then say the 8GB Mac I have is overpowered for my needs.
Correct, plus some FaceTime. Not everyone is a power user. Occasionally I do some photoshopping but that’s about it. I have a Mac because it’s the core of my ecosystem and it works with iMessage and iCloud too.
That's exactly who the entry-level configurations are meant for though.
I do a ton of coding, app design, image editing, etc. and have never had an issue with an 8GB M1. If I needed to upgrade I would, but I don’t. What are people doing that needs 16GB+?
if i remember correctly those ram are not removable, at least on older models
Indeed, Apple doesn't have to be married to DIMMs. Dell engineered CAMM for a DIMM/SO-DIMM replacement and made it an open standard.
Who is buying a Mac for gaming in the first place lmao
Sad but true!
I’m still sticking with old hw just because open core is still supporting it and I don’t need so much performance.
Computing power and the efficiency is still a problem but unless you do really heavy stuff some older Mac can still cover some use case like in my case.
When my trashcan will become totally useless i will move back to linux if nothing change in future Mac generations
Like I said, how come Apple's RAM with single or few memory chip cost way more than regular RAM with proper design and multiple memory chips? The process of making regular RAM supposed to be way more than just soldering and yet it's cheaper. I guess you dont know how RAM manufactured, huh? Apple's RAM is totally simple and it just soldered on PCB just like regular RAM. Why do you think it will cost more? Beside, regular RAM has way more than memory chips itself. 

&#x200B;

Your claim already failed to justify the logic. Totally doesn't make sense. It's just Apple's premium after all.
>$1k+ level has long been 16gb standard

More like 32, i have 16 but its level of 700-800 entry level machine
I get it, for me I'm still somewhat "oldschool" and hate planned obsolescence and the idea of having to buy a new computer every 5 years. I want my computers to last at least 8, 10 ideally. The only piece of tech that actually tends to wear is either the SSD/HDD or the battery, the CPU/GPU, motherboard, and RAM really shouldn't be damaged unless they overheat. So I really don't see a point in making computers last any less than a decade, personally.

The thing with computers is that if your usage habits never get more needy, you won't need a better device. If all you do is web browsing and light doc editing, you can pick up a thinkpad t420 and it'll do that completely fine for as long as you don't do anything more intensive. If literally all you need is very basic text editing/printing, and you don't require a modern GUI, you realistically could still be using a PC from the 90s (with an appropriately aged printer of course lol). That's the nice thing about computers, old hardware isn't inherently bad just because of age. The computer isn't the thing that's changing, it's always your usage habits as a user. You're the one growing out of your computer, not the other way around. Once you realize that, then you realize that upgrading just to upgrade isn't really always a necessity.

I feel like I'm at a peak with my computer usage, i don't really envision myself needing anything more than what I currently do (ofc things can always change), so I bought a computer that matches those needs (a 2023 M2 Pro MacBook Pro, 16GB, 500GB), and I honestly think I could've just went with a plain M2 device. This thing is a bit overpowered for what I do, **which is good** because I know that I will have this computer for 6+ years as long as nothing chances it (screen break, part malfunction, etc). And I have a buffer set up (by overspeccing accidentally), just in case I do end up increasing my usage.
Fine for the most part is not what you should get for well over $2K. Plus, if you do any 3D work in Blender or similar programs, a computer with 8GB of RAM with 8 or less cpu cores will fall apart quickly as it has for me. If you are making 3D animations with cycles on blender - well, don't even try to.

For your purposes, 8GB seems perfect, and it seems that you have an M1 which is made in a period where the pricing wasn't as crazy and M-chips actually had an edge over typical x86\_64 chips. So you shouldn't regret your purchase.

But when you offer a professional computer (Macbook pro) with mediocre-at-most specs for well over $2,000 CAD, where your target audiences are people who need like 4x what is actually offered, you can't really expect people to NOT get rightfully upset.

I still think stuff like the Mac mini is a great value because it's almost 3x less than a Macbook pro with nearly the same specs. I have had problems with it like I stated above, but I'd probably also have those problems with the crazy-priced Macbook pro.

Point is that "good enough" is not even close to "good enough for professionals", which is the Macbook pro's target audience. Maybe 8GB is analogous to 16GB on a Windows PC, but even then the pricing would still be too high.

I quote Apple Explained: "\[Why are they offering only 8GB of RAM on a computer this expensive?\] The short answer is: Because they can." If you want native Unix-Like utilities, more advanced capabilities, AND great app compatibility, you are forced to buy a Mac. And they know that.
[deleted]
Source? Not trying to argue or pick sides just want to learn more about this.
Not really. On Linux I can get 3Gb ram usage while doing normal tasks, down to <500m If I really want to have a minimal setup. This is impossible on mac
Yeah I'm on a OnePlus 8T and running stuff in the background is much better than my iPhone 6S+ was, but I assumed it was because it was a jump from 2GB of ram to 12Gb. My iPad Pro 2018 has't run into many issues either with it's just 4GB.


But I'm also coming to the inevitable realization I'll upgrade to a newer MacBook Pro because 16Gb isn't enough, so I guess demand just varies.
it’s not usage, but it is cache it did not want clearing out, usage was around 8-12, coincidentally around 12 gigs remained free
Yep.
And what did the base model ship with? You sad you can’t get terabytes of integrated memory on an SoC? Jesus F
Christ wasn’t that thing for like massive gaming pcs though? 💀
I didn’t find it offensive. 
Lines of code does not correlate with performance tho.
You're correct. It's built into the main soc. 

But older macs are also impacted. 

I still find it crazy it runs a stripped down version of iOS called BridgeOS and is basically an older iPhone chip. I think it communicates over Ethernet via a few data lines.
2% used after three years, 15TB written. Lol. I did get the 16GB RAM because I knew I would actually use it and I do. Very few local files, but lots of random programs open all the time.
>People forget that a 16gb MacBook is $200 more than an 8gb model, so even if the base was 16gb, it would still cost that $200 more. But these same people still seem to want to have the student pay $200 more just so the base model satisfies their own criteria.

No, they want the base model to stay the same price and come with 16GB, as it should be. $200 for 8GB isn't just stupid, it's ridiculous, you can buy a 32GB kit of DDR5 5600 for around $100 on Amazon, RAM is like the cheapest part on a computer nowadays and Apple still charges like it's 2012. Don't worry about their margins, they could very well sell every base models with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for the same price and still make more profits than most constructors, they just don't want to.
Actually guy right here. 

Hop off apples d and just say they are overpricing their products and over charging to upgrade components.
Thank you! I’m not a power user, why on earth do I need a tonne of ram? For me, it would be a waste of money! I do, however, need an M2 Air because my old 2016 Intel is incredibly slow and laggy. It’s simple. You could argue an M1 is fine, and it probably would be, but I like the design and bigger screen of the the 15” M2 Air.
[deleted]
I get by fine on my m2 pro 16 gb editing footage, occasionally fcp will crash or there will be stalls or other hiccups that I wonder would be fixed with 32gb

after a few hours on a sufficiently large project I'll check activity manager to find fcp using a ton of ram with a shit ton of swap going on. so I'd say I'm a person who 16gb ram is the minimum I can get away with
I’m actually not commenting at all on the RAM chip itself. I’m only commenting on the manufacturing and operational side. Your original post made it seem as if you were implying if the RAM part costs Apple $15 then it shouldn’t cost us more than $15 to upgrade. I was simply mentioning that what we find as piecewise costs does not reflect the total cost to the company to offer that upgrade. Apologies if I misunderstood your original post.

You are right, I am not familiar with how RAM chips are manufactured. I DO know how consumer electronics products are manufactured as a full assembly though, which is why I’m only commenting on that specific area. 

And, once again, I will say I fully agree that the Apple premium for the memory is too high. I simply do not like when people over simplify the manufacturing side and expect to not pay any more than it would cost to buy that same part themselves.

We can agree that the price Apple charges is too high while also agreeing that the upgrade should cost the consumer more than just the price of the specific part, can’t we?
Was doing a quick browse and between $1k and $2k most Windows laptops start at 16, there are some starting at  32gb, but not many. Agreed though there's plenty of sub $1000 that are also 16gb standard, you don't really tend to see 8gb until the sub $500 level.
Just like with Windows, Linux has to support nearly every hardware variant. Apple can support and optimize for one single set of hardware. Also, Apple can invest large amounts of money and time into optimizing their OS for their hardware using the best programmers money can buy. Linux relies largely on coders giving up their free time to work on OSS and many of them are hobbyists/amateurs.
Memory compression
I'm curious as well, a few years ago most lightweight Linux distributions actually outperformed macOS as a whole on Apple hardware.

Though, this was with intel Macs.

Also since Linux is the Kernel (Which is the most important part of an OS) and comes with no default desktop environment or GUI, it probably still could if you put a lighter weight distribution on it (On Intel, at least).

But, you also have to take into account that there are barely any apps for Linux on ARM which is what the newer macs use, and Rosetta II is ***infinitely*** more compatible than the Linux equivalent, box64.

Most people buy Macs for the (most people would think) better OS anyways, putting Linux on that turns it into a regular PC - which isn't inherently bad until you realize that you've lost %99.9 of your app compatibility.

This is coming from someone who loves Linux.
I’ve yet to find a Linux distribution that is less laggy on my Intel Nuc with 8 gb of RAM than my Mac Mini is with 8 GB of RAM
[deleted]
There isn't any reason to clear that cache unless something else wants the RAM, though. You still had 12GB that wasn't even being used, so of course the cache isn't going to be cleared. It's not like a HDD or SSD where there's actually a downside to the cache taking up whatever isn't actively being used.
To be fair the SoC is entirely on Apple. They're not even using HBM. They're using LPDDR5. Literally no explanation why they're upcharging so much for cheap ass memory chips. They could've easily used desktop or laptop ddr5, but no, have to go with LPDDR5. Efficiency? Sure. That's why low power sodimms exist. They did this just to fuck with user upgradability and repairability. It doesn't even give a big bandwidth or clock boost.
Cool info, thanks!
Well, when you have 16GB this won’t be a problem but I can definitely see how 8GB of RAM and 1 chip SSD storage could run into problems.

I personally got the 16GB/512GB M2 Pro for this reason. I only need like 200GB but I like to keep it half empty for the speed.
> No, they want the base model to stay the same price and come with 16GB, as it should be.

Well that won't happen will it. The 16gb model costs $200 more, so that's what Apple priced it at and that's what they would sell it at.
 
You can argue all day about what it should cost but people are still buying them, so Apple won't lower prices because they just don't have to.


**edit** sometimes I forget that people can't read sarcasm on the internet 😅
It is what it is, I'm not riding anything, I just understand the reality. They aren't going to reduce prices if their products keep selling. What business would? Prices are only over if people stop buying, it's simple supply and demand. Most people moaning aren't going to be buying the things anyway.
sounds valid to me, but if you’ve had your current laptop for 7 years and your money is flexible enough to go to the 15”then i would recommend 16gb for future proofing and resale 
How is simply having a Mac too much for me? I want MacOS and integration with my iPhone. Come on, don’t make me explain all this. 

To go along with your analogy which you’ve since deleted:

My M2 is a sporty hatchback. Fast, but can’t carry a lot. You want a sporty wagon that can carry lots whilst still being fast. I simply don’t need to carry lots of things, but I still want a fast car.
Apple's process is totally simple compared to regular RAM. How come you are keep ignoring that? It's memory chip itself vs RAM with many parts all together. Clearly, you know nothing about it.
when u said windows PC, i had in mind desktop not laptop, i guess 16gb is more justifiable there
[deleted]
Man I have arch and xfce on a super old PC with 2Gb of ram that I use for some hobby prrogramming projects. It isn't laggy at all and works very well. 

Heck If you use some older versions/minimal wms you can use a PC with 1Gb without any lag. 

If you really want to go the minimal route you can use LFS and run with ~80mb ram usage. 

Macos is definitely not light on ram, compared to Linux at least
Yeah it's ironic the debate used to be that the iPhones had too little ram, and it's not really brought up anymore.
yeah i’m sorry, but VR eats that ram for breakfast, hence the cleansing
Speaking of arguments people have made for more than a decade… It sounds like you want a different product. 🤷🏻‍♂️
No problem. I could ramble forever on random tech stuff related to Apple devices 😅
Without actually seeing the wear levels on a few machines myself, I don't know if it's actually an issue or not. I honestly think it's a bit overblown because if it was a serious concern, people would probably be talking about wear levels on older MacBooks more, like "2018 MacBooks with 8GB of RAM will only have their SSDs last another year at most, here's the proof" but I don't see people talking about that, really. If it was as bad as people make it out to be, I think we'd have probably heard about MacBooks eating up SSDs before now. 

Obviously it would be better to have a better SSD, but as far as I'm concerned, the M1 chips stomp everything else so badly that I don't really care. The battery life, low operating temperature, and low noise are way, way more important to me than the SSD is. Probably for most people too, even if they don't really realize it. In a person who owned a single Apple product ever prior to 2020 (iPod classic in 2006) and never would have considered a MacBook prior to M series. I just think it's that good.
Then they should put 512mb of ram and charge 200$ for every 512mb of extra ram as they used to do before. Aparently prices can´t go down as techology advances because they are set on stone.
Yes you're not special for understanding that they won't reduce their prices. They never have, they never will, we ALL know this. But you can't deny that they over price their upgrades.
In an ideal world, the MBP would start with a base of 16GB. There is really no feasible applications where having just the 8GB of memory pairs well with the computational performance. On the other hand the MBA seems reasonable for 8GB of memory but ideally it would be at a cheaper base price. So instead of the current model where Apple price discriminates by the categories of (overpriced entry level: people that want a decent quiet laptop or are attached to the ecosystem, really over priced with 16GB: people that want the performance and efficiency but also have workflows that demand memory or need to use VMs), we could maybe have a more reasonable discrimination where the 16GB of memory is at least attached to the MBP since those people are already paying for the high performance they need. And then the 8GB MBP would be comprable to a high spec IPad in price, while the “standard-user” would be like a 12gb MBP at the current base price MBPs. As consumers we have to be aware that when we cave in to the pricing model, we are a small component of what enables Apple to price discriminate this way.

Side note: I actually like the idea of hardware makers limiting the amount of memory for the very casual consumers just so software devs are forced to not bloat the fuck out of their programs, because right now, while memory sizes and speeds are getting better it feels like software is just consuming it without an corresponding increase in features / utilities / speed etc. This way you get a win-win situation for the consumers where the casual consumers aren’t wasting value and the power consumers have more memory usage available.
It doesn’t. It runs much worse. Like I’ve said elsewhere, I use both daily on 8 GB. My M1 Mac mini runs so much smoother than my Linux box on 8 GB.
Man, that’s so cool. I also run Arch on my nuc and it still runs worse than my base M1 Mac Mini.
But why would they? As far as I know the M1 is the first SSD Apple sold with a one chip SSD. The fact that one chip SSDs often fail when used for boot drives is the reason most premium manufacturers (including Apple before 2022) avoid this. I think it is really the combination: lot of swaps due to undersized memory + one chip SSD will be the problem here. I think that this was an none-issue if the base model had 16 GB of RAM or if it came with 512 GB of SSD.

This is a problem which will only show up in 3-4 years which only makes it worse because it will probably show up when Apple Care is running out for most people.
yeah, it's expensive, but why are you so mad about it?
I'm a Adobe user, and holy, After Effects uses 8 GB of RAM just to reproduce a half quality preview of a text, and eats my SSD with 30 GB of cache. Very bad developed app, very bad usage of resources, very bad.
It's obviously a cost cutting measure. They don't have to compete in every metric because they think M series is so much better than the competition that other things don't matter very much. And they're right (although it does seem like AMD might have some parts out soon that do actually compete), M series really is way, way better than the competition, so there isn't really a need for Apple to be competitive on all metrics at all price points. You aren't paying +$200 for more SSD, you're paying to have that on a machine with an M series processor. I wouldn't have said any of this while Apple was still on Intel because I don't think their hardware advantage justified their pricing. Call the past few years a return to form. 

As far as failure goes, when I first switched to an SSD back in like 2008/2009, people were saying "enjoy your read only drive a year from now". Jokes on them, though, none of my SSDs have failed and the only one that I actually expect to fail is the cache SSD on my server that I mentioned. Although that might not even fail now because my transcoding is done in RAM now rather than on disk. 

And for the few people who actually will experience failure, that's going to be a very small number of people and it's not actually the best idea to over engineer a product so that it meets every use case.
No ones mad bruh. Just calling you out for trying to justify Apples shitty pricing tactics.

Build so hot, the cables are on fire.
May I borrow your cpu, ram, and motherboard for a few years? I promise to return then when I'm finished! 

Also, looks good!
Where is the PSU
24 carat ?
If you aren't playing Deus Ex Human Revolution with this rig, you're doing something wrong!
That’s hot! Nice clean build.
How is the case? How is the noise level? Especially compared to the Y70?
It's ok, I don't think you have enough fans.
XFX Speedsters get my upvote by default
beautiful!!!
🔥🔥🔥
nice! love this oil led color, yummy
That strimmer doing some heavy lifting on the RGB setup. Build looks clean.
Very unique.
i have a very similar build with a 4070 ti super!
Piss fans
I can’t stand the fish tank builds usually but the first pic is kinda fire I have to admit!
Is your motherboard an ATX Size ? Because I have ready assembly and was looking to us same Case ( two 140fan back and three 120fan Bottom ) ? .. this case is the best from aesthetic and functional perspective .. well done dude and enjoooy ( I have nitro plus RX7900xtx with B650E Motherboard
[removed]
Very nice build !! 
May I ask you your cpu temps when gaming ? I have a similar seteup but meg 360, and wonder how does the ryujin perfom !
How do you like the brace that came with the xfx? I opted not to use mine... but I've been thinking about it ever since I put my pc together.
Lian li strimmer and fans 🤤
I think you need more fans
is it just me, or is the GPU still sagging with the anti-sag?
is he hitting 54 degrees idle?
Looks good.
Shewww, that’s pretty!! Looks great!
A budget build
Not enough rgb cooling
Looks absolutely sick
I was about to ask how you got an xfx 7900 with 2x8 pins. But it's not an 7900 xtx my mind automatically read xtx for some reason 😂
Really clean and nice build!

That Ryujin looks good in there.
The yellow is sick
Like the look of that
looks good. whats the RGB color code in the first picture?
Nice form factor. Love the golden light
I don't know much about amd. Is it better performance per € than nvidia?
Those XFX mercs are gorgeous just wish you could turn off the logo led
I prefer the yellow light theme than the rainbow one. The system looks great!

Anyway, I see the GPU still sags a bit with the GPU support bracket, maybe just buy a cheap GPU support that you can put under the card (between the bottom fans).
Kudos for not building a white RGB tower. Nice to see not everyone is lacking originality

edit: just saw the second picture 😐
love all 011's i have one in the medium tower. I really wanted 3 fans on the side haha
Very very nice and a dual chamber case I am very jealous
I’m torn between the RYUJIN and the EK nucleus for my next “SFF” build. (It’s not really small.. more just itx)
What are the cables ?
Can I have it?
Sexual👌
Solaris build
oh shi that color is amazing
Is that 9 exhaust fans?
The first pic is Godlike.
That yellow light hits different , congrats on the sick build my guy
Mannnnn I have this build almost to a t, fans and all in my Newegg cart only difference is I chose a different aio, I also have another build in my cart with a 2500d case and a 4070 ti super. After seeing this I’m sold on it. How’s your fps in 1440 with the 7900 xt?
Hey very nice build. 

I am also in the process of makin my first build. And I am really interested in your ARGB PSU extensions. Where can I find the same as yours ?
😲
Did you adjust settings for your xt in order to get driver timeout?
[deleted]
Yo how is the edge and hotspot temps of your GPU under 100% load?
Idk but it looks godly
How loud is your gpu?
 I got same video card and it's been really good for me.
Is it capable of running WinXP?
Has XFX gotten any better with their warranties? That’s a lot of money to be spending on something they won’t even cover.
I really like the color of the RGB in the first pic. Do you know what the html/hex code is?
ALL the big tubers are saying 32GB isn't enough memory any more, that's why I just bought 96GB of Corsair DDR5 6400.
Watch out for sagging cause you got a big black gpu
There's some computer in your fans, sir.
Think u need more fans
Nice

Aren't all those fans bad for such a small case?
Is RGB still a thing?
I finally got a build with some cool RGB fans, and now even the cables are RGB. i will never be cool or hip i guess.
This case has space for the PSU in a compartment that is basically behind/behind and below the motherboard. You can see that the mobo kind of juts out compared to the side-fans. It's one of the reasons this design got so popular.
I was just wondering the same thing.
I never asked for this comment. 
No significant noise, only the fans i hear very slightly
The cool kids table
How do u mean?
Hahahahaha
Yes, Full ATX, I did have problems with screwing in the Top 3 fans cause of the VRMs so i had to squeeze a little, hope this will not cause problems in the future. Thanks! I recently swapped from a i5 10600K with a Rog 2060 Super since that build was 4 years old. The computer runs very smooth, no hickups yet. Temps are good CPU idle 45 gaming 65 gpu idle 40 gaming 50 ( all Celcius). Enjoying it untill now.
They are very big these days it seems, there is a bracket so the GPU wont sag but i hope it holds out.
That brace is insane. It's inside my fan casing
I find it works well for me.
Well you can never have too many.
Yes but due to the backplate of the o11 mini not being rouge enouhg. The pressure makes the case bend.
45 idle 55 gaming
FF6900
well i dont ever use RT so i went for AMD this time its better value for rasterization imo
True
The second one was the first boot. Standard its rainbow.
Yh they are gorgious, I  Come from a corsair crystal 680x rgb so i wanted a smaller one.

I had the ryujin from my old build. 7800x3d is a Hot chip tough.
Lian li Strimer
5 intake (3 lower and 2 for CPU) 4 exhaust (1 rear + 3 upper)
Rhe intake are reverse blade fans for aesthetics
I play obviously without RT. On max setting i have 135 in forbidden west. I also fired up god of war and i have 120 fps but that game is locked at 120. I havent test it in orher games yet.
Most pc part shops have the Lian Li Strimer cable extensions.  I reused the from my old PC.
Did not change nothing yet. Still need to update bios and enable expo to get ram on 6000MHz. Now its running 4800
All components 2700
No idea, only thing i did was gaming. Temp was 50 degrees celcius
No noise, its not getting hot atm.  Only played forbidden west, temp 50 celcius. Cpu 55-60
Well nvidea brands give 2 year, xfx gives 3 year  so 50 procent better warranty
I dont know ny heart, not at home now, its somewhere in the comments
Why isnt it enough for gaming
How do you even come up with that logic?
Personal flavor i guess, you start to a lot of zero rgb builds.
lol what Rgb is getting more and more popular every since Lian li started making fans
That makes sense.  What about the two back fans, aren't they situated between the GPU and that back compartment?   I've seen this tower design a lot recently, and wanted to know what it's called.
does my 6700xt still get a seat?
The color of the fans in the first pic
It looks like it's sagging a bit right now.  The part that is near the screws you should loosen the screws, move it down a little bit and retighten so that it pushes the far end of your GPU up and supports it better.

I have your GPU's big bro (The coolers are identical) and the bracket works pretty well. You just have to finagle it a bit.
Still some sagging due to the cases backplate is not rigid enough
Yeah that's pretty much why I didn't use it. Visually didn't look like it would work with my 4000D case. The GPU alone was a squeeze.


Anyways, God bless! Pray you all have a wonderful Easter.
thanks
Did you build yourself
He probably thinks that the air pressure is hurting the PC because it’s smaller
Nisi me kupila ovim odgovorom))
yes, lian li fans are good, their naitive software is terrible and limits the RGB "flow" the fans rather blink then bleed the colours in transitions, I had to buy another controller the RAZER CHROMA ARGB controller, then i needed adapter cables to be able to plug all the lian li fans into the Chroma, then i needed a internal usb2 hub since i have several controllers, the original lian li controller controlls the fan speed still, finishing off with Signal RGB software to run the show and now finally the Lian Lis reach their potential with beautiful color combos bleeding into each other, the difference has to be seen, its such a difference.  A long post, but had to get it right that Lian Li themselfs are not the reason RGB is popular again. its softwares like Signal RGB that allows you to controll, pc, mouse, keyboard and all other lighting addons you can think of, in cohesion with each other. I have the same colours schemes on my periphials as the PC :)

Wtf is wrong with lookup ??
So this is not the first time I encountered this behaviour from lookup, sometimes it misidentify words, is it a bug or something ?
It adapts to your browser history
Buying a mac rn
"its not a bug, its a feature"

-Sun Tzu, 1974
Siri, yer drunk, go home.

Side note, that technically IS a definition of being versatile... just... inappropriate context.
It’s a PRS thing
"I share a computer with my girlfriend and she would look up anything. "I'm going to look up apples today." She just hits 'A.' It's "Asian ass porn" instantly. Google is, like, "I'll take it from here. I know exactly what you're looking up... Well, every time you hit 'A,' it's 'Asian ass porn.'" Google! All I ask is that you let her type three letters before you jump to such a bold conclusion." - Daniel Tosh
Say Gex
your mac is horny imo
I seriously doubt this is a serious post. When I tried to replicate the result I was unable to. Tried on multiple Macs including family and a friends. All came back with the following result.

ZestBookPro
r/tecnicallythetruth
It hasn’t actually misidentified anything — versatile/vers is indeed a gay sex role and it’s listed on that Wikipedia page.

Siri just isn’t context aware.
Windows could never
I feel like I learned something. Perhaps the “University of Rock” really is an educational institution.
This is so funny
Lookup is horny 😛
Sigh *unzips*
LMAO just made my morning, thank you
i see no error here
Look at the three tabs under the definition. You have it under “Siri knowledge.” Switch it to “dictionary.”
Imagine watching a ton of gay porn but being so closeted about it you make this post to solidify the lie you’ve been telling yourself. Only to find out the reason you got this is the sheer amount of gay porn you’ve been watching and now you’re desperately defending your sexuality to people on the internet.
It’s not inappropriate cuz they’re drawings  UvU
It's a feature xD
Siri confused university of rock with university of something beginning with C that rhymes with it?
this is the fucking funnieat thing ive seen today
Anyone got a link for this page? I cant find it bc i want to recreate this😂
This is fucking hilarious. I actually lold
As a vers this is accurate.
That is more graphic than I thought it would be!
Damn why can’t my Mac be that fun 😔
Tim Cook approved it.
Can confirm. It’s the same for me. That’s wild
You’re holding it wrong
HAHAHAHAHA
No, no... let her cook 🧑‍🍳
Accurate drawing of Craig and Tim aple
Lol the puritan police out in the comments today 😂. It's a drawing similar to something you would find in a year 7 science book, people acting like it's a screenshot of Malik Delgaty railing some twink. 

Wait till these people learn that the word sex in is the dictionary 😱
Versatility.

(just posting that word so I can see if this really happens or if Op is lying)

Edit: Yep, op is lying
It's not wrong.
Well it’s not wrong
Hahahahaha
Working as intended
What’s wrong with it? You’re either a top bottom or vers!
Look at the tab Siri Knowledge. This is all localized but if you wanna reset that, go to System Settings Siri and Spotlight. Click on Spotlight Privacy bottom right. Drag your Macintosh Hard Drive to this area. Close System Settings. (If you need to see your Hard Drive click on the desktop to reveal the Finder menu, go to Finder Settings. Click General tab, and select Hard Disks). Go back to System Settings and remove the hard drive from the privacy area. It will now rebuild that search index and try again before you hit another porn site. It should be fixed.
Yeah I’ve turned off all personal and internet recommendations in Spotlight. When it started showing me fucking blockbuster movies when I command+spaces I nope’d out
I get the same as OP on my iPhone. The same browser I use for porn fairly regularly, albeit straight porn.

It’s Siri knowledge so it changes to your own usage. It’s alright dude, some people are gay 🤷🏻‍♂️
500+ missed calls from Tim. Check yo phone bro.
FIRST THAT U2 ALBUM COVER, AND NOW THIS??? ^^^jkjk
hook up you mean?
It’s a feature, not a bug.
conclusion: your mac wanted to get freaky
that escalated quickly
They made Siri kinky to try to increase engagement
OP in denial haha
Easter Egg?
What the fuck
Ha gaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Absolutely nothing
Telling on yourself
its apple, you should now by now that they use deceptive methods to further their ideology
OMG! It's working on my MacBook Pro, macOS 14.3. Sorry to say this, but do I have a choice to avoid seeing this kind of result? Please!
Is that a PRS? 
I can recommend them so much mate. Getting one was a decision I cherish every day
Bruh 😅, were u watching gay stuff before 😏 browser history or cookies even on incognito mode account still saves info for that stuff 🤭
Or else someone else on ur device was doing nasty stuff before 🙄

Buying a Mac for the gay sex must be the most based thing ever
RIP Sun Tzu. Gone too soon
When I used lookup on that quote, it showed me Sun Tzu’s Wikipedia page, so it must be true. Lookup working perfectly as usual.

it's a gaytar I guess
Only d*ntists can afford say gex
Suckin on that toanwood

nope, it's siri 🤣
Did you try surfing gay porn for a few hours first? 😂
It’s less NSFW but still the incorrect definition in the context
works on some sites ig 🤔
Eat that Kevin Bacon
Thought this was just me 😂🍆
That’s probably true, but the question is why does it only lookup that Wikipedia page for him. If I go to that site and do it I get the merriam webster dictionary definition instead. I think the implication is that OP has a much more exciting life than most of us. 

https://i.imgur.com/hjSE77Q.png
Also Vers is a river of Hesse, Germany. It is a right tributary of the river Salzböde, which it joins near Lohra.
I mean, yeah, but you’d think they’d filter out NSFW stuff by default.
Is Siri *anything* aware?
It literally misidentified versatility as vers. WTF are you talking about?
Or maybe... is
Windows would link to one of the 1000 premium admin modules of same name.
welcome 😆
i was searching for siri suggestions, got the unexpected 🥲
nigga please, my all tabs are private by default, and I don't watch porn on Safari, and if I do I use Firefox(Duckduckgo & VPN), so your point doesn't make any sense 🤦‍♂️
haha, lmao 🤣
you know your gay⭐️
tf, i ain't lying, search from an incognito tab and the exact website, duh 🤦‍♂️
It made me laugh 😆
to avoid others from looking up some words in public places !
it's hard to find solutions on reddit ig, I'll tell you if I get any solutions somewhere 💁‍♂️
i use firefox for that purpose buddy, and only straight porn, duh 🤦‍♂️
BUT I WAS INCOGNITOOOOOOO
I just tried this feature on the same web page as OP. 

The message says that it “now shows personalized suggestions.”

https://i.ibb.co/8XVQWLR/Untitled1-0-5x.png

And my “personalized suggestion” was a Van Morrison album:

https://i.ibb.co/52F9sfy/Untitled2-0-5x.png

So, it does seem to vary based on … something.
I just tried it on iPhone and it did say Lookup was at least partially based on context from your user history. My top result for “versatility” from OPs webpage was a dictionary definition from New Oxford American Dictionary. The other results were more dictionary definitions, an album from Van Morrison and a song on Apple Music.
I mean, the result does make perfect sense. “Versatile” is a very common part of gay lingo.
OP

….

Should we tell him?
if you watch gay porn then obviously that's what's happening here dude. lol
If you are in incognito mode the websites don't know what user is accessing it, but the browser still do.
r/guitarcirclejerk is leaking I see
Damn. That’s where my experiment went wrong. 😂😂😂
There’s a separate tab for dictionary definitions.
Different on iPhone and Mac. 

If you select it on a Mac you also get the dictionary definition first from lookup, but if you then click "Siri knowledge" (which is not an option on iPhone) it gives you this.

The reason is that there are only two main pages that come up as associated with the word "versatile" on wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versatile 

One for a botany term, and the other for the sex role. It probably has a strong preference for wikipedia in general, and decided to use what I assume is just the more popular of these two pages.
dang, I'm using incognito mode bruh 😆
Why? Not very useful if you’re looking up a word with a sexual meaning.
If you look at the page, the subheading is *versatile*. Lookup rarely searches for the exact phrase and instead finds the best available conjugation.
Sure bud everyone else here trying the same thing on the same site with differing results but yours is somehow “different”. It’s gotta be a glitch for sure.
Just did that, same thing, not showing what you're posting lol

[https://imgur.com/a/e6EQzPe](https://imgur.com/a/e6EQzPe)
Ah! Ok 😅
Can confirm I also got the van morrison album, along with the dictionary.com definition of the word.

No judgement OP but you do you.
lol.. OP just came out on reddit
This shit is why Spotlight on my mac only searches:

1. The Builtin Dictionary
2. My Applications folder

"Spotlight found 10 results for 'Frost/Nixon slashfic' in /Users/postmodest/Desktop/Trash/deleted_viruses/temp/totally_not_porn/hidden/do-not-look/abcdefg/ok-actually-porn/00099999/faves"
No, it doesn’t make sense. Not even a little bit. It should be retrieving the top one or two results from something like dictionary.com. There should be no risk of kids looking up words and seeing sexual positions, gay, straight, or otherwise.
OP uses incognito mode, on duck duck go…. While using a VPN homie is most definitely watching dudes crushing other dudes booties
naah bro, that's siri's issue, and fyi i don't keep browser history, and for porn, i use firefox(with duckduckgo & vpn), so no chances of that 💁‍♂️
you said the opposite, it's the browser that doesn't remember anything, website and isp know everything unless you use a VPN

This explanation makes the most sense assuming OP is being truthful about being in incognito mode and whatnot
[deleted]
why do you even trust google? incognito means shit. you got exposed bro
Because you shouldn’t assume the user is of appropriate age. Also, “vers” is one particular usage of the word versatile… why not start by defining the actual word and link other uses?
Even if it is sexual, showing a hardcore NSFW image, even as an illustration, isn’t really appropriate. I understand how it works on the backend (i.e., it doesn’t “know” what it’s showing), and OP’s example is a pretty extreme example, but I don’t think it’s acceptable to show this sort of image when the word is literally “versatility,” which has _zero_ sexual connotation in 99.9% of scenarios.
What’s more likely:

I want to look up a word without the NSFW meaning

I want to look up a word with the NSFW meaning

?

Also, what if you’re using your work Mac and this pops up as your boss is looking over your shoulder?
Get some psychiatric help.
ya, i think so, my siri is so fucked up 😭
Or be done. Or both, as the case may be.
that's the default result ig, as I'm using incognito mode and I always turn off any personalisation
Underrated 😂
😂😂😂
As others have clarified it’s based on user history. I do not get this for versatile. And it is a Wikipedia article after all.

OP is most definitely watching a lot of gay porn.
Oh no! Not the children!
do you watch gay porn though?
yeah, i was expecting some movie title, but got the unexpected
I know incognito is shit, but i don't like to keep history ig, and I use duckduckgo with vpn generally, but that's on firefox, but safari is optimised for Macs yk
Google is mid.
It’s a Wikipedia page, not porn. And the word is defined in the dictionary tab already.
It also gives suggestions based off search history
Suggestions are based off search history as well
Of course bro ;)
OP I think it’s too late


Just tell us the truth
Who else has access to your computer?
I also got van morrison as someone who doesn't use safari. So it's definitely tied to browser history. *Something* tricked siri into thinking you want gay sex stuff, it doesn't necessarily mean you looked up gay porn though. even if you did, oh well tbh. 

it's definitely a bug, i mean versatility definitely shouldn't come up with that, but also something definitely triggered it.
If you use incognito to watch some porn and then go search something that session knows about your search history and would only know about what you just looked at. It’s only cleared after you close out or open a new tab.
Incognito is a lie dude... it just not save chronology
Incognito mode has nothing to do with it as look up is system wide.
I think it’s relating more to the ‘other’ websites you visit in incognito bro.
Which is still broken behavior, I would say. Explainable maybe, but I think if you showed this to Apple, they wouldn’t say it’s working as designed. 

Highlighting a common adjective should probably default to a dictionary definition, not an urban dictionary style slang, even if the slang is also valid and correlated in your usage profile.
ahhhhhhh knew this was gonna pop up at one point
nope, i watch lesbo though :)
oh, i thought you were using chrome
Arc Browser >> 

(seriously, try it out)
I didn’t say it was porn. You understand that this Wikipedia page is inappropriate for young children, right?
Right here officer
OP lookin’ hella sus right now.

Versatility is in the gay sex snippet. So, there is that. This is one of the weirdest things on Reddit I’ve seen in a week. 😂
fyi, i watch porn on firefox(duckduckgo + vpn)
If you don’t want gay porn on your computer stop watching gay porn.
I really wanna know who is upset at this comment but not all the ones accusing OP of being gay. 

Reddit is wild and lame
That's gay
Based
Aww man
So it’s you then…
Bro admitted to a lot of things in this thread but is still getting downvoted for truth
true, i was just making them aware, if these kinds of things get shown when you're presenting something publicly, that will be really embarrassing 💀, but what's the point, it's reddit anyway 🤦‍♂️
Using accusing and gay in the same sentence seems very 1950s. It’s no longer a crime in the developed world.
Are we seeing the same thing? Someone is asking OP if they watch gay porn, which is pretty personal. They respond no,  but they watch lesbians. They were downvoted. Other person was pretty upvoted at that time. 

The hell??? OP up in here proclaiming he’s not gay to downvotes but the moment they likely truthfully state they watch lesbian porn the party stopped. 

This whole thread is awful and was a horrible slog of tasteless jokes. A.I can get things wrong. I had Google wish my kid a happy birthday. It played a song called “happy birthday asshole”. Lord knows we were teaching it to sing that.
Switched to AMD after 9 years and theres one thing that I noticed right away
The shader compilation stutters are very very noticeable on an AMD card vs an Nvidia card. When I originally got my 6900XT I thought something was seriously wrong, I play lots of Warframe and online MMO's, Warframe in particular had so much stutter that I was going mad thinking my PC was broken but after I ran the same mission twice the game was then smooth as butter but if anything, even the slightest UI element loaded in it causes a frametime spike that goes over 150ms every time. Its mind boggling to me that this isnt an issue on Nvidia but only on AMD. Mind you I came from a 3060ti and I never once saw these compilation stutters in any game, not even Warframe after the first launch or playthrough, my quesiton is what is going on with AMD cards that makes the shader compilation process freeze up the game in such a dramatic manner, I googled this and its very common. 

This isnt a tech support thread so plz dont delete admins, I am just pointing out that this is something that should not be a thing in 2023. I am starting to regret my decision to go red team and if feel like I'm sucking on copium if I ignored this very blatant issue. Shadow of the tomb raider also stutters horrendously when you start it up and like usual loading from a previous save and it plays butter smooth after things cache.

You need to disable dxnavi. Look up how. The stuttering is a big issue on AMD if you aren't using DX12 or Vulcan.
I only get this for a real short time after a fresh GPU driver install. It doesn't happen every game and not again, just a few stutters in the first game I play after the fresh install.
Overwatch runs with horrible frame pacing for about 5 minutes until it smooths out, and this happens on every single boot of the game.

DDU wiping my drivers and slotting in my RTX 3070, I don't have this problem on every single boot.

I am curious if you can disable DXNavi on the 7000 series cards.
So is DXNavi that everyone is now talking about for RDNA based cards the solution AMD came up with to make DX11 games and older perform better since NVIDIA famously was well optimized for DX11 where as AMD didn't perform as well with equivalent hardware specs?

&#x200B;

Because to me this is what seems to be happening. AMD came out with Mantle API so that game devs / engine makers could do more things low-level and really fine tune compared to DX11 & OpenGL which relied more on the hardware vendors to optimize per game for their hardware on a case by case bases. Mantle showed the success not only for AMD but also Nvidia, and that then encouraged the development of Vulkan and DX12 which also are low level API's with the former I think taking a lot of the code from Mantle. Fast forward and Vulkan and DX12 are well established API's. AMD now decides to optimize their DX11 and older DX api's by turning those calls into DX12 calls and doing shader compilations (something DX12 & Vulkan do - sacrifice low performance at the start while optimizing hardware at first runtime for ideal optimization after).

&#x200B;

So what we may be seeing is games that weren't built with DX12 but instead older API's now having shader compilation happen and happening without having the code in place to compile at game loadup menu, etc... So your 1 or few matches have stutter until everything is compiled. Just my hunch.
As a long time AMD user, this is something I've noticed starting from the RX 6000 series. From some research apparently it only affects DX11 or older games and it's caused by DXNavi from driver versions newer than 22.5.1.

If this is a recurring issue for you, you might want to check out Amernime drivers.
I noticed the same thing after I switched from a 3070 to a 6800XT a couple years ago. There are much more noticeable stutters, with the same CPU and gen 4 drive. I used DDU to swap drivers

It was worse on certain games than others so it might not be entirely just an AMD thing but it is weird that the stuttering is more apparent with AMD cards

No idea why Nvidia cards handled it a lot better

Also I tried the 3070 with a stock Ryzen 2600 for a little while, which was much *much* weaker than my oc'ed 12600kf, and with slower 3200mhz 16gb ram, daisy chained PCIe power for the double 8 pin on the card, and running in Gen3 because B450 and Zen+ didn't support Gen4. So it was at a disadvantage at the start in every single way, and it still didn't stutter like my 6800xt does when compiling.
Instead of just posting OP, you should leverage the AMD reps on Reddit. /u/amd_vik is a great dude and can relay useful logs/scenarios to the display team.
Yeah. Known problem.
I switched about a week ago from a 3070 to a 7800 xt and I’ve noticed this too. I use a 5800x3d.
Long time AMD user here (5+ years).

I always thought this was just a thing with my PC. Like how I'll load in a game, and the frame rate will be at 1fps, then slowly over the course of seconds jump up to 60 or whatever after making incremental increases. Is that the shader issue? DxNavi?
I feel you with Warframe. Been playing it since beta and never had any issues with any graphics card. But my 7900 xtx has so many stutters. Gets better after playing a bit but still frustrating. Don't have many other games with issues tho
I haven't had these issues at all. Overwatch is the only silly game where I have to wait for the storage to load assets. That's because it's installed to an HDD not an SSD.
Shader compilation should not take more than 5-15 minutes while gaming. Most games do it before you load in. Maybe contact the devs if it stutters after more than 15 mins. Because that is just weird.

 You can also try doing it via Steam.

Open Steam-> Settings -> Downloads. Shader Pre-caching, tick both boxes, Enable Pre-caching and Allow in background. If background processing gets your GPU fans or CPU fans running and it annoys you, untick it. On Linux, this usually happens on the CPU so it is kinda annoying. It can take a while too, especially on Nvidia. For Forza Horizon 5, with RTX 2080, it took 2 hours! And the game crashed as soon as I loaded in. With 6800 XT, it took 20 secs and game just works.

So my experience is the exact opposite. Nvidia is absolute dogshit, in Linux. Which is all I use these days.
I always had this issue too, every time after I installed new GPU drivers, some games stutter while they compile the new shaders. This usually doesn't take more than a minute, but the first time that happened to me I was desperate lol. Now I know so after I update my shaders I simply boot a game and wait for it to install them without doing anything.
Just swapped to a 7800 xt from my 1060 6gb. Janky as hell, fresh windows install, bios updated, drivers dowloaded. It micro stutters crashes overall a headache. And the base setting for my and adrenaline overclock my card to an unstable degree. So every time it crashes or something I have to manually Change the max clock to what the manufacturer recommends (2550 instead of like 2670hz)
Its normal that the game stutters sometimes when the shader cache is loading. 

If you can run Vulkan try to run games in Vulkan. AMD always update there Vulkan API and it runs the best on AMD GPU's .
Interesting, I barely noticed the stutter with my 6800XT. Maybe you just need a lot of CPU power as well to make it less obvious.
You know what...now that I've read this and some comments. When I used to play Modern Warfare 2, and after the 48th shader setup and update requires restart. It would always be stuttery until I changed the video settings each game. (go from max to high, then go high to max) every single time. 
And after each update requires restart, the first game would always 100% crash on load. After that it was fine I told the next update requires restart. 

I always assumed it was just call of duty being a shitty poorly optimized game
Ive had a 6700 XT for over a year at this point and never noticed any issues UNLESS it was right after a gpu driver install. I have \~30 hours in warframe the past 2 weeks and only had stuttering after i installed the new drivers (23.12.1) when the finals came out.
I load into warzone and on the top it literally says "loading shaders.“ I honestly have no idea how long it takes but by the time I grab a drink and take a piss I'm ready to go.
My two cents. I switched from nvidia to amd on both my systems. Replaced a 3070 with a 7900xtx and a 3060ti with a 7900xt. I have ZERO issues and have ZERO complaints and only praise for team red. Never thought I’d be so biased. But my results speak for themselves.
I have not seen this on neither my R VII, nor do I remember "suffering" on the RX480 (outside of making it push a resolution it shouldn't lol)

Not sure googling something specific and it giving you results.... is an indication of a greater overarching issue either lol.
My 7900xtx hasn't stuttered a single time. Also based on my old laptop (2070 Maxq) which stuttered all the time. I learned that was likely a CPU issue. As when I stuck my friends 2070, and also tried an ark a750 into my current rig before I bought the 7900xtx I experienced no stutter. Here's my testing for Elden ring, a game which is notorious for shader stutter.

Ryzen 7700 with 32gb ddr5 6000mhz sff pc Elden ring:
7900xtx = no stutter
Rtx2070 = no stutter
Arc a750 = no stutter

Intel i7 9750h 16gb ddr4 laptop Elden ring:
2070 Maxq = mega stutter (even on lowest settings)

Steam deck Elden ring:
AMD chip = no stutter (40fps locked)
So according to [this](https://nimez-dxswitch.pages.dev/NzDXSwitch), DX Navi. whatever that means.

I reached the registry destination but I am unable to understand with what do I need to replace those.

Any help? I have a RX 7800 XT.
Have exactly the same issue as OP, playing Warframe. Change whatever settings, stuttering persists, grinds my gears
For what it’s worth, the shader compiler stutters on every nvidia I’ve ever had are also very aggressive.
I have been using Redeon card only. I also have the same observation as you. I have seen many people complaining about the shader compilation on every driver update. 

While waiting a few minutes for them to get created in the beginning of the game, it's not that big of deal for me. But in games that does it on the fly, it can create alot of stuttering. I have the same experience with Warframe as you. I'm not playing it as offset as before which makes it much more noticeable than before.

If Nvidia doesn't have that issue, AMD need to look into it and fix it in a way we don't need to compile them with each driver update.
Same thing happened to me when I upgraded to Rx 6600, Dead By Daylight and Battlefield games stuttered sooo much.
Starting a game stuttering happens for 5min after driver update then it's gone until next driver update. Not a big deal.
Like I'm not actually shilling or anything but besides the driver timeout in CS2 I've had 0 issues with my 7900XTX compared to my 30 series card. No stuttering.
for some reason this problem totally goes away on linux.
I have a 6800xt I have no such issues
I don't get it all my games compile the shaders before the game starts. I don't even remember the last time I've seen a game compiling shaders during actual gameplay.
Amd need to be tinkered with to work properly, Nvidia just work, thats my experience after 25years+ going back and forth.

But AMD is often cheaper.
Does sam/rebar still work fine with intel cpu/amd gpu? I have i9 12900k + 7900 xtx and I notice some REALLY bad stutter in fortnite almost unplayable and games like league and the finals run absolutely fine.
I ditched Nvidia and never looked back, tough I went from 900 series to Vega 56 and 6600 XT and in both cases early on there were issues that disapeared over time...
I got 6950 and don't have this problem unless it's a unreal 5 game with known stutter problems. But thatxhas little to do with gpu vendor
In my end on warframe. I get 2 stutters, 1 when I log in and the other randomly when i put mods on the right polarity.
Uhh.. what? I have no idea what you are all talking about. I've never experienced any of those kinds of problems with rdna or rdna2, I play older dx9/dx11 games all the time without any issue.
I have an RX 6800 XT and I've never experienced this. Perhaps it's something particular to your setup?
I mean shader compiling stutter is mostly due to the CPU
Whats even more shoking: all the fanbois preaching how smooth amd cards are.
Shader caching is a thing that both companies experience. I have both and had it on both to which the majority if not 90% of my friends are on Nvidia and have caching stutters as something they report to me on fresh driver installs on a measurable basis.

Shader compilation is done on the CPU, so it can't be the GPU causing it.

Pretty sure AMD drivers have less CPU overhead then nvidia drivers.
I would provide that as feedback in the AMD bug reporting tool in the control panel.
AMD also renders in almost double the shaders, so there is that.
Please tell me you did DDU when you got your new gpu
Thats the neat thing about AMD's drivers there no real fix and there are a lot of real issues. Ranging from the mundane to the spectacular. The Copium addicts will make up all sorts of excuses to boot. 

I am sure this issue will be meet with hundreds of trouble shooting steps that require all manor of insanity. Including things like disabling hw acceleration in basically every application you use ... making sure that the pc is pointed at a 90 degree angle facing the far west window of your house on a 22 degree slope while connected to no more then 2 monitors running HDMI 1.8 cables. 

O and if none of that works remember the drivers age like fine wine.
True. I gave a chance to AMD after many years and I already regret it. Next card Nvidia again for sure
My old PC was a 2600x with a 1070ti. Gave it to my nephew and built a completely new PC, 5600x with a 6800xt. In the beginning, my gph usage would keep fluctuating and the stutters in games was driving me insane! After some time has passed and tweaking I have had any problems.
I have no issues on my 7900XTX. Shader compilation stutter largely depends on the game. Two games that stutter a lot are hogwarts legacy, and Witcher 3. That doesn’t just happen on AMD cards.
I switched from a 6950XT to a 3080Ti thinking it would fix this but seems that the issue still persists. I believe it has something to do with the CPU somehow, I get stutters very often that it’s starting to break my trust in this. I had reinstall windows, all drivers from scratch, latest BIOS update no PBO and PBO on still the same, I had switch my ram 3 times already and all my kits are Samsung B Die DR 3600Mhz CL14 32GB(2x16). The game where I see more stutters is Starfield, even just bringing up the menu brings the FPS from 120 to 20 or less. I have a 360mm Lian Li Galahad cooler and Kryonut Paste but still. Don’t know what else to do. Good to see that I’m not the only one here with issues. I was about to swap my Taichi for a ROG Crosshair or Aorus Master but now I will wait. I have a Ryzen 7 5800X3D.
Might go an intel CPU because ive always ran intel and dont want something like this but the CPU variant

(got a 4070 just need a cpu upgrade in general and was originally thinking AMD)
I get shader compilation stutters terribly on nvidia
I have a 7900XTX on Linux and I do not have this issue at all.
ive switched from 6800xt that required constant tinkering to 4080 and as stupid as it might sound 4080 just works, ive had to adjust some settings once because initially colors looked washed but compared to 6800xt its nothing. i had to undervolt and adjust fan curve just so my reference 6800xt wouldnt overheat, juggling drivers versions depending on the game id play and often having other issues, if my nvidia card keeps being as no maintenance as it is right now then ill gladly pay premium price again in the future to save myself some headache, getting the "newest" tech straight up instead of waiting months for amd to try to "catch up" is pretty nice too


cant complain about my 7800x3d though, its a beast
I didn't even know that there are no stutters during shader compiling on Nvidia. I thought it's a norm 🥲
What's your CPU? Shader compilation stutter is a 100% CPU sided thing that is required whenever they're deleted or more likely a driver is updated. It shouldn't happen every time you load a game either, just in dx12 or vulkan games where the game didn't take care of it ahead of time.

Sounds more like microstutter. Did you use ddu to remove all Nvidia drivers first? Is your power supply up to snuff? Do you have a bunch of USB hard drives plugged in? Daisy chain vs two separate pcie power cables? Older CPU?

Microstutter can come from a lot of places, but I feel like given you didn't have the issues with a 3060ti I'm leaning power issues with a 6900xt in the same system, or maybe you're just CPU bound? That in itself can lead to a lot of stutters.
> Warframe in particular had so much stutter that I was going mad thinking my PC was broken but after I ran the same mission twice the game was then smooth as butter but if anything, even the slightest UI element loaded in it causes a frametime spike that goes over 150ms every time

this was the biggest change I've noticed since I've moved from AMD to Nvidia... and it was incredible lol
Funny enough i also switched to amd after 9 years and im having regrets with all the damn stuttering, my return window is until jan 31st since i bought my 7900xtx on amazon so i'll probably pick up the 4080 super instead
What CPU do you have? A lot of latency issues can be caused by a CPU that can't keep up.
Shader compilation stutter is a CPU thing and often can't be avoided with any level of hardware. The stutter you're experiencing might be something else.

If you switched from an Nvidia GPU to an AMD GPU in the same PC, make absolutely sure you do display driver uninstaller before putting the new card in.
Have you enabled shader caching for all games in the advanced settings of the Radeon software control panel?  When I last had AMD it was set to 'AMD optimised' by default which means it only applied to a select group of games.
Yyyyep..... Its really bad, especially for Flagship GPUs that cost so much. 

If it's the "budget option" then I'd say that's acceptable. But for a flagship GPU with high end performance it's absolutely not. 

Its the big tradeoffs going with an AMD GPU and because of that instead people away that are standard users because it's not a good experience.
Yeah, I went from an RTX 2080 to 6800XT. Games stuttered like there was no tomorrow (along with driver timeouts, yay). Eventually it evened out, but the initial experience was horrible and the card wasn't returned only because of the pandemic and this was the only decent GPU in stock that time, 2080 was already sold too. Now I'm playing the waiting game until 4080 Supers get released. 

This issue has never happened with my previous GeForce cards, not even after a clean Windows installation. 

One of the reasons why "AMD Jank" is a thing. You save some money by not buying nVidia, but all this "small" stuff just keeps on happening with a Radeon. End result: not worth it.
I noticed stutters after the latest Warframe mainline update, it also happens in certain scenarios like a tonne of enemies and casting a skill (that I've casted before), which wouldn't be shader compilation. Warframe updates quite often, I'm sure they'll fix it.
EDIT: Forgot to mention I was playing in DX12 (which is still experimental), if you are also using DX12 it might be worth trying DX11 though I haven't yet.
Me over here gaming with a 6800 on a 4k display not having any of the problems being talked about here. *knocks on wood*.

Warframe is a main game I play too, never had any stutters. Worst case of stutters would be from Yuzu when playing a game for the first time but that's quickly fixed after playing for a few min.
lol there is stuttering on every card in some notoriously bad games (like jedi survivor), games just have shit optimization these days
Dude, I play Warframe on rex 2080s and R5 5700x. The game is old and badly programmed. It stutters, thats its main feature
I don't understand why AMD gets so much hate. It's a different architecture from Nvidia so it works a little differently, that's all. If you're a longtime Nvidia user it's just because you're not accustomed to how AMD GPUs work. But usually there's a fix for what ails you, you just have to ask around. Nvidia GPUs have their own issues and if you were a longtime AMD user moving to Nvidia you'd probably find some failures as well.
yeah, that is a thing with some games. i personally experienced shader caching issue in ow/ow2. every time i launched the game, it would take about 2-3 minutes to cache everything up (you could see the caching process in overlay, the frametime would be high, just like cpu usage) but after that everything becomes silky smooth
Report it to AMD as a bug report

Tell AMD how to replicate the stuttering this will allow them a chance to fix it, and wait 5-6 drivers updates later which probably the timeframe AMD will fix it.
wait how every 2 amd drivers will fuck up something XD
I have the exact same issue on Overwatch. First game has stutters for like the first 2 minutes and then is fine.
Issues and amd gpus name a more iconic duo
Wow Ive been going through this post and see a lot of complaints abt amd and wf (myself included). Honestly I feel warframe has something to do with this. Ever since duviri came out somethings been whack in the code istg
Not sure what you're on about.... it's hit and miss on the extensiveness of it, but shader compiling isn't new, and it should be noted that many games pre-compile for nvidia anyways... might be some lingering ones.

Regardless, once the compiling is done, it's smooth as butter anyways.

Lets take a pretty popular game like fortnite, DX11 on amd... bad... but good on nvidia.... compiling really isn't a thing in dx11... amd's dx12 requires compiling.... performance however is, may be a shock to people, FASTER and higher minimums on DX12 in fortnite on AMD hardware even going back as far as the last support gpus.

This isn't an instrinsic thing for amd... it's a matter of often choice of how the developer wants to handle thing api side.
I play warframe quite a lot on a RDNA2 card and have never seen any compilation stutter, let alone freezing. Are you using the DX12 renderer?
First time eh? 

Switched from a 1070 TI to a 6700 XT, the one thing I learnt about the whole experience was that switching to team red makes you realize the grass isn’t always greener.
RDNA is a dumpster fire. Avoid.
Yep. As much as some posters here like to cope, this is why people choose Nvidia over AMD. Nvidia ships drivers that are reliable and work (and if they don't the fix comes fast). AMD ships beta testing.
to be honest if you want plug and play experience go take a console.

PCs were , are and will never be "plug and play" in the sense you mean it.

There are plenty of PC configurations in the world to fix them all and some problems are more complex to resolve than others.

Because you bought or made something doesn't make it "good" or "playable" .

Sorry but this is what it is and you take it as it is .
This kind of shit is the reason why I'll never go back to AMD GPUs. Love my 5900X though!
You also did quite the upgrade , the cpu is now struggling much more , thus slower shader compile time happens
Switched to amd cpu and gpu after never even considering amd for years. 7700 non x with a 7900gre and I'm never looking back. everything is perfect.
[removed]
I get the same thing in Guild Wars 2 every driver update after upgrading from a Vega 64 to an RX 6800 XT. As people have pointed out it's likely dxnavi trying to squeeze more performance out of old DX11 (and DX9?) games with RDNA based graphics cards.

I just run around the player hub for \~5 minutes until it settles down. And update my driver less frequently.
It is clear most people in the comments have no idea what shader compilation stutter is.

You replaced your GPU so now the game will have to compile the shaders again for your new configuration, so if a game has shader compilation stutter then you are gonna have to to experience that stutter again for the shaders to compile.
Switched to AMD when CS2 game up; 1070 Ti to 6600 XT; better FPS marginally. Way way worse lag stuttering drops and freezing. First 10 minutes of every game where like a DDOS attack
lol a game specific problem being blamed on an entire series of graphics cards, and of course the people saying they don't have issues get buried to the bottom of the thread
DO NOT use any third party conflicting software at the same time, close all apps (including MSI Afterburner), gaming is buttery smooth when no other conflicting software is present.
Always reinstall windows. Takes 20 mins.
You went with a cheaper, lower quality brand and those are the results. AMD gpus have been abysmal since the r9 290
I always do a clean install..never had any issues.
No such issues on Linux.
Nvidia has the best GPUs.
AMD has the best CPUs.
Intel has the best space heaters.
Team red for cpu>
Team green for gpu>
I play warframe with a 6900xt at 4k 144hertz without any issues . Did you ddu when switching cards? I don't see any troubleshooting listed.
Difference between Nvidia and AMD is that Nvidia compiles shaders on background when game is being installed so u dont notice it much except u gonna wait lil longer on installation time :) 
Amd compiles them first time when game is launched and as game is hogging resources your gpu is hogging them too compliling shaders resulting on hangs and stutters. So or so this is done by both companies but just at different times. ;)
I still can't have adrenaline installed without my drivers timing out, it's been since Jan 2023 lol.
Wait until you play destiny 2 on AMD cards, its extremely stuttery
CPUs I understand they are amazing, but at this point gpus, really? You need to be a real amd enthusiast to no to sit on 4090 still or any late gens of rtx
I did suggest to AMD that pre-compiling shaders might be a way to improve user experience on RDNA. Steam Deck downloads pre-compiled shaders to avoid this issue. Something similar can be done on PC.
I've always used AMD and can't wait to switch.

Seems to be, out of all my friends, that I am the one having issues. They run Nvidia
That's why I will never get a AMD GPU again.
Nvidia is so much better.
CPU AMD is the best you could get. Fuck Intel.
use rendering API as advanced there are two options basic or advanced, use advanced
I sometimes get a bit of stuttering on my RTX 4090 after a new driver install, depending on the game. I expect it, so it's not a big deal and it doesn't last long.

It also doesn't happen again for that game, until I update my drivers again.

My RX 6800 is buttery smooth in my secondary PC, so it could be some kind of issue (software/hardware)
The over all quality of the image even on the windows desktop apps and what not look worse on Amd va nvidia to me. I can see the difference. Especially with amd igpu even vs intel.
Shader Compilation is done on the CPU, so unless you changed CPUs as well, GPUs should have little to no bearing on shader compilation stutter. 

However, AMD cards usually have worse frame time consistency than roughly equivalent Nvidia cards. This can often be seen as micro stutter. 

Shader Compilation stutters go away usually after a few hours of playing a game, as shaders are compiled either beforehand, or in a just-in-time manner. Shader compilation stutter can be 100% eliminated by the developer, so if what you are seeing is indeed related to shader compilation, than you should raise this as an issue to the developers instead.

Another thing to consider is that the 6900 XT is much more powerful GPU than the 3060 Ti, meaning it should deliver a much higher base framerate. A single stutter of roughly 150ms will be much more jarring when encountered on a higher base framerate, then when encountered at a lower framerate. You might have had stutters lasting about the same time, but it's much much more jarring now, because performance is generally much higher, so it feels worse.

Micro stutters are most often caused by cache misses. AMD cards usually have a bit more cache than an equivalent Nvidia card, but the Nvidia cards are usually using faster memory. More cache can more than offset  slower VRAM, but even L3 cache is quite small in capacity. If the requested data is not cache, it needs to fetched from memory, and in that case, both latency and bandwidth can be important, but I suspect that in most cases, latency is the more important factor, as the memory controller will be hard pressed to interleave an unforeseen memory operation effectively. 

You mentioned that once you load into a mission the first time, it stuttered, and then when loading into it the second time, it was smooth. Does that happen every time, or was that just a single scenario, perhaps after installing the card?

If the stutter is consistent, you can try disabling DXNavi, as others have suggested. If that still doesn't fix the issue, perhaps you could open a support ticket to AMD and/or the game's developers. Both should ask for at least a DXdiag report.
I have a 3600x cpu is this cpu still up to date
I had issues wth my asrock  6600 challenger  d till swapped to new hdmi 4k cable now sorted ,
I'm having 1 second stutter problem in the 6700xt last 4 months and my only work around so far is to restart adrenalin UI by turning off then back on SAM. After that I can play any game with 0, and I mean 0 stutters.

I've tried about 10 different drivers, I've tried stock, tweaked, xmp not xmp, boost no boost image sharpening no image sharpening, undervolt, lock min clock etc and no, messing with registry, ulps etc etc etc and more etc only solution is to restart adrenalin UI after everytime I turn on windows SO.

To everyone saying they have no problems, and minimizing the fact that so many of us have problems with AMD software side of things, good for you I'm very happy for you. To everyone saying they have those problems with Nvidia, I didn't had anything like this for over 5 cards in 20 years... Either it worked, or I needed to use another driver and that was it.

One thing is for sure, you'll understand more about PCs even if you're an IT technician after the AMD software experience.. but yeah, no solution overall. Some people even find out stuttering being normal.. so yeah, opinions..
Well I think I’ll be sticking with Nvidia then. Lol
Same experience.
Switched from RTX 3090 to 7900XTX few weeks ago and I have the such same stutters too. Especially Warframe.

After clean install Windows several times with switching 3090 and 7900XTX back and forth I think the problem is AMD driver is still relatively behind of NVIDIA experience. Like multi monitor power consumption etc.
I've been on ATI/AMD graphics cards for the past 14 years, mainly because it was cheaper.

I can't wait until I upgrade my now EOL Sapphire Nitro+ RX 580 and finally say goodbye to AMD.

So many issues over so many years, took them +20 years to finally work on OpenGL and still many other issues persist.
Shd mentioned used amd only for 20 plus years and amd cpu wth asrock motherboards since 2002 ...
Interesting. I mainly play Warframe (barring the obligatory break I’m on/maybe coming out of atm, you know) and just made the switch to a 7900 XTX.

Haven't got around to playing for real yet tho as I am still in the "messing around with a new system, tweaking, OC'ing, etc." phase. Have only booted up the game to check some stuff. Did notice the DX12 mode crashed immediately. Didn't think much of it at the time tho.

Will see how it goes today as I plan on going through the new update.
Guys thank you for all the replies, I actually already did the DXnavi swap a week ago and that didnt rly help at all. Not every game is affected and its really not as bad as it sounds. I still regret not knowing this problem before switching from team green. I'm going to buy a TMP module to see if that makes a difference.
Have you uninstalled your old Nvidia display driver's cause if not that might be the Problem,

Use DDU (Display-Driver-uninstaller) to remove them


winget install -e --id Wagnardsoft.DisplayDriverUninstaller

& If that doesn't Fix it, than Reinstall Windows
New GFX card for me automatically means new windows installation. 

DDU is a great tool, but to be 100% certain it’s not a left over driver issue or legacy issue with the windows install I always re-install a fresh version of windows after I change hardware vendor. 

IE intel to amd vice versa - new windows install
AMD to NVIDIA vice  versa - new windows install 
AMD to amd or intel to intel, nvidia to nvidia - same windows install
disable HPET, remove all the GPU stuff you had to install to tweak your NVIDIA card like afterburner and whatnot. Leave SAM enabled. find the best auto-OC option for you, normally undervolt unless you have upgraded cooling.

you're experiencing know issues with known fixes. it's not a problem, you'll have noticed that the amd gpu has amd written in the box where as the nvidia one had nvidia written on the box. this is an indicator they they aren't the same gpu, it should be expected that the required configurations could be different :p

For me this only happened in god of war, but in other games is not noticeable
I never noticed any stutter on my 6800XT since I have it for a year now, this warframe stuttering is more like the game itself if it takes that long. And even if it happens the 1st time you launch it after a driver update, it shouldn't happen anymore, unless you update drivers between every game launch. What motherboard, RAM, PSU and SSD do you have? Did you make sure to install every AMD related drivers and not just the Adrenaline Software? Is SAM enabled?
I found about about frame limiting through rtss this year and with around 10% GPU headroom I have almost no stutters anymore. In game limiters are most of the time inferior to this method and are best set to unlimited while doing it externally.
This being said I have only problems with issues of the engine/game optimization.
Edit: With a 6700xt.
I got stuttering without XMP/DOCP and SAM. With both enabled, these issues seem to disappear.
Sweet a fellow Tenno! Looking forward to cross save this week, can't wait. 

Did the dxnavi disable help your warframe performance by any chance? Curious, switching from Nintendo Switch to my 6800xt PC pretty soon and the smoother sailing the better
Ddu in safemode, reinstall all that shit.
Tested both 4070ti and 7900XT playing Remnant 2 and Borderlands 3, and stuttering was constant on 7900XT that I ended up returning 7900XT and kept 4070ti.

Also, the fact that 7900XT (XFX Merc 310) was using close to 400W trying to achieve what 4070ti (TUF OC) was achieving at 250W or less was good enough of a reason to go with 4070ti. The amount of heat from that 7900XT was quite noticeable as well.
recompiling shaders?
My PC straight crashed when waking up from sleep every time with AMD card. Only solution was to return it and get Nvidia.
6800xt here
Don't really notice this.
But I guess I just play the same games often so it's probably already done compiling
What happens if you try dx12? For me on my 3070 the dx12 branch of Warframe stutters like hell but maybe it'll be better for you.
Could this be why it takes a solid 5-6 minutes for me to even get frames in Overwatch 2? Every time I close the game and re-open it, it has to recache the maps and whatnot and it sometimes takes even longer than that. I have an RX 6600 card. Would disabling dxnavi fix my issues there as well?
I have unused fx8350 4.1ggz boxed not used ,fitted an 8120 at 3.1 but ran every game i played including doom eternal
Been looking to swap to AMD and I might just stick with Nvidia and intel, 5 years since I built the last one and they still have not fixed their issues. It's sad. I much rather buy AMD for price reasons but I want consistency.
Reason # 9,762 why I’ll never by anything other than an nvidia gfx card. Nvidia is just plug and play. It just works. That being said I do have an AMD cpu, that’s a different story.
Have a 7900xtx and 5700xt and Vega 64.  Never had this issue.
I remember when switching from an R9 290X to RTX 2060 I was in the middle of playing Zelda BOTW through CEMU and was surprised how much better the shader compilation stutter felt with the 2060, it was really jarring on the R9 290x.

 I just figured it was due to the 2060 being more powerful but turns out it was mostly due to OpenGL which apparently doesn't run as well on AMD.

But since then CEMU has added Vulkan support which resolves the aggressive stutter issue for AMD users.
So far, the only game noticed the horrendous stutter on it RE4R. I thought my previous RX 7600 wasn't strong enough or something compared to a 3060Ti.

Nope, the game just smoothed out after a few minutes. It's as good as the 3060Ti, just a tad weaker.

CS2 was also rough for the first few weeks, but I think things have gotten better already.

Things have been pretty good on the 7900XT. Maybe the stutter issue is game specific, because most of the time it's only at the start where it stuttery. Subsequent launches don't have this issue.
Would be interesting to see some ACTUAL DATA about this, taking into account any Steam shader pre-caching, etc.
Simply, if you are using spyware, go with proprietary Nvidia. If Linux, go AMD + mesa, no brainer.
Try disabling antilag in adrenaline control panel under the game settings, this has caused stuttering when a game is CPU bound on my 7900XTX.  I had a 6600XT and disabling sleep states using More Power Tools then setting the minimum frequency a few hundred mhz below max frequency would also help on games with low gpu load, I haven't had this problem with the 7900XTX so I think AMD fixed it and not sure if it's still an issue on the 6000 series with newer drivers.  Something to play around with anyway, hope it helps.
amd here 7000 serires and no issues
Well I get them constantly on all games so. 6800xt.. will hold 160fps at 1440 then spike down and shoot back up. Wildly annoying
I only use my setup for sim racing and the entire first lap of a race is a stutter fest. After that everything is fine. Not ideal for sure.
It’s a settings thing. There’s things you need to disable or enable in the computer because amd and nvidia gpu are built different.
Compilation is made on the CPU usually.
I've also noticed these back in the day with Battlefield 1 which compiles its shaders on-the-fly which lead to noticable stuttering on Windows with the AMD driver at that time. Since I switched to Linux, this has become much better (as RADV uses another shader compiler that is more optimized to mitigate the issues you described here, I also use GPL and DXVK-async which might help even further).
If you switched you need to reinstall the games , they will have nvidia shaders they invalidate on the fly.
I will share a fix: if you installed the full driver suit, select the standard profile under graphics settings. Then scroll down where you see all the options and disable Surface Format optimization.

This option isn't supposed to be enabled by default. In fact, when you then install new drivers by updating or when you switch profiles again, it stays off regardless.

What does that? It switches texture format for some games that use not optimal ones, according to AMD. This option causes hitches on older games, Dying Light 2 is, however, very much affected.

I had a 5600 XT before swapping it out for 2070S, then I had a 3080 and finally a 6950 XT. My experience with the 6950 XT has been rather flawless.

I recommend everyone to always opt for the driver only or the minimal install solutions. It's very good that we have so many options in our drivers' control panel, but all those options can mess things up. People will choose the gaming profile because they are gaming and find out that it enables all sorts of options, which IMHO are just detrimental.
I had never even heard of this until now, and I've been on AMD for years. Interesting..
The fact we have to do this says a lot. AMD should fix DXNAVI instead of having us disable it.
SAM also needs more work.

If anyone owns both Wreckfest and Baldurs Gate 3, try this out:

1. Disable SAM, launch Wreckfest and jump into a race. Observe your FPS. The average FPS won't be all that impressive, probably averaging 90-100 FPS depending on your resolution/track/amount of cars, albeit it will still be more than playable and very smooth.
2. Close Wreckfest, enable SAM, relaunch Wreckfest and jump into a race. You'll notice your FPS has nearly *tripled.* On some tracks I can go from 70-90 FPS to 450+ FPS. If I make myself CPU limited at 720P, I can go from 250-300 FPS with SAM disabled, to well over 1100 FPS with SAM enabled. It's hilarious, and you really don't want to play Wreckfest with SAM off.
3. Now, keep SAM enabled and start up Baldurs Gate 3. Load up a save game and just start spinning the camera around quickly, just run around like normal, or start a dialogue. You'll notice awful frame pacing issues, with spikes to 80-180ms, and very noticeable stutters.
4. Close BG3, disable SAM. Load up a save game and repeat the above. The frame pacing will be excellent, very consistent and smooth, and the stutters will be completely gone. You really don't want to play BG3 with SAM on.

Both scenarios are 100% easily reproducible in any order you'd like to see it happen. SAM takes one game from performing acceptably to beyond excellently, but makes another game run like complete garbage.
First time hearing about it and wanted to do quick test with SWBF2 that have been kinda problematic ever since I switched to 6700XT. DX11 is stuttery mess and DX12 kinda works, but have some issues. So did the .dll switch accordingly to [this](https://nimez-dxswitch.pages.dev/NzDXSwitch) table and tried with DX11. On same map 0.1% lows were about the same level as max fps without the fix. GPU load was pretty much maxed the whole time whereas without the fix it fluctuated like crazy. Night and day difference basically. There are definitely some issues with those DirectX 11 optimizations on some games with 6000-series.

As per usual when poking with registry saved settings into file before beginning.

Thanks!
Shader stutters happens even on Polaris where dxnavi isn't a thing
>You need to disable dxnavi. Look up how.

This is turning into some Linux type shit.

Sorry but some of us just want to plug and play. I DDU all the nvidia drivers before using a sketchy exe from the internet. fine. whatever. 

I installed the Adrenaline software Driver and had a look around. A lot of options. Feels like using an Android on my phone but whatever. Options are good. 

Now if I want to "optimize" my shit I have to look up another tutorial online for a thing I didn't know existed just so I can have smooth experiences playing video games (which is the reason I bought a mid-high-end GPU in the first place).

It's a bit ridiculous if u ask someone that even after spending money they prob don't have for their hobby that they also need to configure known and unknown stuff.

Usually the software should be optimised from the get go after a clean install and just work as it's intended.
Always need some sort of manual intervention with AMD. A tale as old as time.
Disabling dxnavi and dx12 doesn't fix the stuttering that's wrong

And specialty in Warframe you have stuttering doesnt matter what you try.

Extra: disabling dxnavi can improve stuttering in some games but you loose performance

I have no idea if 7000 series have this issue
Even disabling that and using Amernime drivers I have some games that stutters anyway or have any kind of graphic related problem
The slight stutter when starting a new game / installing a new driver is worth the significant performance improvements and loading time improvements from DXNAVI, in DX9/10/11.
Is it required for 7000 series too?
Where do I go to disable this?
Where do I go to disable this?
If you disable it you will lose performance
Just an FYI to those out there with 7000 series GPUs. I tried this on a 7800XT and got a blue screen on reboot. I couldn't even get into safe mode. It eventually booted back into Windows long enough for me to open up regedit again and revert the change.
Yeah, first time I noticed that was with overwatch. Thanks for the info 🙌
Just as a test I tried this, and for the Oculus/Meta Quest VR headset, it locked to a significantly reduced encoding resolution for the headset.

I bet a lot of people who don't constantly use VR would have a fun time troubleshooting what is causing things to be a blurry mess, months after making this change.
This did absolutely nothing.  I doing something wrong? I changed it to DXnavi dx9 regular dx11. Edited the last 2 lines to ati instead of saying amd like in the guide.
Yeah, I always have to remember to not play comp for a few games in Apex Legends after a driver update, the stuttering is horrendous.
Glad I'm not the only one, I have a 6700xt and most of my stutters are at the first 10-20 seconds of playing the game(after hitting play and entering a map) after that it's just smooth. I played Grounded with my friend who owns a 3060 and the first thing he asked me was "do you know why games stutter when first playing them". It was reassuring that it's not just AMD cards that do it.
i always assumed it was  something with  warframes shader cache  compilation on warframe and not my  amd  drivers  after the update
I was thinking I am crazy. I have the same on PUBG. First game stuttering like crazy.
Same, moved from gtx 1080ti to 7900xt and it made me want to quit Overwatch.
Feels like dogshit for the first match
Same. Was really confused at first because I never had it in five years of playing on my 2060 (it happened very briefly after a major game update) but with the new 6700 XT it happens literally every single time the game boots up and is almost game breakingly bad after major updates.
Question, Do the Amernime drivers come with the DXNavi fixes built in?
My RX 590 did the same thing back in the day. I think there are easy fixes. But the big question is: why doesn't AMD fix them for good? I mean, again, it's easy. Well, not talking about Adrenalin tho
i noticed that when I launch RDR2 or GOW it will stutter and lag really bad for around 5 seconds then its very smooth with no stuttering. This didnt happen on my 3080.
about to switch from a 3060ti, do i just uninstall the drivers in safe mode then reboot with the amd card slotted in?
Comparing Zen+ to 12th gen is just bizarre, lol
I swapped from a 3070 to a 7800XT and was worried that ddu wouldn't be enough, so I reinstalled Windows 11 completely. My drivers have crashed 1/10 times that I play games for more than 20 minutes. Watching videos on my second monitor produce visual glitches. AMD is great on paper, but they have a lot to work on in terms of software.
I can confirm that moving from 2060 to 6800xt to 3090. And games are smoother on Nvidia. Fps count alone doesn’t equate to frame stability. As the fps counts usually avg over a span of seconds and the dips get swallowed in the metrics.
Can't help but think it's mostly placebo. People pay more attention to what their system is doing after a new install. I wonder if someone using an AMD card that switched to Nvidia with a complete wipe off their shader cache wouldn't notice the same thing.
It's handled better because Nvidia is basically 80% of the marketshare versus AMD 10%.
Am i the only one, who had more microstutters on Nvidia than on AMD? I had it on RTX 3080 10G, GTX 1080Ti. I had it on DOOM, and.... basically everywhere. People told me thats normal as i limited max FPS (like WTF?) via rivatuner (there was not yet option in the drivers. Later Nvidia introduced FPS cap in drivers, but for unknown reason it wasnt working in some games for me. I was forced to use Riva most of the time with microstutters. Much later Nvidia fixed FPS cap for titles i played (most of them) and microstutters was still here, with only Nvidia FPS cap (via driver). Ive not experienced anything like that on 6800XT - like seriously. Maybe i play different games, maybe some games works worse on AMD and better on Nvidia and vice versa (that pretty normal)?

I always limit FPS to 60 or 70. That gives you most stable framerate and frametime.  


What game is so problematic? Maybe i have it in some library and gonna test it.
Now, I dunno if what I experienced is an AMD bug or a bug with my motherboards bios but...

&nbsp;

I was having stutters in games and my audio was crackling/popping a lot up until recently.

I went into my bios, forced the PCI-E x16 slot from "Auto" to "Gen 3" and my issues disappeared.

&nbsp;

My games are smooth as butter and my audio isn't crackling or dropping out anymore.
In all games or just certain games? 
Have you installed the driver after using DDU? 

I know it's a hassle, but generally it isn't the worst idea to reinstall Windows after a GPU swap, especially if you run into problems.
Yep, me too. Always thought everyone had those stutters, my friend use to play with me various multiplayer games with a GT 1030 of all cards, I only realized he didn't have stutters on his 1030 when he switched to an AMD card and started complaining about them every time they happen, I mean he doesn't know what shader compilation is but I do, which is why I thought they were normal, but he only ever noticed them after switching to AMD.



And Yes he did DDU his Nvidia drivers before upgrading.
this is the one game thats giving me so many issues on my new card. I am playing through the new main quests and its a stuttery mess.
Are you on dx11 or 12? 12 stutters way too much and 11 I feel gets me too less fps
This is a separate issue I think. Apex Legends does shader recompile at the loading screen after a driver update but still stutters like crazy in the first couple of matches after.
Note that that Steam setting is only for Vulkan and OpenGL games. There's no shader precaching for DirectX.
Yep. But what really makes me mad is when I just let it sit to compile (in the menu) and it's one of those games that run the GPU at 100% in the main menu, while doing absolutely nothing (even after shader compilation). Like hell, what are you rendering there? A full screen blue background with a few boxes? What the hell?
Yeah, this sounds a lot like a bad card and not drivers. When I switched to AMD 8 months ago, I read some people commenting that most of the time a driver error is a hardware error instead on AMD GPUs specifically. It seems like most AIBs don't care about quality too much when it comes to AMD, since it's the product they will sell less compared to Nvidia. Meanwhile, Nvidia GPUs have better QC across the board, and Nvidia is famous for not letting AIBs mess around too much nowadays. AMD's top trusted brand is Sapphire without a doubt. I bought a 7900 XTX from Asus, and it's perfect as well. Return it while you still can and get a new one.
Yeah, this doesn't seem to be a driver related issue. If your card starts to perform 'normally' at 2550 Mhz clock, its the card, not the drivers. If you are still within return window, you may try your luck and swap the card for another one.
that almost just sounds like a bad card and not the drivers
Apparently the fix only works on 6000 series GPUs.
Wow Ive been going through this post and see a lot of complaints abt amd and wf (myself included). Honestly I feel warframe has something to do with this. Ever since duviri came out somethings been whack in the code istg
I had it on Polaris 20 (RX 580)and on Navi 31 (7900 XTX). But I didn't have it when I was using my Vega10 XTX (Vega 64 Liquid). I assume it's due to the HBM and, much more importantly, the HBCC segment.
most people have never experienced it, OP either has a broken system or they're a troll. they have some, ahem, interesting posts before they started this AMD brigade.
Do you actually play warframe or destiny 2? if not how can you say you dont experience it? this is a particular issue with AMD and some dx11 games. Just because you didnt come across with one of this games doesnt mean the problem isnt there.
DXNAVI makes DX11 games stutter more, and most competitive games are DX11.
The GPU driver can still play a part since it's the main culprit behind this (building PSOs and compiling shader code/IR to an ISA/machine code specific to the particular GPU or GPU arch) and it's also responsible for driver-side caching, should games not use a shader/PSO cache properly (or at all).

Some people are sensitive to frame time problems just like some people like me see 30fps as smooth and others see a stutter show. That shader cache issue is irrelevant to me but relevant to them. I wouldnt care if it happens.
>Shader compilation is done on the CPU, so it can't be the GPU causing it.

Yes, but drivers can cause it. It's dxnavi that's causing it in DX11 games for example. Before that AMD didn't stutter more than Nvidia but now they do.
Its a fresh windows 10 install so I didnt have any previous drivers installed to remove.
What is DDU?
FFS this comment makes me want to sell my AMD shares and buy the company valued at $1.1 Trillion instead
I jumped ship after a year of frustration with the 5700xt, never again.
Did you use DDU? Or a fresh OS install?

Edit: Don't exactly know why I got downvoted tbh. Is trying to help no longer a thing?
What kind of tweaking helped?
there are definitely stutters on nVidia too, but I have no data to compare whose stutters are worse, and in which games
This is a known AMD GPU issue, no need to gaslight OP into thinking it's something else
It's a Ryzen 7 5800X and it's on a completely fresh install of Windows 10 pro. I even have a $200 1000 watt bequiet PSU
I really do think AMD just has an issue with this tbh. Because I have a 7800x3d/6950XT/Samsung 990 Pro/32GB 6000mhz CL30/1.2gbps via ethernet and I still have issues with stuttering in online games as well.
I assure you it's not the CPU. Ryzen 7 5800X as it was the best CPU to go with this specific GPU at that time.
Bulldozer . 

This fuckin question. AMD bots can't admit their shitty GPUs issues and start looking at anything else but the GPU
I don't think it's just the CPU, it's probably some overly enthusiastic RAM timings on DDR5 (or DDR4 and this applies to Intel too) for a lot of it.  Like I'm going to throw it out there and say only 1 in 6 have stable RAM timings, and the other 5 out of 6 have only used memtest (which is rubbish and only good for testing bad RAM). People should be using OCCT, Karhu, ycruncher, Prime95, and testmem5 with certain profiles, basically, all those with 6000 C30, yes  I'm speaking to you.
He is correct. I have been only using Radeon and I'm experiencing the same issue in Warframe after each driver update. It goes away after I play for sometime.
I got your same build, trying to get a 4070 Super, just cause AMD Adrenaling Software sometimes just wont start and other times it deletes my custom game profiles. Havent really had much, if any, driver issues.
you said you have none of the problems talked about in here, then describe a problem thats exactly one of the big problems w/ many games talked about in here. You contradict yourself
Bro I played Warframe religiously for years going from a 1070 to a 3060 TI and I had absolutely no stutters whatsoever and the game was smooth as butter. It's only when I went to my '6900 XT that I started to experience this issue. We're talking about frame times up to 200ms that practically pause the game for an entire second when something loads in. It made me fell a spy mission on my first run because I dropped on top of the enemy when I was bullet jumping. It literally froze in the mid jump for a full second ffs.
I have 20 years on pc, i can take that if you have a potato pc and playing cracked games

But i cant take that if you play in a high end computer with paid services and paid games on steam

Becoming a geek find problems, solve problems and optimize stuff its so cool but that should not be a requirement to play paid and official stuff without stuttering. I get it you can allways overclock, and optimize stuff to gain 10 or 20% perfomance or even more

But stuttering its not fps related, its something worse and bad
This has gotten downvotes, but is actually a valid point. If you are GPU limited, the CPU has way more time to switch to another thread to do the compilation. If your CPU is busy, then it will continue running the game logic until it HAS TO wait for the compilation, which will then be very jarring.

I'm not saying this is the reason here, but the point is valid.
Just remember that a large majority of people have no issues, myself included.

A lot of it ends up being user error or issues unrelated to the GPU.

Definitely take it with a pinch of salt unless they actually provide proof.
I have a full AMD system for nearly a year now and the only problem I had was caused by a windows update what MS fixed fast.
Its not a game specific, warframe and destiny 2 has zero shader stutter on nvidia compared to amd
account for all the stuff that needs to be reinstalled and configured with it. takes me no less than an hour an a half every time
Literally untrue.

But you're stuck with a 10gb vram "flagship" so I understand why you're mad.
Can you explain more about this? I don't get what you mean and where to do it
Can´t talk about AMD igpu, but everything looks great on my RX 7900XT meaning both games as well as Windows desktop, apps or whatnot.
They already know the issue i did it by myself.


They answered something like we can't replicate the problem so we need you doing some deep tests

I did it uploaded 1gb or something of that test

And they said we will not check the results because you are using a modified windows

Fun part I'm using windows modified due low perfomance on original version. I also mentioned that i finished block him

He is from amd dev team and he have direct connection with lab team you can find it on amd discord

He just wasted my time and effort learning how to use an specific monitoring software

The only thing i want try at this point it's linux and check if i get these stuttering on linux
> On the contrary, the shaders and textures look sharper with a Radeon GPU than with a NVIDIA GPU (I used to have a 1080ti).

This is absolute nonsense.
Its only there for RDNA GPUs, RDNA1 only has dxnavi for DX9 and older games. RDNA2 has it for DX11 and DX9 and older games.

If you aren't on one of those architectures you wouldn't have noticed it since its not enabled.
I've used AMD since I was a teenager... so like 20 years and I've never experienced what your saying and I played warfare alot... it's an old game.

The seems like a troll post to wreck their reputation... esecially if your using 6900xt..

Like I always say... let's see some evidence so this can be proven.

I have a 5700xt and use quad monitors and I've never experienced what you are talking about esecially when a game like Warframe wouldn't even come close to pushing that card to its limits.

Sounds like you need to RMA the card or reseat the GPU sinks.
I'm under the impression that DXNAVI has performance benefits. So wouldnt turning it off hurt performance for DX11?
What version of dx Navi are you using with 6700xt.
I don't think this is the issue, the issue is specifically shader caching which exists on every GPU and people who say it doesn't or the X3D CPU fixes it are lying. 

The issue is likely switching the GPU has no NEW shader cache, so every game needs to RE-CACHE shaders. AMD used to have a control panel option for forced shader caching, and IDK if reg edit still can force it. Steam is also responsible for some shader caching, and perhaps it's just not available yet. Unreal Engine is also notorious for bad shader cache optimization.

This isn't an AMD problem. Many people on AMD gpus do not have this issue, likely because long term use has already cached shaders, steam has it available to distribute, etc. The issue is specifically caused from switching to a NEW AMD GPU, which has no cache. 

The stuttering WILL GO AWAY after you use the card. Playing the game for 10 minutes is NOT representative of playing for multiple hours. This complaint is ultimately a massive Nvidia Troll, whether deliberate or naive. 

If this was a REAL problem, it would be pointed out by Gamers Nexus, Hardware Unboxed, and every other tech channel, but they don't, so it's not. The issue is like some dumb relative who disconnects from WiFi, and thinks "the internet is broken". They simply don't know what the problem is, and blame something unrelated. Even if there is some optimization issue, the problem WILL GO AWAY simply from using the card.
This might be why nvidia enables rebar on a game by game basis rather than system wide like AMD with their implementation (smart access memory)
I have not noticed any issues with BG3 with SAM enabled.
Yes but SAM provides better average on "selected" titles and that what looks good on those power-point presentations instead of smoothness and word of mouth of other gamers.
Thank you so much!   
The stutters, the low 1% fps drops, all gone in Warhammer DarkTide... 1200+ hours on this game, had SAM enabled... and I blamed it on the devs and their engine.
This is literally expected behavior for SAM and is dependent of game engine/code and how it does things. This is why SAM wasn’t a thing for a long time but the benefits are so large that you should just disable it for specific cases where it’s not good.
This kind of behaviour is unacceptable in my opinion. This is acceptable for a prototype product, but for actual release it's just ludicrous to expect your users to troubleshoot and fix issues that should never have existed.
Overwatch is DX11 and it stutters massively every single time you start the game, it's not shader compilation, it happens every single time, you have to wait 2-5 minutes before joining a match so the game is actually playable.


Disabling DXNAVI fixes that. Ridiculous.
Yeah, and Nvidia too. That said, this DXNAVI thing seems to be unrelated to shaders, and people are conflating something that's likely a driver bug with shader caching. Then the Nvidia shills are pretending they don't get shader caching. So there's a bunch of complete nonsense and superstitious FUD in this thread, and instead of getting to what's actually going on, everyone is playing the popularity game of saying BS to get upvotes. HURR DURR my nvidia card doesn't shader cache, -> Upvote Upvote. Thread is cancer.

Also, has anyone tried DXVK? I bet that solves it just as well.
>  This is turning into some Linux type shit.

The irony. AMD is plug and play for linux but not for windows LMFAO.
Sadly there’s always some tinkering and troubleshooting bullshit involved with PC Gaming. Be it AMD or Nvidia. This is why people just get consoles and don’t bother. I agree with your sentiment though. Shouldn’t be that way at all. And if it is, should be handled by the manufacturer with a driver update. At a minimum options for settings tweaking in applicable software, connected to that particular piece of hardware for whatever issue pops up.
You've got a computer. You may have designed it (although by the content of your rant I doubt it was you) to play games, but it is meant to do more than that. That comes with tradeoffs. You install software, drivers, can have incompatibilities, then you try and figure out what to do and learn new stuff. Wanna plug and play with almost zero worries, get a ps5 or an xbox.
Yeah I'd be careful following advice from random comments. I just googled dxnavi and it brought up a year old reddit thread that people are posting on now and saying how they did what the instructions said and now they don't boot their computer or it broke something.
>This is turning into some Linux type shit.

glad you think its getting better.
When I switched from AMD to Nvidia this year, I had to use a third-party tool to enable dithering for my monitors because of awful banding. And it took a lot of back-and-forth clicking to make the settings stick.

AMD comes with dithering enabled by default...
1. It is not sketchy (wtf)

2. You don't have to touch anything at all, default settings are ok
As a Linux user I have to say for things like drivers 90% of things just work. AMD drivers are built into the kernel for example. When I switched from Nvidia to AMD all I had to do was put the new gpu in my PC things were already installed.
If you don't want this then game on console. This kind of stuff has applied in PC gaming for decades, regardless of whether you support AMD or Intel for CPU choice, AMD or Nvidia for graphics or going back in history whether you supported 3DFx, PowerVR, Matrox or ATI. Having to sometimes do some tinkering to get stuff to work is one of the prices you pay for using a platform where there are almost infinite combinations for hardware.
> Feels like using an Android on my phone but whatever

Boomers should be banned from using any tech whatsoever
Buy a console?  Who buys a PC then whines about "cOnFigUrinG tHinGs"?
How come you opted for a DIY PC if you value out of the box experience and don't like the many settings provided?

When you decide to configure and put together your own system, then you take on some of the responsibility of the overall system. Responsibility of testing and integrating that would otherwise be done by an SI or console manufacturer.
Sounds more like Windoze shit to me.
buy xbox mate
That does sound like shader caching. It's actually a good thing that it has to recompile and cache the shaders after an update, because you don't want people to manually have to delete it in case the update fixes something that was previously not working. It does suck tho if there weren't any problems. But I don't think it would be wise to have AMD select the games that need recompiling, as there are just too many niche games it could positively affect.
From what I've read, users who tried it no longer experience the stuttering that you've described, so I'd assume so. I haven't personally used it since stuttering is either not present or not a big deal on the games I currently play.

In any case if you decide to install it, do keep a system restore point in case something goes wrong.
I noticed that in some games when I have vsync turned on in the AMD drivers. When I turn vsync to off unless the game specifies, it doesn't happen.
Correct.  Launch safe mode

Launch DDU

Run clean and shutdown option

Install new GPU after your PC Is automatically shut down

Boot and install drivers
I used the clean and shutdown option in DDU while the Nvidia card was still in and in safe mode. After the app had went through it's process and the pc turned off, that's when I swapped the cards
Download DDU

Boot into safe mode and run DDU

In DDU select GPU from right side and click on Clean and Restart option 

DDU will uninstall old GPU driver in safe mode and reboot PC automatically in normal mode

Then you can install your latest driver.


Edit:- don't forget to turn off your internet before booting into safe mode.
Fresh windows
I just had to point it out for all the people in the comments talking about the CPU being an issue for OP. Making the comparison between a 3070 + Ryzen 2600 with little to no shader compilation stutters vs a 6800xt + 12600kf that does have noticeable stutters (I tried the 3070 with 12600kf too, still no stutters)
That doesn't sound like typical software issues with Radeon. You might want to make sure it isn't a hardware defect
I also had a lot of driver crashes when I upgraded. It was mainly driver timeouts only during gaming. It turned out the Corsair DDR4 I had at the time was unstable with XMP enabled. after some manual tuning I got it stable and didn't have crashes. That Corsair kit is long gone, using overclocked Ballistix now

The visual glitches you describe could be from the unstable driver or maybe hardware acceleration in the browser or windows [MPO](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5157/~/after-updating-to-nvidia-game-ready-driver-461.09-or-newer%2C-some-desktop-apps). Hopefully it's not a faulty vram chip
Check your ram, your ram probably is isn′t compatible with your motherboard. 
Sounds dumb but NVIDIA handles way better unstable ram compared to AMD GPU, so it probably is the reason why you never noticed anything before switching.

I would also make a BIOS update while i′m at it, can′t hurt.
Visual glitches in YouTube?

Is it any chance you see something like a checkerboard pattern in chrome? I know several people have that problem.

 https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/youtube-discord-visual-studio-code-are-flickering-with-black-checkered-squares-vertical-lines-partial-solutions-to-this-issue.306623/
Something is either wrong with the card itself or it's not getting enough power. No card, even if it had a bum driver, should crash that often and that easily. That's like, bad overclocking behavior. I'd rma it.
I find it interesting that so many people on reddit seem to  problems Iike this over the years. Black screens, driver crashes, etc meanwhile I've been using AMD for 8 years at this point and have never experienced any of it.
These are usually manufacturing defect issues, meaning you've been hit with bad luck. Most of the time it's bad VRAM modules (IMHO)

You might want to get on a RMA call soon
It could be Displayport vs Hdmi isue. I still had many problems with tripple monitor setup with 7800 XT where one is HDMI and sometimes needs to switch only to main DP monitor for certain tasks to work properly.
Not sure how much water that theory holds. I upgraded from an RX 470 to the RTX 3070. It was my first Nvidia card in years so I was looking more for problems with that card than when I switched back to Radeon. But it was smoother
Yes, I've used DDU in safe mode, I could reinstall windows but I really doubt that's going to do anything.
lol this guy with the "reinstall OS" after switching gpu manufacturers
Have an OS here that went, separately (& successfully of course): Radeon to GeForce, HDD to SATA SSD, Win 7 to Win 10, Intel to AMD CPU & new GPU & NVMe SSD, MBR to GPT.
Doubt it ever got driver uninstalls in safe mode either...
I hate that so much! I don’t mind waiting the actual FULL time for the shaders to pre-cache, If it means I’ll have a stutter-free first match.
just cap your frames unless it's winter
Agree, some devs just use in-game models for some characters for example in the menus and this drains a lot of power for nothing.
This is 100% fact. AMD sells people untested alpha products that NEED an update to work right, starting with the Phenom ONE, and being just as bad with RDNA1. Then their GPUs do not have quality control, some manufacturers are worse, but AMD does sell literally defective silicon, which is why their cards are so heavily stock overvolted. So we have people complaining they get BSODs, crashes, Black Screens, etc, while other people say they have no problems. This ain't all drivers people, you have defective hardware. AMD requires a higher degree of research before making a purchase. The benefit is you get more perf/$ and open source, but caveat emptor.
Amd adrenaline base settings for the card at 100% clock is 2670hz while the Manufacturer states that the cards max clock is 2550hz. So i do think its Just amd being stupid.
At this point I don’t even know maan. But I think I’ll power through and figure this shit out.
Gotcha.
Yea i was really considering upgrading my r5 2600 because i figured it was to old for warframe now. I have to so it soon anyway having 7800x now and getting bottlenecked, but
In WF still my cpu usage is 50-60 and stutters so it is what it is. ;(
[deleted]
the first thing i look at while gaming is the frametimes, i never had any framtime issues since im on amd
did you try reinstalling warframe
> What is DDU?

DDU stands for Display Driver Uninstaller, it's pretty much the go to for removing drivers. _Always_ DDU, before a fresh install of drivers, reverting to older drivers, or installing a new GPU.
It was a new build so new win
To be fair... there are a ton of people conflating the two issues. Stutters when you first launch a game after a gpu driver update are normal. It has to rebuild the shader cache. 

I'm not familiar with the dxnavi issue being talked about, but based on the comments I'm seeing there are a lot of people that don't understand the difference now saying "OMG! I have that problem too!"
It is? I've only had my 6700xt for like, a year and change and I the only time I've had stutters is when I've been CPU limited (I had a 6700k for a while), when there's a common loading stutter (ala re4 remake as shown by digital foundry), when there's shader compilation stutter that's known in a game (also shown by digital foundry on their Uber power CPUs and they usually use Nvidia cards to demonstrate), or when I had several USB hard drives plugged in at once and removing them seemed to fix it.

I'm very susceptible to stutter so I'm just trying to relay my experiences and what's fixed it.

If I had that kind of stuff going on, I'd try everything I laid out and if that didn't work I'd rma my card. This isn't 2007 where that was more common.
Have a 5800x as well and a RX 6800, Lies of P was stuttering with shaders so bad I had to refund the game even though on paper the game was giving me excellent frame times
Why did you switch to a new GPU?
+10 points for griffindor for using a bequiet PSU. I would trust that company with my life.
You got the latest AMD chipset drivers and BIOS installed?
Install amd chipset drivers also

When you DDU?
First off use windows 11 not 10 you can't use 4 year old software and expect it to run fine.

Second of all this shouldn't be an issue thats AMD or Nvidia specific it should be same on both unless you just messed up something like didn't uninstall nvidia drivers with ddu.


edit: Nice downvotes for people thinking W11 bad.
Could be a RAM problem then? Are they running full speed with XMP enabled?
Huh?
This is one of the issues that will happen to everyone if they have not disabled DXNavi in dx11 games. It's an annoying issue and disabling dxnavi means you get less performance, so it's a double edged sword.
There are several people saying that they had the same issues on both AMD as well as Nvidia. Other people report no issues at all with their AMD gpus.
I reinstall just on C drive, everything is on D. Then I reinstall bnet steam and 2 other launchers and re-detect the games and I'm more or less done. Other tools I install for 5mins with ninite. With ssds nowadays it's really quick.
this is wrong. try running hunt showdown for the 1st time after clearing game cache on polaris. its stutter fest every few meters. after everything was seen on screen once, its ok

nvidia behaves differently. everyhing like models and textures load in very low detail for the 1st time and shape up to their final form on screen but fps stays untouched.
what about RDNA3?
How about RDNA3 GPUs? I got a 7900xt and wondering if I should do this.
You responded to the wrong person.
Correct
It's DX11 though. Who the fuck cares about 1% off 300 fps?
I don't bother turning it off. I just stopped playing the games that blatantly have the issue. (Destiny 2 and Valorant). Those games aren't worth me tweaking it every time.
That is just not true for this case because I own AMD and Nvidia machines both. If you take Destiny 2, for example, and blow away the shader cache on both, the AMD GPU machine will literally stutter like it has a disease while the NV machine re-caches quietly and without a hitch. 

DX11 shader cache is handled driver side and broke after DXNAVI released. You can downgrade exactly to the driver prior to it, or disable DXNAVI in the registry, and watch the issue go away on RDNA2 cards. 

If the expected experience playing Destiny 2 is to basically have 5FPS 99% lows in your first and even second PVP match, no wonder why people switch to NV and never look back. Same with Valorant. "Play it long term" isn't a solution for a single-player game you play once and never again either.
this is exacly why rebar on nvidia sometimes it breaks performance or destroys frame pacing other times it doesnt do anything also rebar nvidia+intel makes some game totaly crash thats why its nvidia has another check for games with rebar and intel platforms.
There’s no issue. Go and understand what you are talking about before making up things that users are fixing a supposed issue that doesn’t actually exist.
BTW, I noticed that unlike in that instruction I linked said you can swap those dll's on the fly. So just save reg keys into files and apply them before launching the game. Changing between old and new dll's will be much easier. Think this works as long as files aren't in use. 

But yeah, this shouldn't be a thing.
 If you disable DXNAVI, are you losing anything?  I haven't used an AMD gpu since the ATI days - so, I am just asking out of curiosity.   I guess, it's acceptable as long as you can tweak a setting to fix the stuttering.

But, I agree with ppl saying AMD should fix that problem.   Also, if the trade-off is another issue created (from disabling the DXNAVI), that is not an acceptable solution, imho - meaning AMD needs to get on it.
I have those stutters sometimes in Trackmania 2020 and Eldenring, will/could it help there as well? (RX5800XT)
It's true, Linux doesn't give a fuck. It doesn't even give a shit if your vbios signature is valid or not. Just all gas and no brakes. It would probably sell booze to a child if it could.
the only thing remotely resemble "plug and play" on Linux is the Steam Deck, and that thing has bugs all over the experience too
Shame gaming on Linux is a bit shit.
Windows is optimized for Intel. Do people forget the reason we support the little guy?
I remember having to repeatedly reinstall my GTX 1050's drivers after Windows decided to overwrite them whenever there was an update.
Not true. I bought a 4080 and installed it last week. Went from a 3070 to a 4080. Didn't use DDU and used Geforce Experience to install the latest driver. It works flawlessly. No stuttering. Great performance. AMD's cards should work just as simply and the fact that I see the OP's issue all over reddit, hardforum, LTT forums and TechPowerUp is very telling and the reason I didn't get a 7900XTX instead of the 4080. I've been building computers since I was 14 years old and now I am 38. I just want my stuff to work from day one. If I buy something and I have to fiddle with it to work on day one then I am returning it and looking for an alternative. Even Android phones don't require fiddling and only require a little bit of setup and that's it. Most Linux distro's these days don't require a lot of fiddling and are decently steamlined. AMD has no excuse.
You are probably right but I would put up with tweaking all day before giving up pc gaming for consoles.

The variety and options that pc gaming has that consoles dont come close to are worth a little tinkering.
> Sadly there’s always some tinkering and troubleshooting bullshit involved with PC Gaming

DXNavi is also better known as "the thing that made AMD GPUs not suck with DX11 games", turning it off is kind of a big deal and absolutely not "typical tinkering and troubleshooting bullshit".
I stopped careing about the rant when he complained about the software...I have used both Nvidia and AMD GPUs and have a Nvidia one now...I like the AMD software way better and wish Nvidia would update there UI instead of using something that looks like it belongs in Windows 95.
A PS5 or Xbox doesn't have the same performance as a high-end gaming PC. What if he just got the PC to play games at higher FPS and quality?
miss me with that "No true Scotsman" BS...

I bought every single component and assembled it myself.

I'm just talking about going into microsoft windows registry and mess around with stuff I don't fully understand. 

What's next? Write my own BIOS?
>y with almost zero worries, get a ps5 or an xbox.  
>  
>23

That's not a 'typical worry' - the hardware is not working properly - it's unexpected behavior.   In comparison, their competition - nvidia hardware - DOESN'T DO THAT -as the OP was explaining.   Perhaps, read what others are saying before telling them 'too bad, go buy a console?'
That is why it states all over their site to be careful and follow the instructions.  I changed the dxnavi regedit and unfortunately it didn't fix an issue I had with a game.  Did the change 3 times without a single issue.

I didn't try the Nimez driver, seems to be a lot of work.  Worth it I guess if you have some serious issues.  I don't so didn't want to temp fate.
>dithering 

I don't even know what that is...
You can't just say "no" to valid points. Clearly OP is having issues, clearly everyone tells hims he needs to do something, and clearly many people are upset about needing to do that, and even needing to figure out stuff they have no idea about.

"That's not true" isn't really adding to the discussion.
I meant the internet meme where on Linux, in order to "change your wallpaper you have to go into your terminal and use 10 different commands or some shit".

&#x200B;

I heard that Linux actually has good support for AMD overall which makes me kind of sad that Microsoft just leaves AMD behind sometimes.

Makes me wanna switch to only intel and nvidia in the future.
[removed]
I want you to read carefully what I'm about to write:

*I like having options.*

*But I also like not having to use them unless I reall*y want to.

&#x200B;

This feels like a situation where it should come configured well out of the box and I needn't touch anything unless I have a specific issue or I want something to work differently.

Other than that, I just want to enjoy what I bought. 

I'm sure you also have a job and other responsibilities. Imagine coming home from work and instead of playing games without any friction, you open up Registry editor and tinker for a few minutes now and then for whatever reason. 

Then you realize you have to wash the dishes, do laundry, or whatever. Prepare for the next day. 

Gaming time is reduced with every configuration and/or setting you *have to do* instead of *wanting to do*.
> How come you opted for a DIY PC if you value out of the box experience and don't like the many settings provided?

the problem would not be any better if it had come in a prebuilt or boutique workstation.  this is not a compatibility/configuration problem, it's a broken driver.
thankyou ^ ^
May I ask you about my situation that my 5600 xt already broke and I want to upgrade to a 6650 xt, what is the step then? Does it affect the new card?
 ty :)
I am suggesting you add one critical step in ALL processes using DDU:  


= Disable the system's internet access before booting to safe mode.

WHY? This ensures that Microsoft does not install its own forced AMD driver during the installation process. MS has the ability to corrupt the installation DURING the time you log into your system from Safe Mode, up to the point you finish installing your driver if you have your internet on, with automatic driver updates on.

= Enable your system's internet access after a successful driver install (Clean install usu. means you don't need to restart, but I do that anyway)
Shader compilation stutters are noticeable because they take well several hundred milliseconds to process. While a 12600K is probably close to twice as fast as a Ryzen 2600 at this, it still only halves the processing time to a couple hundred milliseconds. This is why you can't really alleviate shader compilation stutters by upgrading CPUs.
Ok I'll try contacting AMD to figure this out
The Radeon driver after like May 2020 is basically MemTest. It DOES NOT GUSTA unstable memory.
I've had a single problem in almost 15 years old only using AMD GPUs. With my RX 480, my adrenaline software suddenly wasn't working after a driver update. Games and everything worked fine still, but I adrenaline wouldn't start. I figured out finally that it was the same reason that everyone was having corrupt windows installs after updating drivers. Windows was downloading and overwriting the drivers I installed with whatever incompatible version it was using. Disabling Windows' automatic install of drivers and then a driver re-install fixed it. I have no idea why only AMD has this problem, and neither do they apparently.
When people don't understand the basics of how something works, they make leaps and bound in logic to convince themselves they know whats wrong. Why would you run DDU when you can do on reddit and say 'AMD bad'
It can certainly be worth a try. If you have a large SSD, you can try to install a second partition of Windows onto it (GRUB is your friend). 
Other than that, there are many factors that can cause such behavior. Some of it is normal, as the game is compiling the shaders. But if it is happening after many hours of gameplay, something is not right.
Well no. I just said that it isn't the worst idea. Especially when you are running into problems.
Its possible, but given how card clocks are dynamic, and are dependant on cooling, it may be a card specific firmware issue. Again, if possible, swap your card instead of believing the AIB that its AMDs driver and not their wonky card/firmware. AIBs wouldn't admit their fault easily, but if card doesn't work properly out of the box, it needs to be replaced by AIB. Your having to touch the clocks manually means its no longer working as stock out of the box.
Yep, see for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/
Weird, same system here, except i don't know your RAM and PSU, but 5800X+6800XT Lies of P ran butter smooth from the start (1440p max settings, never below 100 FPS)
> you can't use 4 year old software and expect it to run fine.

Yes you can. I've made my peace with any and all software being fucking terrible on launch and at the very least 6 months after. It doesn't magically become shite again, AMD just can't hack it
🤦‍♂️ prefix hits again...
If it worked fine on Nvidia, it isn’t any of the other components
Then again, XMP can cause these problems too. So if it's disabled, try enabling it. If it's enabled, try disabling it.
I never even heard of dxnavi and I played warframe. 7900xtx+5800x3d user.

Shader stutter is everywere on unreal engine games, not the case of destiny 2 and warframe tho, these 2 are atleast the ones i know this is an amd specific problem, and i bet there are alot more in the exact same situation.

edit:  You can downvote all you want, you cannot stand facts and rather deal with that then good for you.

I have a GTX 1070 & games like Assassin's Creed Origins & Assassin's Creed Odyssey stutter severely during compilation of shaders which compile while your playing the game.

I think the issue is clearly the way in which games compile shaders which is slow regardless of hardware. It seems it makes more sense to precompile shaders before loading a game like Horizon Zero Dawn.

I'm not being funny but it doesn't matter if your using the fastest nvme hard drive with the best cpu & a rtx 4090 it seems shader compilation still causes stuttering if it's compiled on the fly like in some open world games like Assassin's Creed Origins & Odyssey.

At least Horizon zero Dawn precompiles shaders before game launch.

Microsoft Direct Storage may solve this issue but it seems no games have implemented yet.

It seems to me like the software & code of games is severely lacking & not taking advantage of all our new cpu's, nvm ssds, & graphic cards.
This is game depending tho? 

In Monster Hunter World I get exactly what you describe with my RX 6800: no lag but low res textures and shaders till the compilation is done.

Also I think for all PVP games there should be the option to pre-build all shaders. Sure it takes time, can even take 20 minutes, but if that removes all stutters I would do it in games I like to play a lot (I want it as an option, not forced).
yeah. nvidia behaves differently. it's almost like...it's almost like it's a different architecture. you know? like the gpus are completing tasks in a totally different way. haha. life is strange.

but the above is totally normal for shader cache compilation. and some games handle it more gracefully then others.

i have an rdna 2 card and have none of the stuttering issues these cubes are talkin about..besides normal shader compilation. which occurs once
I think its on for all RDNA GPUs now according to another redditor. Some 23.7 driver fully enabled it for all of them.
Lol your right, but I still meant what I said! So sorry for clicking the wrong reply.
Nvidia user here. Am I guessing correctly that this DXNAVI is basically a form of API wrapping that converts DX9-11 to Vulkan or maybe DX12? Because if so holy hell that is a disgusting thing to enforce at the driver level.
Remember God of War at launch? AMD cards were struggling down in sub-60 land because of the CPU limitations of their deiver
Is there some issue if we change it? And it'd stay changed unless we update the drivers right?
This is long debunked nonsense. Tech channels have already explained shader cache issues. Your Nvidia machine simply has the shaders PRE CACHED, and this is not a case of magical nvidia drivers. 

To fix this on AMD, Steam needs to develop shader caches for new hardware to redistribute, or the game itself needs to have a proactive precache function. Which doesn't exist on old games, so this can only be addressed by normal use, steam, or the drivers FORCING a precache. Either way, it is NOT a problem after you play the game long enough for the cache to develop. NOBODY plays ONE map, and says, "oh shader caching, I think I'll quit". No, you'll play the second map, caching will stop, and then it won't be a problem.

What you are doing is OBVIOUS SHILL TROLLING. "Shader cache exists, therefore AMD BAD." When in reality, you're taking the issue out of context, pretending something it's not, and no tech channels, AMD, or Microsoft consider it a real problem.
It’s a problem when an end user is required to disable and enable a system setting all the time.  

At least NVIDIA is smart and profiles on a per game and per application basis automatically with rebar.
Ahh well everytime you switch DXNAVI on or off, Overwatch starts an actually real shader compilation process which takes longer than whatever bullshit it's doing when DXNAVI is enabled, but thanks for letting me know, might be useful on another game. 




I'd rather play with DXNAVI off but it re-enables itself every driver update so I just stopped bothering and lived with it.
Yes you do lose a bit of performance especially in CPU bound games like overwatch, i did try testing it although it wasn't very methodical, i tested 2 replays so the game footage is the same but only tested once for each replay, i think i saw around 15 or 18% improvement with DXNAVI enabled, but this is a best case scenario and it's overwatch so 20% less frames is still a shit load of frames, i think most people can turn it off unless you're CPU bottlenecked even in single player games.

&#x200B;

However it keeps re enabling itself after every driver update so i just don't bother and live with waiting in menu for a few minutes before joining a match
Trackmania is apparently DX11, so there's a good chance it can actually help if you disable DXNAVI.


But Elden Ring is DX12 so it's unlikely to affect anything.
Considering how bad Windows 11 is, IDK why people are still using Windows. Just switch to a modern Distro like Tumbleweed, you get the GUI of Windows 7, performance better than Windows 10, and there's no hours of registry hacks, disabling telemetry, app store bs, cortana, replacing the start menu, file explorer, getting rid of Edge, etc.

It used to be Linux was a worse user experience, but now? If you have AMD, Linux works better than Windows right out of the box. Install linux, install steam, play games, no nonsense. There's also Lutris if you need support outside of steam.

Oh, and speaking of this driver bug, there's DXVK. Why has NOBODY mentioned it? I bet this would solve the problem on windows, because it isn't a thing on linux.
somewhere Linus Torvald is fuming
At least it's getting better, thanks to Proton. There are a ton of games these days that work on Linux with no issue. Obviously it's not perfect, but it's a shitload better now than it ever has been.
Have you ever tried it?
Agree. And I hate it when people say "just use this emulation app to run windows inside of Linux". That's just stupid lol.
This is sarcasm, right?
There is a setting in Windows Update to keep that from happening. Windows Update > Advanced Features > Optional Updates. Turn that off and Windows won't install different drivers automatically if there are drivers already installed. So that is a Windows issue and not a Nvidia issue.
I had hella issues with my RTX2080 in WoW, specifically flickering in Ardenweald. I also had hella issues with it when enabling GPU in Lightroom. It's what led me to buying my first ever AMD card.
That's an issue with windows update. it thinks the driver you installed is wrong and that the one in its database is the current one.
Thats why you never have windows automatically update. There will always be an update that screws something up at some point. Better to wait for others to beta test it.
same thing happened to me just a few weeks back cause i forgot to have DDU stop windows from updating them before i could, and i almost lost my mind 😭
I’m 35, been building since I was 17. So similar to you. I have experienced problems with Nvidia drivers in the past. That was a long time ago though. Nothing recent as of now. I haven’t had an AMD GPU in a while. I had ATI cards before even AMD bought them out. People experience various bugs accross many different configurations of hardware that’s connected to whatever hardware they have. My recent build is with a 7800x3d. My first AMD cpu in 17 years, which so far is running great after hearing so many issues with them “blowing up”. No issues on my end with my Asrock steel legend board. I’m running a gigabyte 3080 12 GB that’s running flawlessly as well.
Same here, I’m PC Gamer first and foremost. I’m just stating the path and logic behind many consoles purchases. Right now they are cheaper than any custom gaming PC, it’s plug and play with no fuss. Most people don’t know how to build a gaming PC or even install/update a driver. That takes time to learn which most people are lazy and have no interest.
WHat did you just say? How dare you.
Buy a $5000 Alienware and call support every 5 minutes when something insn't perfect until they don't reply anymore. Then write a lengthy rant on reddit why PC sucks.

/s
My answer stands. Want a PC, know it is a PC. It is way more user friendly then it was a few years ago, but not supposed to be used by people that have low tolerance to problem solving.
> What's next? Write my own BIOS?

It's just a couple of hex code changes, don't be dramatic 🌝
Keeping up the drama eh? lolol.
Eases color banding without additional color levels. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Colour_banding_example01.png
There is nothing to do, just wait 10 minutes for shaders to load and that is it, I don't know why are people making a big deal out of this. you really can't do much about it. 

And no, DDU is not sketchy, you can fight me about it, idgaf.
Unfortunately those memes make people think that's how Linux actually is these days. 

The support mostly comes from the community and not AMD, the open-source community drivers have better performance.
Grow up for suggesting somebody who wants plug and play, minimal troubleshooting buy a console?

Ok then, what would you suggest for an experience like that?  If not a console?

You won't get that on PC.

Maybe don't buy a PC then whine about having to troubleshoot.  

The grown up thing would have been to research what you were getting into before you built a PC.

Not just doing it, then whining about it after the fact.

Hey OP — Your post has been removed for not being in compliance with Rule 3. 

Be civil and follow side-wide rules, this means no insults, personal attacks, slurs, brigading, mass mentioning users or other rude behaviour

Discussing politics or religion is also not allowed on /r/AMD

Please read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/about/rules/) or message the mods for any further clarification
The configuration *IS* the game, tho
I'm sorry to hear that, dude. But this is just life! Nobody knows what hardware combination you put together and they can't test for every possible configuration of components. Physically impossible.

People who don't want to play sysadmin in their free time should allocate system-building and configuration to professionals.

Someone has to spend their time getting this done, and if you don't pay for someone else's time then it's going to be yours. That's just how tech is. I too would love that everything magically configured itself and worked the first time. But that's not possible as long as you have such freedom of choice.

Contrast this to Apple's products where everything is tightly controlled and tested thanks to their vertical integration. I'm staunchly an anti-Apple guy, but in this aspect they deserve credit.
Technically you could just plug and play. But it'd be best to use DDU and reinstall the driver. On AMDs website, select your new GPU, download the installer and then run DDU (it tells you what you need to do - otherwise Google it).
Oh yeah forgot about it. thanks I will edit it.
No I understand that. That wasn't my point. It doesn't explain why the 3070 stutters were nowhere near as bad as the 6800 XT even when it was with a worse CPU
That was windows update over riding the gpu drivers with the generic video drivers. I didn't have that issue , but I remember others talking about it.   


https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-will-not-stop-overriding-my-gpu-driver/d6ebe75b-1503-4912-bb00-ab79867f3835
Amd is bad though. If it wasn't, people like you wouldn't feel the need to jump in and defend it by claiming nonsense like this and downvoting any criticism. Amd sub is the only one that does this. Think why and you'll reach the same conclusion, if you're ever honest with yourself.
It isn't happening after many hours of gameplay, it is only happening when I encounter a new shader that hasn't compiled yet.

on an Nvidia card, shader compilation stutter was a lot less noticeable.
Oh, that sucks. Huh, seems counterintuitive to what I had heard before but clearly people are having issues with it. I wonder if it's just not as prevalent on some cards?
Clean your shaders via amd drivers and open warframe and go directly to open vallis. I bet you will suffer giga heavy stutters 

Not only that you can extract get stutters from fortuna go to cetus and get stutter

So every new shader or effect you load you suffer
[deleted]
W11 is just updates on top of 10 its not a real full new product. And its been out for 3 years.
Launch Apex Legends and let me know how the first 10 minutes are. Make sure to have a fresh driver install.

Same goes for Valorant.
You don't notice* this issue.
I really never experience any kind of stutter with a samsung 980 pro / 4090 / 12700k. Only when first loading into a busy world in vr chat but that's more like a 3 second long slideshow followed by buttery smooth framerate than stutters
You are guessing wrong. It's just a bunch of driver level optimisations they did to try and get better performance for older games.
i thought we were talking about GPUs
I mean the tweak doesn't work at all on RDNA3 (7000 series) so you are SOL if you ever upgrade anyway. 

It's basically just temporarily clutching to old drivers until AMD either trashes them completely or you upgrade, which ever comes first. To me it's a pointless endeavor and we should really be raising hell and awareness to AMD for a fix. They are clearly capable if they fixed it for CS2 ASAP within the same month.
You would be correct for a game running on DX12 or Vulkan without shader pre-caching because those APIs do not do so driver-side. But this issue is specifically with DX11 games. Titles that ran for over a decade without this issue were suddenly broken last year.


I also specifically noted "with the shader cache blown away." No pre-cache to work with. Why would I bother "shill trolling" when I use AMD? My friends use AMD. We just want the issue fixed. What did you think AMD did to fix Counter Strike, Yakuza Like a Dragon, and Halo MCC? Magic? Distributed shaders for them all? I doubt it. CS2 didn't even exist before DXNAVI and disabling it used to fix it for that game.
OSS advocates generally want free software as in free speech, not free beer.
Yep, repeatedly over decades.

It's significantly better now than its ever been, but still shit.
I don't think they think so. Hardcore Intel and Nvidia fans are like apple fans.
The blowing up issue was with the motherboard BIOS and not the CPU itself. Board manufacturers had to correct their BIOS to keep from overvolting the CPU. That's been fixed for the better part of the year.
LOL good one.

But in all seriousness, don't buy an Alienware PC. They're flaming hot garbage with shit cooling and throttling CPUs.
>It's just a couple of hex code changes

Which I shouldn't be doing in the first place.

&#x200B;

Side note: I did them anyway. I know it wasn't that hard but hey. Roll with the punches.

I noticed that I made things worse for myself and reverted the changes because some of the browser stuff were really messed up (for example: Zygote Body website was moving at 1 fps and Google Maps was looking very choppy).

I will wait for another Adrenaline Driver patch in the future.
Because Nvidia doesn't have this issue. Clearly it seems like AMD drivers aren't optimized for some games running DX11.

Waiting 10 minutes for shaders to compile is just ridiculous. That's a long time when think about it. Imagine having to do that in a competitive game.
[removed]
His point is that there's far less need to do this kind of registry editing with Nvidia than AMD GPUs.
What that means is that it's not a shader cache issue, and if other people are NOT experiencing the issue, the issue is not some global driver issue, but an issue specifically with the machine setup including the video card having some hardware defect. Any time there's a problem, the complainers are the main group being vocal. Participating in a circle jerk echo chamber doesn't make the problem AMD's drivers, because this clearly isn't affecting everyone, and it's not the majority. AMD could be just as clueless to the cause, and are depending on bug reports to address it. It doesn't help when complainers don't file bug reports either.

As for the CPUs, we all know Ryzen wasn't a "good" gaming CPU until 3, and Intel has a similar issue where they removed some hardware function to the chipset and increased latency with the 12+ series, and there's videos of people downgrading Intel specifically for this reason. Not that I think any of this is related, unless it's a scheduling bug. Which there are known issues for upgrading a CPU while keeping the same install of windows, like the CPU config being stuck on the old mode on a new CPU.

The problem could also be a Microsoft issue, because Linux doesn't do this, but complainers aren't really interested in finding the real problem so we don't know what's causing it.
First of all, this talk was about Lies of P.  


Secondly, I did try it when I buildt my PC and no, there wasn't. And no, I won't download it again.
What would you like me to do with that informatioN?
3 years.
So? If the changes are minor anyway, all the more reason why anything that works on 11 should work on 10 just as well. The number of years 11 has been out has nothing to do with the functionality of Windows 10. My point was: eveything new is dogshit at launch and you come in and tell us that after a mere 4 years its also useless?
I've done a lot of googling and found nothing official from AMD or any journalism sites on this addition to the driver. Based on my experience with using DXVK, the sudden onset of shader compilation stutters, and the massive boost to performance, I'd truly wager that this is doing exactly like I described. There's no reason for shader stutters if it's still running native code. It must be making changes at the API level to cause this and the performance gains.
The reason DXNAVI exists is to alleviate CPU bottlenecks in pre-DX12 games
People would rather be in denial than raise awareness.
Sorry to hear that.

Different experience here. Last I gamed on Linux was I think 2020 and I had zero issues. That was on Manjaro Linux iirc.
Again, how is AMD the little guy against intel? They even surpassed them in market cap. You are shilling for a megacorp.
Man...the responses you got here feel almost comically out of touch.  

For what it's worth, software/BIOS issues are why I (unfortunately) moved back from AMD to Intel. I've built my own computers for ages, but the Ryzen system was the only one with meaningful issues, and the only time I've ever had to care about BIOS updates.
Im gonna need for you to give regular updates on your pc building. Please like a daily post so i can come home from work every day and go for a smoke and simply have something else to laugh about. I just wish people who are attempting to build their own pcs today had made the attempt 15 to 25 years ago..... oh, the tears would be glorious.
No, 10 minutes is nothing (it is usually less then 2 min but ok) in a grand scheme. Nvidia is irrelevant here as the op has an amd card.
Imagine thinking it sucks.  Imagine getting into PC''s and thinking that having to do configuration yourself sucks.
What registry edits are we talking about?

All I ever had to change, was to enable hybrid graphics on a headless GPU (nvidia P40). But that is not a desktop GPU use-case.
My bad i need sleep 

You can reply that in any modern game with unreal engine overwatch 2 and more always the same behavior

At the end there is a real issue and you should not dilute the problem by just saying i tried that game years ago and worked fine. 

I had more consistent perfomance with my old 960gtx vs my new 6600xt

Ofc i have double fps or more but stutters kills everything

Pigs
[deleted]
An improved product vs a new product.
There is no reason for shader stutters even if it's using something similar to DXVK. DXVK doesn't have any kind of shader stuttering nowadays.
Ok but still, how many games is this really affecting with that kind of impact? Which titles since 2018?
Real honestly. Some people would rather tell me that I'm just dragging AMD down and that "I should buy a new PSU again !!1!1!1". 

But we all know it began with DXNAVI back in 22.5.2 and got a lot better since then, but there are still places where the cracks need to be sealed up. CS2 getting it resolved officially was all the evidence we ever needed that it was real.
I'm a pretty keen gamer, in fairness. More casual gamers can play a lot of titles on Linux, hell, even gaming on Apple is a thing nowadays.

I'm sorry, 65% being Intel doesn't look like market cap.

If you have a more generic statistics than Steam HW Survery please share.

As from last I have seen, AMD only exists on DIY but is non existent in OEM and unicorns on prebuilts and laptops.
In the CPU landscape, Intel is ahead either 2:1 or 3:1.  If you count IOT devices Intel is way ahead.  

In the GPU space NVIDIA is up 7:1 or 8:1.

AMD as a whole beats Intels cap but doesn't even approach NVIDIAs.  

AMD is definitely the little guy but they compete in multiple sectors where competition is limited giving them a significant boost overall.  

I think AMD processors are better overall but their GPUs are typically a generation behind comparatively.  

And there aren't many choices in the CPU sector.  AMD, Intel or ARM based CPUs.  

In the graphics arena it's NVIDIA or AMD.  Intel barely enters the equation.  

So if you support any of these entities, you are shilling for a megacorp.  Push for more entrants into the market.
Same. Had annoying USB issues on X570
I'm laughing my ass off at this thread. And people wonder why some people don't want to bother with PCs. 

Not everyone has an entire evening to do a software engineers job for them.
Stop it, you're upsetting the children.
People have a hard time waiting a few mins for shaders while they will wait an hour for a playstation to install a game they downloaded.

I want a game to run well, if I have to wait a few mins for it to setup the first time or after an update I will, not a big deal. Likely they are running on 10 year old hardware.
And speaking from the replies here, this will probably be his last amd card and his next upgrade will be to nvidia. But then the people in here will be crying again that poor amd doesn’t sell as many cards because „blind shills always buy nvidia“
[removed]
Read the thread? Supposedly the fix for OP's issue is to disable DXNAVI, which is a registry hack
Real issue just not for everyone, there's a difference. And it was months ago, not years. And for who helps if you are being an ass?
I am, you should try it some time.
It does still have it, it's just minimized compared to the early days. Only by using a forked version of DXVK with asynchronous shader compilation can you completely eliminate it.
God of war is the only post-2018 game *I* know of, but there are plenty of games with large modding communities that are also affected like Skyrim and The Witcher 3
AMD denial is strong, I visit the sub because of my former 6700XT and my Ryzen processor (just love reading how AMD is competing mostly) but I have no idea why some people deny issues like these when it's completely obvious that it's on AMD's side.
I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean.

What sorts of issues do you believe are exclusive to "keen gamer[s]" that are not experienced by "casual gamers?"
>I'm sorry, 65% being Intel doesn't look like market cap.

You're talking about market share.

Market cap is a finance term, means the 'effective price' of a company calculated by multiplying shares outstanding by the share price. By that metric AMD is the more valuable company and worth \~30B more than Intel.  


A company with 10 shares going for $1000 a share has a market cap of $10k.  


A company with 1000 shares going for $10 a share has a market cap of $10k.
>As from last I have seen, AMD only exists on DIY but is non existent in OEM and unicorns on prebuilts and laptops.

This is RAPIDLY changing. Looking at new laptops there are several brand new, readily available AMD based laptops on the market. I'm also not talking about the crappy AMD A-series mobile CPUs, there are a ton of laptops with Zen CPUs on the market now. Pre-built desktops are also adopting AMD CPUs much more than previously. 

It helps when there was a lawsuit against Intel when it was found that they were paying off OEM's to only use their CPUs. 

Thankfully that just means more competition in the industry and that's good.
A large majority of pre-built companies do offer AMD options and have since at least a couple years ago when I looked into pre-builts for one of my kids before deciding to just build him one. I've seen quite a few AMD laptops too.
That will change. The amount of people leaving Nvidia because of price gouging will only get worse. Needing to shill out almost 1k above MSRP for a card is just nuts. If they don't control pricing soon AMD is always going to be the better buy price wise. 

You can get AMD's best card for $900 and it will cost 70% more for nvidias to only marginally be better on average
Thats exactly my point. Shilling for a corporation is dumb. Buy the best product available for your budget and your needs. That's all the support a company deserves.
"Software engineers job" damn, its not so complicated .. Back in the day, in mid 90, computer was a big pain in the ass, now you need 3 click on Google for know what you need to do...

C'mon guys, if is too complicated, buy a ps5.
Yeah I don't really get some people, I had worse shader stutters on Nvidia until I enabled unlimited cache, on amd you don't have to do that for eg
Well if waiting two minutes is a deal-breaker for some then sure, they can waste money on nvidia. On which btw I had much worse shaded loading stutter issues but ok.
[removed]
I thought you meant that in a general way, but you were referring to a single issue. My bad.
I have been primarily gaming on Linux for almost 4 years now. I haven't encountered any shader stuttering on DXVK since GPL was implemented in RADV over half a year ago even though I have a pretty weak CPU.

And yes, I did disable Steam's shader precaching.
Yeah I have huge modded builds for those and others. Certainly didn't have an issue even on 3700X, 150 fps in Skyrim with over 1k mods. Plus both games have upscalers.

So, another non-issue.
I've been for more than a year mentioning  all the issues that I've had with AMD (in reddit and techpowerup forums) and it's like, bro this is the third pc, do I buy a whole new pc part by part when with nvidia this doens't happen?

The denial and the blatantly disregarding of the issues is insane and it makes not able to recommend any AMD gpu at all.. as much as nvidia is anticonsumer at least their stuff works.. (unless they botchs their drivers)
I explicitly approved this post because this sub is not, in fact, a river in Egypt.
Maybe he means he's been around since the commander keen days, has done his share of tinkering but is now starting to feel too old for this shit. 

I kinda get that tbh, I'm getting at that age too where I'm starting to get tired of fucking around to get shit working properly. But I still have some fight left in me.
Not many games on Linux compared to Windows, for one.
>Market cap is a finance term, means the 'effective price' of a company calculated by multiplying shares outstanding by the share price.

Ah, sorry about that.

>By that metric AMD is the more valuable company and worth \~30B more than Intel.

Huh, AMD is worth more money than Intel now?

So Intel is the underdog now? Weird how the wind changes.
>This is RAPIDLY changing.

Then I hope it changes fast because last year a friend asked me for help to find a decent gaming laptop that wasn't over $1500.

There was nothing Ryzen on that budget even if we imported from USA.

Edit: it was 1500 with our country taxes and with last year conversion of dollar as it needed to be 1000 or less if buying from Amazon.
Reason I said unicorn. They exists if you search but you find more horses.

Or TL from metaphor, for the same price with an Intel CPU you get something better or cheaper.
Reason my planned build has a 7900XTX, even if I have 4080 as a fallback in case stock is out in my country as I'm not dealing with international RMA.
I wouldn't say it is dumb.  I have things id rather spend my time on but it does foster some debate and provides feedback for improvement.  I wish we had a few more options so we could have more of a 'X company does this so much better' forcing Y company to experiment and innovate and vice versa.
The point of having to disable DXNAVI through registry editing on a per-game basis manually being a bit of an issue seems to have flown over your head. Some other guy in this thread has also pointed out that some games are only playable with SAM enabled, and some are completely unplayable with SAM enabled.

This kind of manual tweaking is generally not needed with an Nvidia GPU.
Just hit version 100 of a 30 second edit
Anybody else ever make it to the century club of revisions ?
Oh you must be the person my former client hired. Good luck!
99 once, we let that client go shortly after
138 is my record. It was a non-scripted testimonial spot for a bank with a cast of 10. There was another partner company involved so with 2 clients and an agency who all liked options got us to that magical number.
I hope you got paid extra for versions 4 - 100.
"please stop with your passive aggressive naming conventions." OMG IS THIS THE FINAL 80?
I edited a trailer that was V36A thru M, thirteen different music alts. 

Every tweak had to be replicated across all 13 alts. 
 
Let me tell you, I’ll take a v100 any day over that shit. 
Why?
V_100_2_29_2024
Yes. I had 107 revisions on a 6 second sting. I reported the AP to his manager.
135 here. For Super Bowl. Granted it was a trailer style edit working from a more long-form video to direct people to go see. The long-form we had nailed in maybe 12 versions ironically.
The highest was V12 and the funny insane part was that we returned to back to V1 with some tweaks, lol.
What creative agency are you working with? 😂
[STOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZzlPGnKdU&ab_channel=CrackerJack06)
In commercials it would be incredibly uncommon to not have 100 variations of the first edit. It just depends on if you dupe your sequence every time a small change is made.
Its when the versions start getting A,B,C suffixes when you know you are deep in it.
I wouldn’t even be mad at that point. Just impressed with their incompetence.
i need your contact details cause it seems you provide free work :)
I think v56 was my max…
I got 99 problems and they're all one client.
Thoughts & Prayers.
So obnoxious. Clearly an example of a client who is flailing around.
I routinely get up to 30-40 versions of promo spots these days. I just start pushing buttons after about 20 versions 😆 I can’t imagine 100+
Kinda cheating but I think I might have hit over 300. 

The caveat being it was 6 maybe 8 individual edits, but each had to be delivered in 16x9, 4x5, 1x1 & 9x16. Each "edit" had copy which kept on changing, then later down the line the copy started changing between the aspect ratios too. 

Absolute nightmare, and I later found out that the client decided not to use anything as they hated how everything had been captured, dim low-key lighting as opposed to the high-key commercial look.
Weird flex.
The most I’ve done I had someone do is 12. He hated me but he was phoning it in and realized a few weeks after. 

The most I’ve done is 30 - because the client was changing verbage & text nonstop. I’ve never been closer to quitting everything.

100 is absolutely insane
i’ll pray for you
I would've quit by 20
Who has the budget for 100 versions?!
I'll do one no problem, provided it doesn't counter what was agreed-upon.  If you want seconds, you better come with something that I failed on.  If I have to do a third, I'll question my life choices.  5? 10?  No way.  Unless you're paying a lot PER HOUR.  In that case I'll wash your car while I'm at it.
How does this even happen?
lmfao
At least you have work....
Are you working for Intuit?
But how many laps? Like how many times in that 100 have you presented virtually the same edit as v1 and had someone say "now that's feeling much better"
Never! I've been pretty lucky, even back in my agency days I never went higher than like version 8.

Now that I'm freelance I typically charge hourly, so I dream of 100 revisios. Gimme those billables!
Version 100? no. Usually by that time my versioning becomes something like Clientname\_30SecondSpot\_v35\_final\_final\_final\_Ifuckinghatethisclient\_rev3\_final\_final.mov

Good on you for maintaining consistency.
![gif](giphy|YmQLj2KxaNz58g7Ofg)
What kind of nutjob sends you back to the editing bay 100 times for a 30-second spot? No, what I want to know more is, what you’ve been taken to task for. Like, are they catching things in the editing that they want to de-emphasize, and others that they want stronger? Are they too vague to put into words, but they have you over a barrel, so you feel compelled to dig in again and grind out another edit?
V30 is my max now….
Yikes! I thought V12 was a lot
I hit 50 versions of a short documentary once. I think that's my personal record.
Never broke 3 digits but I feel your pain & am sending you final approval vibes.
It’s when I see half these comments like “that’s insane” and “my max is 12” that I question my sanity for going into trailers
That sounds fun as hell.
Wow, think low teens was my highest.
Oof, never been that high, but I can feel that frustration in my bone just reading that.

There have been a few …_final_v014_final_copy06»s innmy time
Not so much with an edit - but I've seen version 100+ for the schedule quite a few times.
I work with one creative that routinely hits between V30 and V40 before presenting to the account team. It's always funny to overhear the account manager saying the version number under his breath in a snarky manner, "version 36 huh?"

By the time we do client comments we get into the 50s and 60s. I'm not positive, but I bet if you include rounds of music options I've been really close to 100. Not sure I've passed it, but been close.

Then I have clients that barely break 4 versions...pretty stark contrast.
I personally haven’t but my friend who cut a Spider-Man trailer finished it on V.63rev which was really around version 100+
Good God, man.  My condolences.
Just wait for the cutdown. 😂
Are you working in-house or why/how is this even a thing?

I cap it at a few revisions and start charging for subsequent revisions. I've never come close to 100.
99 edits none of these ~~ain't~~ are the 1 HIT ME

edit: mangling of the reference / english at once
Not even close honestly. Maybe somewhere in the 40s.
Sheesh
Sounds like the client and producers didn’t quite know what they had in mind or a well developed plan and punted it for you to figure out. That or they like to leave it to you alone and then nitpick afterwards.

I know sitting in with the client or producers can suck, but I think it can mitigate these issues. Less back and forth.
Finished at v117 Rev on a trailer.
Oh man, hope you're not on a flat fee haha
suggestion...using 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc. you could still be on version 1.001 ! or maybe version 2.01
I’m currently on 46 of a BTS edit
You don't have a post manager or producer to lay the hammer down with "let's wrap this up!"

Still have fond memories of my old one ripping into the client when I was doing a toy ad 2 years back and the revisions made us go 2 weeks past deadline and it was affecting other projects in the pipeline.
So yes, but I at a job where I worked with a lot of animation/motion graphics and we versioned up every time we had a tiny change internally. Copy change, new 3D comp, legal changes, etc. So there where one or two spots where those type of little changes were coupled with a complicated edit (tons of unboarded live action elements) and really added up. Probaly only a dozen actual "edit" changes in terms of actual pacing/content, though. Just subtle iterations that got that version number up.
I Hope you’re hourly
As long as it’s billable hours at full rate, I say keep the revisions coming.
I don't do shoots I work from stock so once in a blue moon if I can sense a client might be like that I bail on it. Its a really tough call to make. But I have minimal losses because I don't have a crew. Had a guy come back with 17 change requests right off the bat once. And they were all so finickity. And it was a terrible project. I just thought this is gonna be one of those and I cut my losses. I had a guy once that was requesting so many changes and each change was like can you move the subtitles a couple of frames this way and that way. We went through every subtitle line and with 100 percent precision it had to line up with the syllable. I said to the guy I said you know I don't think anyones ever going to notice this. And he sighed because his business partner was making him do it. So he's giving me all these change requests and he's sharing in my pain. We had a mutual understanding of it. He's like i'm really sorry about this but can we just move the word "and" just a frame earlier. For the 20th time or what ever lol. He's basically just trying to appease his OCD business partner who's going through it frame frame with a tooth comb. Ridiculous.
This says everything.
Yikes. Were there revisions as little as "have that cut appear 5 frames later". New version.

And then, "no no, bring it back to the way it was". New version.

That sort of thing? I mean, how do you get to 138?!
I wonder how much time went into exporting. Or maybe one shouldn't dwell too much on that...
FINAL_rev2_USE_THIS_ONE_v4 😂
In my department people will frequently hide the "V" number or not increase it when duping as to avoid displaying higher version numbers when going through approvals.  I get it, but I don't like it.
"And can we get that tomorrow?"
V1 alt 

V1 alt a 

V1 alt why? 

V1 alt stop  

V1 alt go home already
Why not
There’s not supposed to be over half as many revisions as there are frames in the video! I’ll admit I get more irritated about excessive revisions than I should; but damn I don’t know how I would handle that. I’d be losing my mind at 20.
Ahh yes validation tea is cold, but it's good tea
Love when that happens. But not really
Exactly. A v1 for the client could easily be a v10 in my sequences.
\^This

Lololol
Gonna put “Killed my Kj5” on my headstone.
In a surprise coincidence I think 56 is my max too.
Naw, we've been there. Post should be tagged "support"
Same.
…you can’t be doing agency or scripted work. Right?
I’ve had clients that would seemingly pick out one thing they wanted to change at a time, ask for a revision, then find something else. Like they would just stop as soon as they saw something they wanted changed and then continue watching instead of asking for all of their changes at once. Couple that with clients that have *multiple* people that seemingly have the authority to ask for revisions, sometimes contradicting each other, and those revisions could run up quick. 

Often it was pretty obvious some people would ask for something to be changed just so it looks like they’re contributing. I’ve even been asked to “shorten it by half a frame” once.

I’ve never had as many revisions as OP, but I can imagine how shit like this would happen lol
Either too many cooks or someone on top is deeply incompetent.
People who are highly critical yet wildly non-specific, and unable to communicate what they want.
Layers of approval. Supervisors, producers, directors, distribution company, streaming company, all with numerous members and priorities. Oh yeah, and the most powerful approver, lawyers.
Ver 2: You must the person my former client hired. Good Chuck!
It wasn’t anything too nitpicky about length. It was more about crafting an unscripted story in 30 seconds where 10 people all talk about the same features. Everything was like dominos. Swap person A with person B saying a line, of wait now we need more diversity, oh we love Person C saying this line but we need to now connect them with Person D and so on and so on. The best was when one of the clients removed a talent all together and trying to rebuild the edits with the people left.
There is a reason I date my timelines/project files/exports with y/m/d, avoids that mess
ProjectName_02-28-23_v26_ISwearToGodIfYouDontUseThisOne_v666
Idk, I’m paid by the project, not by the hour. I would never do 100 revisions on anything. Wtf.
My revisions came in so thick and fast that I could barely render a new example before the next change.

Tbf with this guy I did it deliberately. We'd worked together before on some other stuff and I could tell he was delusional so I left him to his own devices, lost a day in edit and fed that back to his boss so he could sort him out. To be fair it worked and that producer is way better now overall.
Yeah no client would ever get to 100 revisions if they're paying for it so I just assumed it's a flat fee.
Generally I can’t imagine going for a flat fee unless we’d already agreed upon how many days/weeks/etc. I’d be working on the project
Also many don't
“Half a frame” is literally the anus of asks
I've been a part of that entire list and still can't comprehend how any cut gets this many revisions!
V16 still super rough cut
Holy f that's brutal. By version 20 you probably already know the whole thing by heart and the way it SHOULD be edited. And by version 50 you probably don't even care anymore. 

Anyways this one is for my nightmares...thanks for sharing!
How do you do when you do different versions on the same day? Like 20240229v1 or? Just curious cause I do the same with the project but not with exports. I always prefer just v1, v2, etc. if one is radically different I go A_v1, B_v1. But would love to hear other people’s thoughts on this
Well yeah that makes sense. I'm paid by the day so if they wanna make 1000 versions let it rain. Most versions I've ever done would be in the 90s
And thats why you try to get paid more for revisions.
[deleted]
I just worked on a superbowl spot that got to over 250 versions. We're all getting day rates over here and they paid for it.
I give 1, sometimes 2, revisions for the quoted price and charges apply for anything after that. Maybe OP doesn’t charge until 99?
Some of us are staff editors. The boss gets unlimited revisions. 

Not as bad as flat fee, but I’d much prefer to move on to a new project.
[deleted]
“This is a great start.  I just have a few thoughts”
I am happy to share! Oh and one last thing that helped inflate the numbers is when we did get a revision we would have to present 4-8 different options on how to address that revision.
Oh I do a time stamp as well! Like today I called my timeline “Pilot_Name_Of_Show_24_2_29_11.30_AM”. This works really well cause, with the use of AM/PM it still remains alphabetical!

I use the same format for exports, and once we get to close to picture lock I start including picture lock in the name.
Yeah I just do numbers and then letters if things start branching; but I don't know that I could handle more than two layers of branching.  There must be enterprise version control for this stuff.
I name same-day versions as A, B, C, etc.

Client_Project_240301_A

It's very rare for me to have more than 4-5 of them per day.
I do [YYYY_MM_DD]_[TITLE]_[VERSIONNUMBER] regardless of what day I export it.

e.g. "2024_03_01_HatersPodcastEp21_v01"

Then if I make a new version same day it's "2024_03_01_HatersPodcastEp21_v02"

And if I make a new version the next day it's

"2024_03_02_HatersPodcastEp21_v03"

EDIT: Btw, reddit formatting messes up my file name at the top of my comment. Examples are accurate though
I use letters.  I'm not in advertising, so I don't know if it's possible to run out!

So today is march 1st, so my seqs will be 0301a, 0301b, 0301c, etc.
[deleted]
I mean, if I’m paid by the hour, I don’t care either way. I just happen to never work like that
In that case I need contact details to your clients :D
superbowl spot is an entirely different category
Two is my standard thing.
Yeah
Version 127:

"This is looking great! I'm so excited! Now we can show it to the board and ask for their notes."
This is a great start. Now i'm going to take a big shit all over your work.
That… that hurts my brain. Ow.
24 hour time makes so much sense. Imagine using 24 hour time and someone saying nah, we’re going to make the day two 12 hour segments and we’ll flip over at the middle of the day. Also AM and PM change an hour away from the flip, because screw you. Sorry, soap box topic.
Hourly with minimum hrs is better
Initial deliverable scoped at a set price, revisions quoted hourly. I recommend trying that sometime, you might like it! It makes revisions much more enjoyable, haha.
Board: “I don’t love the music”
No I totally agree, it’s just I have to convert from 24 hour to 12 hour, so it’s just not worth it for me.
naw it’s better for them to buy your whole day. some days you’ll get paid a full rate to swap out a graphic.
[deleted]
I don’t have that option
Can we maybe see the beginning of 16 along with the ending of 64...Oh, and maybe replace the actor in the middle - we can do that with AI right?
It's also less likely to be intuitive for clients. But it would be more straightforward. Thank you for humoring me.
That’s what hourly with minimum hrs is. You get paid based on 8hrs whether you work the full 8 or 1hr, but you also get overtime
OT starts after 8, oftentimes it’s just built into the day rates, but you are still getting OT after 8. At least in California and NY https://dol.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/03/overtime-frequently-asked-questions_0.pdf
O i see what you mean. That’s not bad at all. Assistants have this in a way. Half day up to 5hrs, full 10 after that.

Don’t think you’ll get an 8 hr day or OT in commercials though.
Most editors I know have this, myself included. The only half days I ever allow is having to log on for a meeting or review on a weekend, doesn’t matter if it’s only 15m, we bill for 4hrs.
new.reddit.com is now broken for me, Firefox, Desktop
I have been using [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) to browse reddit as it had quite a nice dark mode. This afternoon the URL started giving me the redesign of reddit that makes it look like budget facebook with its foul design. It's particularly heinous on an UW monitor as the center part of the site no longer scales horizontally and is set at a capped width with only the 2 columns expanding in width when the window is extended horizontally. What's more is that I use an OLED monitor so the "dark theme" which uses off-black colors will inevitably cause burn-in so I would prefer to go back to my proper dark theme in the earlier version.

I am using firefox, is there any way to return to the older [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) or am I sore outta luck?

EDIT: The solution is posted by u/missing-comma in the comments below: [https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1f1s8ya/comment/lk1s940/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1f1s8ya/comment/lk1s940/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I can verify that this solution worked for me as of today, 08/26/2024.
As [admins have answered OP's question](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1f1s8ya/newredditcom_is_now_broken_for_me_firefox_desktop/lk1deq5/) and further comments are all either unhelpful or otherwise break community rules, this post is now locked.
[Anyone who thinks this is good needs to be fired.](https://imgur.com/a/cRi2ZNH)
yep i just got forced off of the old [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) design too... i knew it was coming but it still sucks. as someone who started using the site with that design, i cant decide whether i hate newer reddit or old reddit more
SOLUTION: Create a new subreddit. This will make you a moderator and let you keep using the new old UI.  

> For moderators, you will still have access to new.reddit.com via your mod accounts until all mod tools have been moved to the latest web platform.

You can just create anything, like, your username_reddit_theme.

P.S.: /u/Django117 Your post is locked now. But yes, it should. It is a temporary solution, though.
Noooooo... gief back [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) !!!

The New UI is less readable and less compact. It makes it an effort to track channels, flairs, and read many messages.  
The [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) ui should be optional at least.
God this UI is awful.

Modern UI design means cluttered and colorful for no reason, right?
😭 look what they did to my boy

BRING BACK [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com)
reddit admins doing everything in their power to get me to stop using their website

i should be thanking them
this new UI is disgusting.... using chrome on desktop... 

I hate old reddit to... but I feel like I will be forced to use it because this newest crap is terrible.
Came here to make this post but you beat me to the punch. The new layout is awful. No idea who would prefer it. Hope we hear something.
this blowwwws
This new design is just awful. It takes longer to load and each post with an attachment loads the pictures. Following to see if there is anything that can be done....
Looks like this was the final push I needed to leave the site. I can't stand this new design and now it's being forced. Later all, it's only down from here.
Yeah just noticed this myself,I hate this new UI so much and dont want to even bother with reddit because of it
This is actually convenient for me. It's the last push I need to kick my Reddit addiction for good. No way I'm gonna be as active having to look at that atrocity. When it rolls out for me I'm a free man lol
Reddit, this new layout is awful on desktop and will make me use the site less! Please don't pull [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) without better viewing options for your new format. It just doesn't work on desktop.
Just had this happen to me too, this sucks, the newest layout is horrible.
absolutely atrocious and ugly UI. what is this grey color scheme? It's like they're forcing a mobile layout to web
Uuuggghhhh

I could tolerate it. But the main thing I hate is the commenting

Quotes and editing are all different. In "new" reddit, you could highlight part of someone's comment and reply and it's automatically quoted. Now you have to actually copy it and put it in a quote section. And all the other mark-up options are hidden, limited, and broken as well. Maybe I'll just emulate Android on my PC and hack a copy of BaconReader so at least my experience won't be absolutely busted

Or maybe it's time to finally cut ties with Reddit for once. This is insufferable. Don't replace something with an "upgrade" that lacks half the features of what you're replacing. This is a downgrade. God damn
Yep. I was on new.reddit less than an hour ago and now it's gone.

RIP reddit.
Same, I HATE this new new design, I don't like the old reddit cause no dark mode. The "new" reddit was the better version. Give me that back :(
Same here… r/enshittification at its best.
[deleted]
[deleted]
ugh..  i hate it.   not just the scaling, but my laptop is old and this new version is \_soooo\_ slow compared to the old-new one.    Is there a way to get rid of the side bar at least? maybe that would help wit the comment area being so small, width-wise.
Yea, I ain't using reddit with this new terrible UI.
yeah it's forcing me into it as well, I'm on Opera GX. I really don't like this new design and liked the [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) one
Same thing, hoping there's a solution
Just a reminder to everyone here that [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com) still works and is still as legible as it has always been.
Same for me, just happened today.

At least old.reddit still works.... for now.
There is no way to get back to it.  It has been removed and your time in the queue to get removed has arrived
Literally. Been using reddit just as that happened, and was surprised to see the subreddit colored annoying green, making everything so much harder to read
Just happened to me too. This is the worst...
Wait.... It just switched back for me..?
Same here.  It sucks that they now have [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) the same as [www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com) on desktop browsers.  I'm hoping a programmer somewhere can change it back to what is was.  If not I will have to stop using Reddit as much.
It looks terrible and posts load slower.   At least give us to option to customize the layout.  I don't the columns, especially the one on the left side.
Please I hate it!!!! Half the options are gone from the profile section too. The home page is the worst, the comment section just bearable.

I don't what to use the bright old old Reddit.
i think i just saw the last of new.reddit too. About a half hour ago.  it' gone. 😭
I hate it but I will get used to it over time BUT I NEED THE DAMN SIDEBAR GONE WHNE LOOKING AT POSTS!
just happened to me too. I could honestly give two shits about the layout but I can't stand having to sort by new every time I load a sub.
Yep.. just changed for me aswell.Why are they even pushing for such an obviously inferior design.
you have to do some work but this can get the new cruddy reddit design look like new.reddit should look like.  again.. YOU HAVE TO SET IT UP!!  it won't do it automatically out of the box.  you have to hide elements and stuff.   i've offered it up multiple times and get back "it didn't do anything" because those people seemed to think it would do all the work for you..  it's a powerful suite of customizations but you have to figure out what you want and don't want. so you have to set it up...

"www.reddit" always gives me an error a red ribbon. I just found the "new.reddit" and It's working for me lol. Thank you!
Hey there! Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ehmgmr/next_steps_for_newredditcom/) where we announced that new Reddit would no longer be supported. I'm sorry.
I was originally like this, but honestly, I like the new design now. It's a different story that sometimes stuff just randomly refuses to load or errors out - so feels less stable but in terms of aesthetics you get used to it. Zooming out a bit can help
[deleted]
[deleted]
It doesn't even expand the content in the middle, it just scales into blank space holy crap this is so terrible.
Agree 100%. I do work in web development and anyone who would push out an update so hated by many users would be looking at losing their job at my place.
I am going to figure out how to buy points just so I can give this an award.
SOLUTION: Just create any new subreddit. This will make you a moderator and allow you to keep the old UI.
Wait really? So it will apply to all subreddits even in that scenario?
It's actually foul to use. The threads constantly change color and oscillate between this disgusting dark green and pukey-gray.
[deleted]
[deleted]
this new one in particular looks like someone just found out about the curved boxes option in photoshop and decided to use it on everything
it means "copy whatever the most popular social media ap is doing right now"
[deleted]
They are working hard for it
It reeks of mobile development with the restrictions placed on it. it's built for vertical setups with the side-bars automatically collapsing into hamburger menus on the sides when you shrink the window. It's actually garbage.
Hey cool. I just hit a bug where I can't even type in the comment box for certain posts. This is a quality upgrade..
Same! They must have just pushed it out at 12:00 EST.
Yep it sucks badly, makes me wanna leave the site asap
There simply has to be a way to banish the right column and therefore widen the main one.
Permanently.  
Apparently they announced it almost a month ago, and only now fully rolled it out.
The thing is that the middle portion is constrained. It only expands to a maximum width then all remaining width is given to the sidebar on the right and expanded hamburger menu on the left. It's a mobile website being forced on a desktop site.
[deleted]
So it'll be next on the chopping block?
and looks like crap
Welp, time to drastically reduce my reddit time.
GIVE IT TO ME. Maybe they are undoing it and it was a mistake? One can only hope..
Yeah, even though I selected NEW in Default Community Sort in settings it still shows Hot when I load a sub. 🙄
Compact is still dogshit compared to the old look.
Just tried this, the add-on isn't fixing the problem. I'm assuming this one just injects new at the front of each reddit URL, but if the website itself is now giving us the default reddit view even when using [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) we are screwed.
Cancel that. I just got an eror xD
it's like you guys want us to stop using reddit
Literally everyone hates it. -\_-
That is really disappointing to see. This new UI of reddit is a worse experience for all users. 

* The color scheme is gross and incompatible with OLED screens which are becoming increasingly common. Nor is there anyway to change the color scheme to an OLED compatible one.
* The page does not scale horizontally and leaves [massive blank spaces](https://i.imgur.com/anl4c26.png) between different parts of the UI
   * The center part of the website is where the content is, yet that part does not scale horizontally. 
* The lack of an actually compressed front page akin to what was in v2 of [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) originally was dense with information and content whereas now you can only see 2-3 threads at once while it massive privileges images to be blown up. 
   * This issue is shared by the official reddit app.

It is one thing to block third party apps with the API, as was done to Apollo, but now this awful, dysfunctional design is applied to the desktop website as well. This is a terrible decision and reminds me of many of diggs' failings.
bring back new.reddit, this new UI is unusable garbage
forcing us into old reddit is not the answer... please restore new.reddit, not this crap reddit being forced onto us
And it was one of the most horrible decisions in the history of social media.
Why would you guys push this garbage forward?
"modern" Reddit is very laggy / slow, not nearly as responsive not to mention ui looks terrible.
This new design is awful, it literally hurts my eye sight, the previous one didnt. Stop with this lunacy and revert back to previous UI.
Hey there! Please revert this horrid decision, it's amazingly awful and nobody likes it. I'm sorry.
You had a product with a certain level of quality. In that post you declared that you will not support that product anymore and that you will provide a lesser quality product. The problem is not that you abandoned the old product, but that the new product is of such lower quality that it increases a lot the effort that thousands of people have to make to access information. Some ideas may be: to allow to hide the left bar and regain that space for the threads list, to allow users to choose to not show the image in the message list, to make the threads cards more compact, so that more threads and comments can be listed in a single page, to allow users to click the flair to select all messages with that flair even when in the New and other sort options...
Shame.
please resupport it, the new new reddit UI is awful and cluttered. why is there a setting for old reddit but not new old reddit??
At least, let us customize the GUI since the new one is horrible for desktop, for example add the option to remove the left and right columns, the center column where there are messages is too much compressed and small.
I'm embarrassed for whoever came up with this design and pushed it on us, because it sucks.
This is stupid. Bring back new.reddit. Whatever this new layout is, it's bad web accessibility, it's cluttered, it's just bad design overall and people have been telling you this for months. Idk why you hate your users so much.
Why dont you listen to feedback?  At the very LEAST, make the unbearable sidebar able to be hidden
Subreddit takes a full minute to completely load, and that is before I try to scroll the page down at which point it goes on to load the new content at the same leisure pace. This post takes 15 seconds. It's not my connection, new.reddit.com opened instantly. It's just that everything is dynamically loaded with scripts and takes a lot of time to process. In the network inspector I see like 50 scripts loading before the page even shows any meaningful content.

Also it's pretty much impossible to read long comment chains anymore because every comment beyond the first 3 or 4 is hidden behind a click that may or may not take me to another page, and I will have to unwrap all the comments again one by one when I go back to find the point where I was reading, which gets old really fast.

tl;dr this UI is unusable, please get the old one back and fire whoever thought it was a good idea because they're clearly a net loss to the company. You might save up front on servers and development with the new platform, but it defeats the purpose when you lose users as the result.
[deleted]
But noone fixes the issues with a new Web platform. Why do we have to use an early access platform?
* Can't they at least change the font and colour?
* I also still have a massive blank space on the home page.
* The history button is gone from profile options.
* In compact mode the images are too small, in card mode the images are massive.

There are lots of subs which doesn't support this! I can't sort these subs with flares. This is totally broken.
Forcing a new new UI is one thing, but this one is still so broken. You cannot even access all your subs past a certain limit on the homepage. Is the new one in a beta where all this feedback is collected, or just here?
Adding insult to injury is that no matter your default sort in preferences, the system always loads subreddits with HOT.  And it appears to load comments as BEST as well...  /bugs shows that this has been going on for a LONG time.  :(
https://old.reddit.com it is then, I guess...
ill be using reddit so little with this crap UI
Bro, you spammed your fix on a ton of posts, people are gonna dislike that. Also, the fix didn't work for me nor many other people.

EDIT: And then the user decides to be even more immature and block me for calling out his nonsense. Downvote this child into oblivion everyone.
Jesus, imagine messing up the UI scaling on one of the most popular devices on the planet.
switch to old.reddit.com and install Reddit enhancement suite to get night mode back

Also for Chrome and firefox based browsers, there's an extension called Dark Reader that will give you dark mode on every website, even if they don't support it.

It also has per-site settings and exceptions so you can have the Internet just the way you want it
I'm also a dev, although I'm more backend, and this would be reverted within a few hours if it was pushed at my company. Additionally there would be an inquiry into the QA/UAT of this and the devs involved.
lol please don’t, treat yourself to a snack and I’ll enjoy a strangers good vibes.
True. It works as you said. So there must be some kind of state in a cookie that still allows to use the [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) version. Or maybe it is just a caching/referrer glitch.
I clicked on the bell opened messages and then clicked back and got the old version back.
But your solution doesnt do anything... Its a redirect extension, and new.reddit looks like normal reddit now. It was good idea before, but not right now man
Add "Add as much sensory overload as possible to turn people into average tiktok children with an attention span of 5 seconds to make as much profit and numbers as possible" on top
Doesn't work, it's just redirecting to new.reddit and the whole issue is that it's deprecated now.
[deleted]
well, now i can't even get threads to fully load...  using old.reddit to send this msg..  then I guess I'll get some work done this afternoon for a change
That extension does nothing dude.
Not likely.  The *developers* at Reddit's headquarters apparently use old.reddit exclusively.
Some subs are defaulting to the awful new design but the new.reddit link is working for most... fingers crossed...
I just noticed the damned subreddit themes are on again too. Sigh. Time to stay off reddit for a while.
Hi! Thank you for that feedback! And that screenshot is very helpful as well! 

I will share this feedback with the team that is in charge of this product. I appreciate you taking the time to write all of this out.
…so far.
Hey! Thanks for that feedback! I'll pass that along to the team!
Hi! That shouldn't be happening. What is your device and OS?
Thanks for that link. It is a big improvement on the one we've just been switched to.
Yeah, i guess such small indie team like Reddit couldn’t afford to test their new UI before releasing it.
[https://new.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ehmgmr/next\_steps\_for\_newredditcom/](https://new.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1ehmgmr/next_steps_for_newredditcom/)
Maybe they should take a look at the dumpster fire that is new reddit lol.
The feedback will lead to nothing, everyhing that is wrong with the new UI has already been told again and again since it was introduced and the design wasn't changed or improved at all since.
Ironically, this is the pre-2018 version of the UI.
Welp, that's foul.
That it is.
Old reddit has everything tiny and bare, newest reddit makes everything big for ipad babies and doesn't even let you see if the post was made by a bot.
Middle reddit was literally the best of both worlds.
Does anyone know how this happened? I turned on my mac mini and there’s so many chic fil a widgets
please help i’m confused
Is you computer accessible by anyone else
OP, it’ll take about 5 hours before you get a serious answer. Folks love their bad jokes for points. 

I’d wait till the morning and read comments.

Honest turn off your Mac mini for bout 30 min…. Turn off ur iPhone 📱 also 10 sec
Then turn on ur Mac mini first (alone) leave ur iPhone for later - hopefully this would reset the issue.   If not then do a NVRAM reset and that should do it… after that u can turn on ur iPhone
Clearly it’s divine punishment for eating at that homophobic slop hole.

feed it a chicken sandwich, its hungry
Get chick-fil-a’d

Why wouldn’t you want to make ordering easier?
Probably just a cow wanting you to eat mor chikin.

Have you considered getting started on your order for Chick-fil-a?
It’s an advertising campaign that chick-fil-a is doing currently
Well “let’s get started” I guess
I've got no idea, but it's very funny.
Must. Get chick fel a.

I think you computer is asking you to get some fried chicken, cant see any other reason
Check your Mac's Settings. Go to General > Sharing. Make sure that Remote Login, Remote Management, Remote Application Scripting, and Screen Sharing are off. If these have been on, someone (likely an advertiser) has added these widgets.
chicken flu?
Chicken pox?
What purpose can a chick fil a widget serve anyway? You really ordering enough to need a widget?
I think it’s a good sign to order some chick fil a
This feels like a shitpost lmao
It's giving 2000s pc virus
Just a bunch of cows
It looks like an iPhone widget behaving badly. Actually, I'd blame macOS first then the widget. My guess is OP has the Chik fil A app on their iPhone and hasn't set up any favorite for ordering yet.
Tomorrow’s Sunday, all the widgets will be closed in the morning
its alright, i think the jokes are funny! Someone probably just went on my mac that really likes chic fil a LOL
Good morning! You reading this yet?

It does. If you eat there you’re directly funneling money to anti-gay and conversion therapy groups. If you eat there you’re not a supporter and homophobic.
Yep and if you eat there so are you. You are directly funding antigay groups and conversion therapy.

First PC Build - went full AMD
Specs: 

Mobo: MSI MAG X670E Tomahawk WIFI 

CPU: Ryzen 7800x3d 

GPU: AMD Radeon 6950xt 

Storage: WD SN850X 2TB 

RAM: Corsair Vengeance 64GB DDR5 6000 

PSU: MSI MPG A1000G (1000W) 

Case: Dynamic Evo XL 

CPU Cooler: NZXT Kraken Elite 360 

Case fans: Lian Li Uni Fan SL Infinity (6x 140mm & 5x 120mm)


First ever PC build! There's some cable management cleanup I can do, but pretty happy with how everything turned out!
Needs more fans.
Stop the cap, ur case ain't amd
Bruh instead of all those fans you could’ve easily went with the 7900XT.

But typing this comment made me realize the beauty of pc building comes from the fact that everyone can build their pc by their desires and what’s important for them, so you do you OP and have fun with it. Sure looks nice.
[deleted]
When I see 6950xt:⬆️⬆️⬆️
Gotta be honest it's kind of crazy you went for top tier components on everything and then settled on a 6950XT for your GPU.
Fans alone cost almost as much as the GPU. Oof.
Looks awesome, nice job. One comment, if you want extra performance and don’t mind having empty slots, two sticks of 32GB each will give you the same capacity and higher bandwidth and better stability.
god damn your top mounts can handle up to 3 140mm fans.  Why go with 120?
You could have toned down the case and fans to get a 7000 series gpu
Disregard the "too many fans" bullshit, this generation of both intel and amd builds  benefit massively from extreme fan setups, i have something similar and still can't believe the ammount of heat coming out of that case when in moderate heavy use, those guys with negative airflow  fan setups with all on exhaust 'because they hate the look of the back of the fans' will be the first ones with chip failure from heat degradation and so on , you have a nice clean build with appropriate airflow setup for the spec!
All aboard fan city, prepare for take off 😋😋🤫🤫
Looks awesome! May you have many years of enjoyment!
This looks so sick but where the hell is the psu..? Is it like shoved in the back panel? Does it have to be a smaller form factor psu to fit in this case?
For a second I thought the rad was your GPU and was very confused lol. Beautiful build.
Are the rams running the same speed?
W
Visually - stunning.
Damn bro! Nice build!!!
Love that GPU. So sexy.
Congratulations looks great
Boring, this same build is posted 3 times a day
Wow the turbulence inside the case must be crazy.
Lmao so many fans. To me money wasted but you like what you like
"went all AMD"  


[https://shop-ca-en.amd.com/amd-wraith-prism-thermal-solution/](https://shop-ca-en.amd.com/amd-wraith-prism-thermal-solution/)
How many L-connect hubs did it take to connect all the fans and Strimer and what not?
Awesome for 1st build looks clean job well done congrats.
I love the infinity fans damn they look good
nice!

what are you gonna play first?
More fans more problems, good luck finding one with fault when it starts making dying noises 😂
When you turn it on does it sound like you’re on the tarmac and the jet is powering up?

Jokes aside, very nice looking build.
Damn if only that 6950xt where white it'd be even better
black mobo and GPU on a white PC build? trash, utterly disgusting, you beast
Whats the name of the cables?
I just downsized from that case into 4000d, same gpu.  Decided to unrgb.  Looks good!
If you put all the fans to exhaust and unplug the CPU cooler you’ll create a good enough vacuum for fusion.
Those xfx cards look so good.
Nice try but we can all see it's a fish tank
Nice build thanks for posting the specs. That’s a lot of $ on fans.. also not a big fan of the angular shapes, personal taste I guess. How much of a squeeze was fitting the psu and all the wiring in the back panel?
Think if one can spend all the fan and case money on a better gpu
Did you actually get 6000 MHz out of your RAM? I have the same ones, but scared of messing up the timings. So, I have the default memory trained version at 4800 MHz
we got the same gpu its pretty good
How much total?
Is that an AMD desk?
Hey we have the same gpu from the same brand :)
It's beautiful. 64GB will serve you well
Will this many fans even do improve ventilation
You can tell its your first PC build because you spent a lot of money on unnecessary flare :)
Did you go full AMD or full FANS?
Why 64 GB of RAM? What are you planning on doing with your PC?
Ayyy looking good :D also switched to full amd like a week ago
Your case looks way too big for the rest of your components.
Need a video of how it sounds running before it flies away
I have that same card, and it looks huge in my case, but in that monster it looks tiny lol
Wish you luck mate with the xfx 6950xt mine lasted 3 months and in for RMA. I went a brought a 4070ti today to replace it.
To my surprise there was another xfx card in rma I seen the guy told me it's a 7800xt and it's only 1 month old in for repair. I would never buy Radeon or XFX again. I hope you have  better luck than me mate honestly 👊🏻
Where did you get the gpu brace?
How do you even power these fans
My friend built nearly the same pc but it takes very long to start. We installed the same mb, ram , cpu, gpu but it feels like something is odd cause it feels slow.

We activated the faster ram settings in bios. Any ideas?
Nice I got the same GPU but „only“ a 5800X3D
My favorite GPU desing 😍
Where is the per l power supply?
I got the same GPU in my white build. I painted the shroud then mounted it vertically. Looks great
[removed]
Very Similar to my PC that I built. 7800X3D cpu, msi mag x670e, 7900xtx, 990 pro 4tb, same ram but mine is 2 x 16g, dark power 13 1000w, lian li o11 evo dynamic xl black, evga clcx 360 AIO, I went 11 x lian li Uni SL V2 120mm for uniformity. Got an Alienware 34" 3440 x 1440 QD OLED to add the cherry on top.
Very nice build. People here  complaining you can get better for less money, but some people also want a good looking pc (not me but I understand). I think you did great! We've seen a lot of builds with wrong fan orientation, wrong aio placements etc. This looks very good.
Can I get some fans to cool them fans?
Come to PAPA!
He must be RiCH
It looks very clean! Nice job, even for the first time. Also could be build by a professional PC builder.

You cable management looks also very clean and is very good. The only thing I would try is to lift up the GPU cables so they are not laying on your bottom fans.

Great PC you've built there👍!
Where is the PSU ?
Very clean.... Love the display on the CPU/heatsink with the temp gauges, but Where's the PSU hidden?
With that setup, you have a lot more gaming power than a PS5. GREAT AMD build, OP!
I think i made your case whiter😖🤤
How much was that AIO
Your set up looks great, the fans aesthetic is quite unique, what are the temps you getting? I switched to AMD from INTEL on my recent laptop and realize that intel is maybe overrated and one day my pc build might also be all AMD. :D
420 aio would look much better
Broo low fan need incurs wind
whats the point in having so many fans?
nice, an air conditioner
Very nice.   Will it float over desk if u turn every fan all the way up????   No….keep adding more fans ✅😎👀👀
YOU GET A FAN, YOU GET A FAN, EVERYONE GETS A FAN
Nice build. That case has adjustable motherboard height right? I'd personally go up a notch to ease the tension on the AIO tube's
I have the same exact GPU! I just got it, how are you liking it? Despite minor driver issues it works great and runs cool for me
Wish I went with the xfx 6950xt instead of the stock Radeon one. My shit gets so hot and loud it’s obnoxious sometimes.
Now you can play Dota 2 at 4k
Looks good, but I'd flip the side fan panel so you can see the sides of those fans. They just look a bit... off, set back like that when all the others are more prominent.
[deleted]
Why not Nvidia GPU? 7800x3D is great btw
7800x3d has bad latency i believe.
It has bad single core perf. but is good bang for the buck in gaming.
where da ef is the PSU? Also I had that card its big... and it looks small in that case.
Where did you get the power leads from?
Ya its crazy that this is the norms with how kids build these days. 

You can’t tell me there isn’t diminishing returns by 5 or 6 fans.
No glass, just fans.
Could do a push pull and add 3 more
Hopefully he has the exhaust and intake properly setup
No, needs more support for the video card.
THiS
Damn, you're right
His cooler clearly says NZXT
Oh you're 100% correct, but this build gets me all the performance I need at 2K so I went this route. 


I mean the AIO was also completely unnecessary too, but it's just the decisions you make with your budget and what you want to spend it on
Oh you're 100% right and I thought about it, but I decided to snag the 6950xt when it was $630 and then spend a bit more for aesthetics. At 2K the 6950xt gets me all the performance I'll need for a while.
Settled? it's literally the best AMD card from the last generation, I would hardly consider that "settling." It's still a great GPU
Although I agree with you there ,but it's still a pretty solid spec for the pc so , it's all right I guess .
Yeah learned that too late, can't get the full XMP performance out of this setup as it is. I'll probably switch it out sometime down the road, but I'm fine with it for now
Why is that if you don't mind me asking? Just did a refresh of my pc (14900k, Asus z790-a 2 gaming MB, 2x 16 gb Corsair dominator titanium ram ddr5 7000mhz)

I was thinking of filling the remaining 2 slots since when i wanted to fill those on my previous build years ago they we're getting rare and very expensive, i want to avoid that this time.
They wanted a Kraken Elite specifically I'm guessing (I bought it after finding out it's the only AIO that has the specific screen functionality I wanted). Kraken Elite doesn't have a 420mm version.

There is the Corsair H170i Elite LCD XT or whatever it's called, but then you'd have to deal with iCUE.
I thought only 120mm were compatible with the radiator
I mean I get that you don't need that many fans but I did it for aesthetics too, not just function which people will have their own opinions on too. I was okay allocating more of my budget for the fans. 


I also have the fan curve set up so it's pretty quiet honestly.

But thanks I appreciate it! I'm happy with how it turned out
thanks!
Yep it's sits behind the panel that the motherboard attaches to. And nope it's a normal sized PSU. The case is just massive
I second this question. My motherboard (B650 Aorus Elite AX) can't run 4 sticks at 6000 MHz stable, and based on what the sales person told me, it seems this problem is common across all of AM5 (max with 4 dimms is like 5200 MHz?). But maybe that was only for the specific kit I originally had bundled with the motherboard and RAM which might have been more problematic due to being dual rank. I suppose if OP has single rank sticks they'd be fine?
Thanks!
Thanks!
Just 2, one for all the fans and the other for the Strimers
Thanks!!
CS2 and BG3!
Dude I know, same with a white mothorboard. But it's close enough
Lian Li Strimer cables.
I'll probably do something similar in the future, no rgb more minimal case. But for my first build decided to go full rgb
Yeah the fans weren't cheap but I look that look awesome, but obviously everyone has their own preferences. 

It really wasn't too bad squeezing everything in the back panel, the case is big enough to pretty easily for everything including 2 fan / AIO controllers and a USB header splitter
Nope, didn't realize using all 4 ram slots was less stable than just using 2 on DDR5. So I dont have mine all the way at 6000 either
Yep it more than gets the job done. At 2K it handles everything I've thrown at it so far with ease
Lol I knew the case was going to be but, but didn't realize it was going to be this big
Hardware failures happen to any brand. I bought a RTX 2080 on release and had it fail in under a week. To disavow a brand just on a random failure is just ignorance unless it has a real design flaw.
It's just off Amazon. If you search something like "GPU support brace" you should see it as one of the first suggestions
I bet that looks sick. Do you notice any difference on thermals with the vertical mount?

Yeah dude that sounds like a beast of a build especially with the monitor to get the most out of it
Thanks I appreciate it! I totally get where they are coming from too, but like you said, some people make the decision to allocate more of their budget to aesthetics and that's what I did.
PSU is in the back behind the panel where the motherboard is attached. The case is super wide so there enough room for it
Thanks!!
Not cheap at $299. There are the same or better CPU cooler options for much cheaper but I wanted the lcd screen
My temps are overall pretty solid imo, while gaming CPU stays below 70°C (usually hovers around 60° give or take) and GPU usually sits around 65°C when gaming.

So far in my limited experience AMD is going well for me!
After like 4 or 5 fans, it's because it looks good imo
I'm loving it! Haven't had any problems at all with it after making sure all the driver and everything are up to date. 

Crushes anything I've thrown at it in 2K so far.

Congrats on the new gpu! Did you go xfx too?
That's a really good suggestion. I didn't even know you could flip it and bring the fans up front more until after I put everything together.
I can only speak to my limited experience with my GPU but I haven't experienced any driver crashes
The equivalent of more fans flex back in the day was multiple dvd/cd drives

https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fb4ltafcsv78a1.jpg
There's 100% diminishing returns, did it for aesthetics which you can argue is a waste but that's the decision I made going in
Spends 1/4 the price of a computer on RGB and fans. I'll never get it. Could've gone basic and bought a 7900xtx and made a world of difference.
I sit in the high 50s Celsius under full load or playing Tarkov. There is SOME benefit to having extra fans and they cost $25 a piece
I mean 1 exhaust fan is probably enough, but having at least 3 if not 4 intake fans helps keep your dust filters from getting clogged, makes sure that dust filters work as designed, and reduces noise when the fans are new enough. Additionally because GPUs are so big airflow kinda gets separated, so minimum at *least* one case intake needs to be dedicated to each partition created by the GPU.

So yeah, I'd probably want 5 fans in every build (or rather 6 including the CPU fan[s], but excluding PSU fan).
No tires, just gas
You should think longer term though, I would highly consider a 850w psu, less aesthtics and a more powerful gpu. Plus you won't even care what your computer looks like in a few months. Regardless, congrats on the first build.
it’s easy to clown on people who sacrifice performance for aesthetics but I think if you’re gonna have this huge ass computer on your desk for everybody to see why not make it sick as hell. I love this build
To keep it simple, the memory controller in the CPU can't handle it. 

Intel is more stable, but not at 7000MHz. Fastest I've seen is 4x 6000MHz I think. AMD almost always fails.

Hoping there will be dummy sticks like for DDR4 in the future.
It looks like that to me.
I put the maximum 9 fans in my case and did it for aesthetics as well but mostly because I could run them all slower and as such quieter. Love the build man, good work
I looked up the case and I see how they do it now. It’s almost like am optical illusion. Beautiful build man!
It's a Zen4 problem. The memory controller is in the CPU. Therfor this won't be resolved until the next iteration of CPUs
Can always turn off RGBs, so you have the option. Love the look of all off but RAM and that strimer cable on.
Only with Radeon cards mate never had to return a new Nvidia card from my knowledge as I said good luck to all whom but Radeon I won't buy there crap again 
Nope, my temps actually got a bit better since of my intake fans is dumping directly into the GPU heatsink now (there is about 3mm of clearance between the fan and my GPU lol). 

I went with the cooler master Vertical mount V3. Highly recommend it, very adjustable.
Oh nice temps! That's great to hear its going well , I think AMD is a much better option these days given the price hikes of intel and nvidia products and AMD is actually giving them good competition, that generally benefits the consumer.
ah, it doesnt have a function like preventing overclocking heat
Yes and I love the look of it. Got a great deal on a practically brand new one (gave the guy my old 3070 plus $200) and it was such a worthy upgrade
Yeah, thankfully, those fans are easier to flip since it's just a single cable attached directly to the fan.
The nostalgia is so good
Hey, that kind of setup was actually awesome back in the day! 

I could take my friend's CD, pop it in one drive, a blank disc in the other, and create a copy of it in one go without having to rip the entire disc to my storage. It was actually quite practical. 

I'm not sure it's the same "excess for the sake of excess" as modern day 11-fan case setups like we see above from OP.
I still have 2 in my oversized cooler master chunk of metal with metal mesh for the fans 💪
Yeah but I used all those drives!
I got 2 reader drives back in 2008 🤣😝
This OG was still using arrow keys instead of WSAD brotherhood, some serious memories right there.
It looks good but I’m still old school. I like the smallest build possible that still gets the job done. These new age cases are insanely large.
Curious how where you intake and exhaust? I'm guessing intake from the top/bottom and exhaust out the back ?
I support aesthetics in software. If that was the reason, you have my full support. 

I really don’t undestand the reason of “optimization vs beauty” in the IT industry.
GPU Hotspot?
Yeah and I mean maybe I'll regret some of these decisions in a year's time, but time will tell. 

Thanks though
Thanks man!
That's awesome. Down the road when I get the itch to change something I'll probably go that route too. It looks so awesome
That's a great deal, this thing a beast. More than enough power for years to come and one of the best looking gpus imo. I only wish it came in white lol
Yeah, I did 'on the fly' recording of CDs too. 

Brings back memories!
Yeah that's totally fair. I was between a more minimalist looking Fractal North case with no AIO and just a few fans etc. and this one, and just decided to go big and overboard because why not
It's been like that since 2015 onwards. My Fractal Design Define R6 is a large full tower case that can fit **six** 3.5" drives while still being able to mount 360mm rad on top. I bought it in 2018 but it's released back in 2017.
Intake from the side and bottom, exhaust from the back and top
Don't worry about regrets.  You'll be happier if you just play your video games and move on.
No worries, my first computer was a fraction of what you have (I'm 37) so for the first one, I think you did very well. I have pretty much my dream pc now and very quickly it becomes the new normal. Game pass has been awesome, playing Dead Space 2023 edition and Lies of P.
Real lmao, I don’t like how you can’t change the LED colors either but it’s rly not a big deal
Yeah when the 6080 comes out, it and the AMD equivalent might be 370+ mm long the way gpus have gone recently. I don't honestly think they will, but I also wouldn't be surprised lol
Either way, very nice build!
Cool, looks good. I had a kraken on my last build years ago. Went with a beastly CPU fan cooler this time
True but I'd go all white anyway so it's close enough for my needs lol
My First PC Build (again)
I already posted this on r/watercooling but I actually meant to post it here first but it was a Monday so…

Only difference is that I added more photos this time, including when it was green. (XSPC ‘yellow’)

It’s got a 7700x and 7900xt

And I’ve gotten half a million comments about it being piss urine haha funny already just fyi.

Not everyone believes it is my first build but oh well. I used a 2019 acer predator Helios 300 (1660ti) before this (est 2019) and a MacBook Pro 2015 before that (which I still use) and a 2008 MacBook Pro before that. That is all.

And yea the coolant can be changed if I choose to so don’t think the yellow is a permanent fixture although I likely won’t change it anyways.

(Finished 9/23 btw)
Very clean urine cooled system
Piss is stored in the PC
your first build huh?
These 'first' builds are getting a bit out of hand.
R Kelly approves
This urinal be looking funny
PC = piss computer
Despite the color of the liquid, this might be the coolest system I’ve seen in a while…and I can’t stand lit up systems. I usually want them well wired but boring.
It looks like dehydration piss inside a toilet. Very well thought out.
Gamer girl piss pc unlocked
Also FAQ:

What case?: NV7

What distro?: Bykski NV7 distro plus the pump it can come with

But of course the most frequent question was ‘why did you piss in your PC?’
Looks really cool! I actually like the yellow. People on here are mean.
If there was some purple or some other accent color to go with the yellow it would look great, like a cyberpunk-ish theme... But the yellow on white just looks like urine after a long dehydrated day of drinking energy drinks.
It's all good, my piss glows green too.

To all their own, everyone has different preferences and priorities. Me personally, I would have dumped all that extra money in hardware improvements. Again, that's just me though as I think a 7800x3d and 7900XTX was definitely in the budget here. Actually come to think of the cost of waterblocks and custom loops, I think a 4090 was in the budget probably.
These comments are really taking the piss out of you OP.

On a real note, super clean and i like the yellow. Haters gonna hate.
"First build" or "first custom loop". Still waiting for the answer of why pee. Its a clean af build but sorry it reminds me of a urinal with that color fluid and the white.
Piss-Build
I'm getting pissed looking at this.
If I had to name that build I'd call it 'Yellow Snow'
It looks great, even with the yellow coolant. I've never been a fan of white PCs, even from the beige era. But yours looks really neat. 

Unfortunately nobody makes white monitors to match your build
What fans are those? Despite the criticism, I love the color combo yellow/white, looks really clean and hot damn water cooling and tubing looks wild!
[removed]
Great job urine business baby!
Damn did you mean for it to look like piss? It's a shame cause it looks like a really good build and the piss colour takes away from that
Ur in trouble
This would be so sick without the pee coolant. Literally any other color dude, why 😂
yellow looks awesome, i dont really fancy lights in PC and whatnot, anyway impressive for a first build!
Piss master!
If that is what your piss looks like then you really should give the Mountain Dew a rest and drink some water
Wow.... piss cooled pc 🤣🤣🤣
Very interesting
Absolutely cracking build and looks amazing!! I actually think the yellow against the white is a good look and I congratulate you OP on what is a very clean,smart and outstanding first build!! You obviously are good at this and you should take pride in a really nice build, hope it brings you hours of entertainment 👌💯👏👏👏
First build and you use urine for liquid cool? Seems legit first build
it looks so beautiful
NICE!
Beautiful
Take a shot for every comment about piss/urinal. Personally my first thought was, this seems sus for a first build because it looks so clean. My 2nd damn this must have been expensive lol.

I'm a cheapskate and I reused my 2012 thermaltake chassis for the last custom build among some other things like my laptops old HDD as well as several new parts. Saved a few hundred dollars.
What kind of thermals are you getting on your GPU? I sorta kinda wanna go water-cooled on my card (7900XT), don't need to, runs cool at 100% load and barely audible fan, but still wanna screw around with a water block.
"The Personal computer is a series of piss filled tubes" - Al Gore I think.
best beer cooling system ever
All that and not even top of the line components. 
Form over function I guess.
Exquisite, technical, professional
While it does look very good and very clean I do like it.

Why do you not have a proper 'flow'  of the water loop?

I mean everything is just plumbed into the distro block.

There is no hot to cold flow.

Is it not ment to be   :

Pump/res   into 1st radiaror  then onto gpu next cpu then 2nd rad finally  back to pump/res

So you have actual hot to cold flow.
Seems OTT considering the specs but hey looks like you did a good job atleast
Fuck that looks so good 👍
Awesome build. I wouldn't recommend running anything overly demanding on it though, or your cooling system may start developing stones.
I think the yellow looks awesome!
Fill it up when your dehydrated for a darker yellow
Lol, I'm sorry your gonna think about the reddit gang all calling it piss after you worked so long and hard on this magnificent machine..

&#x200B;

Luckily it looks awesome anyway and the color is changeable since it's just the liquid.
I think I said it on the original post, but that is very good looking build, clean AF (not my choice for coolant, but that's irrelevant, drain and change if/when you want anyway)...

Your bends and lines look great; it's hella difficult to get those runs parallel and horizontal/vertical, and just one of them slightly out ruins the whole aesthetic IMO... But yours is perfect!  Well done on one very difficult first time build 👍😁👍
I didn't believe it was a first build until I saw the cables. The classic stuff and jam.
Ahh, piss boy is back.

Looks great though man. It’s a great set up and if you’re happy then that’s what matters.
As someone with yellow coolant, I feel your pain. Everyone calls it piss. People have always said I'm weird for yellow being my favorite color, I still have yellow coolant. Nice build, enjoy it.
Looks absolutely incredible, people often tell others what to do, in your case you could've went simplistic but instead you created something that I can tell meant a lot and I can respect that. As long as you Keep it up you'll be straight, it's really not even difficult tbh. My first pc was an open loop as well and people made it seem like I was going to fck it up but it turns out I didn't even struggle, it's easy to maintain for me. They were def correct in terms of using that money for better specs, that's a whole other argument that I agreed on.
I’ve wanted to do a hard line custom loop for years! If you have a moment and can drop some knowledge or links to content that helped you get this done, that would be dope! I’d love to know how long it took and if it was challenging, frustrating, or just took a little practice and you were a master at it!
Probably gonna get buried in the comment, but FANTASTIC job OP. 
Don't listen to the gatekeepers that think you need to spend 5-6k on parts before you build a custom loop. The parts list makes for an awesome pc regardless, and your routing looks great, nice straight lines, etc. Honestly, congrats.

Like most, I'm not a huge fan of the color, but it's not my PC. If you really want to embrace the bathroom theme, though, you should totally add a pink urinal cake.

Even with the color, it looks rad. All the whites match, and it's better than my pc, so congrats!
Noooo. I saw this over on the water subreddit. Dude the piss gave it its charm.
Lovely pc but could you not afford propper coolant? Why did you piss in the pc?
Piss PC
In the next post, the fluid will be a creamy white, and we'll all be like, WTF?
Fuck OP and his urinal box.

Just reading the title "my first pc build", just brought back the nostalgia of actually building a PC as a teen with no knowledge and very outside help. The struggle was real in the Nokia 3300 looking cases
Looks like my pee after I take my vitamins.

Beyond that though, the hardline tubing is excellent. Well done with all the bends. Great case choice as well, that hardline cooling deserves to be shown off, you should be proud of your work.

I think clear coolant would probably look better, would be such a clean looking build.
Idc what the “pissy” comments say. This is a beautiful build. This is the o11 case correct? Congrats 👌 I’ve been thinking about going custom water loop next gen of cpu.
this is the exact shade of yellow
Looks cool!

My first thought was what a color choice for the water cooling, but it actually looks nice.

I just hope you don't use that HDD for storing (latest new) games. SSDs perform better.
Very clean and well put together pc very impressive did you bend all the tubing yourself?
I feel piss poor
Therapist: the piss computer can't hurt you

The piss pc:
a work of art tbh, i'll hire you to build me a pc once im rich
The power of P I S S
I just never post anything I'm invested into on reddit because people are shitty and just make fun of it in any way they can.

The build looks great OP, don't let the assholes in the comments get you down.
Very good looking build. 
Did you bend the tubes yourself? It's far from easy to do this as a first build.

Where did you find all the gear?
This looks amazing
WOW, realy good use of lightning. Nice😍
why change from green? green looked cool. i guess if youre into piss fair enough
Barring the piss jokes, I do really like it. 

That said there's a 0% chance this is your first build haha
Yellow looks cool man ignore the haters.
So like... is it your own in there? Did you collect it all at once or did it take several samples?
Sexy
HUC, Human Orine Cooling system.
I genuinely felt a little ill looking at these pictures, which really took me by surprise.

To each their own of course, but man, that color really triggered some primal reaction in my brain.
If there's anything this sub has taught you is that piss is stored in the balls
Pissmaster liked your post
Did you use cooking oil for the liquid?
Pee-C
Why piss yellow?
PissC
Why did you piss in the loop? Does it transfer heat better?😆 How are the temps?
“Mom I pissed in the loop!”
Your PC needs to drink more water.
-rep for not using actual piss
Don't worry OP we're all just taking the piss. Nice build for sure.
gamer girl pee
"Not everyone believes it is my first build"

_No one_ believes it is your first build 😆
Y piss?
Hummmm piss
Beer or pee?
The mechanical hard drive in this build feels so wrong
always wondered if piss was a good coolant.
Pee tubes!
I would be pissed, pun intended
Another boring distro build, meh.
Something is pissing me off about this pc
OP ok I will pay you to build mine 😁 that's a compliment and yes no peeing.....
Had you done blue I'd say it'd look a lot better
Very nice clean build, thanks for sharing.


But if it glows like that you should get tested...
This looks insane, well done!!

What is the case?
Piss Master would be proud
All that and a crappy little monitor, that's black?
I hate how much I actually like the piss coloring. I'm going to have to use it when I get the funds to get a display worthy case...
I bet this thing is opened up and worked on more than it is actually used. And 'when' it's used it's probably nothing big. At this point this computer is just a dust collecting piece of decor
[removed]
Need to know some temps dawg
Really cool looking but I don't like the fluid colour AT ALL lol but at the end it's not my computer so you do you ! Enjoy
It looks very clean! Good job! I love the pipe bends. You thought out every aspect of your loop and it looks like it flows well. Enjoy your build!
Why did you choose yellow?
Worlds first urine-cooled system. No need for weewee breaks during gaming.
You must love yellow, good for you for expressing that. Not my choice but it ain’t my rig either. Not a water cooled guy either because Murphy’s Law likes to use me as an example, with that being said its a cool clean set up.
So that's where all the unsold Bud Light went
This has "Bought my first car! A Bigatti Chiron!!! =D" vibes.

I'm mad jelly that thing looks dope as fuck, great job! Hard pipe WC probably the toughest project you could've picked for a 1st build tho XD
I personally would have used normal coolant, but to each their own.
Okay this might seem dumb, I've never built a liquid cooling build before. Do you have to unhook the pipes to get access to the RAM? or is there some easier way
You spend a million dollars on water cooling custom loop. Meanwhile u settle on lower cpu and gpu. My 7900xtx and i7 13700k ON AIR COOLING say hi .
I think it looks awesome! I think the yellow and white looks really good. The pic with the rest of your setup is cool too. I almost feel like the yellow would look cooler with a different color wall though...haha

Are you mechanically inclined/build other stuff? I can't imagine myself doing something like this

Don't you feel like the water cooling is a bit oh a waste on your more mid-high range cpu and gpu? Or, if its a money thing and you just enjoyed making this build that's cool, I just assumed with something so intricate you spent a lot anyway.
This PC runs on Mt. DEWWWWW
It looks great, but why you are ruining it with this hdd!?
Piss easy first build?! Doubt.
Imho i like more "bundled up" Tubes. Example: Oh nice RGB Ram, can´t see shit because Tubes crossing it
Why choose this color combination? When you were adding the liquid there’s no way you didn’t think it would look like urine. Not hating on the build but it’s an interesting choice to go with.
Very nice.

You need to drink more water though.
You don’t see often yellow coolant, looks good
Looks great.
All this work for a 7700x and 7900xt?  Holy shit this is like putting a Honda civic engine in a Ferrari. Lmao
The piss build! Legendary.
Wow amazing build my man 👍

But yeah, piss goes in the toilet
Insane build bro. The bends look great the color coolant is interesting to say but lighting can be used to make it pop. You must of watch/read massive amount of content to prep for this. Kudos!
Sir, urine is not a good conductor of heat.
Piss build pics build
Jarate !
Have u tried hydrating it?
U forgot its kidneys
awesome build. very cool
Ngl I hate the yellow and it's way too bright to be that close to your monitor.
I mean, it’s called „pee see“ for a reason, right?
Ah so YOU are the guy who bought all of the olive oil in my area.
Its neat, i like it.

Urine yellow wouldnt be my first choice but who am i to judge
I like the yellow. Honestly. People here are just jealous.
Y'all need to drink more water I guess
clean build, what is that wallpaper on slide 3? is it just some new win 11 wallpaper?
The piss puter
You need to drink more water

Damn, piss cooled PC build, nice
Damn, that’s cool.
Loop of Henle.
This really puts the P in PC.
You can make your build whatever color you want man, urine control.
why would u use sunflower oil as coolant?
Looks awesome.
That is what I call a perfect build
I love the colours and the build, well done bro!
Piss conduit
Love that urilic theme
Urine coloured....
Looking good!
I assume that by now you've figured out that that was not the best shade of yellow to use. Otherwise, nice.
Looks so clean! As a Mediterranean I approve this, looks like olive oil to me
pisscooled
Seems pretty advanced for a first build. You did this yourself?
I like the yellow this shit is fucking awesome looking. Damn and it’s clean af.
Pissmaster 64
I can believe it is your first build since you have a 1TB WD mechanical drive in there. In this day and age there is no excuse to not have all SSD’s in a build of this caliber. 

The Gatorade Green is cool.
You should of just bought an aquarium. Useless build unless you plan on doing massive overclocking.
Amazing job!

be proud of yourself!
Looks fantastic, all piss jokes aside.
The sniper gaming pc
this is a true PC (piss computer)
Dude could have skipped the water cooling and bought an rtx 4090...
Nice Work
Not too bad for a beginner’s first PC build but you will get there eventually.

Note: Sarcasm has been utilized in this post for the ever present tone deaf.
The Piss Tower
PeeCee
Why yellow liquid? Sick build but I feel like a diff color liquid would have made it pop much more smoothly. Even clear or light blue. For an all white build.
Nice
It looking like urine isn't an issue till it ages and becomes cloudy, you'll need to STD-check your loop.

Looks sweet BTW, I want a similar look but with orange liquid instead.
Bro what kinda piss do u have that can cool ur entire setup
Beautiful build . The black fittings bring out the details on this build . Excellent job for being your first build !!! Bravo!!!
Nice looking rig.
Absolutely stunning dude! Absolutely love it!
Very clean.

Just curious why you went with a urine colored liquid or tubing? You must have realized that while building or filling.
Runs on piss lol jkjk I'm sure you were aiming for gold.
Pee pee cooled 🤤
What kbm?
What's the case?
personally I love pissing in my water-cooling system
OOoo! I have all the parts for a hardline setup, still haven't bothered and am also scared to put it together xD I have some questions I always wonder about..

- How hard it to bend the tubing how you wanted? 
- Did it take a lot of practice to get your bends coming out acceptably on a consistent basis?
- Was figuring out where the lengths and where to put the bends pretty hard? Seems like just using a ruler or something wouldn't quite be enough to get the tubing ending up right where you want it...
That's a first build? Be right back just wondering what 2 liters of coolant tastes like.
What case is this? Bealtiful pc btw
Ah noice. A golden showers build.
That better be beer in there
We got piss-cooled PC's before GTA VI
"bro, you're never going to believe what of a cool as urinal I pissed in today."
Just wow, I feel this should be at the MoMa or smth
really clean and neat ! what a pretty setup . i always wanted to have a gaming pc setup for 11 years now and suddenly this post is making me sad thinking that i've never got one 🥹 anyway really nice one 🔥!
Looking so wonderful
Did you nickname is yellow snow?
I wonder if it would look any better if you threw a UV light in there so the yellow glows and looks less piss-y.
Looks like piss lol

Change it to literally any other color and it'll be better
PEE. SEE?
i see a lot of pee in your pee-see heehee
First of all gj on the build! Very nice and clean looking, must have taken ages to assemble.. not to my taste as I like darker colors but you're the one who's going to be looking at it so ignore all the comments regarding the coolant color imo.

Also what's that clock on your desk? I'm really curious!
Ah yes.   


The ***PEE C***
What cooler is that? Nice build.
Piss is not sterile man. Better use something else.
The pissC
This build pisses me off!
The urinal pc op
Fricken awesome
What Temps you get with that urine? And what species you using?
I really like this, except the piss. I’ve got the same case and also going for a white build
What case is this?
Your first pee PC build 😂
I won't lie, I don't like the liquid color, and we all know why. But damn, the rest of the setup is impressively clean. Great job OP !
So you had no coolant at hand and really needed to use the toilet huh?
Piss cumputor :3
A) the yellow on white looks awesome
B) you are full of shit if you say this is a first build you did yourself
Is it your piss ?
You look a little dehydrated.
Haha pee pee poo poo.
Jarate cooling system
I like yellow, and we have the same desk.

Welcome to the ultra cool master race. 😎
Please refer to the comment I left on r/watercooling
I mean it looks nice and expensive, but why pay so much for the look and then „only“ a 7700X and 7900XT?
Love it, but it'll be more clean if you used wireless peripherals.
my guy starts does hard to easy
Very nice work dude! Looks amazing. What desk is that?
Did you upset it? It looks pissed off.
That is one crazy watercooled build, don’t think I’d have had the patience. Makes me think of jolly ranchers candy. Does the psu sit above the mobo on this case?
Yellow and the white look awesome in my opinion
I love that it's piss  cooled and the same white colour as a toilet.
Looks like a gamer piss jug
Why you got the piss looking liquid for the loop?
First PC build with hard tube water cooling? Wow, I that's pretty gutsy.
Looked like someone pissed in your water reservoir
Am I seeing this correctly, that it goes through one radiator, then into the reservoir, pump, another radiator, and then GPU and CPU right after another? Wouldn't it be smarter to have it go component>rad>component>rad, so that the heat from one doesn't affect the other?

Also, how exactly does that drainage pipe work? Is this a special kind of pump or reservoir that has a third connector specifically for draining?

Also, why is there this tube at the very top of the reservoir? Isn't it going in from the rad and then coming out at the bottom?

Thanks for any help, just trying to learn more
Looks like piss.
Your first build this week 🤣👍
that's a cool build, congrats bro
Well you don’t have to get pissy about it
Urine for a treat, that looks great
yeah but does it run crysis?????
Mom- where's my urine sample...
Degen son- I just made a $1000 mom🤗
I see you went with piss for the coolant interesting choice. Lol
Looks great! I wish I had the money rn to go watercooling for my mini itx. It runs on air rn but it gets toasty. Looks great regardless!
Piss
That looks like at thisrty boii! What happens after it drinks all the water?
Yeah im building also my first PC build after 15 years of building my first PC builds builds. Builds
Yellow snow build. Nice
PC stands for Piss Circulator?
Nice toilet
Not a fan of the yellow but white cases are just ungh 🤤❤️
[That's piiiisssss](https://youtube.com/shorts/MbcJbfV1u80?si=Qf2FQbRqMUhMyTaP)
PeeC, nice.
Like the golden, blue, white mixt of collors! As well, liquid cooled, so no noise. Very cool!
Am I the only one who can smell that???
First build my ass

Beautiful 😍
This really makes the 1650TI (mobile to make it worse) look like crap.

Nice choice of case. Clean build. Very sexual.

Thanks for sharing.
Hardcore first build. I've been building PCs for 20 years and still haven't built a true liquid cooled system. Just didn't want to deal with maintenance hassle
1TB HDD why?
Your dehydrated my sir
I have a tiny AIO push / pull for the same CPU and don’t hit thermal limits lol.. you never will
How much water do you drink to make it still yellow and also still fill a pc
r/pissloop
Put the Roca/Fossil/Gala logo hahahaha
Maybe add some uv lights so it doesn't look like piss? Seriously, why'd you pick clear yellow?
Were you pissed at the comments last time you posted?
#P I S S S S S
the more I see the piss rig, the more it grows on me.
PC is stored in the balls
Does it filter your piss into drinkable water?
Whats the phone stand, very clean!
Yo that’s a sick build. Imma have to remember to piss in my water cooled… or I mean piss cooled set up next time. Thanks for the pro tip. Does it have to be fresh piss or can it be old piss that I collect prior to building the setup?
You can use cooking oil as a coolant?
piss coolant
I think people are being a little bit judemental. It's fine transposing yourself into OP's position and think that he is a bit of a lunatic for custom hard looping their first pc, or that the parts are not technically the absolute best on the market rn, but if they enjoys it for their use case so be it.

But the battleststion imo looks really clean and neat, and that's all I personally care for in posts like these.
Op went into a public bathroom and was like: "hell yeah, gaming time".
The cable management in that PC is godly 👌
The first thing that popped up in mind was SouthPark Nintendo 64 piss snowballs... that's not a good first impression but it does take me back...
Why not flip the rads around and avoid all those long tube runs? It would look a lot cleaner.
Nice piss you got there
I Would love to try water cooling but I will be moving soon and I putting 3k in the hands of TSA
First build, full water cooling system? Yeah okay
Pissmaster would be proud
Gorgeous build
Neat, I disagree on the pisoar (urinals) theme.
Piss Computer
The forbidden lemonade
Wow that loop looks cool as heck
Pissy master race
🧢
DAMNNN A CUSTOM LOOP? WITH A 7900XT?? AND A 7700X?!? AND URINE?!??!!!?!?!!11??!?!  
SOLID 9/10
That’s a nice Pee C
That's a beautiful case. Nice build brother.
Print a full height cardboard copy of the sniper from TF2 and put it right next to it

It'll be amazing
Very nice looking..  Why rad uptop?  Nvr got that as heat raises.. I get nowadays not a big deal specially if u water call gpu. Heck my 360mm 4copper pipe rad is old and my case has it attached at front door of case so it use ambient temp. Age of these two components umm 8800gtx was gpu king ( had 8800gts with dd full water copper block) last time used rad was with fx 9590.  With everyone's nice designs I feel I need to update those parts :)
I came here to make a urine joke, thinking I was original.
How long did it take you to build? Also, how long just for the cooling system?
u/Cowslayer9 - you should be insanely proud, my friend. That is a remarkably good first time build. Exceptional cable management, although yellow wouldn't have been my choice but to each their own. 

Mine was literally a clump of cables with zip tied sata drives to the clump. It looked horrifying but to my defense, I was only 14. 

Well done though bro, truly.
Zajebiste :)
I would have said the second.
what keyboard is that?
Even if it looks like pineapple juice I like it reminds of piss.i do like it tho
What's the case you used?
It appears all fans are exhausting.

Do you have an intake anywhere?

If you have negative pressure in your case, it will suck air in from every little hole it can, which can bring unwanted dust and other small particles in to coat your components.

If you can turn your bottom fans into an intake it would do you a lot of good long term.

Then adjust fan speeds until you have neutral or positive pressure inside your case.

(If those bottom fans are reverse fans, ignore me)
How expensive is it to make a water-cooling loop like this one?
Hmmm The Gold3n Shower, nice
Bro needed to clean out the Piss drawer
nice build bro, love the custom cooling look  
stating mine in a few days, using an AIO tho, 7800xt and a i9 7900.  
good stuff
Is the pc compatible with the toilet?
"the coolant can be changed if I choose"  


I am under the impression that whether you choose to or not, it will still /need/ to be changed. I.E. , it is not a matter of choice.
That looks nice but if the fans had rgb, it would be better combined with the yellow tubes
Nice Pee C
Super cool
It would be cool if you had it have different lights like a rainbow but not those colors fully, what I'm trying to get at is that it looks very nice with the colors
LTT new video after seeing this post

"can your PC be cooled by PISS?!"
Love the build, but I'd have tried to use a super dark blue fluid that was uv reactive and use blacklights so it gets that "tron" vibe.
How much did this cost ?
Nice
u/Cowslayer9 what was the cost of your build
Wow looks good!
Pissee(through) master race
is this the same as a piss closet? Drawer?
All that work and you go with HDD?🤨
What an amazingly beautiful way of burning some money.

I didn't thought it's a pee until I've read comments. Hey people: Do hydrate more and you won't be think of urine when you see a yellow fluid.
Way to clean to be the 1st build. But none the less looks nice super clean very nice work.
Any chance you could do a 'brown' one next? ;)

&#x200B;

looks great though. nice work!
-.-
That is tidy :D
Never usually a fan of white pcs, but that looks awesome. Well done 🔥
That's sick. Like many others not a fan of the color but it's your pc so we can all go and get fucked.

Did you bend the tubes yourself or do they come in a kit? Awesome job.
8 8
Wow.
Thanks OP, now my wife wants one... lol  
Wife: "Ooh, that's BEAUTIFUL! When are you gonna build me one like THAT?!?!"  
Me: "But yours is fine for what you do."  
Wife: ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval) ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|rage)
I see fans, he lied to us
im sorry man, it looks amazingly tidy, but id dose look like it belongs in the hospital urine analysis department, just go a little more orange or blue or any other colour than slightly dehydrated piss test. it is very tidy though, much props!
Urine is the ultimate renewable coolant source
Piss is free too so you’ll never run out, what temps are you getting?
Hi I just wanted to ask you I'm planning on a similar build should I wait and save up for the 7800x3d or is it not that much of a difference?
That's so cool looking. Also like how you recycle your piss.
Damn, I wouldn’t dare put water cooling for a first build. But GG ✌️
Even passed a piss test
Yeah instantly thought “Pissmaster Build?”
reddit comments never dissapoints
White case looks like a toilet lol OP needs to drink more h2o
Yeah don't feel yellow was the best choice
Came here to see exactly that comment
Came here for the urine comments :)
Dah! Looks perfect combination. Very clean. So, who thinks thats a pee, minimun think a Beer or something better.
I'd call it the Urinal build, but he's missing the toilet puck
You can drink pc piss as well as your own piss. But afterwards you might have a pisshap.
My PC stores a lot of shit too
That's why it's called the Pee C
PC
Piss Computer?
Piss Cooler?
Piss Container?
Yeah was apparently piss easy to build
IMO you should only see custom loops in PC’s with the BEST components. Don’t get me wrong, specs on this pc are solid but definitely could have had a 7950x3d and a 7900xtx (probably even 4090) with everything air cooled. That is a serious difference in performance. The novelty of the aesthetics will wear off sooner than you think. In a month the internet clout will disappear and you will just have a box that looks like it’s plumbed into the piss trough at a state fair.
My first build was a Frankenstein PC I threw together and 2003 to play Diablo 2. I picked all my parts from a fancy neighborhood's trash on trash night.
Despite my silly posts I give the honor to you for most legit comment. He’s not trapped in a closet now he’s trapped in a cage and broke.
Honestly I fear for the op if he gets really drunk and mistakes it for a urinal
The comments never disappoint
PeeCee
I mean, are you above criticism or?
> ‘why did you piss in your PC?’

If this is a FAQ, what's the answer? If you really like gold, maybe add some aesthetics that suggest gold intead of piss. Or beer. Something.

If you're not that attached to the color, why not drain and change it? Literally any other color will be better.

Here's another question though: Why do you have every single component going back to the pump/reservoir? That seems horribly complicated for no reason.
Definitely. I mean I get saying that you don’t like yellow, which is what some people said on the original post. Opinions are welcome and I respect those. But gosh some people here are actually getting agitated over my color choice. I never really said this, but needless to say the yellow on white color palette was a deliberate choice, and wasn’t meant to have the pipes especially contrasting the rest of the build.

That being said not everyone is ofc, only some people are, but it’s a notable difference from the original post.
Peeople*
First of all, Ild like to thank you with how you worded all of this. Many people here could learn a thing or two. You can express an opinion without throwing a hissy fit that someone else didn’t share the same opinion. 

That being said now, the budget was set from the start, and I wasn’t going to expand the budget for the sake of spending more, for me, these parts were more than enough already. What I wanted primarily was to build a water cooled pc. 

Due to improvisations required along the way, the build ended up going slightly above budget as it stands, but keep in mind that a 4090 is MORE THAN double the price of the 7900xt (especially recently because of the whole China thing, not that that mattered back then). Not a very insignificant amount, but small upgrades, such as jumping to the xtx or x3d, all add up, and sticking to a budget means not jumping at every upgrade opportunity if it puts you over. (Btw at the time, idk if it still is, the 7700X was actually even cheaper than the 7700 to put this in perspective)

It’s like going shopping and keeping a list so you don’t buy things you don’t need and end up spending way more than you intended. I made a list going in, and stuck with it. That’s all.

(Except ram. That’s shits expensive. But I intend to keep that for a while longer than other parts)
A little surprising not gonna lie, especially since I already posted this once
>"First build" or "first custom loop". Still waiting for the answer of why pee. Its a clean af build but sorry it reminds me of a urinal with that color fluid and the white.

I assume it's one of a few likely scenarios... that was all they had... or personal choice. are the most likely reasons
Better to be pissed off than pissed on.

Idk tbh. Nothing impressive. I might get back to these comments about gpu temps if I ever look into it though. Gpu temps are really good, but hotspot temps are another story.
I pressed on ur notification and I like your edit better lol
Ask golden shower boy
You’re mistaken, it IS piss and he was going for a toilet aesthetic.
It doesn’t look like piss if you don’t think like that
I think you're in too deep m8.
☺️
If I was to take pictures close up on all the corners, and all the flaws that I myself know of, then it would seem a lot less clean

Look at it from the distance and perspective I took the pictures from and it all looks good, but I know deep down, the issues with it. Wiring is the only example that shows this really

Oh and yea it’s expensive, I had a budget to start with and I didn’t deviate from it. The water cooling really took a chunk out of the computing parts. Like others have noted; they would’ve expected more expensive parts with this
Uh normal gpu temps are very cool, but I think that’s normal even with an air cooler. It’s really the hotspot temps that are concern. I forgot what the temps are but I wouldn’t call them impressive or anything. Should I go back in time I would use the Liquid Metal on the gpu dye like i did with the cpu. (CPU is not delidded btw). AFAIK air coolers do a good enough job on their own, it’s just going the extra mile to integrate it into the loop. Partly because of temps, but mostly because it’s fuckin sick
Ted Stevens
Was a budgeting limitation. Believe it or not I skimped on watercooling costs as it is (ex: cheapest cpu and gpu block on the market for these parts) But the parts are good enough for me (I mean cmon, 7700x and 7900xt are good parts, regardless of if there are better things), but yea, didn’t want to break the budget just for the sake of getting a bit more performance, especially since this is fine as it stands. That being said it’s a PC, and I can always upgrade this down the line
Hmm, not sure I quite understand.

The path you described is actually what’s going on here. It passes through the distro, into the bottom rad, then into the gpu, then cpu, then top rad, then distro again
Btw it’s literally perfect
All my info came from scattered sources which I couldn’t exactly recall.
[this video](https://youtu.be/wMXUJclGvyg?si=cokPl_NnRR7R3xoJ) was definitely best for figuring out how to measure and bend the tubes though.

This took like two months, although partly because of logistics 

I didn’t really screw up the typical PC building stuff besides the wiring which is still a mess, but a few tubes at the start were thrown out because I didn’t bend them right at all. A physical wooden rig was the key to bending things right. It still didn’t come out quite right since ultimately your bends are going to be done free floating above a heat gun, so adjustments you make along the way inevitably warp the tubes a bit. There was a bit of improvising needed for filling and draining, such as needing a syringe with a long flexible end to drain the rads, and the fact that fluid just kinda didn’t want to enter when put in the fill port, leading me to need to fill it up while the PC was on so that the pump was running. So, good luck, ask any specific questions I guess
I’m going to start saving up now for my next build
NV7 case
Nah it’s just an hdd that was in my old laptop, third from primary. Only used for storing screen recordings and very light games

I’ve got a 1tb 980 pro main, and some Kingston 256gb (slow) m.2 as a secondary
Yep
OP really set himself up for these comments by mentioning piss in his post. See: Streisand Effect
Yes bent the tubes over like a month. definitely wasn’t easy. Got parts from all over the place, like titan rig, modmymods, performance pcs, etc.
Because alien gamer aesthetic is obnoxious. Also that coolant was dogshit quality
Yea but it is… I haven’t yet gotten into an argument about this, even on the original post, but it really is my first build, and it’s absolutely impossible for someone to ‘reason’ their way into making me lie and say it wasn’t my first build. I suppose if I was waterboarded I would say it isn’t my first build. 

That being said I already had experience repairing laptops and I knew a lot about PC building because of YouTube. Just a bit of dedicated research later and I had all I needed to know. Lots of improvising happened down the line though.
Jokes aside this is DP ultra yellow
It’s just a carry over ‘third storage’ from the laptop I was using before. It’s 1tb and good enough for storing recordings and stuff so why not
Main reason I didn’t do blue was because it’s been overdone. Like 50% of water cooled pcs have blue coolant. It looks nice, but I wanted a warm color as opposed to cool
Cliché
A little radiation never hurt anyone

It fr was tough. I regret making it actually (a bit) just because of how much time got dumped into making this. Definitely would go small form factor with soft tubing for cpu only in the future. Maybe for gpu too but soft tubing nonetheless. Measuring and making the tubes mentally and physically took a toll
No, despite how it looks, there’s actually plenty of space to remove the ram without draining g the loop. However, if I was to access the ssd or anything else for that matter (especially because of the vertical gpu) I would have to drain it all
Curious, what made you go with an Intel cpu + amd gpu combo? That’s quite a rare sight
I wanted a water cooled build. That was the priority in planning. Then the budget restriction. To stick with a budget is to not change it and fall into the trap of spending more for the sake of it. 

Yea I fixed several laptops in the past but that’s about it. While I was at it I took the Liquid Metal I was using for this and put it in my 2015 13” MacBook Pro (pictured) 😂
That’s the third storage. Main is a 1tb 980 pro
Yep I was watching shit about this for fun well before I started building
Unfortunately yes, that’s why the cpu block doesn’t light up anymore 🥲
Kidneys are stored in the balls
Fair. It’s actually not that bright though. It may look like it because of the photo though. Absolutely zero glare unless the room lights are turned off (which I don’t do) but even then it’s totally fine.

I actually get far more glare from the windows (behind/right) and the sun doesn’t even shine in the monitor’s direction at all
That’s the login screen or whatever, before you enter your pin
Probably not too much at first tbh. Assuming you’re not diabetic, it wouldn’t necessarily introduce growth in the loop, but coolants typically have biocide and anti-corrosives in them, while urine doesn’t have either, but doesn’t encourage it at the same time. I don’t know what particles there are in urine, but if there is anything that can be made “undissolved” then it will undissolve itself and build up in places.

In conclusion: wtf why would you do that?

Sounds like a thing ltt would do though
Another reason to eat sunflower seeds in moderation is their cadmium content. This heavy metal can harm your kidneys if you’re exposed to high amounts over a long period. Sunflowers tend to take up cadmium from the soil and deposit it in their seeds, so they contain somewhat higher amounts than most other foods.

Yep for two months it was for my eyes only. It’s only recently I decided to share pictures.

r/pissingexcellence
It's a fine specimen.
If taking two months of constant building is easy, then ild like to see what hard is.
For real. This is one of prettiest builds I've seen, but when I see water cooled without the best parts available, it just feels sad. Value your time people! Spending 2 months and however much extra on water cooling could have been replaced with doubling the performance of your PC.
True, although no one should buy a 7950x3d for gaming. The 7800x3d is cheaper, easier to cool and performs way better.
As a custodian I have to agree and also I think its time for a deep clean. I have to ram a johnny mop into this thing and dump half a bottle of acid foam cleaner in this thing before I rinse it with a machine. Dont worry I will hit it with some stainless steal polish so it looks brand new.
 What is this supposed to mean
The answer, is that it’s not piss… but everyone knows that already.

The distro has 4 compartments which ‘distribute’ the coolant as the name suggests. It makes it so o can have these straight tubes instead of making “horribly complicated” tubes to directly connect the components to each other. 

In short, they don’t go into the res, only the top rad/fill and bottom rad/ drain are connected to the res
It looks sick, fuck all these people saying the CPU and GPU should be x or y. Toxic shit when someone else build something they within a budget (most likely) and I’m sure you looked up performance yourself.

I have the same CPU and a 4090. It’s perfectly fine and works well. 

I think a total liquid system as a first build is sick when I was only using a AIO for mine.
yeah but you couldve gotten all that more expensive stuff if you just air cooled it instead
What is the cost difference between your water cooled setup verse say using an tower air cooler and air cooled gpu?
Also, I think some Alienware monitors are mostly white. Can’t say if they’re reasonably priced though.
Wow, they look great and actually look white opposed to my Lian Li SL INF 120s, which software is terrible so I leave lights off usually and they are louder than desired.
It looks like piss
My guy everyone who ever sees this is going to immediately think this is piss lol. What other transparent yellow liquid of this hue could this be? It sure ain't lemonaid.
It may look like piss but I still like it alot
Just a lot more work and effort than just building it right the first time. 

Not my pc, not my disappointment I guess.
They only mentioned that because they posted this on a different sub a few days ago and got all the same assholes in their comments telling them their jokes instead of actually being nice about the build lol.

I don't think them mentioning it in a comment on this post is why all the comments are talking about it, people are just rude.
Sure I understand that but I get the desire to take a piss when I see it. No offense.
I saw a guy did it with vodka, and i thought it would be funny to see if someone ended up doing it with urine. I dont wanna do it. It ended probably ruining something, and it would be expensive like my rig

Btw pc looks good. i like how lights change the color of the coolant almost like a black light
Mate, if that's your first build you sure did complicate shit for yourself.

Be careful, you don’t want a kidney stone to clog your radiator
It was a joke bro, damn
It's really difficult to get the coolant to flow when it's hard
I get the point but technically I don’t think the parts are available to be able to ‘double’ the performance of this just yet
100% agree and I honestly wouldn’t really recommend the 7950x3d to anyone. It’s just the most expensive cpu outside enterprise-grade which OP could have bought with money saved on the custom loop.
I'm so confused why the 7950 and 7900x3d chips exist. Like for gaming, the 7800x3d is king of the hill. And for productivity(unless they fixed it ), they 7950x and 7900x 3d variants have scheduling issues, so they can't use both dies at the same time. So you're better off with a standard non 3d series.   Like why the fuck did they make them?!.  I'd be amazing if you could run the 7950x3d perfectly as like a dual cpu and basically have a 7800x3d for gaming and at the sane time be able to use the other die for everything else you're doing.  Maybe it works like that now but I'm pretty sure they still have tons of issues
Most people think the colour looks bad, but if you like that's all that matters really.
Do you not understand that we aren't literally asking "Why is it piss?" We're asking why did you choose white and yellow, bathroom colors? Why not literally any other color? Is there no other color you would have also liked?
But I wanted to water cool it. That was the point, not getting a 4090. I wanted watercoong more than a 4090, I thought that was clear
it looks like pee and it makes it better
How about yellow coolant? Since that’s what it is…
*a lot
Actually the people here on AMD are being a bit more aggressive with the whole piss thing than on watercooling

As in, it’s less of a joke, and more of an insult here
I think vodka would be corrosive btw

Also turns out piss would also be corrosive because of the salt content. Also it decomposes apparently. Yikes
If I could turn back time I would’ve done a small form factor build with soft tubing just for the cpu instead. This was way more work than it was worth
I know it was a joke, I’m just saying it wasn’t easy at all
I fuckin know it was a joke god. I’m getting pummeled just for saying that it was hard to build because it’s getting interpreted as “I don’t know what jokes are”

I’m just not laughing, I’m crying
Well RTX 4090 has 50% more performance and better upscaling techniques so it is not far. Fully overclocked 13900K/14900K with 8000CL34-36 RAM will stomp that CPU also.
Neither of those two idiots know what they are talking about. Great build btw!
The 7700X is an amazing CPU. And the 7900 XT is just a slightly cut down 7900 XTX.
But I don’t get the “above criticism” thing. That’s kinda uncalled for, considering my comment addressing frequent comments form the original post, have absolutely nothing to do with criticism.
Like what exactly did I say? It sounds as if I pissed him off.
but why
Honestly for the memes I kinda agree
Yeah, people will know it IS yellow coolant. But the first thing they'll think is that it LOOKS like piss. Because it does.
Sorry that people are being like that man. The build looks really sick!
At least you know that now, I can dismantle my build clean all components and put them back together within about 4 hours. 

Don't get me wrong it's a beautiful rig, and well done for the work you've put in but my advice would be start with what you need, not what you think you need.

Anyhow, good job bro 👏
bro u custom looped your first pc 😭😭😭
His CPU is fine… it’s also not needing 300 watts. 
The Ryzen 7700x and 7800X3D are still some of the best CPUs around. 
Obviously a 4090 is the best but hey, it’s an AMD build.
> The 7700X is an amazing CPU.

It is. It also only 8 cores instead of 16. 

>And the 7900 XT is just a slightly cut down 7900 XTX.

It is also significantly worse than a 4090. 

Again, value your time people. If you are making a non water cooled 1,500-2,000 dollar build, then of course get the 7700X and 7900XT. However that isn't the case. OP spent however much extra on water cooling and spent 2 months on this product to make a upper mid tier computer.
Exactly! Like ok, I could spend a portion more for a portion more performance, but if I don’t need that then I just won’t! I’ll accept donations from them if they really need to see it upgraded though 😂
They are just being a douche. Ignore. Looks awesome to me. I didn’t think of urine until I read the comments. Love it.
It must be a generational thing.... huoh. When my friends started water cooling it was to get overclocking benefits. Now people just want a pretty PC that they can show in social media. They talk about a "budget", but they spend their budget on pretty lights and  useless water cooling on low powered components.

So did i... never again
Ah yes, the 7800X3D is also terrible using your logic. Wait. The 7800X3D performs better than both the 7950X and the 7950X3D.

I didn't know anything other than a 4090 was mid tier 😂😂
I have an overclocked 4070 ti. What potato build are you using??
I follow what you mean, I'm not at all understanding the point of "well ya fuckin water cooled it so you might as well spend another $2k so it makes sense" No lol, that shit does not make sense. You wanted to water cool it so it's water cooled, needed or not. Having a $500+ CPU and 4090 is obscenely overkill for 99.999% of people. Your setup smashes 1440p and can also do 4k. The more is better mindset in the pc world is mind boggling.
Right! If they care so much they can put their money where their mouth is 🤣
> Ah yes, the 7800X3D is also terrible using your logic.

Oh yes. I needed to give a very detailed post to your low effort comment. You were saying I don't know what I was talking about and put 2 lines of effort into your reply. 

>I didn't know anything other than a 4090 was mid tier 😂😂 I have an overclocked 4070 ti. What potato build are you using??

I know you aren't this stupid and at this point grasping at straws to roll around in the mud. I've already explained where I and others are coming from twice. You don't address our points at all. 

God I hate mobile users who shit talk. They don't have a keyboard to actually have a productive conversation so they resort to low effort attacks.
Its laughable watching people talk down to other computer users over their preferences as consumers buying products meant for consumers and not enterprises or true ballers. These people who shame others who are enjoying themselves using their knowledge of Information Technology applying themselves where they can based on their skill level. These people who like to commentate and stance in a holier than thou attitude and pretend to be elitists likely do not even have any sysadmin/pentesting/ZeroTrust Networking/CVE/enterprise/advanced experience and then they talk down to other people who are just having fun experimenting with DIY at their level. Do you want a cookie? Let us see your build, give us a tour of your shit, all I hear is someone who is salty that they aint got/know shit. :D  
I welcome the downvotes raid my website too! Its okay Im deploying ory so I can self host an alternative for cloudflare protection. I have a 7900 xtx i have a 3080 ti i have a surface pro 9. Dont mean shit, these are all consumer products; what you are getting excited about is just benchmarks and marketing. Depending on the use case of the end user, that marketing doesnt mean fu$\*$ shite. For instance my grandma does not need even a gtx 760 to browse the web. This is a watercooled loop, that shit aint for function. That shit is for art. So berating and down voting someone for making a midlevel computer that is  a work of art is some first world holier than tho garbage. And pretty lame imho when I know my knowledge and skillset probably more and I can keep calm and be a chill nerd and not a terror like these haters XD

It felt really basic but also impactful. I used Adobe Premiere with a driving time-lapse and interviews. I have no professional video editing experience but have access to Adobe products. 

As it turns out, we were selected to win out of over 200 other submissions from across the world. Securing $50,000 for us to purchase a new van. What a way to end 2023. 

I feel like I still have much to learn.I love editing, even though it was tough to grasp at first. Premiere was daunting. I hope to continue my work in video editing in to the future.

Thanks for reading!
Congrats! 

Video has a strange power to make people feel something, to change hearts and minds. Keep cutting, sounds like you are doing great.
Congrats and nice job! Don’t sell yourself short, most of the best editing is “basic”. Flashy graphics and effects can be cool but editing is about story telling. You must have picked the best bits from the interviews and strung them together to tell a good story. Add some music and nice pacing and you have a good piece.
Heartland Emmy Awards: *Hold my beer.*
Congrats! Would love to see your hard work, feel free to DM!
Congratulations
Awesome job!  Congrats!
Many many congratulations
Well done, be proud, happy cutting
Congrats. I'd love to see the video if you're comfortable sharing.
Nice!
BASED! Congrats man. Probably felt amazing! Love seeing positivity on this sub.
Congratulations! That is some awesome news for your org! Try to find other ways to use your skills an try to improve. Good Luck!
This is so awesome!! CONGRATS!
Brilliant! Congrats to you and your organization.
Way to go. Congrats on your achievement.
Congrats! That feeling of landing new gigs feels amazing!! Keep them coming.
Thats so awesome, anyway we can see your edit?
Congrats!
Congrats! Love to hear this good news.
Wow, very cool! Congratulations! 🎉
I'm not even into editing but Reddit sent me an email for this post so I wanted to say congratulations!!   
Happy New Year everyone. Have a nice day.
 Congratulations!  That's awesome
Thank you! I will!
😅
Hey I have a couple of those lol. Didn't pay for the ripoff statue tho
Same here! Would love to see it
Thank you!
Thanks!
Thank you!
Thanks!
>Thank you!

You're welcome!
Leaving the industry...
After 20 years of editing shows, I have to leave. This last year has just been godawful...I've barely worked at all, and it seems that there's no ending in sight.  My savings are gone. I can't sleep at night.  I can't even treat my wife to dinner anymore.

I'm trying to figure out where else to go and wanted to see what everyone else is doing?
I feel this. My lease here is up in September and I’m seriously considering leaving town, doing a whole different career
[deleted]
I feel this and I'm not even at that level. I dunno if you know Blue Collar Post Collective but they're doing a conversation/stream kinda thing tomorrow at 4p ET called "Diversifying Income for Post Production Freelancers." [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdRYGPcaxdM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdRYGPcaxdM) I intend to tune in, might be helpful or not to others. I'm working every angle I can to land some editing work but I'd be lying if I'm not looking at spending some of my evenings learning to code or something. Maybe that's on its way out, too. The future's so dim, I gotta take off my shades!
My wife and I have this convo daily about what else would I do. So far it's been fruitless. This shit has been brutal and I'm just furious all the time. I like what I do, I'm good at it, I have a great resume and tons of contacts but I just can't actually DO it.
I don't blame you. I've managed to work but I'm honestly not comfortable staying in this business anymore. I feel like I already have 1 foot out the door. I've done a lot of research. If you can go back to school than id suggest healthcare. There is a shortage of healthcare workers. Government work isnt lurcrative but its stable, has great benefits, generous time off and a pension. Sales is lucrative, don't need a degree, but kind of crazy. Theres also a shortage in trades, you get paid to train thing is it can be pretty hard on the body but it's definitely not a job that AI can replace anytime soon.
I work in the ad space and it's bad for us too. 

My only advice I have is, if your looking for extra income and you have a college degree it can be anything get into sub teaching. Here in Arizona there so much demand for them that you can pick one district and pretty much work full time or pick what days you want to work the night before
I just started working at an agency and we've booked like hell for the next 6 months. I gave up freelancing for a while, having a salary is a blast.
Basically same as gwmckeon, been editing in social media advertising while waiting for TV and film to open back up but they seem very dead end right now. Nobody I know has work aside from like one AE fresh out of school and a Disney plant who’s PAing for Lucasfilms. Strongly considering using my marketing and advertising experience to get an MBA in marketing and doing that
Lot of my editor friends went to the "dark side" and started producing and directing. With your editing skills, it immediately pays off by showing clients you know what you're doing. A wise person said "content is king".
Government. Work is steady, boring, but steady.
Sorry man. Strike hit everyone hard as shit….its gonna bounce back. 🤙🏼 Stuff is trickling in. 🙏🏼
Got two months left before I move back in with family and pursue a career change.
I've been unemployed since January of last year, feeling super hopeless especially since my unemployment funds have run out/can't reapply until May & there are murmurs of more strikes with Editors guild and IATSE... like, damn, will this hell ever end? What a horrible time to be an editor. 

I've turned to teaching myself how to code in Swift & Xcode, since I have some ideas for apps and games I want to make. It's a steep learning curve, and sometimes it feels like I'm trying to teach myself how to read and write in Chinese, but I'm not giving it up - it may be a long time till work ever comes back again, so may as well use the time to learn something new.

I really really really want to avoid having to work retail, but if things get more desperate, I'll work at the local grocery store as a bagging person :( I'm so mad at our industry....
I had to drain a 401k account to pay bills. I finally landed an editor position at a game company but that was thanks to knowing people who worked there. If they didn't hook me up I'd be a data analyst now.
I’m right there with you, brother. Been in the game for 15 years and this last year and a half has decimated me and my bank account… But being so skilled in one section of life and having to start fresh in a new one feels so frustrating… It’s a tough pill to swallow.
What scares the shit out of me are the "other industries" id be qualified to work in..... like advertising. Shudders!
Editorial will be the last thing to come back. 2024 will be lean and I’m sure 2025 will be busy again if you’re in features/tv. 

I can’t imagine that reality won’t pickup super quickly.
I feel you, I’m in the same boat. I reluctantly started a new career path about 7 months ago and I’m still mentally struggling with making less money and my identity. I still am picking up small gigs on the side but I’m having a hard time with life right now.
I feel your pain. I haven’t worked since last September and just finally booked something for April and another project for June. Maybe don’t give up just yet cause it feels like the work is coming back. You gotta really push those contacts (without being too annoying) to get something.
30 year editor here and my time has run out too. Laid off due to AI last July. Hardly anything available apart from social media nonsense. So I’m going into the finance sector. It sucks but I gotta do what I gotta do. Good luck to everyone else who is changing industries too.
Dang social media, the internet, streaming, and hollywood really have killed every creative industry in visual media..
I've not worked in TV for a year, so now I'm working various corporate and internet gigs. Nothing union, unfortunately, but I'm working and thankful for it. I apparently did a great job of having a diverse group of industry friends, so when film and TV went down, some of them are still working and hiring. Just referred another TV friend to one of my clients and they'll be starting with them soon.   


I've gone down some very dark paths this last year, and very much have been exploring putting more energy into working outside the industry...but it's not dead yet. It might be easy for me to say, since I live alone, but keep your chin up and just do what you can to expand your network. If you are strict about your comfort zone and can't wait until this summer (when things SHOULD pick up), maybe it is time to move on.

&#x200B;

Just don't go into real estate.
Aviation needs maintenance mechanics, I did a campaign for one.
Commercial/ad work not doing too hot either. Slow last year, even slower this year. I'm salaried, but I think we might run out of runway soon.
I’m out. Already got a software certification & working on 2 other certs I’m studying for now. After 12 years, I’m going back into construction.  I was an adjunct professor to help close the gap because I just never made much money as a post guy, & I shot too. Selling all my gear and saying good bye. Too bad, I really enjoyed the work when it was happening.
Edit commercials instead then? Or music videos? Or films?
Good luck homie.
Well what else do you do? And what are your other skills you’ve forgotten about? What could you do for another 20 years? How is your wrist? lol. For me I do video, photo, editing, graphic design, and some website maintenance. It has been great to know these things. I also sell my art on the side. A jack of all. Only a master of the ones I really enjoy. Perhaps you can take a freelance route and start doing various things you are skilled at for income.
As someone who graduated film school last year and just started editing professionally, this sub is literally one of the most depressing things I've ever seen
I moved from LA to a small town on the East Coast. Got a job at a local tv station doing photography and editing. Doesn't pay much - but I feel like I'm at least going somewhere with this and the benefits are great. Plus  - it's also cheaper. A LOT cheaper.
I had to pivot hard, thankfully found a preditor job off indeed that’s about 150 miles out of town but it’s full time and the pay and benefits are pretty decent. Good luck to you OP I hope it turns around for you and your family very soon, like latest tonight!
I'm still working (docuementaries), just wrapped a show and started another. I know it is really hard out there for folks so consider myself hella fortunate. If I were to leave i would work in a kitchen.
100% right with you. Fucking brutal.
Get in touch with the SBA and ask for a small bridge loan to get you through to the next better thing. As an independent contractor, you are a business.
I’m giving instacart a try.
Don't do data science, it's full of similar idiots trying to find jobs but they have more work experience in more relevant roles and industries.
The one corner of the industry that seems to have a ton of jobs right now is tv news
Hey, thanks a lot. 

I sometimes come here to post advice to new editors because I don’t want them to make the same mistakes that i made. Many of us didn’t have mentors or *any* pathways to follow. The road to advancing had many gate keepers, and it was pretty expensive to be an editor once upon a time. Those factors created exclusivity. A lot has changed. 

There’s certainly a future for the art of video editing. It’s just that the way these stories are told will be very different. Sometimes, when i think about my time in Los Angeles between 2000-2020, I’m dumbstruck by the speed of technological growth.  The floodgate opened with more distribution outlets,  cheaper access to more powerful tools, and the once voracious appetite of digital platforms to fill space with anything for people to consume becoming standard.

 It’s arguable that as movies and TV have moved from away from art, and into the realm of product and commodity, where we’ve landed with AI and industry constriction was an inevitability.  

I’m not saying this as some sort of foo-foo indictment of commerce over artistry. Just a statement of fact. I think the tools are amazing. I only wished that the infrastructure supporting this industry that makes the wonderful things we watch had a pipeline that trickled down.  That didn’t feel like a scam or house of cards at every new production. 

I’m only sad that I never had a ‘career’.  I came into this industry in ignorance, and that’s my own fault. I’ve been reaching back and having 1 on 1 conversations with as many recent transplants as I can.  My old undergrad, isn’t equipping these kids with the right tools to thrive.  Skill certainly matters in this town, but social matters a whole lot more. 

I was a nerd that kept my nose clean, stayed out of trouble, stayed ambitious, treated people kindly, payed it forward as often as I could, and really REALLY loved storytelling. The world changed and, unfortunately, i didn’t change rapidly enough with it. That’s on me. 

My job is to make sure that isn’t on the NEXT person.
If any of you guys see this: do you worry at all about AI eventually taking up jobs in the industry?
I’m trying to build up skills in editing and vfx but it seems like a valid concern. 
I’d be very interested to hear others’ thoughts on how the industry is going too
it been almost 3 years working in the production and media content industry, any fatherly advice for youngsters? lol
I’ve looked into court reporting. It’s quite fascinating, pays well and there’s major shortage in that industry. Training takes less than a year, but you do have to increase your words per minute, which is a skill that takes time to develop. Although I do wonder how long will it take till AI takes over that as well :/
Lean into CGI. I did and I’m SWAMPED.
I feel the pain in this post, OP. Plenty of creators - big creators - looking for editors. Unfortunately, there's no good way to connect with them. But if you're repped, maybe some intros are possible.

I'm always looking for editors to supplement my in-house team. I usually find them through referrals, but I've hired based on nothing but a good reel and a kind email. 

There is more editing work now than ever before - just not in Hollywood. Hollywood was on life support, then covid pulled the plug. The entertainment economy is now online. Good luck and hang in there. I've been there.
I've started day trading in between gigs.

You sit in front of giant monitors looking at timelines and clicking your mouse a lot.

Your day ends at 4pm eastern and if a good gig comes along, you can just stop and pick it up again when you're ready. I was surprised how editing and motion graphics skills like visual acuity and having a feel for timing and flow are relevant to the type of trading I prefer. 

But pretty please don't do this if you're in any way risk averse. And if money is tight, learn with paper trades or tiny disposable amounts of money until you get a feel and an understanding of how easy it is to blow up your account. Then start doing the things that don't blow it up.
sorry to hear that.  

I had a camera op friend who had a couple years of minimal camera work, he took up a side gig with an electrical company, going out and taking meter readings. 

Since then the work has picked back up and he no longer needs those side gigs.  

You could always go into something else but keep your lines open.  Honestly one of those delivery apps could do the trick for a bit and you could work and stop work as you please
I got up and left the city I was working in. Trying to become an electrician.
Amazon warehouses are always hiring. It’s physical labor, but I did it during the pandemic.
I haven't made it to scripted other than a couple shorts. Unscripted stories allowed me to survive for many years. Never thrived. Treading water too long.

Been using AI lately. Recoded and modernized my site. Don't know why. The resume does look more like a resume now with the assistance of AI in order to expand my career possibilities. Not saying AI is any sort of issue here other than helpful.

Certainly not going to ask it "how can you employ me as an advocate for you so I'm not subjugated when the rise of the AI machines happens?"
I'm actually prepping to stick my toe back in.  This is not the news I wanted to here. But since of my work will be for myself, I'll just have to deal.
I think I'll become an electrician. It was pretty fun doing my own solar installation (cos I'm poor now)
You’d do well to participate in this discussion tomorrow about diversifying your income sources, held by Blue Collar Post Collective: [https://facebook.com/events/s/diversifying-income-for-post-p/1464606194448453/?mibextid=RQdjqZ](https://facebook.com/events/s/diversifying-income-for-post-p/1464606194448453/?mibextid=RQdjqZ)
Sorry man. Why did they stop hiring you?
It might be worth considering moving out of LA to a lower cost-of-living city where your caliber of skills is less common/less competition.

We made the move about 2 years ago and honestly, this is the happiest we have ever been.
My friend did that about 6 months ago.
I will say that the infosec field is extremely saturated right now. And there’s not really any entry level infosec jobs, especially without a degree. Not saying it’s impossible, but something to consider.
Where.could one find these certification courses?
Im going to that but this isnt a situation where we need "diverse income" and side hustles, we need our careers back or completely new ones. Plus ive seen one of the three people running that yell at out of work editors to "GET A JOB!" when they talk about how hard this is on them so im not expecting much.
The future of coding doesn’t look that good either
Amazing resource. Thank you . 

I am recently laid off from a corporation and am struggling to navigate the freelance route even at a project basis. This might ease my mind if things aren’t looking up.
Thanks for this. I follow BCP, and had missed this
Did anyone tune in to this? Ngl it's bumming me the fuck out lol
Yeah, it really really sucks right now.  I want to be optimistic, but the strikes really seem to destroy the industry.
Here's the [actual link to anyone interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRaXvAhDqc4).
It's sad but life is random and cruel. This moment right now feels like a fleet of manufacturing jobs leaving the rust belt, or like a once stable country breaking out into civil war and we're just the refugees. Absolutely awful situation to be in but we gotta adapt to survive.
Same.
Yup, I feel exactly the same.  My wife is awesome, but she knows how worried I am.
This is great advice. I'm turning 50 this year so I've got a harder road, but if you're young and able to transition in the fields you mentioned, that's smart. There's definitely ageism in post production. But yes, everything you said about trades and the industry to invest in that AI cannot replace? 100%.
wow so im fron the IT world.  Just came on this subreddit to see how people were perceiving the new Sora AI news. and im shocked to see this industry is suffering as well.  If you were to go into the IT related subreddits you will see that everyone there is struggling as well.  about 400,000 layoffs in IT since 2022.  And everyone is talking about the trades too.    


Theres going to be an influx of people migrating to nursing, healthcare & the trades.  Alot of people in the IT subreddits are saying they're doing the same.  


These are crazy times.
When I found out what dental hygienists in Los Angeles make per hour I bookmarked it as a possible alternate career if I ever needed to pivot. It's a shorter day than a typical editorial day, plus there's some amount of science knowledge to keep things interesting, and if you're a people person that'd be a plus.

Maybe one day they'll be replaced with AI piloting precision SCARA robots sporting automated tools to do the work and a Furby strapped to the side to provide emotional connection, but that's probably a ways off.
I just got a government job (videographer for a department coms team) after getting laid off from the marketing agency I was working at last year. Is it flashy or going to be stuff I put on a portfolio reel? No. Do I now make more money, eligible for overtime, part of a union, have insane health insurance ($250 deductable for $50 a pay), 14% pension match to my 10%, and this thing called "work life balance"? Yes. Also, the work I'm doing in the department is really meaningful and very mission focused (we focus on developmental disabilties) and it WAY more fulfilling than sizzle reels about sponsorship bullshit.

I don't regret my last 10 years of working at production houses (and to a lesser degree the agency I spent the last two years with), but after the mental anguish of working in agency life and getting into my 30's wanting some more stability, I'm extremely thankful for the opportunity I have now. AND, with my network I've built, I've opened myself up to freelancing occasionally for projects as a added bonus.
I bet the speed at which robots can do most everything is going to be mind blowing.

Once we've got agi then the companies doing innovation are probably going to switch to robotics as that'll be the last frontier.
How does one find a job at an agency?
What agency?
I've only ever done either freelance or in house agency and we are loaded with work. I think a lot of the OG editors will look down on this type of work but the hours are great and I actually have a life outside of the office.
hear, hear. recently I've felt grateful having my teeth kicked in from the 2007 WGA strike followed by the recession. Been doing Government for 4+ years now. Decent pay, good security, and everyone thinks I'm a wizard.
I feel like Government work would be a good base and you can prob side hustle some low impact editing gigs.
What do you do?
until there is a shutdown that happens every now and then. one lasted 3 months a few years ago and all the military families were at the food pantries.
Yeah but every gig I see get posted is absolutely slammed with hundreds of applicants.
If I get laid off I'm probably going to the post office. At least they get a pension.
May I ask what your go to for learning swift is besides YouTube-U?
I wanna learn swift so bad but when I try I can’t help but think it’s more convoluted and complicated than it has to be
Oh awesome.
I work in advertising now. 4 day work weeks and an 80k salary plus benefits. The irony is that now I actually have time to be creative.
[deleted]
[deleted]
What are you doing now?
Man, that fucking sucks. I’m sorry. If you don’t mind me asking, what was the exact way AI put you out? Are they doing like, fully AI editing now? Or are they cutting assistant work?
im surprised to hear a video editor getting laid off due to AI.  Would you be okay telling me what happened?  I thought my industry was one of the few that got affected.  Didnt think AI was screwing videographers and editors like this wow.
What are you going to do in finance?
How exactly are you pivoting to finance? Are you going back to school to learn new skills or…?
lol why not real estate?
How did you find your corporate gigs? Want to look for that, but don't know where to start
Trust me, I'm open to them.  Would love to. The opportunities are just not out there right now.
Thanks dude.
Its the most depressing year in most of our careers
I hate negativity generally.  I know there's always times when the industry is slow.  But this last year has been absolutely devastating in terms of work.  Everyone I know is feeling it.
So, do you commute 300 miles a day? Or hybrid?
I see a lot of hiring jobs at NewsMax but I don't think my soul could handle it.
> people kindly, *paid* it forward

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*
IMO, new technologies have emerged throughout history and the same concerns and conversations about it “taking our jobs” arise. It will make a lot of career paths obsolete, but it also creates new career paths while others evolve. AI isn’t fully automated, best analogy I can think of is how automation on a factory floor still needs humans to operate and oversee production. 

The genie is out of the bottle and the best one can do is adapt and embrace those technologies. Learning how to use AI in your craft and keeping up with it as it progresses is paramount to stay current in the market. I use it for almost everything in the edit room, from generating AI VO or sound bites for a sizzle, to script cutting long interviews. Something that used to take a full day can now be done in a matter of minutes. What the future will look like is uncertain, so my approach is to continue to learn how to integrate those tools to my workflow and take it from there with my fingers crossed.
I think AI is going to take over a LOT of industries, from photography, video game making, newspaper writing...hell there are self driving cars on the road now.  Imagine in 10 years from now when the driving technology is perfected...everyone who drives a car, from uber driver to truck driver will be out of a job.
I wish I had a solution.  But everything is just so dark right now.  Someone else posted that this year there's 30% of the production work there was last year.

I've been trying to be patient, but I've barely worked this last year and neither have most of my friends in the industry.

I know it WILL come back...people will want to watch shit.  But when and how is a mystery to us all. This is the worst I've ever seen it in my entire career.
And this is the dilemma, you either pick a whole new career with a year of training that might go away soon anyway or you do nothing and just go broke because other jobs dont want people who will leave if the industry comes back.
How so?
How did you learn CGI?
Thanks man! Yeah I'm in NYC right now and we're feeling the crunch hard.  And yeah I'm repped but my agent hasn't really gotten me much lately.  I've gotten a few interviews and referrals this week so hopefully things are turning around.

Are you cool if I DM you my website?
> I've started day trading in between gigs.

haha you're gonna lose so much money. have fun dude
Neat.
Hes been working 20 years.....this isnt a just get a side hustle solution.
I actually just checked after reading this and they are not currently hiring in Los Angeles. The closest job is delivery station customer service in Torrance.
Good luck. It's absolutely brutal out there.
Oh the irony. I quit that god awful career path to become an editor.
Yeah I already replied to that. But I’m no super hopeful.
[deleted]
The industry kind of imploded last year with the strike.  It still hasn't recovered yet.
I don't live in LA (NYC) but I see your point.

My wife and I own a place and she has a full time job in advertising (how we met) so we're not looking to move.
What new career did they choose and how is it working out for them?
I've checked out [https://coursecareers.com](https://coursecareers.com) before and it seems legit.  I haven't decided if I want to pursue one yet though
If you don’t have a [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/landing/cissp-2024?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GBL-exam-peace-of-mind-protection-promo&utm_term=search&utm_content=GBL-exam-peace-of-mind-protection-promo&msclkid=7a5be32486341e40eefd86c403005436), your prospects are very slim.
I dont get it, why do the people who speak for the board seem to hate the membership so much?
It doesn’t. I’m in IT now after leaving editing last year and while it’s providing stability and money I’m fully expecting this not to last either. My only hope is that those skills can somehow shift into something that will be relevant then (if anything).
The future period doesn’t look good. AI is gonna take over everything.
The coding gold rush is over- way too crowded now. You got indians on fiverr doing it for pennies. Everybody piled in because they saw google engineers making 800k/year. If you learned to code in 2013 though you'd be a multimillionare now
I have to assume they planned this before the strikes because they forgot to touch upon ways we could actually do anything now. "Live with a relative for free" "invest in the stock market" and "turn your second home into an airbnb" werent really relevant and helpful right now for most people. The fact someone had to actually ask them to discuss ways to make money and they REFUSED because there was a thread from last week made me think they didnt even know the topic of the  stream.

Their main advice seemed to be "find something you love and make money off it" which is great but thats what editing is for me.
I found it to be pretty useless.  A lot of their advice is really outdated.
"Live with a relative for free.  Sublet your apartment and live out of your car."

This is fucking insanity.
Not to be pedantic but the strikes are in reaction to the industry being ruined, they're not the source of the ruin.
I would look at the consolidation rather than strikes as the reason for lack of new production.
>  I want to be optimistic, but the strikes really seem to destroy the industry.

IATSE is next, just to kick you when youre down lol

I know a few cinematographers that are taking a break from the industry and will come back when all the dust settles. It's bleak out there right now.
Nobody should bother, its a giant waste of time that never deals with the issue at hand.
If you're willing to get your hands dirty some trades will prob take you.
Is there really ageism in post?  The way I see it most creative leads or senior producer/ director roles are held by veterans with experience
Curious how you landed that gig.  Can I PM you?
They'll never take away government jobs. Inefficiency is too baked into it.
Bit of a fun story, I was homeless, traveling and trying to survive by writing poems in the streets. I just applied to the job on Indeed. I still have no idea what I'm doing but I kinda know how to edit films.. We mainly do commercials for luxury arty brands.
Most near me poach, never advertise the actual job
French video production agency, we're 10 in total, 2 editors. We do mainly commercials for luxury brands. I can't say I'm all in for it but since it's luxury, the films/videos are very high quality.
Nobody is looking down on anything right now, they just cant find anything that will hire them.
What do you do?
The meaning of being a big fish in a small pond 😆
Edit and produce for a local government
Local government. We don’t have the problems federal government has with asshats who don’t do their jobs to ensure their employees get paid, ie Congress. 

However, I wouldn’t mind a sweet CSPAN gig
Mate, Ive been an editor for 30 years in LA and only gotten like maybe 5 actuals jobs from posts that want to pay a good rate. Tons for minimal/no pay, or “backend”😑 I will sometimes take the ones that are lower if I have the bandwidth or dig the project for a multitude of reasons. 

The real way is true networking, and I don’t mean forums/FB groups, etc. Im not sure where you live, but you gotta find out where the decisions makers hang. You get like 5 people, you can always pivot around. If they trust you, then you’re on their list. Shits always being made, especially in the feature world. 🤙🏼. 

BUT, AND I MEAN A BIG FUCKING BUT….the last strike was insane, that backlogged so many projects. This itself caused post to push back months, fuck some years. I have close friends on huge shows/films who were twiddling their thumbs….fuck, I had three films pushed till I don’t know when….  

Things are/will hopefully right itself. As I said they are trickling in.
Sorry to possibly disappoint, but I have mostly been learning from YouTube - Swiftful Thinking has been the easiest way to comprehend things and following along Nick's directions in Xcode [https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking)

And using the Apple App Playgrounds has been helpful in learning the basics. There are a bunch of different level courses, some of them can be enjoyable like playing a game. Good luck!
Can I ask how the transition was? Did you just "move in with an existing client" or did you have to apply cold?
Where do you work?
What is your role? Are you still an editor/motion designer? How did your skills translate?
Most of the editors working now were booked pre strike. I wouldn’t expect new projects to be staffed for a bit. This is what all my friends in tv/film have experienced. Don’t know any reality people. 

Nothing I’m on has really picked up anyone new since strike.
It sucks and it’s bleak now but ya it’s going to return.
If you had contacts and regular work before you will again.
Personal training. I actually really love it but I'm not making enough money to pay my bills yet and will probably never make as much as I could in the film industry. It's actually a much more meaningful profession for me and you can make over $100k/yr once you have built your client base but I'm struggling with accepting where I am in life at the moment.
Fully AI editing does not exist except for the most menial tasks (deleting air between dialogue for example)
Honestly I think they were looking for excuses to get someone they could pay less. The official word was they eliminated my position due to AI, but the reality was they hired someone for a lot less money and invested the rest in AI.
Take some calls, take some tests and see where it takes me. Lol. I should pass my tests in anywhere from 7 weeks to 6 months. Then I can see what I like to do and try to get transferred up the ladder.
Starting in customer service so they will pay for my training, studying and tests. I’ve also spent the last 7 years editing thought leadership videos in the financial services vertical so I’ve learned a little along the way. After a couple years when I’m accredited I should be back to making the same as my editing gig. 

Thinking about it today wondering if it was worth it. I’ve dealt with some nasty, nasty people in my time. I don’t need that shit any more.
the current interest rate environment means nobody wants to sell (because they locked in a 3% mortgage) and nobody wants to buy because they're either waiting for rates to come down (sep 24 at earliest) or there's just not enough inventory. prices are also extremely high making housing largely unaffordable without a six figure salary/dual income. 
its a feedback loop causing gridlock in the industry.

on top of that, being a landlord isnt that profitable anymore because insurance costs, home services/maintenance labor costs, and property taxes have skyrocketed in recent years as everybody wants a piece of the pie

commercial RE is basically destroyed by WFH. retail and medical is strong but also subject to the above, and the barrier to entry on investment for that is insanely high. 

whats remaining is developing raw land, which is very hard now because city govs are NIMBY and actively discourage new building to keep the supply low and prices high (they're all landlords shhhh)
I started out with a combination of corporate gigs and television.  I would say what helped me get corporate gigs was the ability to create motion graphics as well.  So you can search for people/corps looking for motion graphics and video editing gigs, also shooting.
I hate to say this, but 99% of my jobs I've ever gotten was by word of mouth. My work certainly speaks for itself, but I would not have gotten in the door if I had not known someone on the inside to refer me. The industry is saturated with people trying to break in and it's extremely difficult to weed through those with ability and those trying to learn it. Especially with youtube: there are thousands of people who downloaded the free version of Resolve and think they can edit a story.   


I've been on the hiring side; if I know someone, they are 99.9% more likely to be hired. Go meet people doing what you want to do.
You're not rong.
Yeah I would’ve bought a self driving car if they were reliable and could afford one lol but sadly I just moved for now.
You'd be a literal traitor to democracy.
Hi, i'm still working through an AV production degree and after stumbling across this board and specifically this thread i'm starting to question some of my life choices.  >\_>  

Thats not the reason for this specific response though, I was just curious, what kind of AI tools are you currently learning which help you work that efficiently?  Reducing "a full day to minutes"...  I don't even know what things are out there (specific to video editing I mean, as opposed to those text to image generators and such) but I figure i'd better learn quickly what i'm NOT being taught in my college courses.  Either I will have to self-learn to use it myself, or know what i'm competing against that is a risk to my future job.
I self taught myself over the years; but really dived deep over the pandemic. I went from DP/Director at my work, to then mostly editing, and now just CGI. Most editors on our team have a little bit experience in CGI. I would start with Blender or Unreal to start.  But yea....I always thought it looked so cool, so made it a mission to start getting into it a long time ago. There's so much control and neat things you can do, it's really addicting; once it starts to flow and feel comfortable in understanding how it works.
What do you suggest? I think during the down times it’s reasonable.  Or collect unemployment or something 🤷‍♂️
Omg for real?! That is bad.
does seem tough.. u ever get electrocuted?
Indeed, a vacuous brainstorm session with people who didn’t even have any groundbreaking ideas.
They left La and moved back to Denver. Last I checked he was working in photography.
I’ve bought course careers and it’s good. I never got through all of it cause I got hired a week after I bought it.
Coding or Cyber security was also my plan b, but they seem as bad as video editing now even young people with experience. Idk what is going on here. It’s like only media, marketing tech and video games are getting directly targeted. I find it interesting that the sectors who were fighting for unions, more remote work, and etc are the ones getting killed the most.
No clue. Im guessing its because they know that things have only gotten worse for years and years now and since they cant actually help the membership they might as well try to demand they shut up and get in line. But thats not working either because people can see that theyre just being mean and downright abusive to members in need while they gaslight them and tell them things arent that bad. 

They had to browbeaten into telling us the survey results and even then they barely told us anything at all. Even the CAT leaders dont know whats going on with the negotiations that start in a few days, they wont even tell us who is on the local committee yet! They tried to set up a financial aid system but its not anonymous so you have to personally beg a board member for money and justify your needs to them and then it turns out nobody is in a position to help you anyway.

If its not obvious im ready for the entire board to be replaced. Alan and Cathy included.
What about IT security? Seems like that would have a prosperous future.
AI will supplement everything. You still need human operators. People are fear-mongering AI way too much.
sublet your room and couchsurf! i have a fuckin newborn man lol

but the takeaway for me was "get what you can and also pivot," which is what i figured. perfect time to figure out how to begin some new career tracks 💀
The strikes shut down everything for 7 months.  That's not nothing.

I'm glad they got what they want, but it also greatly hurt the industry in a lot of ways.
I don't entirely disagree...
I'm all ears. I just filled out a Costco application this morning. The Industry's ups and downs have taken it's toll.  I was telling my wife that I've been an 'editor' for 15+ years. My only daughter is 9 (I'm 49), and I waited as long as we could for my career to kick in before we finally had children. It never did, and we stopped waiting. We finally moved out of Los Angeles to Vegas during pandemic, and while her business career is as solid as one can hope,  mine (and most editors I know) are DOA. The wives are literally the primary incomes now. 

So yeah, I'm definitely open to different options. But like I mentioned, at 50, I'm just hoping for something that isn't so physically grueling that  I won't be able to enjoy my daughter's 15th birthday in 6 years!   


Editing is wild. It's the only industry where you can make 300-800 dollars a day for a month, then nothing for a whole year. My last solid gig was 2016.  Insane.
Def. My experience is in commercial and scripted, the young fresh voices will def look on old folks as stuck in their ways etc. I've come across showrunners who actually look at industry experience as a negative. It's both crazy and refreshing in my opinion, ha. I'm mid-40s and haven't experienced it (that I'm aware of), but have watched it happen.
Haha... it's the literal definition of bureaucracy
inefficiency is part of the culture.
That’s an insane story and I’m very glad to hear you’ve got your feet under you. I see the company is French, are you in Paris? I’m just curious because you don’t hear that kind of story every day.
homeless guy writing poems on the street to survive, applies to agency job on indeed and gets it. would you be willing to provide the cheat codes brother? haha
I always wondered what happened to the dude from Before Sunrise who sold the poem to Jesse and Celine.
This can’t be true. I’ve been working in the ad space for almost a decade with some of the largest agencies in the world. Ever since Covid I lost most of my clients and apply to all sorts of jobs with a ton of the smaller boutique agencies and get ghosted every time. Jobs even so entry level that 5 years ago I would never consider.
T'es dans quel secteur/boîte ? T'es en CDI plutôt qu'intermittent j'imagine ?
for every 1 person that has a story like this 1000 of them overdose and die in the streets. you're insanely lucky.
I can only speak for the UK but there's a crazy amount of jobs right now. The only thing I see being a negative are editors who cut long form are unable to work with this new wave of fast paced social content or they are expecting a higher salary.
Oh that's kinda cool.  How'd you get into that?
[deleted]
Yeah the backlog is real right now, Especially in production. Lots of reshoots for shows that had to hiatus haven't even shot yet. Still waiting on scheduling conflicts with talent and locations to clear. New principal is in the same boat. Network tv seems to be farther along however I mainly deal in features
I really, really, really, really hope so. I got plenty of contacts but everyone I speak to is in the same boat right now.

Everyone's saying that it's gonna come back something fierce in the spring...I'm just counting down the days.
On staff at a small studio in Atlanta.
>The real way is true networking, and I don’t mean forums/FB groups, etc. Im not sure where you live, but you gotta find out where the decisions makers hang. You get like 5 people, you can always pivot around. If they trust you, then you’re on their list. Shits always being made, especially in the feature world. 🤙🏼.

Features are slowly picking up. Most of the ones I hear about are aiming to shoot abroad in case Iaste strikes...they could keep going.
Yeah that’s why I was asking for details
Yeah i think thats going to be the norm.    


Get some passionate people that are at the bottom of the pole.  Pay them less and let the AI help boost those people to new heights.  AI can answer so many questions.  It gives the average person super powers.  But when everyone becomes super, suddenly, no one isnt.
I got a social media job during covid over everyone else with degrees and who was way more qualified than me and I have no experience in social media, the trick was I told the owner of the company  I will work and he can pay me whatever he wants as money is of no value to me.
To add, the only reason the bottom hasn't fallen out yet is simply institutional investing, followed by lobbying for gen z to "just keep renting! It's great not to own things!" Thus locking in the subscription economy for everything and effectively ensuring an entire generation lives in financial servitude in perpetuity. Laws need to be written to severely limit institutional ownership of single family homes and it needs to happen now.    


A few state govs have bills on ballots to start doing this...hence, don't go into real estate. Bubble go boom.
I will be goddamned before I learn motion graphics. I respect those that do it, but I refuse to do the job of two people. More power to you, and you're absolutely right, I have turned down loads of commercial/corporate jobs because they asked me about AE. Nope, won't do it.
Yeah... That's where I'm at - I'm in TV which has been mostly good for 15+ years, but this downturn is brutal and I'm looking to diversify by getting in some corporate work
I know buddy.  I know.
I’d encourage you to explore Premiere’s “new” tools, they have features like transcript editing, auto audio editing, etc.

I’m utilizing a beta software that is not yet available to the public that expands on the text editing software, using a ChatGPT-esquece text box to make avid/premiere pull specific selects in interviews based on a topic you feed it. E.g: you can ask it to pull every bite that mentions family, it’ll create a sequence and organize all of the bites in minutes. That’s something that should be available to the public soon, so keep an eye out for it (I’m unsure if I can disclose the name atm).

All AI tools are still very new and quickly evolving. It’ll take some proactivity to keep up to speed with new releases, following AI news, and or even following creators who often showcase AI tools, like Premiere Gal.

It’ll take time for our career to become obsolete, if it ever happens. I believe something like editing will still need a human supervising the process if it ever comes to that, and those who stand out will be the ones who are well versed in those tools vs those who are resistant to it. Of course it’s something difficult to predict, and sadly we’re not alone in experiencing industry wide changes.
You really made this shift? I always wanted to try CGI, but I thought it’s way too saturated and outsourced a lot. I have a descent rig for it as well. A 3090 with a 5950x. How do you get started once you learn it, put together a demo yourself?
I have a friend who posted screenshots of all the apps like doordash being full.
[deleted]
I'm quite confused what you are talking about.  What negotiations? 
 What is a "CAT"?

curious to know.
Cathy blew it in 21. She needs to go. 
It’s good if you can get in. But infosec is extremely oversaturated. And it’s also not an entry level job/position. No one is gonna hire you without previous IT experience of some sort. (Unless you get lucky)
Anything you find online about need in infosec is old. The field is saturated with people who have Sec+ and want a job. Entry level infosec needs 4+ years in IT.
As one who lost his job to a lower paid editor so the company can invest in AI, it’s reality to me-no fear-mongering here. Here’s hoping you aren’t making too much $$ in the eyes of your employer. Reality is a bitch. Companies will pare the upper levels and the lower levels and all the rest of you lucky slugs will be working twice as hard with less help. Good luck!
Sure but you’ll need 1-2 human operators plus AI to do the same job it used to take 50 humans to do. 

That’s the problem.
> sublet your room and couchsurf! i have a fuckin newborn man lol

My lease agreement also forbids it.

> perfect time to figure out how to begin some new career tracks 💀

Thats what this was supposed to be about, not learning how these two people started their careers and what cities they moved to. What a waste of nearly 2 hours.
Referring to new unscripted production. Should have been clearer.
That’s really sad to read. You have my full support and best wishes. What a wild industry we’re in.
Maybe check out data annotation as extra side gig. Work own hours whenever you want.  Not a guarantee but a nice side one if it happens
I also got a nice job in social media for a computer store, the trick was to say salary is of no  concern and you will work for free and let them pay you how much they want
It was the only job available after the recession
They won’t LET me shoot video 🤣. I’ve asked! I’m kind of particular when it comes to my video in a reel (as we all should be) and sometimes I think I have a better eye than my other 2 shooters but, oh well.
We’re all waiting to see what happens with the IATSE. Hoping negotiations are all good. I think it will be insane in about a month if they don’t strike. 🙏🏼
Oh nice.
Think you need to post in the country to get the incentives though.
Sorry, I’m having a hard time keeping up with the conversation. You know- gen x-er here. Lol. Official word was they eliminated my position due to AI but the reality is they hired someone who makes way less and are investing the rest in AI.
>  Laws need to be written to severely limit institutional ownership of single family homes and it needs to happen now. 

never happening lol. blackrock et al. are some of the largest donors to both sides

at this point, your only practical entry into home ownership is either inheriting it from your boomer parents who bought a house for $20 in 1997 or by getting a job at a MAG7 company
Where are you located? (if you don't mind me asking)
Omg I feel so bad I never replied. I took a break from Reddit. I really did make the shift. It’s NOT over saturated and there’s so much work it’s insane.

It’s most definitely not easy to learn, but I would start at some point just to start grasping it. I see more and more people want CGI as it’s cheaper than shoots and you can change about anything. 

Fortunately I work full time for a very large tech company who allowed me to just move around so I didn’t have to really pitch anything. But demo reals help. I would try to get work at an agency not independent as a lot of work people want will be too large for one system and one person to support.
That’s wild.
Im in the IT world.  Web Development, scripting and automation.  ChatGPT 4 can generate snippets of code well and it does a great job of getting alot of things done in my line of work.  I just finished reading the Sora AI website and i feel bad cause alot of small videographic gigs might go down.  


I've known some digital artists whose gigs dried up because MidJourney was capable of generating art similar to theres.  Just now i was able to generate my own wallpapers.  All i had to do was prompt and Midjourney was able to create all kinds of wallpapers for my Desktop.  

Im not saying AI is going to replace everybody but i feel like alot of jobs that are in the "lower part" of the totem pole might get cut.  Small gigs.  Such as myself.  I use to specialize in creating these small pieces of codes that would make a good impact at companies but now ChatGPT can generate those codes fairly fast and efficiently .     


Im surprised and shocked to see that AI making an impact in so many industries.  And when AI becomes AGI, i seriously dont know what would come of the world.  This all feels super surreal to me.
People want real photographs not AI slop
Let me know when Ai can show up at events to capture things in real time.
IATSE is entering into negotiations with the studios in about a week just like the DGA, WGA, and SAG did so there is potentially another big strike coming this summer. CAT are "Contract Action Teams" that are supposed to be the people in between the board and the membership keeping everyone informed about the plans for the negotiations but the board in their infinite wisdom has forgotten that would involve telling the CAT team members anything at all.
I know Cathy is beloved but when youre in charge while things get worse for almost a decade straight maybe theres a problem.
Idk what infosec is
Hey, thanks a lot. I sometimes come here to post advice to new editors because I don’t want them to make the same mistakes that i made. Many of us didn’t have mentors or *any* pathways to follow. The road to advancing had many gate keepers, and it was pretty expensive to be an editor once upon a time. Those factors created exclusivity. A lot has changed. 

There’s certainly a future for the art of video editing. It’s just that the way these stories are told will be very different. Sometimes, when i think about my time in Los Angeles between 2000-2020, I’m dumbstruck by the speed of technological growth.  The floodgate opened with more distribution outlets,  cheaper access to more powerful tools, and the once voracious appetite of digital platforms to fill space with anything for people to consume becoming standard.

 It’s arguable that as movies and TV have moved from away from art, and into the realm of product and commodity, where we’ve landed with AI and industry constriction was an inevitability.  

I’m not saying this as some sort of foo-foo indictment of commerce over artistry. Just a statement of fact. I think the tools are amazing. I only wished that the infrastructure supporting this industry that makes the wonderful things we watch had a pipeline that trickled down.  That didn’t feel like a scam or house of cards at every new production. 

I’m only sad that I never had a ‘career’.  I came into this industry in ignorance, and that’s my own fault. I’ve been reaching back and having 1 on 1 conversations with as many recent transplants as I can.  My old undergrad, isn’t equipping these kids with the right tools to thrive.  Skill certainly matters in this town, but social matters a whole lot more. 

I was a nerd that kept my nose clean, stayed out of trouble, stayed ambitious, treated people kindly, payed it forward as often as I could, and really REALLY loved storytelling. The world changed and, unfortunately, i didn’t change rapidly enough with it. That’s on me. 

My job is to make sure that isn’t on the NEXT person.
Negotiations dont end until the end of July...
While I mostly agree with the cynicism here, at some point kids are voting are becoming elected officials. So. There is hope. Unless they, too, grow to like money more than people.
New York
Im curious though from an editing perspective, can Sora achieve that? Transitions, effects, etc.. Or will that come in the future
People, yes. A drug company making a commercial for whatever-the-hell, no.
Unless the cost differential makes it too tempting. 10K for a day's shoot plus talent and editing VS 1K for an AI facsimile. Don't be left behind. Investigate the tech objectively.

You wish
There are already plenty of robot cams doing this. Has been for years. I worked at a major news station in a top 5 market in 2015 and the entire studio crew was let go except one guy that oversaw the robot cameramen that could operate a jib, pan, zoom, dolly in and dolly out all on its own. I remember thinking how odd it was to watch a live news broadcast with no one behind the cameras running the show.
[deleted]
She shouldn't be beloved.  She totally blew it in 21.  Editors guild voted to take that deal after rejecting in 18 (when she was going against leadership).  If she had asked for a no vote on the 21 contract we would have rejected it and either gone back to the drawing board or gone on strike during boom times.  We would have been in a far better position to get a deal quickly when the streaming bubble hadn't burst.

Now we're way behind the 8 ball.  The hourly contribution gains we received from the last contract for the pension and health are entirely eroded by all IATSE not working last year.  She and all the rest of the leadership need to go after not preparing for 2021.  It's something that will fuck us for a long time.  


And now we're sabre rattling at a time when membership is depleted both financially and mentally.  They ALL need to go.
Information security or cybersecurity.
You’re a good person. I hope there are plenty more like you out there!
But we’re gonna know a ton in month. You can always tell with the jump point where it’s gonna land.
Damn, I don't have contacts on the east coast. Was hoping to throw you a bone.
Today, I think of Sora as a stock library. You can probably find something, but it may have problems, and it won’t match your original footage. And like stock, you probably can’t source as much coherent footage as you’d like to have.
Those haven’t been traditional photography for nearly a decade now.
I saw an image I *think* was AI on a USC web ad today
Im actively working with the tech with major clients. It takes way more guiding hands than is actually worth it, and that’s unlikely to change ever for a multitude of reasons and it if it does there’s far bigger issues than you or I’s jobs
Na, if anything the novelty will wear off
Me and anyone with taste, yeah.
That is interesting, but not really a live event , that would still be a studio. I mean a live event like a party, wedding, concerts etc. where nothing is static and you have to be on top of the action. But hey who know's with this shit now a days.
The only thing I took away from this is how much you don't understand the event/wedding business. Just bangwagoning, oh everyone with a camera can do this shpeal.
But we got to check a box that said we identify as "dual flame"! That was way more important than asking about our health care concerns or fixing the health care she allowed to get infinitely worse.
From what theyve told me, publicly and privately, its not going to start off looking like an easy negotiation. They want to put up a heck of a front.
I'd say it's most likely the limits of the technology will become more clear. Whether it's a matter of control, or price, or even law. The recent acceleration of these new tools is not endless, because we don't live in a fantasy. In a way I suppose I could agree with that being called "the novelty wearing off."

The enthusiasm behind AI reminds me of way back in 2000 when everyone was afraid 3D would replace actors forever because of the Final Fantasy movie. Twenty years later, that hasn't quite panned out as suggested.
That is some grade-A copium.
cope more dude. reminds me of everybody complaining when photography went from film to digital lol or in the 90's when 3D/VFX replaced practical fx 

you need to adapt. if you prefer human made content, charge more for it. It's going to be boutique and artisinal, and a market of its own.
That was almost a decade ago, if you think the tech hasn’t advanced far past that by now you’re very wrong. Go take a look at what robot cams are doing in things like sports and major concert events. It’s wild.
U2 show at Sphere in Vegas could use some of that

ALso can't blame soley Cathy for the health care situation.  She fought the good fight for most of her years.  After 2018 Loeb made her pay and she held the company line since then.
I’ve heard the same, but I’ve also heard from people at the studios. They know how much they’re gonna lose if the strike happens. With all these productions trying to get started after last strike, they can’t afford it. They are so backlogged it’s insane…they are only now getting their footing, they can’t afford a long strike
The models are already hapsberging themselves. We are in a stage right now where all these firms are grossly overstating the capabilities of these models, so they can pump up their financials. Look at the sora stuff, they meticulously curated what they showed and even that stuff barely holds up to any discerning eye.
How exactly am I coping? My job is safe, have survived three rounds of layoffs (that had nothing to do with AI), and in fact was promoted. I’m on the round table for innovation at my company, we are implementing AI workflows, and they actually require more man hours to get any sort of consistent, quality results that hold up to any sort of scrutiny. It’s not the crutch y’all think it is.
By all means, feel free to put all your eggs into this basket.
We do not have robots walking around events recording footage. I guess I should preface that with "yet," because everybody wants to talk about what's coming someday instead of what's currently happening. Concerts sometimes have robot cameras locked on a track in front of a stage moving left to right, or (human-operated) drones occasionally getting a wide shot.

News isn't really comparable because it's one set that uses the same locked angles day after day. Of course that automation has been happening for a long time now, it's old news (couldn't resist, sorry). And sports have some cool shots like you mentioned, with cameras moving along elevated tracks.

But the price and tech barrier of having a reliable, mobile AI robo camera moving amongst a crowd? That's fantasy talk right now, and even in 20 years surely more expensive than hiring a camera operator.
Now you are starting to make more sense with this thoughtful reply. I have to agree who want's fake photos? You could just have a fake event as well. I think there will still be a market for having a person help capture the moments as they happen, and not use Ai to fake it. But as this tech develops I'm sure it will be forced into every area, for good or bad reasons.

And I still believe you are devaluing professional experience vrs cost, just because you think anyone can do this. I hope your mechanic isn't your 9 year old nefew, because ya know anyone can do this stuff.
She released a statement saying she didnt even feel like asking us our thoughts on health care because she feels like she knew enough and didnt want our feedback. On the other hand......dual flame!

> After 2018 Loeb made her pay and she held the company line since then.

If she was done fighting she couldve quit and gotten us someone else who would try.
Neither side can afford an actual strike, but posturing in the first months? They can both afford that.
How do I go back to the old UI?
The new new Reddit UI sucks ass.  It looks ugly and nothing is where it should be.  Clicking on a post sends you to an entirely new page instead of just opening the post.  

And there's no option to go back to the old UI, at least that I can find.  

But right now as I'm typing this post, it has the old reddit UI.  Why can't I keep this UI on my screen all the time?

Also this is on a laptop, not a mobile device.  
for now, changing your URL to [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) seems to fix it.

... I already spent 3 weeks in this beta, and got removed from it, why is it back??

I already opted out of betas ofc, it just dosn't seem to be respected.
Just happened to me and seems bugged to all he'll and insanely large fonts
You can't even go to comments on a post now without resetting your scroll back to the top... I guess if anything I'm not going to be using Reddit as much because of this. Whoever designed this update should get fired it's trash. Why would they get rid of the pop-out window for posts?? It completely redirects you to the actual post URL and there's no way back to your homepage/popular/all, without just going back and it resets you to the top.
Just got switched to this myself - found new.reddit about 2 minutes later.  Reddit - I know you don't care about my opinion, but the new UI is absolutely terrible.  The font, the use of bold, they layout, all of it.  Abysmal failure.
Trying desperately to figure this out. I was one of the people who loved the first redesign right from the beginning, but this new one hurts my eyes and all of the posts bleed into each other.
This just happened to me for the THIRD TIME. And I'm opted out of beta. I really hate the format. I just had to complain here because its all I can do.
Is this u/spez revenge for the protests? Wtf ive been put in this terrible “beta” like 5 times now and can never find a good fix for mobile. Everytime I get put back to this terrible ui i stop using reddit as much until it finally reverts but then it always comes back like a curse. It is getting really annoying, i wouldnt care if it was just an option but why are we forced into it? All i see is people complain about it, not a single positive comment. Clearly reddit doesn’t care though
Reddit, you better make my layout go back to as it was. This it the second time you have done this. Its freaking awful & makes using the website unusable. Revert it now you stupid bish
God what is this?  Please let me back to the same UI layout i've been using for years.  This is hideous.  Everything is too big.  Who thinks this is a good idea?
It's actually impressive how fucking horrible this new UI looks. Like if they designed it with the goal of creating one the worst UIs on the internet then they fucking nailed it alright
I 100% use only old.reddit.com and am not sure what I'll do if they try to sweep that away.
The solution is to change the url to [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com), like other commentors have already said. However, you can use an extension so you don't have to type that in manually every time you visit a new reddit page:

Install [redirector on Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd?hl=en). There's a Firefox version as well.

Configure it [like this](https://i.imgur.com/LDYROPX.jpg) for reddit

This has been working for me. You can use any reddit url as the example url (I just copied the url of a 5 year old post that used this exact solution when they wanted to redirect to "old reddit").
Just happened to me, and now scrolling Reddit on my phone is torture. Is there some kind of avenue for feedback where I can tell them I hate this and I hope whoever designed gets IBS?
The new-new design doesn't have widescreen support...? for some reason? It's 2023 ffs!
They just changed mine back to the old UI 15 minutes ago.

Edit: They changed mine back to the new one again 😡🙄
I had it for a few days and then it went back to normal on its own. But it just came back today and I can’t stand it.

Edit: wait it just went back to normal again. I have no idea what’s happening anymore.
I was trying to figure out why my interface on this site suddenly looked like trash. A lot of wasted space with a sidebar to the left I can't collapse. Text on the middle, the one part of the site I care about, is suddenly smaller. The bar to the right has barely any info but is now full of recommendations from subs I literally could not care less about.

This interface is not just objectively worse, it's completely atrocious. If there is a way to opt out I'd like to know.
Please change this back reddit!
The scolling is broken. Pages worked perfectly and I could scroll without repeat content.
I plan to stay off until this is fixed. Impossible to use without it reloading back to the top.
This is fucking awful. Thought there were enough complaints a couple weeks ago when I saw the new layout so they scrapped it...but it's back. Absolutely awful
This is painful.

Not even new.reddit is working to get rid of the card format for me on mobile. If it's not reverted guess it's an easy way to give up this site.
This is just atrocious. What kind of designers do they hire? Stop it, no one wants bigger card view to scroll through. LITERALLY NO ONE. STOP IT NOW.
Yeah this is horrible.  So much slower and looks like shit, infinite scrolling, doesnt show my joined communities, I mean come on.  Is this permanent?
WTF? Where is compact view?
The current layout is extremely narrow, and the `new.reddit.com` is exactly the same, it improves nothing in this regard.

[old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/) is the one that looks like it should.
I've been using my alt reddit account since they nuked my other account with this awful update. Now they added it to this account. Everything about it sucks! It is harder to read threads. Also, noticing a delay in the typing, apparently they are recording keystrokes now so we have to type even slower. Seriously Reddit?
oh this is terrible. The editor, all the extra icons everywhere. The plus signs. Clicking anything opens a new page with less stuff, and it is too busy.

yuk yuk yuk
The new one you can't search in the post I've noticed, which i like to do.  I'm not a fan.
This new one is much harder to read and differentiate one post from the next. I find it pushing my eyes away. The various greys on black was perfect enough compared to what they've done. This shade of blue with the white text is so awfully glaring.
Reddit Enhancement Suite + old.reddit.com

Best way to browse imo
Every good website eventually hires a designer that thinks they know better than their users, and then the website rapidly undergoes enshittification
The new mobile page is so cancerous with its additional and more intrusive advertisements. I finally just installed an Adblock on iPhone safari to get rid of them. Hate this new mobile UI.
I got a new new ui once and I hated it, I was able to bring back the old new ui by using the preferences to switch to old and then back to new.
Worse design ever -\_-
My biggest issue for now(since i immediately found new.reddit and change to it) is the "Bell" icon didn't show you a notification table but makes you go to new page, what's crazy is in the notification page there's the notification table.
This is one ugly ass new UI. Absolutely disgusting. Whoever designed this, shame on you.
Not everything needs to look like Twitter ffs
The new UI is really terrible and not user friendly. If the goal was to chase away users then mission accomplished.
yes it is hideous ... also notifications are not working now

example: i posted something on r/ecobee and had 4 likes on it and a comment from person and notifications never told me anything about it ...

i tried the [https://new.reddit.com/](https://new.reddit.com/) link and my home page is fixed now but my notifications seems to be stuck on earlier comments. nothing new is happening ...

seriously why did you have to mess everything up?

if i load in a old account it seems to be working fine but this one is not. how do i fix this??

i can't keep making a new account every time DEVs decide to play with reddit format nor should i have to!...

EDIT: apparently comments i made while under new format are lost to me permanently. as this comment posted in notifications just fine using link given above ...
It's so widespread this stuff. Literally even Deviantart users be like "first time?" When it comes to a website forcing everyone to use an obviously more mobile oriented interface with a lack of page turn buttons and a whole lot more scrolling. It's really quite depressing.
Massive new Facebook interface vibes from this. We’ll all have to suffer and adapt I guess, just another shitass fucking thing.
You don't.
Since I know that this post is going to be shown when people search for ways to restore the old UI, [https://new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) now acts as a redirect to the official website. No old UI anymore.
THANK YOU SO MUCH THE NEW UI IS UGLY AS HELL
Is it a feature that there is almost half a screen worth of free space on the website?  
Both of the margins on the side are like 20-25% of the screen. This monitor is like 500 dollars, so they're actively screwing me out of at least 200 dollars (ik that's not how it really works but it helps me complain)
Have noticed this sometime ago but working fine now for me.
Just came here to say I HATE the new UI.
The web site is just horrible now. Dark mode was fine before, but now it has a painful amount of excessive contrast on a PC display. Also, I guess they think I got tired of my multireddits, so they removed that section from the sidebar.
Please i hate this and I hate the comment thread stuff
opting out in the profile settings took it way to the old.reddit layout, haha

this new-new one is truly awful.
I hate this, I've also opted out of betas, and yet I have this garbage ass new mobile style ui.
I also hate the new UI. Somehow ended up with it on my desktop. Forced to click to open all kinds of comments. Switched to only using reddit on my phone. Now my phone ended up with the new UI.

I do not want to be forced to click to read every other comment on a post. Clicking on the bottom to load more comments is fine.
I hate that the username no longer appears on posts that are displayed on the homepage, does anyone know of a way to get that back?
Yeah this change pretty much makes reddit unusable...
unironically, who ever is responsible for that, drive into a ditch

at this point there is no discussion to be had anymore
Clicked posts don't grey out anymore, so I have to remember if I have seen a post before or not. Annoying
fuck reddit

fuck musk

and fuck npc-rogan
I thought I was free and now it's back please save me
seriously, why is this layout back? i was put in the beta for it before and hated it, and now mobile reddit is basically unusable again, with ghost notifications that won't go away. it's super annoying. maybe reddit saw that people hated the new discord mobile UI and just thought everyone wouldn't notice them roll out this crap again.
This new UI is god awful, it looks like a child made it.
Are they trying to speed run the category "how to kill a website just by switching the interface" ?
Add me to the list of people that was switched with no notice and find it unusable. I finally had mostly switched to "new" reddit but this latest version has lost a lot of functionality and is visually unappealing.
How can we fix this? Suddenly everything looks awful. I need to get everything back in it's place. Anyone got any ideas?

  
To reddit : revert everything back ffs. This is dogshit.
That's what I want to know, it just changed for me on mobile. True black is gone and every post and comment are blending together.
Ughhh the side bar with my communities in no longer has my custom feed in it either
On my tablet I've got a sidebar full of unrelated stuff on the right hand side. I can't scroll through comments with my right hand thumb any more. It's horrible to use. I really hope they undo this.
Just opened reddit on mobile chrome for the first time today, and I somehow am looking at the prior UI again. Definitely not complaining here other than for it not to change again.
same here. I hate when reddit drafts people randomly to try out their new shitty interface.  this UI is garbage.  everything you do navigates you away to a different page, its like it was designed by someone in the 1990s who accidently ran into a Google Material Design pamphlet
I quite like the redesign, other than the notifications. If only they'd stick to one, lol. It's quite a bit snappier.

Okay, it's horrible. I thought the stuff at the side were collapsible. And it seems to take too much memory.
The thing I hate about the new UI is that I can't see my karma anymore. It's stupid.
every modern UI re-design is just white space everywhere, ridiculous.  Why did we invent this big monitors and screens?  Why are be going backwards?  They want us to use smaller and smaller screens?  Why?  stop it, I am not playing games on my phone, nor watching movies, and for sure not trading stocks, lol... just stop...why are all these companies so obsessed with me doing everything on my phone?
clicking on notification takes half hour now thanks i wont be on reddit until they change back to the old UI
the ui is literally slower, it takes ages to open a post
I don't know where I am supposed to go/be. It is quite obvious, as I have been permanently banned in 4 categories in less than 2 weeks, and I don't even know why. I have also been temporarily 'quieted' from finding out why I have been banned. I only wanted to be considerately explained to as to why I was being banned, and was getting nowhere, when the next thing I know, I am being temporarily 'quieted.'
This is really no way to maintain a clientele.
I await your response.

New new Reddit sucks bad. 

Sometimes opens things in new tabs sometimes doesn’t. Sometimes back button works correctly. Other times it just keeps reloading the same page until it just sends you back to the Reddit home page. It’s so bad and inconsistent. 

The cynic in me thinks they just do it to promote their own app.
what new UI?
I wrote a small Tampermonkey script that replaces "www" with "new"

[https://pastebin.com/LD1nhWCF](https://pastebin.com/LD1nhWCF)
Merci ! La nouvelle interface c'est vraiment quelque chose... Elle est nul et inutilisable...
Thanks for this....the new UI is fucking unusable. Why they thought side bars taking up 70% of the screen on desktop and only having 1.5 post titles visible in the viewing area was even remotely acceptable to test with is so far beyond me........
You think Reddit, or any social media respects its users?  Got some bad news for ya lol
You mean change it to old.reddit.com, right?
This does not work on Chrome mobile. Well it gives you a different UI, but not the one I had 3 hours ago
That works until you click on a notification or link, it goes back to [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com) :/
holy shit, thank you for the link!
My fucking hero.
>I already opted out of betas ofc, it just dosn't seem to be respected.

I guess It's out of beta - we're all getting this UI now. It's horrendous.
is this the best solutions so far to get the old reddit back permanently ?
Thanks, this helped.
omg thank you so much <3
Thank you!
Thanks!
This just gets reddit blocked by my workplace's filters unfortunately
Thanks, I needed this. The latest UI doesn't make it possible to add a sub to a custom feed.
That was working earlier but as of about fifteen minutes ago it's no longer working for me. I just get a blank white screen most of the time. Every once in a while, part of the page will load, but not all of it (e.g. the subreddit's sidebar doesn't work and just shows blank boxes)
Me too. I was in the first beta a few weeks ago and now I'm in this new version, which looks completely different from the previous version. I do not want to keep changing layouts. I'm on mobile view for reference.
That URL does not work.
I would have given an award if i had one... Thanks
Thank God!
just did it ... still works well ... I nearly cancelled my account ... take my upvotee  ...
[deleted]
I love you <3
Worked for me, thank you.

The new UI is the worst interface I have ever encountered with
I used it for the last 2 months but it stopped working yesterday...
Thanks so much dude, the new UI is unbearable. Have you found a solution to make this permanent though?
You are a life saver, many thanks.
Thankyou man!!! I was so irritated by the new UI. Comments section is the worst.
Same doesnt work at all. Wasn't even able to post comments. Switched back to the old old UI design for now.
>seems bugged to all he'll and insanely large fonts

Reddit in a nutshell. New Reddit was and still is a dumpster fire as well as every official app they've ever released.
Its also really bad taste to make changes during the Holidays....most companies adopt a "no changes" policy during this time. People out on time off and you don't want things to break. I feel bad for the people needing to work on this this month now.
And the 'card' messages are too thicc... I want the compact list style X_x;
please yes
top comment for a solution :)
[removed]
Happened to me 2nd time. And each time that I'm opted in this testing, the reddit format is different!!

I'm also opted out in my settings but I guess Reddit doesn't care about those settings. Then why have those settings in the first place?
Every website does this dumb thing where they completely redesign their shit for no reason. I think they just have web designers trying to justify their pay check. If they don't make changes, they get fired.
Same. I guess it's time for a reddit break until this new ui mess goes back to normal
Yes, they actually managed to be worse than imdb.
That does not look like what I had this morning at all
worked for me thanks.
Thank you, it works. I hope they don't ruin this one as well with that awful interface.
good tip!
thank you! I changed my bookmark and so far so good. [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com)
tysm it works for me, for now
That works great for threads, but seems to break Reddit-based images when you click on them and Reddit opens the image in a new window.
for anyone seeing this: there’s a similar extension on macOS for Safari and it works perfectly!
it's just porting their mobile UI to desktop... I have a 1920x1080 and 3440x1440 monitor, I feel like I went to a website made with the 90's mentality that people only have 4:3 monitors. but they also wanted something that felt modern.
Same with me. I'm very grateful. Thank you reddit! Now keep it like this.

Edit: shit, back to the crappy new one again. Why.
Please reddit gods, fix my shit next too. This is awful.
How did you get them to do so? Where all have you posted about it?
[removed]
i thought i accidently set my desktop to open some sort of mobile version of reddit, i hope they do not keep this layout.
Use old.reddit.com until they break that and then leave the site for good. That's my plan at least
Everything sucks
*thieves*
Scrolling time/10
Reminds me of my second FB experience (& last)
for the people that want the OLD old interface, sure, old. is great, new. however for now is just to bypass the current "mobile UI for everyone" nonsense.  
It does nothing if you aren't rolled into this involuntary beta test.
Sorry to hear that, I'm on desktop, so can only verify that it's working there.

hopefully a workaround can be found for you soon, or they stop this nonsense..
As a more convenient solution I found a firefox addon called "Old New Reddit Redirect" that automatically does it for me, thus preventing links and such from taking me to the experiment,

[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-new-reddit-redirect/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-new-reddit-redirect/)

There are many similar addons for the other browsers.
It's the same as last time for me, it's still a tablet/mobile UI forced onto a desktop browser.

Absurd idea, it's absolutely unusable.
I don't know what the security issue is, but I'm not a fan of google, and don't have chrome anywhere, it's working fine in firefox and vivaldi at least, on desktop.
well that's not good news.. sounds like they might be planning to force the new UI, and screw the people that don't like it..
for Firefox, there's this addon, that seems to work quite well.

[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/old-new-reddit-redirect/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/old-new-reddit-redirect/)

I don't use chrome or chromium enough to have found one for those browsers.

But usually these "not really a beta test" phases only last a few weeks, and you will be out "soon"
What are those bananas?
>  I think they just have web designers trying to justify their pay check.

This. And of course web designers know what's best for users.
Are you talking about the old, old reddit layout? If so I think you can change the word "new" to "old" in the Redirect To field
its like we are going backwards, so weird.
It just happened on it's own.
Honestly I think they’re just randomly experimenting on us and it goes away in its own eventually. 

I can tell you that if you’re on mobile you can get back to normal if you tap on the notifications bell and then go back a page, but you have to do it for every page. Hopefully that helps a bit until it goes back to normal for you.
I totally missed there was a brand new new pile of shit dropped on you all, I am sorry.
i never opt as beta test and they change my ui to as of today. damn this is worst af
No not that one either. I didn’t know people were seeing some other version than what I saw
[removed]
it doesn't even support widescreen... like how in the fuck are you not gonna support widescreen in 2023
Yeah, the official excuse is apparently that it's fine because it's somehow "not a beta test"

It's a limited test of unfinished features, which they want feedback on, here specifically: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf8Cx6LszflP8gSslmMj1lSh4Rt6QKEytLaxG9bE-o0PkT6Q/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf8Cx6LszflP8gSslmMj1lSh4Rt6QKEytLaxG9bE-o0PkT6Q/viewform)

.. but it's "not a beta test" somehow, so they don't feel the need to respect our preferences on that.

(I forgot who said it's officially not a beta test, think it was an admin post, but I cant find it right now)
>  I thought it was just that magical un-installing thing

What is that?
They think phones are all there is lmao

Glad I could help :)
Am I a “Pro” yet?
7700X | 4070 Ti Super “Pro Art” build
oh thats such a good match for that case
I know that board for the x8/x8x/x4 biconfiguration it does, very good
Anyone  can look like a pro if they have the right amount of money 🤭 Nice build ♥️
Sure are in my eyes 😍 I love ProArt!!
Uhm... you forgot to plugin the GPU
Hot damn what cpu cooler is that?
No shot of it inside the case?
Gyatt
Bro has 80+ Gold PC.
Sheesh, that is an attractive card & build. What case is that?
Can you put a photo with the GPU in also? That build looks clean
Not yet, you need a ProArt Display
That black and gold is slick as hell.
plot twist , gpu won't fit that's why it's out , pfff "pro"
It’s beautiful, and expensive.
Yes!! Also props on the T create ram, I've been eyeing that for a little bit when I do PC parts picker builds. Great ram tbh. Looks super clean with the proart kit

Why don't mods make a rule to have people list all their parts in these posts since that's what everyone ends up asking them anyways?

I freaking love the aesthetic of the ProArt stuff!  Slick looking build!  Awesome work!

\m/
You have much to learn yet, grasshopper! Good start though.
I did the same combo and I fucking love it! Congrats homie
That looks really really neat, subtle is way nicer than loud
It helps if that thing is on the inside..
very elegant
Great aesthetics man! Loved it
Damn that black and gold looks sick!
Fractal has been killing it with cases over the last year or so
This is the most photogenic thing I've ever seen. It givese me happy chemicals.
Dude, almost the same build here lol
Fractal north with TG, proart rtx 4070, thermalright PA

Now that looks like Art
Not yet, you need to put it into the system and power it up!
Thats a fucking piece of Art
Oh my, personally I wouldn’t spend extra money on it, but I will admit without hesitation, that the ProArt design DOES look amazing. Subtle, yet elegant. I love this build!
That's soy pc. you would get litterly same performance for same money with 7500f and budget E chipset board. Why did you do such terible mistake? But it doesnt metter it looks sick with that cooler and mobo hetsinks combo. beoutiful internals. Maybe get nylon wrapped 30 cm atx12v extension with some wire comb to organize cables to 2x7 pattern . it would look sick.

Only if your name is Art!
That CPU cooler is MASSIVE
Not until you get the display too lol
Your not a pro until you break the glass panel for your case.
You're missing the ProArt AIO:

I love the way the ProArt series looks, I just don't really like Asus
Pro art cooler sucks. 😅😂
Without RGB, even a 4090 isn't pro, because RGB boosts fps
I don’t see how yall can stand that CPU cooler. Just get an AIO it’s going to look way better.
It's time to fucking pwn some n00bz!
Beautiful!
"What's in the Box"
What are you going to do on it?
Profart
Your GPU isn't fully slotted in. You're only utilizing the x0 PCIe lanes like that.
Nope, should have gotten the FF04 case specifically made for the 4070 Ti Pro Art
Um, are you getting paid? All the word "professional" means is you get paid for whatever it is you are talking about. Somehow people mistake that as being good at something or whatever you are trying to say by it. Anywho, no. I'm pretty sure you are not getting paid for having that PC.
Thanks I love how it all came together!
Yah I wasn’t thrilled at spending this much on my motherboard but I needed USB4/Thunderbolt capability.
That bottom slot is actually PCI-E 4.0 x2, not x4
Ain’t that the truth! Thanks ❤️
I historically am not a big ASUS guy, but these products have officially won me over!
No bro it’s actually wireless 🤪
Deep Cool Assassin 4!
Sorry I took these before I slid it in. :(
I don’t know what that means 😂
Fractal Define North ❤️ mine is a mesh side model they also do tempered glass.
I can’t add a picture I’m sorry :(
I'm confused how he adds the GPU unless he doesn't slot into the pcie x16 slot but the lower smaller pcie
[removed]
That’s what the Apple Studio Display does! 😉
bruh he also needs dat pro art 360mm aio if that exists
I love the accents in gold on everything!
Come on this isn’t my first rodeo 🤪
No kidding, and nothing was on any type of sale, really timed this lovely for maximum cost.
My OCD made me, had to match the board but also checked QVL lists for the board and these were the only T Create listed, 0 issues posting with EXPO/XMP profile loaded for 6000MHz CL34 I believe.

Thank you!
Thanks ☺️
Right!
1000% I want them to do a CPU COOLER non AIO 😭
Oh those are the best kind 😉
Thanks 😆
Haha I did that after I took the pictures.
Thank you 😭
Thanks, that’s fair, I never thought I’d buy “that” board lol then suddenly I found myself needing a native thunderbolt board for my apple studio display lol
It already looks sick yes it costs more yes thats silly yes you can get more but hes paying the black and gold tax and I will be buying those cables and combs off etsy soon kind sir
lol darn nope
I went overkill but it’s designed well and dead silent. They certainly made a fan out of me 😉
See other comment, I use an Apple Studio Display
Nightmare fuel
Woah that looks great but I can’t stand AIOs from a noise perspective.
You and me both, I guess I’m turning a page with them.
code is 17TW8TAX
Is it really worse than the TuF?
Get outta here 😂
I actually would disagree, and it’s a noise thing. The added noises the AIO pump makes drives me insane. I use a Mac Mini and I wanted a PC to be equivalent in silence outside of obvious high load scenarios. This does that.
I don’t do multiplayer games tbh haha.
Browse the web and play games
That’s a cool case but wouldn’t have met my needs in terms of the limited motherboard selection at that size :(
So do I man I will have somthing similar soon if i can find that case in stock
wait, does the ProArt Desktop case has USB4/thunderbolt? I dont see it [in the specs](https://www.asus.com/us/displays-desktops/tower-pcs/proart/proart-station-pd5-pd500te/techspec/). 

In fact, the only USB-C port is on the top part of the case. 

can you confirm? it would be a life saver for me!
Make sure you have store warranty..
Oh really?! Is it the one where you press a button to power it or it reads that it plugs in?
DeepCool is killin it with the aesthetics lately. Love their stuff.
I was wondering what that was. I thought it was a mini itx... like a russian doll setup
Oh sorry, it means it looks good, very good 👍

Hey OP — Your post has been removed for not being in compliance with Rule 8. 

Be civil and follow Reddit's sitewide rules, this means no insults, personal attacks, slurs, brigading or any other rude or condescending behaviour towards other users.

hmmm well u do have hardware that says pro and a pcmr tshirt so u must be a pro , i believe u

I have the fractal lumen 360; the first one got RMAd due to some manufacturing issue but this second one has been working well. Sadly I need an inverted case so no fractal case for me, just a dynamic evo. Nice build, though. Been wanting to do black and gold myself at some point.
Got to say: that's one of the most clean looking systems I have ever seen!
These are 12 USD on AliExpress.
Jokes aside, they do have a very clean look. Enjoy the new ~~toy~~ workstation!
Yes. It’s very noisy just after a few months..
That was a dark souls joke :)
oh my bad. this is not a ProARt desktop. it is a ProArt motherboard.
My motherboard is Pro Art X670, case is Fractal North and I do have a USB C port on the front panel connectors but no no case alone would have a actual thunderbolt port, you need specific hardware on your motherboard and or add in cards can also give you some! Hope that helps :)
Very sleek and rated higher than Noctua that I’ve bought in the past. It’s definitely quieter.
All good, Thanks! ☺️
Yah no problem
You and me both!
oh are they post the link kind sir
YouTube runs so smooth 😭😂
Oh sorry totally over my head haha
All good, I don’t think that one you linked has one either! The chipset I believe would need to be a Z790 board not their B series chipsets.
You should try Minecraft to *really* see what it can do! 🤣😜
thanks. yes I want to upgrade from my Intel NUC 12th extreme, and I am having a tough time finding off-the shelf desktops with USB4/thunderbolt to connect my RAID boxes that require thunderbolt. am I crazy of very few desktops offer the port?

On the ProArt lineup, I only have a monitor and their studiobook 16 behemot. 120watts+ on a laptop CPU is quite a treat if one puts up with the noise of course.
Continuum Shader and Resource Pack may or may not be involved! My LinkedIn “Architect” 😂
Yah I feel like in a desktop it can be more niche where laptops at a certain level your ports just become thunderbolt by default. Worst case build one :P
You are definitely not crazy, we will see more and more USB4 boards from here on out but as far as current products go there's very few boards that offer Thunderbolt support.

I had written an extensive reply, su much so that Reddit refused to post it, so I'll keep it short.

Stay away from ProArt, as far as you can. They're embellished consumer-grade products that lack the professional features needed for their intended use. I'm returning a PA32DC tomorow and will never buy a ProArt monitor or any HDR grading monitor from Asus ever again.

In your case you have three choices:

1. You keep the current hardware and plow through the lacking features until it's time for a serious upgrade.
2. You sell all that nonsense and buy a M3 Macbook Pro or a Mac Studio. Unless you plan to work with 6K or 8K RAW footage from RED or Arri there's nothing an Apple Silicon machine won't do better than any Windows desktop build.
3. You do the same as I did and make a Threadripper 7960X + Gigabyte TRX50 Aero D build. That motherboard is literally catered to serve our use case, nothing more nothing less.

To also answer your question: no, you're not a pro yet.  
Reason isn't the hardware's quality level but rather the fact a professional would've picked either no. 2 or 3 on the list above, without stumbling into issues first.  
Remind yourself that the value within content creation is not the machines or brands behind them, but rather the ability of the creator and his own creativity. Whatever takes time and efforts away from that hinders your work more than you can afford. Moreover, clients and viewers will base their opinions on the end result and won't give a damn about what hardware you used to achieve it.  
I also am specifically tired of doing constant initial researches on products, researches on where and how to get these products, researches on how to make these products work, and so on. You do that too long you forget what you wanted to do in the first place, which is to make art. That can sometimes require more than one can give already on its own, so this whole hardware deal is driving me crazy. Hopefully this can avoid that part for you.

Bottom line is: it is not the car, it's the driver.
That's way over my head as I don't really know anything about Minecraft lol that was just the first game that came to mind that could basically run on a potato (without all the extra shaders, of course)
I dont understand reddit.
I am having trouble posting on subreddits because everytime i try to post some things i get a message from a bot that i dont have enough karma but you can only get karma from people liking your posts, but when you cant post then its pretty hard for people to like them. Can someone plz explain how this works plz I am very lost.
You can also build up karma by commenting on other posts. That's often less restricted than making posts. When someone upvotes your comments you'll get karma.
What you are running into is new user restrictions. Most subreddits have restrictions on posting and commenting based on account age, karma, or both. You can use this [List](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/wiki/index/newusersubs/) of subreddits from r/NewToReddit to start building you karma with. I would suggest commenting first for a while since some of the subreddits have small posting requirements. You can also use r/findareddit to find some others that interest you. Smaller and more niche subreddits tend to have lower restrictions. You should also check out r/NewToReddit.
Some subs have restrictions. Some don't. You can find some easy ro post at subs at r/newtoreddit
Some have that Karma protection from Spammers 

Wanted to post something in OdlyStatisfying but it has a karma cap so I couldnt… now I ended up never posting it even thou I have enough karma. Loss for them.

I „spammed“ tankporn with pictures I took during my military time to get some karma so I dont run into such problems anymore. 

That now doesnt mean u should go spam post in a Subreddit. Post for real and not just for karma.
Sometimes Reddit annoying but only one thing is good. It’s anonymous
Not all subs have this Karma requirement.

Don't just spam subs to gain Karma
I’m in the same boat right now, I know how you feel. Hopefully you’ll get quite a bit from this post though!
I gave you a up vote to get your karma up😎
Thanks so much for this post, I thought I was the only one. I have tried for two months to post my issue but I keep receiving "something went wrong" error message. None of the moderators on the subreddits have been able to figure it out. I am only able to comment.
I gotta build karma to message lol
Every sub-Reddit has different rules. The larger ones have more rules and requirements for posting. Some times you’ll need karma, sometimes you’ll need specifically post karma, sometimes you’ll need to have an older account. This post should help. Try posting on smaller subs and commenting. Stay away from the free karma subs.
They made that feature to prevent funny haha bots to spam crap. I know that's annoying but you just gotta deal with it. My tip to get more karmas is to go to a fairly popular subreddit (that has no karma requirements for commenting btw), set to "new", them comment as much as you can hoping that one of the post will blow up. Resulting in your comment getting more noticed, increasing the chance of you getting upvoted.

Also, if you comment something and it got like 5 downvotes, delete it. It'll get worse overtime.
r/NewToReddit is a great resource for explaining this stuff. That subreddit also has a list of new-user friendly subreddits.
Is there anyway I can see how much karma I have
I've been using reddit for years and still don't understand it.
Reddit is super confusing, I know
How on earth do you see Comments?
Why did I get banned for talking about crossword jam and its algorithms? They are cheating people out of money. I've played it for over a year. I don't do ads. Strictly My knowledge. I don't pay for anything. But when you get close to a goal it makes it almost impossible for someone who doesn't pay. I'm pretty intelligent with words but they make me spell words no person could spell or heard of before I finally run them out of words and I have to use a bonus to search.
I just don't do social media much.
This makes me angry though.
One post. That was it.
Where are all my posts going when I comment about crossword jam cheating people. I haven't said anything vulgar. I'm just telling the truth. Does truth matter anymore?
And then you have r/blackpeopletwitter, where you have to proof that you're black if you want to comment. Imagine the outrage if r/whitepeopletwitter had the same criteria. I always mute subreddits who feel too good for people without enough karma/certain skin colour.
You are a normal person. I have karma saved up from years earlier. I try to make kind comments to those I agree with, and makes helpful comments & posts. Anyone can check to see what I post about. I have nothing to hide.

Yet, this last year,  I have been down voted regularly and increasingly. It is what it is.

I have a theory that just like businesses or individuals can buy votes, so more people will and lik their products, or whatever it is, they’re selling,, down votes can also be purchased by people who don’t like a post or comment.

Then there is the bot factor. It’s a strange world out there.
I'm like you, is there any way to know which one doesn't need so much karma?
SAME!
Yes having similar issues! I don't even know because I try commenting but bots won't let me. Someone just please like this so I get lots of comment karma hehehe 😈😆😂
yeah i dont get it either and i keep trying to figure out how to get help  this place is so very confusing
oh and how do i create my own posts i need a book on how to work redddit lol
Over 1400 positive karma, still can't post anything on most of my preferred subreddits unless I go to a "beg for votes" reddit and post nudes apparently. Maybe have comment karma do a minor modifier to post karma, this is my forth or fifth attempt to mention this issue, and it has to be done in a comment SINCE I CANT MAKE A GOD DAMN POST ABOUT IT... /angermodeoff

Edited for spelling
Karma exist solely to encourage group think and erase opinions and facts that don't fit the narrative.
[removed]
I get the very same thing every time I post 🐂
Help for me too please! I posted something in relationship advice and it's telling me the comments are disabled for my post. Why are they disabled? How do I fix?
How do I edit a comment I made?
Thx for the help
Can I ask an unrelated question? I have some people possibly mods or unknown flagging lots of my posts to get removed when there is nothing wrong with them. I finally got a response from Admins after months of reporting it. They said to keep track of them and provide links to the comments being flagged.

How do I link to a comment? This is probably a dumb question but I'm not an expert. As an example all my posts on a sub today have been removed for no reason so I started tracking them by number so I can eventually report it as a pattern. But I'm not sure how to provide a link to a comment.

  
Thank you and I can delete this if it's not appropriate. I didn't want to start a new post.
I have the same issue so it's nice to know. I've had my account for a while now but I'm just usually a quiet person so I don't comment on things much. Makes it kind've a downer when I finally want to speak but get my comment taken down for not enough karma. I'll look through my subreddits and see if I can find something to reply too!
Thanks for the help!
I don’t know that this explains everything. There may be computer, algorithms, and other factors involved.

I have tons of karma saved up from years earlier. I try to make kind comments to those I agree with, and makes helpful comments & posts. Anyone can check to see what I post about. I have nothing to hide. And I have nothing to sell or promote to gain from.

However, this last year, actually actually starting late last year, I have been down voted regularly and increasingly. It is what it is.

I have a theory that just like businesses or individuals can buy votes, so more people will and e their products, or whatever it is, they’re selling, I happen to know that down votes can also be purchased by people who don’t like a post or comment or a person. It really is an attempt at bullying.

Then there is the bot factor. It’s a strange world out there.   


As a personal protest, I’m going to vote this post, and everyone who makes a relevant non-sounding comment.
Can you tell me why a post I made says the comments are disabled? I want comments but don't know how to turn them on I guess.
Thx for for the info
Thx for your help
How do you know you have more karma then the karma cap?
The subreddit r/montreal had a min 30 day account age for quite a while.
Yup. One of my local hometown subreddits doesn't let me post or comment because I don't have enough karma. While I genuinely had help to offer people. They deleted my comments and said "we remove blah blah blah from new accounts or those with very less karma to avoid spam"

When will the bots get THEIR karma? 🔫 🔫 💥
True
real
Thx for the tip
I’ve done and said exactly this in this very sub and got warned that I could not ask for upvotes and I could not tell a poster how I voted their post or comments
[deleted]
Yeah i have the same thing in some subreddits, but it looks like its just the case of getting more karma and pray it works.
On mobile just tap your username

154 post Karma and 8 comment Karma
Google your questions and get a lot of answers. What you cannot figure out you ask kind Reddit strangers
Sure is ok
Loo you got 7 on this one only already. and 40 on the main one
Comment positive things, anything controversial can get you down voted that takes karma away
[deleted]
Each subreddit has separate rules and moderators.  Read the rules carefully.  Everyone gets things removed
Unfortunatly I dont know the answer to your question but I hope you find your answer here or anywhere else.
Hit the 3 dots / share / copy link 🔗
One of the options at the bottom of comments is "Share" that will give you a link directly to the comment.
If you’re on the phone: Find the comment you want to link -> click three dots -> share -> copy link 

And then paste it wherever you need it
right-click on [permalink] > copy link address > paste in message
Are you using a phone? There's an add link button on the lower left corner of the screen when posting a reply.
Yup the old slap in the face. Oh so you finally worked up the courage to speak? Put in 15 min of effort in your comment or post? 

Shut the f up! Sit down. Know your role. You're not worthy of speaking. Your opinion doesn't count until you suck up to your betters and get up votes.
Same here!
Welcome
Moderator sets minimum cap.
I dunno. Maybe its somewhere written in the rules. If not u know it when u wanna post something and the bot should tell you how much u need. There is also a difference in Comment karma and post karma. 

OdlyStatisfying need I think 5K comment karma.

*Maybe then I have still not enough… dunno. Never tried to post there since.
No, a lot of those already existed
Ty
Hey, what's your username based on?  


The band?
That's true
iirc some subs explicitly discount karma gained from farming and only count legitimate karma so this isn't necessarily a good method for the whole site.

just meaningfully participate in the community, maybe create some kind of content occasionally and post it in the appropriate places. i got a massive, massive chunk of karma a few years back from making some old video game buildings in a different, slightly newer video game (age of empires in minecraft). do and create whatever interests you, and share it and talk about it, someone else is probably already interested.
The mods didn't delete the posts. The posts didn't violate the rules of the sub. I have some people who follow me around to different subs flagging my posts. The posts are automatically deleted because of the flagging not by the mods. The mods always confirm the deleted posts don't violate the rules of the sub and reinstate them. It's been going on awhile on various subs. Some mods aren't aware that they can report people who misuse the flag function. If it happens numerous times Reddit Admins will ban the user but I need to track the posts they flag and sometimes I forget. Then I have to send the Admins the links but I haven't been doing that because I couldn't figure out how to provide the link to the comment. I need to show there is a pattern of them misusing the flag function so they can be banned from the site entirely.
My problems with Reddit, or across several forums completely unrelated to each other.

But it will open up my comments which I’m sure are closed, and you will find all sorts of helpful tips. It is important that humans deal with us and find a way around. It just may be a wonky AI program. One that REDDIT seems to like.
Correct. No matter how polite and neutral, never using bad language or being negative, if someone doesn’t like your post and makes a report, you can be banned from the community scratching your head. 🤔 I am not on any other form of social media so it has been a learning experience.

Link to your comment obtained by clicking 3 dots … below the comment then click share then link and paste where you want to share the link
I'm on a laptop. I think I might have figured it out. This is one of my posts on the sub that keeps getting deleted. At the bottom of the post is a copy link option. The post has been deleted but this is the link to it.

Wait, there are multiple kinds pf karma? Whats the difference?
[deleted]
YW
Just got done playing a video game and one of my troops is a mummy. Was thinking of a username that was a tad witty and fun and didn’t think very hard and well this is it 🤷‍♂️
If I had that happen to me I would start over with a new username, maybe mask my IP address.
The report function does not remove posts automatically unless a sub's automod is set up to do so. Posts removed by admins can't be reinstated by mods either. No one is following you around you are not that important lmao


It's probably reddit's spam filter being garbage again, nothing you can do about it
Gov't employees who do this know the ins and outs, so they block being reprimanded. Many are mods on subs important to them, so they can work their censorship and "stopping misinformation" campaign...
There are 4 kinds of Karma actually:

- Post (Link) Karma
- Comment Karma
- Combined Karma
- Subreddit Karma

Karma is not calculated 1:1 in terms of vote to Karma. 

Usually the Karma thresholds are not disclosed but typically range from 1- 200. Generally it can be said that the bigger the subreddit, the higher the threshold (if there’s any). There can also be an additional threshold for account age. So the worst possible combination would be a new account with negative Karma. 

Check out r/newtoreddit they post new user friendly subs every Tuesday (but you can find the older posts by scrolling too).
I actually dont know.
If u click on ur profile, it should show u the comment and post karma separate. 

Probably 1 like = 1 karma? So when ur comment gets 500 likes = 500 comment karma.

Im also quite new in that matter and dont care that much. Better someone else explains.
Don’t! Quite a few subreddits will ban you outright if you participate in them.
Engaging in karma farms is against reddiquette and some subreddits may ban you if the mods see you have engaged on them. Asking for votes or karma anywhere on the site is called vote manipulation and can lead to a site-wide ban.
That's coo'.
That is what some mods told me to do but that won't fix the problem because I'm only on a few subs and they could probably tell from the posts that it's me with a new name. They also have multiple accounts so blocking them won't stop it either because I don't know all their user names. It's time consuming and annoying but tracking what they're doing and getting them banned is the only solution. I don't think Reddit has ever had an efficient way to handle mentally unstable users but it's a free site so it's not realistic to expect much.
That's a really smart work-around and creative problem-solving.
Okay thx for your help
Almost all subreddits will ban you for a variety of stupid reasons (non-reasons).

I bet if the same guy modding r/liberal is also modding r/freespeech, you’ll probably get banned for protected speech in the latter.
Good luck
That won't solve your problem either... If you're banned you can just make another account. Your best bet is to make a new account and lay low for awhile, they'll find someone else to pester
I'm not banned from any of the subs. The mods don't have a problem with me. The issue is people keep flagging my posts without a valid reason. Once a post has multiple reports it's automatically deleted and Reddit only allows mods to report posts that are being flagged inappropriately. I can't participate in discussions on the sub because they get my posts deleted. I have to ask the mods to reinstate each post and it's time consuming and frustrating.  Unfortunately creating a new account won't solve the problem since they will easily be able to tell it's me.
A quick glance at your history shows a post approving of anti-semitism, very specifically saying it's ok. Maybe not every sub appreciates your bigotry and it's users have reported things you said because they felt they deserved to be reported, even if the sub mods might eventually disagree the users can still report. I made a new account to explain this because I run a few subs and don't want you or your future accounts in them as revenge for this comment.
There are ways to camouflage a new account.  Just participate in subreddits related to secondary interests of yours or just general human experience.  Make snarky comments in r/subredditdrama for example. Suggest movies or television or books. 

Good luck but the admins might not care to help you.
I’m not banned from any subs either. The one sub that I was banned from, had the moderator arrested for doing the legal things, including falsely, accusing the members of being child molesters when they weren’t. But I was restored to that one.
Seriously, dianagorgon seems to not want people to be allowed to report their bigotry just because theyve found subs where the mods dont care.
Boss thinks 80+ videos a week is possible due to AI...
Title says it all. I am an in house video editor and boss man came down to say he wants 80 YT shorts a week because he thinks it's plug and play and will work perfectly. I immedythought this was completely unrealistic, but I wanted to post and ask if maybe there is something I'm missing out there that could make this possible before I pull him into a meeting to tell him his idea is bonkers? 
well - in your bosses fantasy world, by next year, he won't even need you. He will say "hey AI, hey ChatGPT, make me 80 different videos based on this concept. 

He is in dream land.  Listen - I speak to countless companies that say "why do we need local storage - why can we just pay for a cloud site and have the editors edit off of that" - and I tell them - YOU CAN - just pay for Lucid Link.  But they all think that if they get a DropBox account, everyone is editing in real time for very little money.  I run into this at least once a week. 

Bob
40 hours in a full-time week.  That's 1 video every half-hour.

It really depends on what you need for quality.  I can shit you out any sort of video in a few minutes if you don't care.
If he’s such an expert have him show you.
All bosses over estimate, so they can gauge the workload. If you bust your ass and make it work, they’ll expect that every time.
I mean, you can throw footage and keywords into the CapCut AI system and it will shoot out random edits that don't make sense. I did it for fun recently with some phone footage at an arcade / bar. It picked the wrong clips, missed the central movements, and the AI script it wrote sometimes picked up on a couple of keywords, other times was literally random and unrelated entirely.

AI will continue to refine. You cannot use it currently to make actual edits. Honestly I'd recommend giving that Capcut one a try and showing it to your boss. You could just export a few, or you could literally do it in front of them and show how ridiculous it it.
Your boss is a moron.

Quit.
I can't even promise to _watch_ 80 short Youtube videos a week.  Even if it was all ChatGPT magic that doesn't exist yet, I can't even promise to think of 80 decent titles for videos every week to type into the AI generator prompt.  If you managed to churn out that much crap, it would be the most worthless garbage tier crap that nobody will actually watch anyway so what would be the point of making it?  Even if it was possible, why pay for a dollar of GPU time to automagically make a video that has so few views that it can't bring in a cent of ad revenue?
Ask your boss how he came to that number, because hes a fucking idiot
Im curious why you need 80 shorts a week. Is this across like 10-20 channels? Otherwise this is over posting by a lot
Yes, 80+ videos per week is possible, definitely!  
Just don't ask about the quality, mkay ? 🤡
Sure. They will be complete garbage. But there will be 80+ of them.
Uncreative people will never understand how we work 
Boss man seems to think content is a silver bullet to getting rich 

Boss man seems to think that AI will fix everything 

Both ideas are horse shit 

Trash content with viral retention style editing might hold on to views, but those viewers won’t be the sharpest bunch and they won’t remember any of what you actually have to say. Do you even have 80 things to say?

Your boss doesn’t know a thing about how this stuff works. Ask him what his favorite online videos were and then explain how long it probably took to make each of them 

Then again, he might not even look at social media that much and his mindset is all CONTENT  CONTENTXONTENT CONTENT and there isn’t shit you can do about that
I have little knowledge on this,  but checking out klap,  I just dropped in one of our news stories into the system and it was scary fast and honestly pretty decent for a shitty little 1-minute facebook reel. A 60-second reel like that would probably take me at least an hour or 2 to create and klap did 10 versions  in under 90 seconds.

So if you're talking about taking the stuff you already cut and dropping it into this system 80 a week is doable if they're OK with those quality of versions without you needing to tweak things.
Maybe think of an exit strategy. His idea will fail. He make throw you out, because it won't work. Maybe after burning the third editir, he might realize his wrong impressions of AI output. However you will be gone.

I hope you are not that unlucky, but better be prepared.
Even if you could what would be the point?  AI’s storytelling is for shit at the moment and it’s going to take as much time iterating through generative results and correcting them as it would be having a lowly humon edit 20.  It’s also not just about editing them it takes time and $ to review, post, organize, and store all that shit.   

One up him and generate 120 absolutely garbage videos with AI and make him sort through them 😂.
Whenever I work with wonderfully ignorant people thinking they can undercut very important processes, I simply remind them that there are entire sub-industries within our industry for a reason:

“Why can’t I just hold the camera really steady? Why do I need a tripod for a locked off VFX shot?”

“Woah! Congrats. You’ve just put every tripod manufacturer out of business!”

—————————————————————————————


“This LUT pack says it’s modeled after David Fincher…why do I need to hire a DP to get that Fincher look?”

“Hold the phone! Somebody call David…we’re gonna save him so much money on his next project.”
I mean, yea it is, but they're going to be fuck awful.

If he cares nothing about quality and is OK with churning out total garbage with zero originality then it's a great idea! Why would people hire your company to make garbage when they could do it themselves?
You can try? But as a person that takes in any content if it's a.i I pass up on it, especially if it's an a.i voice or pictures, maybe the majority of people are ok with it or don't care but it's an automatic downvote from me.
Ask him to show you how.
80 videos is a lot, even just crapping them out without much quality control. However, have you tried Opus Clips? If you're taking videos that you've already done and making one minute selects and or just chopping out the fat and clipping down to 1min social length, Opus Clips is kind of perfect.

 It's preset heavy, but you can take 1920x1080 clips, drop in the the program, and it will spit out 1080x1920 clips with subs (you choose the style of animation, position, and look), and it will even split two shots into top and bottom of the frame like so many of these YouTube shorts do. 

If you're doing social content, this is actually a real secret weapon for speed. If you've already cut down your rough on the NLE, just export the QT and dump it in OPUS and 90% of the work is done. It spits it out, Meta tags, and will even write a headline based on the transcript it makes. Good luck. Hope that helps.
use Opus Clip or [Captions.ai](http://Captions.ai) to auto-generate crap edits and charge the company card for all the costs. After 2 weeks they'll switch back to doing it manually and let you take your time
Even if it was feasible, quality over quantity. If it's only for one brand where it's subclipping a podcast, is he really trying to annoy people with 80 video posts? Maybe it's more brands, it will still require back end support to organize and distribute across multiple brands to support 80 videos.

He sounds like a moron.
Tell him you'll run a test to see how many you can do in a half day, and that you can discuss his goal after that.  Let him down easy by telling him that 80 in a week leaves zero room for quality control, which I would imagine is important to him.  

I'm sure he wants these with animated captions too right?
Don't tell him he's a moron.

Hey boss: AI doesn't provide anything better than you emailing everything through chat GPT. It gives you something, but everyone can smell it's not right. 

*But…I want you to know I hear your desire.*

AI right now, shortens a certain part of the path - but *good emails get better*, not more emails.

Here's more details:: 

* The field isn't like that. There aren't tools that will "auto edit."
* I'm happy to explore any tools you like. I frequently search and actively stay up to date in communities like r/editors on Reddit. But if you think you can find a tool, please sign us up for it. I'm happy to churn things through it. The 125k pros on reddit are doing the same thing I am.
* When I use whatever tool you like, would you like me to post them via Frame or just give you access? You tell me which ones are good enough.

I'm happy to churn out 80 of them. I'm sure they'd be on the same par of quality as ChatGPT is for writing convincing copy.
at best 4 a day for 5 days (40 hours of work) is 20 shorts.
Is he going to review 80 videos a week? Christ even if you were just clipping out 60 second clips from an 80 minute timeline in linear order, exporting for socials, putting a title, and QCing, we're already at days of work, I feel like.

How long would it take him to decide which 80 videos he wanted?

Maybe point this out to him: we've been using "ai" in video for years. It helps transcribe video, helps sync clips, attempts to streamline or automate a lot of sound and color editing, theres tools like Avid's Phrase Find. From where I'm sitting, things are moving fast but at a pretty linear pace, and I haven't seen anything in the last two years that makes video editing more than marginally faster, like it is year after year.


What's his vision for these ai generated shorts? Is there a specific tool he's thinking of using? Does he want to use ai generated voices to narrate preexisting clips, and rehash a bunch of already existing content (for example?) Because you are, and already have been, leveraging ai to streamline your workflow. Unless he has a specific application to suggest, better to let you keep on keeping on, staying current with the latest technology as you always do.
I think this is a boss that needs a demonstration/ wake-up call lol.

If keeping this job is worth it, I say try his method and record every step/ hiccup you face. If he can do it better, have him show you how. If he just throws empty claims at you like, "I bet another editor can figure it out", then that sounds like a toxic environment and you should leave.
It's possible but depends on the type of content that you need to create, If you need 80 faceless type of video shorts then for example you can use [cliptalk.pro](http://cliptalk.pro) to turn scripts to video. it work by converting your text script into video shorts that has captions voice actors and visuals.  
use it but don't show it to your boss, he might replace you with that AI.
Sounds like his golf buddies planted some seeds he's trying to cash in on. Maybe he should consult with Ai before he brings this to the table next time.
What is the subject matter? Does it even merit that much content? How.much can be said about it to warrant that flood of content? And does he want quality content or just mass-produced trash?
Best I can do is 15.
Actually impossible. Even with dirt poor standards (minimal tweaking), that is unsustainable.
I said a while back after being asked my concerns over AI. the corporations and their ignorant CEOs and greed. They will do anything and everything to increase the bottom line.
Just make 4 medium/long boring videos and cut each one into 20 short ones.  “Follow to see what happens.”
He’s an idiot. He’s responsible for garbage existing in the world. You know that big island of floating garbage in the Pacific Ocean? Your boss made that. Now he wants you to grow it. So he can build a little throne on top of a big pile of garbage. On a serious note there’s no point in smashing out tons of low grade content. It’s not an effective strategy in the long term. It will provide some short term gains, but the easier the content is to produce the more it gets lost in the ocean of garbage and it dissipates because it was worthless to begin with. So do you want to have some short term visibility in a sea of garbage or do you want memorable long term equity?
Hard to say without knowing what the videos entail and how many editors are on that team. Is that 80 per person? Are these 20 second repurposed clippings? Etc Etc. 

You are probably right though haha. 80 is a lot.
I don't know any of the details around the creative or production of each video but I'm going to take a huge, scary, totally blind chance here to go out on a limb and say nooooooooooooo.
Tell your boss he’s a moron maybe
You tell your boss that while there maybe AI technology out there that will allow the creation of this number of videos each week, you would advise against it due to concerns about the quality of those videos. He then has the choice to take your advice and not move forward with the idea, or ignore your advice and move forward with it.

Trust me on this, I have had bosses like this and clients like this in my years in this business. Best you can do is lead that horse to an oasis with cool refreshing water. If it decides it would rather run out into the dessert instead, you already told them they were gonna die of thirst.
It probably is, they're just all gonna suck ass.
If your boss was a doctor, he'd think that 9 women could make a baby in 1 month.
It depends on your definition of “show” — I personally believe that my company could put out around 150 shorts per week to a social media channel of your choice. But those “shorts” are quite short and their quality would be good but not refined.
Take a day to experiment with it.  Then sit down with your boss to look over the results.  Decide together if the technology is ready for prime time, then decide what a realistic pace is.
80 a week for social media? why? thats over 11 videos a day

fuck no
Please lmk what company you work for so I can NEVER apply
Clueless motherfuckers like this.....

(the boss)
Cut 80 one-second progressive clips of a single video and release it as a series 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Throw the long form videos into opus and show him what it spits out. It will give you about 8-10 short form pieces of content but like 2-3 are somewhat useable lol. In short your boss is trippin’!
If mine asked me that I would have had a hard time not spontaneously bursting into laughter.
It’s possible if he can accept certain quality standards. 
Use Opus clips, submagic, heygen 
Having a studio helps, but heygen on its own will make it possible, or if long form shoots cuz with opus clips
It’s a bosses job to overestimate productivity. AI is just the latest tech to apply. Back when all the NLE systems were clunky tape based using 286 processors, plenty of producers thought this meant schedules would automatically shorten. Actually managing people into keeping a schedule wasn’t a consideration since directors and editors had been so good about keeping the work print based ones. 
But lo and behold, people actually used these tools to explore more possibilities and the political demands of choosing which of those to use sucked up huge amounts of time and energy. If you let more people in the rooms (which often had couches and food just down the hall, all kinds of rabbit holes opened up.
What is the niche for your videos? History/motivation niche may be possible as there are many auto generated tools which can spit out a short within 5 minutes (no need to edit as your boss had already tried to mass produce the shorts and didn't care about the quality, you can just grab the video and upload to YouTube) and YouTube can allow more than 12 shorts per day (80/7 < 12). Other niches are impossible.
I frequently have to deal with my boss giving me unreasonable requests based on his misunderstanding of AI. My approach is usually to try creating a proof of concept for what he wants and document how much time it took. When I’m done, I explain the benefits, the drawbacks, and let him view the output for himself. I usually present it as, “this is the output you can expect within the parameters you gave me. I dont think the result is perfect, but it is ultimately your decision”. He usually backs off when he sees reality
Opus clip. Quantity vs quality tradeoff
Yeah you're missing the beat to get the hell out of there, he knows nothing about it, he should be consulting you, not setting unrealistic demands, and you are not missing anything, if that's the kind of thing he wants, he just doesnt care about quality
80 posts is definitely doable if all you care about is how many "videos" were posted. 

There's AI apps that will take a long video and give you 10 cut out videos, so if boss man can record a 20-30 minute podcast everyday the AI bot can chop down 10 of them in a few minutes. It'll add text and everything. It's pretty slick. 


Now the question of - Is it any good? Eh. I'd say you get 2-3 that are ~almost~ usable right out of the can. Then you get 2-3 that could be moved around a bit and you can get something and then you get the rest which are just complete dogshit BUT will give you an idea for a native short you COULD make if you were willing to press record and riff on it's notes. 

Again though, that relies on boss man making long form content everyday to feed the AI engine or for you to have a massive backlog. If you were making this shit from scratch? Fuck no.
lol what a clown. Honestly I’m glad I picked this career path because I highly doubt AI could get close to actually editing hours of material and multiple multimedia down into a comprehensive video

There’s just way too much stuff to tinker with to accomplish such a thing

Maybe tho lol but anyways I’m rambling

For 80 shorts a week they better be paying you good.
It's possible, I make at least 84 videos a week, plus shorts, but the niche is really important here.  I can do what I do because my niche is designed for bulk uploading and simple to record and edit, and all the Mario levels I show were handmade and highly rated so there's an audience there.  I think for a lot of other niches people are going to get tired of seeing that many videos, and if you're not careful you'll repeat similar titles, thumbnails, and concepts to where nothing stands out.  A.I. can be fun but I don't think I trust the quality over that many videos without a whole lot of human intervention, and that could be quite time consuming so that 80+ goal is unrealistic.
So instead of paying you an editors rate he wants to pay for an AI specialists salary?
How much would it cost him to send you to a training course to learn how to use some AI tools that will enable you to squeeze-out loads of shit for him?
If I encountered 80yt shorts from the same channel a week, I would block that channel. That is spam. Tell him that.
Ask your boss what he's snorting and can we have some?
Ya'll need to stay far, far away from News if you think this is some impossible task no one could ever do. 20 SOT/VO or VO reels a day is pretty normal for a News editor. I cut my teeth doing this shit 15 years ago, and then jumped on the teleprompter for the broadcast.
I think you need to do one and then time how long it takes and then multiply that by 80 or whatever. Then add some padded time on top of that. To show him what’s realistic.
I don't think your boss has thought this through.

Suppose we have a magic wand which gives us an AI that can produce really great YT shorts. It's perfect and is nailing it.

We still need to find the footage it should use. We still need to prompt it such that it will know what to make. We still need to come up with a configuration. If it produces 160 YT shorts, we have to pick the best ones.

Everyone else would have access to the same AI, unless we can keep it to ourselves. I don't think we can keep it to ourselves for long in the thought experiment we are doing.

The internet would be *flooded* with crap YT shorts. This means the YT algorithm would begin selecting among all of that trash we dump onto the plate. It'll start rejecting more based on post rate, with a preference for channels which post less.

The crux is this: 80 YT shorts a week relies on a fundamental assumption that *more is good*. That is, the more you post, the higher your KPIs will be. My immediate intuition would be that this assumption is wrong. Any kind of recommender algorithm will track post cadence and use it. If your stuff gets rejected by viewers, it won't be shown to other viewers who fit the same profile. The only way to beat a recommender algorithm is to make stuff people like to view.
I’m also in Marketing and can tell you creating five social media posts per week’s already stupid, even if they’re just pics since that’s already too much content for your viewers to consume, within that short time. 

Imagine what shoving 80 videos into their faces will do…

They might not even watch one since they’ll get sick of your content, as well as think you’re crazy.

Tell your boss these points, as well as what a waste of previous time it is.

Doing so also becomes “Quantity over Quality”, meaning they’ll just be videos, not content.
So, I’ll take the other side of this argument. This is possible, I’ve been doing it for clients, and it can be incredibly lucrative but requires you to completely disregard the way true post-production works and rethink of yourself as a software enabled robot. Which I 1000% understand most people would not want to participate in. But there is a business need for it, and I don’t think it’s a great use of human energy to mindlessly edit throwaway edits. So, I’ve set about trying to solve it for my clients. 

I use tools like Airtable, zapier and frame.io and write automations for everything. 

It starts with a longer “hero” video that’s edited traditionally and then you can cut it up and/resize it with software. 

Sometimes we run an automation that makes a transcript, then sends transcript to chat gpt with a prompt to pull short highlights, then an editor uses that output and premiere transcription to relink. 

This can also be used to generate blog articles, and twitter post images (which people also want)

For some clients we made custom descript templates, with backgrounds we made in after effects, then custom caption style. If we go to a conference we’ll live edit snippets from feed with captions to post onto social minutes later. 

I have found that there is incredible money in operational excellency selling these content packages to B2B clients. It’s tripled my income as a freelancer. But if I was an employee not paid for output… never would have set that system up for someone.
Sure, with AI and very low standards, one could make 80 pretty terrible YouTube videos in a day 30 min each.

Whatever he’s pay isn’t worth the corrosion to your soul the effort would require.
my question would be what would 80 shit AI videos accomplish that 10 high quality videos wont?
Check out HeyGen.ai URL to UCG feature
Run, don’t walk away.
I think I know this guy. I survived 3 weeks.

If long term employment with this kind of personality is important to you, ask him to send you the information he has about "80 video per week AI video production" so you can do the necessary research...

The problem is, people like this are looking for reasons to not need people like you, and that should be all you need to start exploring other horizons.

Sorry 😞
Well your boss clearly knows something you don't, maybe he should do a demo instead of talking out his ass
Very easy doing interview based stuff with opus. Anything else not really
I'm a photographer and I've been training faces with SD and generating photos of my clients pro-photoshoot style for a couple years now. 

People don't realize that what I do (at the level of quality that I do it) takes the same amount of time as a real irl photoshoot. The magic is that I can do it remotely for anyone in the world, and there are zero limits to the clients appearance, environment/location, wardrobe, background, pose, expressions, weather, camera/lens, etc. 

Ai in a professional setting should not be about speed, but about the opportunities it opens.
Hell, they had me doing this way back in 2009. I edited so much, a giant thing formed on my wrist from joint fluid.  
I don't condone any kind of mass editing, but certainly the ai tools will streamline the process once you come up with a couple formulas or patterns, and learn the limitations of said ai.
Tell your boss he’s a dumbass
Just the logistics of processing 80 YouTube videos, not even creating them, is a monumental task
Warms my heart knowing people can fail upwards in this industry.

Seriously though, have him walk you through the process if he’s so sure about it. He’ll probably drop it pretty quickly.
So, 30 minutes per video.  I guess it depends on what you’re doing, there is no indication in the original post.
How is he in charge of a post production operation?
I’ve build an app that does our editing. It can be done! Automated.
Sounds good! You get paid by the video, right?
80 videos of what exactly? This is absolutely batshit unless it’s like ai generated Tik toks about random facts or something but still unless it’s really interesting what’s the point?
Try it.
>they all think that if they get a DropBox account, everyone is editing in real time for very little money…


I love this detail.    It explains Bob’s drunken rage posts.
Thank you for your perspective. I feel your frustration and empathize a great deal
Keep fighting the good fight ✊🏼
This is the worst, but I can relate. My company tried this, during Covid   It was so bad, and I felt sorry for our IT team.
These people are so horny to replace workers with AI and don't even understand how llms work lol
He wants us to take videos we have made in standard format and plug them into Klap or Descript and thinks it will shit out a perfectly formatted video for socials. Having tried the trial versions of both of those I feel confident in saying even in the BEST case scenario still has us having to trim and make adjustments
This is the real advice. I started out in Real Estate editing my first day I busted out like 8 house videos, all with music graphics (it was all cookie cutter but definitely took time) My co-worker next to me basically told me to slow the fuck down and that was the best advice I could ever get. The company was perfectly happy with me getting 5 videos done a day, some days even less
Remember Scotty's Law. 

If it will take an hour, say it will take 2, so when you finish in 1 its a miracle. Otherwise you have padding to fix shit and still come out on time. 

This is how I never missed a deadline.
Yes absolutely do it in front of them
Nah, ride it out. 

Get fired. 

Collect unemployment. 

Open up freelance at 10x current salary.

 Offer services to Boss. 

Profit and win.
Took the words right out of my mouth lol
☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻 This!
I checked some other YT channels just to get some context, and ones that post most frequently post MAYBE 4 a day, but it's usually like podcasts that offer more opportunities to do that.
I wonder how many views these shorts even get on the channel, I’m imagining this I some corporate YouTube channel that gets 17 views per short especially with that many uploads
*Delivers 9000 astronauts looking away at changing skies, cuts to the same AI chick, then a furry overly cute animal with changing texture and sound styles*
I think he really only cares about views, not so much retention. But we've been posting one video a day for about a month and our  channel has grown by about 500% in terms of views, and if I had to guess he just thinks more videos means that number will skyrocket
Maybe. I own 60,000 AI images that I generated in 8 weeks manually.  That’s a one man effort.

That’s a slice of what AI assets I own.
I tried it as well, and it gave me 5 videos 3 of them were essentially the same video. If I could just shrink the video down into the frame and add the blurred background it wouldn't take very long, and we have a davinci plug in for captions. I think if the number was way lower the quality would be better, but it would drop drastically if he is hard set on 80. Thank you for taking the time to try it out and offer your feedback, much appreciated!
I just tried Opus and it spit out four videos that look exactly the same, only with captions now. It didn’t even edit out the chair creaking.
I will definitely look into this. Even if I can bring him down from 80 videos, anything that might help speed up the process regardless will be a good asset to have. Thank you!
I'm positive he wants the captions
This is a very thoughtful response and approach. I am more or less going to use this method. But to your point about the quality of chatgpt emails, he actually writes some emails using it and doesn't seem to think anyone can tell the difference, so I'm not sure how it will be received.
Not bad at all if you ask me. But what do I know, since apparently 80 is an option 🤷🏼‍♂️
Two editors on the team. These 80 would be on top of the other standard format videos we create each week. He wants to take our finished videos and plug them into Descript or Klap and thinks they push out perfectly formatted videos.
I guess I could use AI to help me figure out a way to say that as professionally as possible
Brilliant! 🤣
I don't want to get too specific about what kind of videos so as to not give away any details, but let's just say it's manufacturing. We make marketing videos that utilize footage we've filmed ourselves plus stock footage and custom motion graphics/text animations. Some videos are 2-3 mins, some are longer. In my opinion, not a topic that warrants 80 videos a week
Whether or not my pay is good is probably up for debate 🤣
Karma bump for the reality bump.
Someone quoted me high assuming I couldn’t afford their service. They used their work with Kanye West as their premier marketing tool. That didn’t age so well 18 months later.
Yes, apart from all the other practical comments here, the prime beef is, as you say, gathering adequate CONTENT. THAT takes time, as does VIEWING it, and making judgements as to what is actually usable.  But I was a TV trailer-maker, always looking for "moments" in two-hour films, so probably a million miles from what is being discussed here.  The briefs demanded and described here make me shudder!
This is very interesting. Thanks for your perspective and for sharing your method and experience. I do agree that if we're selling this as a freelancer it could be very lucrative, but as an hourly employee I definitely don't want to go the "software robot" route, as you put it. But I will definitely be looking into some of the methods and tools you mentioned. Thanks again!

This is probably worth asking on my end

I am "Bob's drunken Dropbox rage."
You must be young. They aren’t rage posts. Just the honest thoughts from someone with experience who very much knows WTF they’re doing and is forced to interact with ignoramuses.
I don't feel bad at all. I not only tried this, but my clients got RANSOMWARE during this process during Covid.  I WAS THE IDIOT.  But like I always say - if you don't FAIL, then you don't learn anything.  And I learned - I learned about Tailscale, Zerotier, Jump Desktop, Parsec, and Teradici. 

But with all of that said (and now with the wonderful addition of LucidLink to our toolbox) - that is not CHEAP enough to company owners, who say " wait - why can't I just spend $100, and have free storage forever, and have all my remote editors, edit FOR FREE on the cloud". 

These are the people that I want to kill.   Because all that matters - is that they can buy their daughter that is graduating from high school a new BMW - not run their business, not give you a raise.  And I have NO PROBLEM if they want to buy themselves a new Maserati - they run the company - they deserve it - they employ you - but when it's THEIR CHILDREN, and they feel that THEIR CHILDREN deserve a new BMW, instead of giving you a $25,000 raise - well, they only deserve this - go freelance, or get a new job, and STEAL THEIR CLIENTS - the only thing I want to hear when I am dying is "daddy - all my friends have nice cars - why can't you buy me a nice car ?" - THEN I WILL DIE HAPPY.

Wtf is Klap?  Sounds like something grandpa got overseas in a war.
Minvo has worked pretty well.  If you have it output 10 videos from a 15 minute edited video a few will be decent.  

[https://minvo.pro](https://minvo.pro)

  
If you have a huge backlog of content you might be able to get out 80 clips a week by just uploading a few long form videos on Friday before you leave for the day, then on Monday download everything and pull out anything remotly good and load those into your social scheduling upload program.

  
If I were your boss I would ask myself "Does anyone want to see 80 clips from me or my company a week"

  
That's 11.4 clips per day if you include the weekend.  I think people are probably just going to ignore content from that uploader if they're pumping out that much.
I mean, if it really is just reframing 16x9 to 9x16 in 60 second bursts, it's mind numbing but not really out of the question.  If you have to subtitle as well, could get quite a bit slower.
If you're leveraging content you have already made, and just need to flip the aspect ratio and make it short format. By memory ffmpeg can do this for you.
what about like premiere auto reframe
How long were these videos? Man, 8 videos sounds like a lot if each video is around 6-8 minutes long
Or in case boss has already failed and had to close down shop, hire boss and fire boss for not being productive enough.
This guy gets it
If he can’t work hard enough to deliver, why would someone like me line his pockets? Owning your own business isn’t twice as easy, it’s four times harder. Telling editors to kick rocks is a hobby. 

The only editor I met this week that I’d hire is deeply vested in his own struggle as an entertainment producer. I deflected him, but even so, he’s the only candidate in the back of my mind. We’re going into business on another thing. Once I have cash flow on my new thing, he is green lit to assume my previous promo load for close to the money he would have asked for. The people I sent away will probably have pivoted 2 or 3 times in the meanwhile or given up without success.
Yeah, I literally cannot imagine why you’d want to make that many shorts regardless. You’ll get unsubscribes for blowing up peoples notifications
Then maybe ask him what he wants to achieve with 80 videos a week and fix that problem instead?
Yeah the story I dropped in was just under 3-minutes long, 10 versions, all were similar since 10 1-minute videos coming from the same 3-minute source. 60/100 Virality score, rest were 20 or under, whatever that means. Like I said if they're just looking to flood the system I think 80 is possible depending on how much you currently put out. And that would be without having to do much tweaking, but if they're going to nitpick every video, definitely not realistic. Makes me REAL happy we got AI generated content protections in our union contract this last negotiation.
What a douche canoe.
Tell him about his toupee…gently. Yes, we can tell his ChatGPT responses if he doesn't rewrite them.
15 TOPS
Do what he says and show him the results
I'm pretty sure you can tell AI to do that and have it done in minutes!

Also, not young.
Definitely not the best product name if you ask me haha
It's slang for crabs where I live lol
Sensational!
You nailed it. Video content this dumpy is ignored by humans. Sure the social platforms say "video out performs" but when its shit... it's shit.
Minvo is the way to go. But if you think you'll just download the output you're crazy. I cut my podcast from 1 hour to 5 clips in about 2-3 hours. (Rendering before export takes a lot of time, and the quality isn't that crisp. I also add an overlay and resizing images in Minvo isn't straightforward.) Captioning is pretty simple in Minvo. The interface is browser based so it isn't the snappiest and scrolling on the timeline is cumbersome. AppSumo has a lifetime deal for.minvo for like 60 bucks. Minvo is the piece you're missing. You can get 80 clips out but some may be redundant. Another tool I use is AutoPod. It's a premiere extension that  takes horizontal video and auto reframes it to vertical. It still takes trimming and editing but these are two ways to maybe get close to that number.
Oh... If it really is just one graphic....  If it really is just lowering the audio.... If it really is just adding a fade at the head and tail off each clip....  If it really is that you don't have the budget this time, but next week when you land that multi million dollar project you're going to hire my company to do the whole thing and it's going to be magnification!!!! 

Should I continue???
I did video commercials from now until December with no sound in one day. Same with digital print ads and physical print ads. I used a template that I built ground up, altered the event date and I’m using different music for each week in a a carousel.

 It really depends. Honestly, men these days are doing what was considered ladies work when I was born, but to them it’s normalized and normal. I carried a pistol for work and collected money in Detroit for years, so to me editing a lot of videos is easy. My grandfather was a wildcatter, and was wielding a 4 foot chainsaw into his 60s in the Ozark mountains. He was a 1% and didn’t have to do that. But like Sinatra, he did it his way.
They averaged around 3 to 4 minutes. It was mostly just pan left pan right add music, proper branding and do minor color correction when needed. We had higher end videos for more expensive properties that would take more time. These were for your average run of the mill homes.
Gets what? Fired?
Hey could you give me the link to your hustle culture advice and vague inspirational bullshit TikTok again
Actually with the way YouTube works I think that you still wouldn't get any
This is the only real answer.
[removed]
So spot on lol
Fair enough. Every now and then I also find myself thinking Bob is a crotchety old man, and almost without variation I get a call the next day that reinforces all his points and makes me feel like Danny Glover in every Lethal Weapon.

The more time passes, the more I see wisdom in the cautionary comments of those with more experience than I have.
Where everyone lives
Posting that much is kind of the equivalent of junk mail.
I think the Minvo app sumo deal is gone.
Are you some sort of wierd copypasta troll account?
I do real estate videos and I'll tell you now, 3-4 mins is LONG. The attention span of someone even getting to the end is probably slim to none. I do 1:00-1:30 with aerials and even having the realtor Mic'd up and in the video. 



You could seriously trim those down and the fact that you were doing 8 or even 5 in a day is kind of insane.

Uh I love bob as much as the next editor but no, the man is frankly insane, he believes life is nothing but a battle to learn enough to beat out the others to make big money so he can take his wife to nice dinner and any pain or sorrow from such a brutal and shallow life is to be buried in alchohol or drugs. I mean, he's completely right but uh
Nope, Crabs and the Clap are two different ailments..... And I'm going to just shut up now and fall back on the 5th amendment....
Exactly. Its spam.. and not the salty, tasty kind
Shame. Shouldn't matter anyway OPs boss sounds like he thinks these tools would be free anyway.
It’s to the point that whoever is paying for your services is a working man or woman who bled to be able to hire you. Juxtapose that with a black turtle neck, French press coffee maker and a $50 haircut that they’re paying for. 

It’s not too much to ask if someone is dropping $2,000-$5,000 per month on services. Work is hard, sometimes impossible. They want to get what they’re paying for. Even if they ask a lot, it’s likely reasonable. 

Plenty of people have asked me to pay them for cake jobs. That’s not being a troll, that’s being someone who can afford to actually pay you. And, I’ve been teaching myself editing to get exactly what I want.
Why, because I’m a working man?
Can I dm you?
Ha! I read the first part of that and was like "and...?"
I'm kinda having the same impression of a guy. Don't mean you can't learn from him tho :)
Whoops I got my stds mixed up
No, not because you are a working man. Because in a single comment about video editing you talking abot your grandpa wildcatting and carrying a pistol for work. And Sinatra. Its fine to mention those things but they were all so out of left field for a comment on r/editors that it seems like a troll comment.

If i was on a wildcatting subreddit and a comment mentioed video editing, icecream trucks and the matrix movie i would ALSO be suspicious the commenter was trolling.
Hahahahahah
Sure
Ooooooooofff!!! Don't do that.
It’s called having a personality. It’s unfortunate it brought up your insecurities and caused some form of distress.
I used free packs, free fonts and $40 worth of adobe.  The music I licensed cost the most. And, it wasn’t that much. Of course I’ve invested some months of time to be able to do that.
Kind of speaks to the state of the world.  He saw someone who actually works for a living and thought I was some kind of alien. Instead of picking up on the fact I could spin up an event in 10 days and handle the years video and print promos myself, instead of the $2,000+ bids that would not be delivered yet.
DM sent, thank you
My first feature film edit is going to theaters
Yeah, it’s a short run in only 4 states but I never thought I would see this happen. The film is a rom-com (not my usual genre) but I’m proud of my work on it.

Now I’m not posting this to try and brag or anything. I’m on this sub every day and there is a lot of doom and gloom about how there aren’t jobs out there and it’s getting harder and harder to find work. A sentiment that I often share.

I was laid off from my agency editing job just over a year ago. My intention was to find more full time work, and I applied for everything. And the calls never came. I couldn’t figure out why, I had never had a problem before.

So I started looking for freelance work, I had to work on my networking skills (I had none) and slowly the work started to show up. Just here and there at first, and then as I started working with more people, I started to get referred more often… and now this weekend I’m editing for The Hollywood Reporter up at Sundance. 

So I guess what I’m saying to other editors that are at the same level of the game as me, keep going, do good work, make friends at every gig you get and it can happen. I thought my editing career was over and now I’m hitting life goals. It feels like things are going to keep going up from here.

As a treat, here’s the trailer for the film, which I also edited.

https://youtu.be/KRzUaSQUMpU?si=PJRfoShLdwUx5fhr

edit: just changed some language

Update: Remember what I said about networking and making friends at every gig? By the time I left the THR job today the VP of video, who I’m working for, was already asking me if I would be available for more work.
This is not a brag it’s inspirational. I def wanna be where you are some day! I can feel my work picking up and my skills getting sharper. Nice job man. Only way from here is up.

Also rom coms are the best! Haha it looks cute
Dude. Don't publically disparage any project you worked on. What if your producer or studio (etc., yadayada) saw this post?  Keep your work opinions amongst friends and peers you trust.  Just some advice from a vet.
Nice job! I have edited several low-budget features and it's my favorite kind of work. It's always exciting when they are being seen!

Congratulations!
Congrats!
Congrats, mate. Hope you live someplace where you can go see it on the big screen! 

If you don't mind, tell us a little more about the project. How did you get involved with this one? Your experience (with details!) might help some of these younger folks on how to get started. 

It looks like a lower budget, but by all means not micro, feature. Good choice by the filmmaker to keep the locations way way down. Smart. Reminds me (in approach) to Reservoir Dogs. If you are creative with your locations, you can pack a lot of value into a small budget.
Congratulations! Thats awesome!
I appreciate this. Congrats and thanks for posting!
Congrats!  I had my first big screen credit this summer & am currently working on my next. As lame as it was, I still posed & pointed at my name as it passed in the theatre for a photo that my mom put in the Christmas letter & I wouldn’t have it any other way.
Good job keep it up!
Congrats that’s great ! You’re motivating us all !
Congratulations!
Congratulations! Good to know good things are happening out there!
Looks interesting, congrats!
This looks cute OP, good on ya!
Awwwwww! I loved the trailer. Esp the water balloon sync with the high hat. Nice work!!! And congrats. Your journey is super inspirational too.

This is insanely american bravo
Congratulations! What a cool turn of events. Any big takeaways from your first?
   
I cut and colored my first feature (a romcom), finally it released theatrically, and ended up going to #19 at the US box office… sure it was *June 2020*… But I won’t let the details ruin it :)
Congrats! If you haven’t experienced it yet, seeing your work on the big screen is both the most thrilling and humbling thing. I hope this leads to more work for you!
Congratulations.
Congrats and thank you for sharing.
Congratulations brother, always celebrate this types of wins!!
Amazing!! Congratulations!
Congratulations!! I’m very happy for you
Congrats on the film, but also thank you for the ray of hope. I've been pretty depressed about my career so far (stuck in a small dead-end situation editing low-budget commercial work).

It's inspiring to see someone head off back into the freelance world and find success, I'm always daydreaming about this but I can never get myself to pull the trigger because I'm afraid of losing my 9-5 and the stability that comes with it.
Heck yeah! There’s just nothing like seeing your name up on the big screen. And when it’s just your name up there, you’ve done yourself proud. 

Congratulations.
This is so awesome! Congratulations.
Great post, thank you and congratulations!!!
Great job and great advice!
Wow! I watched the trailer and it was so cool. I cannot wait for the day when my editing skills will be at this level for my YouTube channel
That looks adorable!

And I was also laid off a year ago and have had trouble finding work. Never had trouble before. This job market is the worst.
This Is amazing, I'm so happy for you!
Did he edit it out? As of now he’s says nothing bad about it at all
I totally will give some more details but I have to get through this job this weekend first. Long days and hard work!
Ahhh. That’s so cool! Congratulations!
Aw thank you. I appreciate that! I actually got to direct a couple scenes and the water balloon fight is one of them. And now I also have a 2nd unit director credit.
Insanely American is the best description. Thats so funny.
Congratulations to you too! Thats awesome! Celebrate the wins! Not many people can say they’ve done the thing you did!
Thank you! I sure hope so too. Making movies is all I’ve wanted to do since I was 6.
It makes me so happy that my words have managed to do that for you. It’s hard out there for sure. And by no means am I out of the woods. The money still isn’t even close to what I was making at my 9-5 and I’m not as young as I used to be. Freelance is stressful and hard. I’m still not even sure that I’m cut out for it. But I’m riding this wave and it’s working.
I did. He was right.
That's fantastic! I'm happy for you! =D

Talitha Hanks rawks! She singlehandedly lifts the whole trailer - brings some sort of X factor in.
My first ever build!
Upgraded from a RTX 2060 laptop, been playing around with it for a day and I couldn't have been more satisfied 
Should have 3 separate cables from psu to gpu, don't daisy chain, or use split cables.

Edit: otherwise very clean, good job.
Looks really clean, congrats on the upgrade.
Which GPU and CPU?
I love the aesthetic of "clean AF white build with white lights and a big blocky air cooler"
Clean!

Congrats on the upgrade, game on brother.
How tf have people come from first build being bare minimum to absolute monster builds
Looks good. only change I would make would be using 3 separate cables instead of that piggyback
damn that Sapphire GPU is one of the classiest GPU I've ever seen, congrats on your new PC!
[deleted]
Very nice looking, great job.
Bro that thing looks badass, very awesome
Very clean nice but as others have said please do not daisy chain or use splitters for gpu power cards just draw to much these days. If you want it really clean you could have custom cable extension made and possibly an adapter if you don’t have enough pcie power plugs on your psu but back to keeping it clean while delivering power you have them wrap 3 pcie extension cables in one tight mesh body tube leaving enough room to connect all there power connectors and boom on cable look to the gpu but all the power of three dedicated lines.
[deleted]
Looks good mate.

Do not know what you use the PC for, but man that is an upgrade for sure! Congrats.
Clean
Damn... whish they put the power conector at the side or the other side, that GPU design is very sick.
Looks great, how much $$??
 duunnn dunnn… duuuunnnn duun… duuunnnnnnnn dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dunnnnnnnnnnn dunnnn...(Jaws theme song). Nice rig♥️
Very nice clean build.
Dear sir, pigtail cables supplying power to the GPU is sub optimal. Please reconsider. Three separate cables is preferable
If I were you, I'd consider 180 degree gpu adapters for a much cleaner look.
Use 3 seperate cables for the GPU

Looks great!
That's sexy as!
clean build 🏳
Looks clean man awesome
That looks really clean! Well done
Awesome! Such a clean build!
Very nice. White looks shmik! I did mine last year. Full
Black build 😁
Is that the thermalright thantom spirit 120?
Nice, very nice and clean.
Looks so clean
Very nice bro! Nice to see good air-cooling from time to time!
Almost the same setup :) Same case, same processor but with an AIO and a 7900 XTX XFX.
Looks great, only suggestion I’d make would be to swap them Corsair power cables for some cablemod. It’ll be peak aesthetics. Great work!
Congrats nice Build
 what case are you using and are those the stock psu cables
Assembling the asus wifi thing was awful 😆
awesome man, congrats 

But the daisy chained looks awful
FYI, the antenna should be magnetic along one edge allowing you to mount it directly to a steel surface without the need for the stand.
Looks amazing, but you can improve the cable management inside the PC slightly if you want it to be literally perfect! Looks insane anyways
How easy was the Thermalright cooler to put in? I'm doing one soon and I'm a little overwhelmed.
What card is that?
Clinical!
For the price of a nitro+ 7900xt you can get a 7900xtx. Why would you pick this model?
and then not using ethernet
I wish I had that pc I’m jealous
seeeexy
Damn that is beautiful! I'm jelly
Nice build congratz, I hope you'll enjoy your pc.
What case is this?
Sure it is 🙄
Bruh, you tryin' to make me C U M ?  
Cuz that's just sexy!
The Sapphire nitro + GPU's are sharp!!
Pretty!!! Too bad you used an AMD though.
If you’re saying this because the cables couldn’t handle the load I think it’s not a problem. Aesthetically it would be cleaner to have 3 separate cables but power wise it’s not a problem. Der8auer made a really good [video](https://youtu.be/fRVSGFjKf4E) how many cables you really need.
This. Especially with an OCd card like his.
Thanks for the suggestion, I will do it soon, any suggestions? Cablemod?
This should be on the top, it's scary that only a few people noticed it
thanks!
7800X3D + 7900XT Nitro+, they run pretty cool
Might as well call it the Ice Build for how white and beautiful it is!
The nemesis of neon cat puke.
thanks brother!
graduate, get job, have money, buy PC
Thanks! Yea, the card is gorgeous. The PCIe slots screws can fall in there quite easily tho, don't ask me how I know
thanks!
and that is correct, just PA, no SE
Yea, I agree, I'm thinking about investing some new cables solely for this reason, the cables are ugly and they stand out a lot, they also don't quite bend the way I would like them to which is why they are in the position they are.
More or less $2000 after conversion
It is, this thing is awesome, my CPU runs so cool with it!
I wanted to grab a xtx as well at first, but it didn't make sense with the pricing over here. The cheapest xtx is at least 200 USD more expensive than the xt nitro+
Thanks! I actually did have the thought to swap the cables right after I was done with it
case is Corsair 4000D Airflow, and yes those are stock psu cables.
I agree, I will tidy them up once I got the 1 remaining fan (I wanted 5 but ordered 4 on accident)
It's actually quite easy, a long screwdriver is very helpful so try to have one in your hand and make sure you don't micro adjust the radiator too much if you are using a kryosheet since it tears quite easily, lift up the whole thing and try again. The RAM sticks might get in the way of the fan in the front tho, so you might need to adjust the position of the fans by lifting it up a bit.
It's a Sapphire 7900XT Nitro+
not where I'm from, the cheapest xtx is at least 200 dollar more expensive than this unfortunately.
Corsair 4000D Airflow
I don't understand why this has become such a big trend, people telling everyone on the internet that their pc will blow up because their GPU has one or two cables plugged as daisy chain.   
  
The actual safety limit for a single cable is so damn high you'd have to pull 400 watts over a single 8pin 2x6+2 pin cable. Even then you wouldn't hit the idk 40amps max those cables can technically handle lol. 

Same thing with how much power your PSU needs... I ran a i7 with a rtx3080 on a 620W psu and that was completely fine. People on here would tell you you'd need 850W to be 'safe'
OP what's that GPU? I'm curious as it seems a bit bigger than my AMD Sapphire Nitro+ 7800XT, and I thought mine was huge already
What temps for high end gaming
What temps does the Thermaltake keep the 7800x3d at?

I got a kraken x53 and it tops out at around 68c under a gaming load
Nice to hear that! Also upgraded my system to a 5800x last week and this cooler is amazing :)
In France, it was the opposite ;)
Personally I'd just stick with the Corsair cables since they are definitely rated for the current going through it.
Or, you could get cable extensions
IIRC and depending on how your brand of PSU pins out you could swap around the cables so the pig tails are toward the PSU side and use a third (assuming you have one) to get one to one connections for the GPU on the cheap.
Yeah I was a little worried about the front fan. I have a Meshify C so it's not a huge case. I wonder if that second fan can go at the back if absolutely necessary.

Guess we'll see.
Yeah I don’t understand either. Rule of thumb is to go ([GPU TDP] + [CPU TDP]) * 2 = PSU wattage, but that’s just a recommendation and definitely not a necessity.
It's 7900 XT Nitro+, yea this is a chonky boi, the same size as an xtx if memory serves me right
Not sure if this game is a good benchmark, but I've been playing Hell Divers 2 for a few hours at max settings 2k native. CPU running at 68°C and GPU at 67°C on average.
I have no idea, I'm using an air cooler, Thermalright Phantom Assassin.

It averages at around 68c for me as well. Now with undervolting, it's averaging around 64c
you can actually do that, cooling will be a little worse that way but that's an option
Powersupplies are most efficient at like 50% load, maybe people are confused by this.   
The peak can be much higher as well than the constant load, but if you have a GOOD psu it won't fukin explode it will just turn off if its an actual issue. 

a single 8pin cable can handle up to 40 amps or something before melting which is more than a fukin 4080 would pull. Plus those garbage 12vhpwr cables melt above 400 watts anyways so you can't use it anyways with the 40 series lololol
Awesome! Do you use any anti sag support? The GPU must be really heavy  in weight
That's good for helldiver's 
Try undervolting both,  they'll run at least as fast and 10 degrees cooler.
Did you use the curve optimizer to undervolt or did you manually do it?
I do! I use the bracket that comes with the card. It's very hard to adjust since it's not very well designed (or it's just not designed with this kind of size in mind) but it looks super clean!
It's amazing how much you can cut down on high temps, power usage, and noise with a little tuning.
manually, in the bios
Hmm, for my GPU it was easy to set up. Maybe they're using the same one for you and it's why it's harder. At least you got it set up, no need to remove it for a long time now. 

Also, do you game? If so, what games do you play?
Yea, I think they do have the same bracket, alongside the 6000 series, which is why it's hard to adjust for the xt and xtx since they are just much, mich bigger.

I haven't been gaming too much lately, was very busy up until recently, plus I just did not have the specs to play recent games (I personally can't stand playing games below 30 fps). Just started playing Helldivers 2 a few days ago, before this I was just playing some old games such as Monster Hunter World.
Ahh I see. I don't have any experience with previous PCs besides my new one I built a few months ago, so I'll take you saying that other GPUs must be lighter indeed. 

Hmm, what temps for the GPU do you get? What about fps? My GPU stays at around 68 degrees Celsius in every modern game (2019+) I'm playing at ultra/very high. I'm thinking if adding more case fans will lower the temp of the GPU significantly or not (currently I got 3 intake fans at the front and 1 exhaust fan at the back)
you can have 1 more exhaust fan at the back, on the top of the back if you don't already have one there, that way the airflow is more balanced while keeping it a positive pressure. I'm currently running this fan configuration myself and I'm also averaging 68~70 celcius full load.

it will probably only be just a little bit cooler but it's a nice headroom to have if you ever decide to overclock your card. 

if you are unsatisfied with the temp, try out Radeon Chill, I discovered it yesterday and it's probably one of my favorite GPU software feature now. with the very limited time I have with it, my GPU rarely ever hit 60 celcius. it's a shame that so little people are talking about it. AMD software is honestly so underrated imo.
Adobe is the Worst Company Ever
So some background -- I've literally been using Adobe Premiere since high school (I graduated in 2005). It enabled me to create some really artistic things over the years. Compared to AVID's workflow -- it was a dream for me. 

Somewhere along the line -- it started getting worse and worse. The constant crashes; weird quirks that had no logical explanation or origin; things like Auto-Save actually making the program crash and LOSE WORK; the constant updates for Creative Cloud App that break everything until you update it (and often break things even more once you do); the s\*\*\*\*y way Adobe treats its customers and their complaints about this dogs\*\*t software...you get the idea.

Recently, it has literally ruined my life to the point where I had to switch to DaVinci Resolve. And wow -- am I glad I did. It feels like the day I switched from Adobe Audition to REAPER. Refreshing. Actually works. Doesn't make you want to smash your computer out of frustration. Much easier to use than Premiere.

As I'm finishing porting my project over to DaVinci -- Adobe starts yelling at me for having Creative Cloud installed on two computers. I'm licensed for up to two installs and this is the first time it has every done this. It's not the standard "Oh you are logged in somewhere else so you have to log out." Just tells me I can't have more than one person using it. Adobe are scum and I'm so glad they are being sued by the government.

The cherry on top? Today, I was exporting from DaVinci and it was taking way longer than normal. Then -- I notice that every title is screwed up in the export. What do you think was causing it? Creative Cloud had updated itself overnight (I still have the license for a couple more weeks until it expires) and just uninstalled the font I was using. I literally hate Adobe more than any other company. It managed to screw up a project in a completely different system.

Switch to DaVinci. If you are even having a few of the issues I outlined -- it will get worse. DaVinci is so much better that I'm kicking myself for not switching earlier. Peace.
Hard agree, esp with how theyre going about AI rn aswell has put me off their software too.
I am no fan of Adobe. Let's start with that. 

I have been using Photoshop since version 2.0. I learned vectors in Aldus Freehand and moved to Illustrator on version 3.0. I have been using After Effects since the COSA days, Pagemaker since version 5, and InDesign since its inception. I used the old Premiere and the new Premiere. 

None of these apps have been, at any time in their decade-spanning lifecycle, any more or less buggy than any other software I have used. 

The only time I saw constant crashes was when people ran on systems that were either infected with malware or generally very unclean (lots of "shareware", system utilities, and other stuff that could interfere with the stability of a system). 

I use Photoshop about 7 hours a day. I switched from Premiere to FCPX because I like the workflow more (not because Premiere has anything wrong with it). 

I hate Adobe's tendency to prey on users and overcharge. I hate their subscription tactics. I hate that they are heartless. I hate that their products are do expensive. 

But I have never experienced instability of my system due to Adobe software. Mac or Windows, it's been fairly reliable.
I agree. Just finished a 60 minute show on Prem and it was such a headache from start to finish. Avid and Resolve are both so so so much better, of course both are far from perfect themselves.
I hate all editing software. I just use Premiere because that's the one I get paid to work in.
I hate to tell you this but this morning DaVinci Resolve borrowed my car without asking and ran over my beloved cat. I'm just not sure what program to use anymore.
I'm pretty sure that Nestle is a far worse company.
Strongly disagree 

Once you understand the workflow, Premiere works well. There are still some benefits to using Avid but the difference is becoming less each year. Resolve is a great colour tool. Not sold on the edit side. Not many people have jumped over for that reason. It's still fantastic and I like Grant. 

Adobe as a company has some crap parts to it. As editors we should engage more with the forums, engineering teams, make groups to feedback and improve the software. 

Currently working on a HUGE feature doc with 100s of hours of footage. There's been some issues but broadly it's been good times. Some errors we made setting up. Adobe should offer more professional level guides to setting up and running the software (its complicated after all)
So you hated Avid, then you hated Premiere. When is your 'I hate Davinci' post gonna drop?
To each their own. 
I switched from FCP7 to Adobe the day Final Cut X was announced. . It’s been great. I’ve cut trailers, feature docs, episodic TV, shorts, commercials… never a problem. I don’t understand what some of you guys are doing or experiencing.
I've been using Premiere professionally for 10 years (currently editing a TV show at WB), and I've never had any of the issues you're describing above? Usually when I see people complain about Premiere here their issue ultimately boils down to either incorrect workflow or hardware - both of which are out of the company's control. The Productions workflow has especially been a game-changer for us on the TV side of things, and I like it way more than anything I've done in Avid. 

I usually recommend Davinci to beginners or students because its free and more advanced than consumer-friendly alternatives like imovie or capcut, but if you want to work at a professional level I don't see it ever competing.
I'm finishing a big project in Premiere now, alternating between banging my head into the wall and screaming in rage, just trying to get through it - and as soon as I do, I think i'll finally, years past due, take your advice and make a permanent switch.  Premiere has gotten borderline unusable...
I've been running the Adobe suite as a producer / editor for 20 years. I've worked in both MAC and PC shops. While Adobe does some things that I'm not a fan of, I have found their software to be no more buggy or crash prone than any other software I run. As long as your box passes the Adobe HAL, it should be as reliable as any other software. At least that's been my experience.
i HAVE to use Adobe for a client, since I have a team that also uses is to edit episodes, but once i lose this client im switching to DaVinci. Dreaming BIG
As much as I dislike the dinosaur that is Avid, my MC session has now been running for over 3 weeks without restarting/crashing once (not just during the day, it's been left switched on and running MC for over 500 hours).  While slightly more modern, I can't stomach Premiere and its instability.  I do like Resolve, but its hard to convince my clients to go with it (i'm normally on multi-editor projects).
I have every bit of software they subscription sell...they don't get a dime from me. It's fully activated, updates, and I even downloaded it legally directly from Adobe.

Damn it feels good to be a gangster.

I also avoid using them unless I have to. 

I've been using Resolve as my preferred NLE since 15 came out. I've been using studio since 17, I think, and it's only gotten better and better.

Seems like every update I find something else that feels like a real game changer.

Edit: I want to be clear... I'd rather pay for something else than use Adobe software for free, and I've been actively looking for other software to replace the rest of the Adobe software that I still depend on.
Dude I've literally cried from the frustrations it's caused me. Every time I call support I try to calm myself by simultaneously googling  if it's possible to sue them for distress. When you're working on deadlines and shit hits the fan, no I can not wait for your tech guy to call me two days later! No I do not need you to send me links to articles,I've already read through. I need you TO WORK!
yo dude - I found this homeless guy on the street that knows iMovie and CapCut - screw Adobe, and Resolve, and Media Composer - I am paying this guy in Meth, and he is doing a GREAT job - I have 100,000 hits on TikTok now, and I am starting to make REAL money !

............. this is what this forum is turning into. 

bob
I agree. In a professional environment I notice most agencies and companies switching away from Adobe since you can have issues that can break entire projects. I introduced a few clients to resolve and most of them were surprised about the stability, speed and ease of use when there's not "Adobe" in front of the softwares name. This doesn't only apply to resolve but to almost everything these days. (Affinity for example works great too).
Also most agencies are saving thousands of € per year since cancelling their subscriptions. My bet is, Adobes times are starting to being over. 
I've been using Pp since 2007, and the only time it behaved any way like this is because of my hardware than anything else. Regardless, I'm shifting to Davinci in November because I hate having to pay for both Pp and AE in perpetuity.
Forever Avid was the most hated (snobby) company. I used it for many years before switching over to Premiere out of necessity to be more compatible in my area. Was super reluctant and certainly had to rethink my way of working but in the end I love it. I brought over a lot of my Avid traits / shortcuts. At least those that it can handle. But ultimately I found in my work (mostly commercial/corporate/social) it works wonderfully for what I need it to do. Especially how it works with other Adobe tools. For those that have technical issues there are a lot of resources out there to help prevent/fix them, but like I said for me it works wonderfully. And clearly for others, it isn't stable enough for what they are using it for. The fusion page on DaVinci was just too much for my brain with its node based way of working. More like smoke or flame. And my earlier experiences trying out the edit page led me to believe it didn't have enough tools/ability to not have to learn the fusion page to accomplish what I needed. But love the color page when I need it. The great thing is we have options. None of them are perfect.
I work on Final Cut and rarely have issues and when I do it’s because my crappy Mac has run out of room or needs an update. I’ve always thought premiere was not aesthetically pleasing or fun to work with. Glad it’s getting the hate it deserves. Haha
As a 5 years premiere user, I fucking hate it. Even though I work so fast in it, my software speed is incredible as I’ve found all the shortcuts needed to make my work flow faster. With that said, premiere is the worst software I have ever used in my life
Adobe can suck cocks. Fuck that company.
Yep, I'v been complaining to, and about Adobe for years. One of my Editors decided to update halfway through a project because they thought they might get better features (yes, he was stupid!). Na, all it's done is mess up the AAF import into Pro Tools and wasted me 2 days trying to work out a solution. Turn off auto update, then you get a project from another client, CC says you can't open project until you update CC. Update CC, Adobe says you can't open project unless you update your OS. Update OS, plugins don't work, bugs, errors, crashes, you get the picture.   

And fuck their subscription models, nobody needs a monthly subscription to their software unless hardware updates to a point where you have no choice. I've bought perpetual licences 10+yrs ago that I'm still using now. 

Davinci, only need to purchase once and can use for years. Can be a little clunky on time, but their user interface has vastly improved over the years and now it's my go-to software for picture.
I recently had to export an entire project to Resolve because Premiere - different versions on different computers - refused to export an AAF or OMF that was useable by my sound designer and mixer. It was a horrible week of trouble shooting and stressing and moving deliveries around. This is my livelihood and I was shook. Still sort of am.
The key really is just to just hate all of them.
waiting for the adobe staff verified accounts to come in here and smugly explain how youre using it wrong
DaVinci is taking the spot over PP  the same way China is taking over the  states in global economy: silently, in the background and just being better and more efficient
Just pulled the plug on Adobe after about 14 years, never going back.
Noped out of Adobe a little over a decade ago (and i used to work there a long time on web/video products), and haven't looked back. Affinity, Resolve, Reaper. Great software, and no subscriptions.
Could not agree with your assessment more. We are currently striking all of our licenses and switching to DaVinci for video. Surprisingly, canva for our quick one off designs is very robust and intuitive for folks in our shop to use.
I just had a font weight vanish from my computer overnight and now I’m wondering if it was caused by Adobe. I couldn’t find the font, thought I must be going crazy, but looked at some AE comps I had exported the day before and yep, they used that font. Now it’s nowhere to be found. Weirdest shit ever
pure truth no cap
Man, not trying to get into a war, but my experience with Adobe's tools over the last few years has really been pretty seamless (I started on the first release of Photoshop when it shipped on a pile of diskettes in 1990, I'm old as hell). But I read all these threads with Adobe rage (After Effects seems to take the most hits) and it hasn't happened to me (yet??)

I'm in AE sometimes ten hours a day, PS, AI, Premiere - my main complaints with Adobe is Premiere really should be viewing and rendering much faster (the current generation of FCP is just so smoking fast), and AI is getting some serious bloat. But going from Intel to a Studio was the best After Effects upgrade I've ever seen; I wonder how much of this is a Mac vs. PC issue. I'd love to see some data on that. 

Again, not wanting to get into *that* fight, but my tools just don't get in my way. And I'm full-time, editing, animation, VFX, motion graphics, maybe 1/3 of my work I actually shoot as well. I'm not doing anything special hardware-wise, plain old M2 studio (not an Ultra), the only thing I do differently than some users is *nothing* goes on my boot drive but OS, apps, email, personal docs. All of my cache/scratch/background tasks go to a dedicated NVME, my media's on an NVME RAID (which was like $300, no big deal). But I don't know any pro's that use their boot drives for media and project files. And I don't even own a laptop.

I do use Resolve for interviews - color grading and audio sweetening, Fairlight is just the SHIT. It's like ProTools without sussing out their mess of in/out issues - really almost a direct knockoff of ProTools. But that's just exported as ProRes HQ and dumped into FCP. FCP is still the fastest editing experience I've ever had. 

I wouldn't have a business without Adobe - if I stopped taking external projects, I'd lose half my income. I feel for ya OP, I hope my luck holds out!
I'm going to say it in a semi-curmudgeonly way.

They all suck. And if you think Apple, BMD, Avid or Adobe are actually great, you're lying to yourself. 

Each of the tools has had *royal shitshows* at different times. Much of why is that they add new features, some that work, some that are broke - many that work well in a demo and less good professionally. 

I've had every-single-one disappear. Just "gone".  Avid Error codes. I gave FCP (which has often been solid) a single file and it blew up it's memory. Much of Adobe pain is shitty formats. And you haven't lived until you keep missing a double deep menu in Resolve. Or something that exists on one page and has no existence on others (where it totally could.)

Much of it has to do with VFR and H264/5 media. ProRes is almost always bulletproof.

And FWIW, I'm having a personal shitshow with Adobe support right now…over Photoshop breaking and the actual Creative cloud app.
Audition is terrible. I may just go back to Garageband at this point.

Tell me more about this Reaper...
Quark Express forever
I've never had an issue. I have some serious survivorship bias with Adobe I guess.

But I definitely agree that they're scum. I don't like their tactics and I've seen them pulling their shady shit for a long time now.
Adobe Sucks. BMD please never change except for the better
I never looked back after switching from Premiere to Edius, some ten years ago. Even then it was a relief. DaVinci Resolve is ok, some things are faster/better, some are slower/harder than in Edius. I don't think it's my time to fully switch to Resolve.

Few months ago I installed Photoshop just to test the generative fill, as it was the base of their marketing - and found out that the AI 'thing' does not work at all, some legal issue... LOL.

I had some old tiny projects in Spark, and recently found out that Adobe made some free fonts not free anymore.

If I had to choose one thing I hate about Adobe the most, that wouldn't be anything people mention here and everywhere... I hate their SHORTCUTS!
I can think of a few companies worse then Adobe. Mostly companies producing biochemical weapons and such though.

In the media production software companies category though, Adobe definitely tops the list.
Some of us have to put up with Adobe’s shit because there are no other apps like After Effects on the market and they know it so they are being assholes and getting away with it.
It’s gotten bad for professionals. We just aren’t as big a market, nor does that larger market know enough to understand what’s required to produce great results. The AI tools are at best doing pretty good with the promise they will get better. Pretty good without the user having to pay the real cost yet, btw. 
So while Adobe is pretty bad, they are just one in a long line of those chasing growth through AI. From my experience Dow is still the worst company.
Don’t switch to Resolve!  Look what it did to my desk!  Definitely bloatware!

Question as I haven't used Davinci to edit yet - Do you have the same easy tools to play with graphics, easily keyframe shots etc? Or what are the main differences between Premiere and Davinci? (I know a quick google search or youtube videos can answer this, but would love the thoughts of an actual user like you).

I used to edit on FCP 7 back in the day and once apple ruinned  it, the jump to premiere was seamless compared to Avid - trying to add graphics on Avid or even just basic transform operations was annoying. So curious how the premiere workflow adapts to Davinci.
I just switched this month to Affinity Publisher/Designer/Photo and cancelled my Adobe account. I guess I will try out DaVinci next, I haven't done much video editing recently so I haven't needed to but I'm just glad to be rid of the monthly fee. 

No other problems with Adobe but I used to own CS6 years ago until it stopped working with my system updates, and I really felt bad paying a monthly fee for a program I already own. I don't do much high level work so I just needed the basics anyway.
I started with da vinci since I much prefer  one time payment model to a monthly sub model, im so glad I did 😅
Careful. I got FLAMED on this sub for mentioning the constant crashes and bad updates.
Sorry, I strongly disagree. I'm old. I've been using Photoshop since it was born, and basically every other Adobe product since they were released or acquired from another company. I defy anyone to show me a higher-value suite of continuously evolving products for $50 a month or less.

Take a step back. It's a fucking miracle that you and your computer can render out 4K clips of moving images while tossing back a cup of coffee and doom-scrolling Twitter. Does Premiere have bugs? Sure. Do FCP, AVID or DaVinci? Sure. But you know what? I'd offer anyone to go back and try editing 3/4" videotape or even better, cutting negative, compare that to Adobe's workflow then get back to me about how miserable their existence is. The integration between Adobe apps rocks. The continual evolution of their products rocks.  The price for the suite rocks. I could complain about the bugs but, seriously, the whole deal is a frigging miracle.
Davinci is great.
I never miss an opportunity to tell people to drop Adobe and get DaVinci. Hated them ever since they started ripping people off with the subscription model.

DaVinci is great (but if you're a motion graphics designer you're unfortunately stuck with AE for now, but for everything else, there's no excuse not to use DaVinci.)
I'd like to join in on this. FUCK adobe. Been using it since high school as well and the code is basically the same. A big time engineer friend of mine hard agrees. He said, "They basically make functional enough programs and then gift wrap it for subscription. Their code has not changed in ages and it's fucking garbage.".

They keep bloating it with more and more features for content creators and it's adding a lot of weight to the software with what feels like ZERO optimization, thorough tests, or deeper programming, which is part of the main reason why I'm about to move to Davinci myself and it's heartbreaking because I KNOW premiere so well and have basically created my own workflows and so many macros and shortcut keys. I'm about to move to Davinci because it utilizes tf out of the money I spent on my computer. absolutely using full bandwidth of my CPU and GPUs. Davinci exports 4K+ RAW footage with heavy color and effects LIKE BUTTER compared to Adobe premiere. Adobe doesn't utilize jack shit ESPECIALLY After Effects. Davinci can actually work as fast as you can.

Bottom line, ADOBE NEEDS TO COMPLETELY REPROGRAM AND RETHREAD THEIR SOFTWARE INSTEAD OF DISTRACTING US WITH BLOATING IN MORE NEW FEATURES. FIX THE REAL PROBLEM AT HAND. Cheap greedy sons of bitches. And Davinci is ONE FUCKING PAYMENT AND IT'S YOURS, AND IT SMOKES ADOBE IN PERFORMANCE. WHY?? HOW????

  
Fuck man.. thank you for the thread.
**TLDR: Final Cut Pro X is the shit. Not joking.** Look into it and you'll see why some veteran cutters are switching.

25+ year Emmy Award winning (non-humblebrag) Doc editor here. Mained Media Composer from the start of my career in 98. Grew into the occasional FCP 7 job back when it had massive inroads in the short form world. Once it changed to FCPX and the pro world dropped it completely I found my way to Premiere. Found it much easier to work with native media in Premiere but would still choose Avid for long form work due to its media management and collaborative workflow solutions. (As long as you took the time to render proxies.)

Dual used Media Composer and Premiere for the past decade, each have their strengths and weaknesses. Media composer is the devil I know and Avid is hysterically bad at keeping the codebase up with new OS and hardware releases. Adobe will have software available and tested for new updates almost immediately, but then Premiere will lose link to random pieces of media in your project after updating. That's a level of crazy making I have yet to match. 

A little over a year ago I stumbled on an article by a veteran editor explaining why he switched to FCPX and wasn't turning back. It was a great read and got me interested, so I downloaded the free trial and started playing around with FCPX. It's now my favorite NLE app by a mile. 

In short, they changed how editing works in the timeline. You no longer need to spend half your time arming and disarming tracks,  lassoing odd chunks, or opening gaps to insert new work while dancing around sync issues... the "trackless" workflow and magnetic timeline are the evolution of editing. You'll hate it for a day or so until it clicks, then you'll never want to go back. Every other editing app feels like stepping back in time now. 

There are still jobs that have to be Avid or Premiere based on client / shared workflow needs, and I still haven't tried cutting a multi-hour network doc in FCPX and I'm not sure how I would like it, but for short form work it's a dream. This last statement might hit home for some of you who have been at this for a while: FCPX made working in the timeline actually *fun* again. Fun. Imagine that! 

I'm babbling all of this because I'm so thankful to the guy who posted the article that intrigued me enough to try it out. If you're lucky enough to still have steady editing work, are Mac based and you can choose your editing platform, give FCPX a shot. You'll be surprised. (Just to say it, I'm not affiliated with apple or FCPX in any way other than being a user.) Worth mentioning that I bought a tutorial to learn the basics of FCPX and that was clutch. YouTubers can get you pretty far, but people who are experts at teaching make a big difference. Highly recommend RippleTrainings Final Cut Pro Core Training.

  
Last thought: OP, I can sense the unbridled rage in your post and want to share that I feel you. I've been there with Premiere a number of times, some of them cost me days of work and billable time. Their bugs cost me a good chunk of money. It's beyond crazy making. To stay current on hardware we can't stay stagnant on OS updates, which means not staying stagnant on software updates, which means rolling the dice on reliability.  Glad to hear you're in a happier place with Resolve. I still need to learn that one. It's just a matter of time until a project with its name on it comes calling. 

Here's the link to the site that hooked me: [https://nofilmschool.com/switched-final-cut-pro-x-after-25-years](https://nofilmschool.com/switched-final-cut-pro-x-after-25-years)

Cheers all, and stay positive out there. Hard to do while our industry is in semi-collapse, but things will eventually level out and we'll find a new normal. Until then, take care of your mental health as much as possible.  It's currently rough days, but good things are born from chaos. Man, this turned into work therapy for me. Sorry for the huge post.
Well said.
As a Colorist, Ive been pleading with all of you Adobe heads for ages. PLEASE listen to OP.
Best adobe app:

The one that removes all the adobe apps
https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/kb/cc-cleaner-tool-installation-problems.html
I spent over 10k on them...only for them to f me over. I haven't used FCP regularly since about 2015 after my last MBP died, as soon as they announced that skimming agreement I closed my account bought a Mac and FCP. ( I don't like Vegas or davinci)
I agree with you about Adobe. But what do I do about photoshop and Lightroom classic?
Problem is that every job post I see working with an editing team it's almost always Premiere.   
  
Only time I see Resolve in job posts is for color correction.
I am happy that Davinci is working for you. I had the opposite experience. I couldn’t get davinci to run without it constantly crashing on me.  It drove me back to Premiere.
I have been working with Adobe for 10 years now. Of course there are bugs and of course there are crashes but for me it never crashed often or on critical projects. Unless I work with weird footage premiere runs fine for me. But unlike others I stick to common codecs and don't update when I have a stable version.
Sorry to hear that you have been having trouble. 

Issues come up now and again, but Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Media Encoder all run pretty well on my workstations.
Once you know what it likes, Premiere is great.  And Resolve is great for color.  

In my experience editing in Resolve, I had a couple major issues with proxies and delivering an AAF to mix.  Therefore, I don’t trust it.
Yeah defo, but I can’t switch to anything cause I know how to use 22 to a T
Personally prefer Adobe's workflow for editing then switch to Resolve for grading, but fuck man the former keeps crashing on me.
>Recently, it has literally ruined my life to the point where I had to switch to DaVinci Resolve. And wow -- am I glad I did. It feels like the day I switched from Adobe Audition to REAPER.

Does Reaper have a spectral editor like Audition's which allows you to spot heal/remove certain frequencies to get rid of things like clicks and pops? I find that's the most useful part of Audition which keeps me there.
This made me ponder, the title not the body of text, but I’ve been using Adobe for atleast 6 years now and there’s things about it that definitely piss me off but over all it’s been a reliable software. My biggest gripe is paying $60 for CC when all I use are pp, ae and ps
I ditched adobe for other editors. Got sick and tired of their crap and the subscription model is not sustainable for someone like me who uses it mostly for fun.
I wish Adobe wasn't required in the professional world but unfortunately it's required for most professional related things 😭
I'd love to switch to DaVinci but I'm a bit stuck as I also use photoshop/aftereffects/illustrator extensively and I love how they all talk to each other. I've also been using them for a similar amount of time as OP (started using them at uni in 07) and apart from Maya+Blender, they are all I've known. 

God I hate adobe though.
Export times alone from Premier to Resolve are the key reasons why I switched.
I like premiere. It doesn’t crash for me. I edit on a MacBook and I have a proxy workflow.
I wish I could switch to DaVinci but my job uses premiere so I gotta deal with the BS. Premiere is the only one I got issues with though, PS, LR & AE work pretty good for me
I wholeheartedly agree. I really enjoy InDesign, Lightroom and Photoshop but the Video editing software by Adobe is just pure dogshit. It doesnt run well, it crashes too much, trouble replaying footage in preview and let alone starting After Effects or a Premiere Project takes ages even with a freshly set up M2 ssd (870 evo) and the cost is in comparison to Davinci just outrageous. Plus the new terms that they just can use your work. I‘d rather pay half of a yearly subscription for a Davinci license forever. Shit is just hitting the fan with this company.
Can someone resurrect Adobe Suite 5? - that was the last good copy.
But is there anything that realistically replace after effects?
I’m going to do this. I’m so sick of Adobe for all the reason above. Also been a user for 20 years and it’s just keeps getting worse and worse.

The other thing I hate about Adobe is something I found out recently that in the latest update the Terms and Conditions state that Adobe owns the copyright to anything you produce in its software, as a commercial media producer this is unacceptable 

Thank you for your post
Paul from Adobe here and I’m glad the OP switched and is happy but I don’t wish what has happened to him on my worst enemy. Personally I use Illustrator and Ps and don’t have crashes any more than any other software. And when I do I appreciate the “Recovered” file because I remember when I’d resign to just rebuilding my files from scratch. Also I’m on a Mac so I think that also helps. And I only use Pr about 10% of the time. But maybe it has a tendency to crash a lot? 

Anyway. Glad you’re happy. From one creative to another. Life is hard enough without having to deal with stupid tech issues.
FCPX for me.
Had the exact same experience, except that I bought a big FCP and other program bundle. One time payment, and no dumbass subcriptions or crashes.
You know what else works? Avid🤣🤣🤣
But seriously, if you can master the Media Composer workflow, you are golden. Resolve has come a long way, and if it continues to improve, it might actually replace Premiere. Time will tell.
You keep saying it’s ruined “your life” or the issues have been your “entire life”. I don’t love Adobe, and can’t say I’ve had the significant issues you’re having (Premiere editor for 15 years) but have you um…..been doing other things outside of working to improve the rest of your life? I get the annoyance, but work is just work my man. What else are you doing?
Adobe’s subscription model is a scam. Avoid giving them money whenever possible.
yeah they lost me when they started asking a monthly fee for their programs. i get it, a lot of people love it, but i don't want to have to be online when working, i have lived in a lot of rural areas where the internet can go out if someone coughs. And just monthly fees in general for every damn thing- over it.
If you haven't properly configured your equipment (mac or pc) for redundancy then that's on you. EVERY NLE has issues. But the first rule of video editing is and always has been redundancy.
I love DaVinci, I just wish that it had a lightroom/photoshop replacement. Would love to edit photos with nodes
I rarely have issues with Premiere or AE. I'm guess I'm just lucky. I work all day in AE with very little hiccups.
I really like PP, and I’m a confirmed Avid user.
Meh, I can't remember the last time I had issues to be honest.  Except when I was trying to use a Insta360 plugin about a year ago but I think that had more to do with the plugin.
Yeah, you can definitely say that again! TRY DaVinci Resolve 19 https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/ca/products/davinciresolve it’s FREE and has better features than adobe! I would rather use da Vinci resolve 19 instead of Adobe, even if it was the same price.
YES come to the dark side of Blackmagic. Fusion is underrated as well.
Switched to davinci 2 years ago. Hardly ever open adobe anymore
Thank God I'm a \*PIRATE\*
I went back to Premiere for a project not long ago and they still haven't fixed the bugs that I had encountered SEVEN YEARS ago.
Yeah, adobe as a company is terrible.

They also have near monopoly on the market, because outside of video editors, nothing else come close, especially when it comes to supporting ecosystem and AI features.

It's sad but there's little we can do.
Gentle disagree. Premiere’s biggest weakness is its biggest strength: it has a lot of tools and accepts a lot of codecs. This makes it really accessible to a wide range of editors, but also makes it easy to not maximize your workflow. 

I find if I’m following a “traditional”  workflow - transcode everything to ProRes before ingesting, working only on optimized machines from media on a fast server, and only use basic effects - it’s a very stable offline editor. When I inherit projects from editors who mix a million codecs, add a bunch of effects, and nest with wild abandon then… yeah. It starts to crash. 

There are definitely things I like better in Avid, but Premiere works for our pipeline and has been a solid tool.
I'm gonna get a lot of flack again by saying this but honestly Premiere is unrivalled when it comes to editing software
Have you tried deleting your caches? 99% of Adobe problems solved for me.
r/Reaper one of us one of us
I can get behind the statement that Adobe has much room for improvement with its business practices and product development decisions.

However as someone who has used Premiere Pro over the past 10 years, I do disagree with some of your points about Premiere being absolute trash. These are just my own experiences, and by no means am I invalidating yours.

Premiere became way more stable once I switched over to Mac, especially when Adobe made it run natively on Apple Silicon. I get that this solution isn't going to help PC users, but Premiere does seem to run better overall on Macs. I also saw performance improvements when I set up everything optimally:

* Premiere installed on fastest drive (same as OS)
* Project files and media on a separate drive
* Cache files on it's own drive

Most of the Premiere issues I ever had stemmed from one of three root causes:

1. Editing with VFR footage
2. Editing with a highly compressed codec like H.264
3. Corrupted cache files

For points 1 & 2, transcoding media is the best solution, and really doesn't slow down the workflow much. And for corrupted cache files, it's a simple fix by deleting the cache files from wherever they are stored.

I also have a license for DaVinci Resolve Studio, and there are quite a few things I much prefer within Resolve. However there are also some wonky things that keep me from switching to it as my NLE of choice.

I'm not a fan of the database structure for saving project files. You can literally delete entire projects and folders from the home screen of Resolve, and there are no confirmation prompts or safety checks to say "Do you really want to delete these files?" I accidentally discovered this by deleting a folder with all my work from this year in it, and although I restored the main database file, there are like 3-5 other smaller database files that all have to match. If one doesn't match, your projects don't appear in Resolve. This is a HUGE oversight in my opinion, especially not having any confirmation of a rather critical action.

The way Resolve caches is weird. In Premiere, even if I've bogged down my timeline with clips, effects, color adjustments, motion graphics, etc., I can render the timeline and then it plays back in real time. With Resolve, once my timeline gets a bit heavier than just clips, even after rendering it will still slow down and not play back in real time. I have no idea how to fix this and after researching it looks like there really isn't a fix at this time.

Lastly, Premiere is pretty easy to troubleshoot if there's an issue, as it throws an error code and will let you know what frame has an issue. It could be my lack of experience with Resolve, but I've never got a specific error  code. It just crashes or decides to stop working, and troubleshooting is more difficult.

If Resolve works better for you, great! Continue to use it and enjoy that Adobe subscription-free life. No NLE is perfect and each one will eventually have hiccups at some point. As for me, Premiere (23.0 and higher) is the most stable NLE on my M1 Mac Studio (compared to FCPX and Resolve.)

Fuck adobe. All my homies hate adobe
Been using gimp since 2010.also use Davinci for video, dark table for photo editing. Didn't have the money to justify creative cloud in college ten years ago definitely don't have it now.
If Adobe would just work it would be great.

I'd love to swap, but many of the cool plugins/scripts/libraries/templates etc that I use and save me ungodly amounts of time are all only in Premiere/After Effects sadly
I still get notifications from the Adobe User Voice forums where people are responding to posts I made years ago pointing out broken or missing features that are *still* not sorted. Occasionally there’s an update from an Adobe employee to say that something will be coming in the next update and all I can think is “Too late. I switched to Resolve years ago because it already has this feature.”

It’s so nice to have unshackled myself from that company and to be using software made by people who genuinely seem to understand what we need and who innovate in ways we couldn’t have imagined.
Maybe learn technical workflow. I have no problems.
Strongly disagree with this. Unfortunately every one of your problems is probably due to user error. As an expert level Adobe user across Premiere and After Effects, and plenty skilled in both Resolve and Avid, I can tell you without a doubt that Premiere is the most stable of all the applications I use. I've had Avid crash on me for simply pushing the play button.
Why I love Final Cut Pro X
Downvoted due to hyperbolic title.
How did it literally ruin your life? Did it delete an import project for a client or something?
I’ve honestly never experienced the whole “Premiere Pro always crashes” experience, but then again, I have a decently powerful laptop and started using Adobe products around 2021, so I’m sure most of the bugs have gotten weeded out by the time I started using their products. Adobe definitely does overprice their subscriptions, but my school has been paying for my Creative Cloud lately, so I haven’t had to deal with the price lately. The only reason I’m starting to switch from Premiere to DaVinci was for the color grading. Prior to that, I would edit in Premiere, export an XML, and color grade in DaVinci. I still use their photography programs, though.
I believe you're in the wrong place for this. Lots of more amateur editors can get by with Da Vinci or Reaper, but the pros need what the whole Adobe suite offers and I personally need the stability of Adobe stuff. I know you had trouble with crashes or whatever but I never have, and yet I have had issues when using the other company products

Yes the AI thing is particularly egregious, but that's not limited to just Adobe stuff, as Da Vinci is also advertising for upcoming AI additions, for example

To each their own
I love my Adobe subscription. it does everything I need and beyond. happy camper.
They're literally foaming at the mouths over AI. Forced it into everything imaginable. Went to an Adobe conference and every single chat or new tool was AI. Talk about not knowing your audience.
I will never understand them actively trying to destroy the industry they are meant to be supplying.
Global downturn in the economy much?
Agree with all your points.
Completely agree. I hate their subscription model and their predatory tactics, but the only issues I’ve encountered with their products are cause my pc is already considered old
Yea, it has some quirks but if you are using it correctly, with good workflow you will not have problems. Overwhelming majority of these problems is user error and bad media management.
I'm a bit younger than you and I've been using PageMaker and Freehand as well when it was Macromedia (after Aldous)

so are you telling us that you've NEVER been working in Photoshop for hours when it suddenly disappears from existence? and when you open it up again it acts like nothing happened?! of course you should remember the days when the software didn't even show a crash prompt. As a matter of fact I was working in Photoshop today, I switched to chrome to save an image and when I wanted to go back to Photoshop it was just GONE! I opened it up again and hope the "recovery" would bring back my file, but nope!

I don't know what you're on about, but the software has ALWAYS been buggy, is still buggy, and WILL remain buggy for a simple reason: they don't clean up old code. they just add more lines of code on top of existing ones because adding features and sales is their ONLY priority.
Part of Premiere's stability issues is it's ability to run on a very wide variety of hardware and its ability to work with a large number of video formats natively. A positive thing in most cases, but also dangerous.
Other editors like Avid MC made the environment more stable just by strictly controlling the requirements. Had to have specific hardware, had to transcode to their codecs, and so on.

I started editing on Premiere many years ago in its earlier form. Premiere wasn't taken seriously by the professional industry - it was FCP or Avid. Later a job required me to switch to Avid MC as that's what they were using in house. I struggled a bit learning a new way of working and adjusting to Avid's quirks.
Then Apple released FCPX and upended the industry. Soon Premiere became the thing. I held on to using Avid MC for as long as I could as I had become used to its speed and workflow. I would switch between the two when a project needed it. Eventually, everyone I was working with was working with Premiere. Work got enterprise licensing for CC so pretty much forced into using it.
Premiere still aggravates me. I don't usually have stability problems and crashing but just a lot of head scratching moments of why it does or doesn't do things. A lot of "why can't I just do this?" Lots and lots of little quirks.
I've used Davinci for many years. Primarily for color, but have used the editor as well for certain projects. It's fine but it also has its issues and quirks.
None of them are perfect. They all have their own issues.
Use whatever fits your budget, fits your needs, and fits the job.
I am actually a fan of the subscription model.

I once paid $1,200.00 for a Photoshop license. And that was useless after a few years due to OS and chip incompatibility, unless you want to give another $600.00 for the upgrade.

And that was for ONE piece of software.
That's funny...I was editing VR one minute without issue and then suddenly struggling in a completely normal project the next. Since switching to DaVinci -- none of that has happened with the same media. I hear this argument all the time and having to add five extra steps to the workflow is a pretty bad solution. No issues with DaVinci so far.
Bro said Aldus Freehand lol. Damn.....
Nailed it. Professionally been using PS since PS5. As a solo editor/developer that does a lot of different things, I like the subscription model at its current price. 

My biggest gripe about Adobe is that Lightroom is still an archaic app and they just hammered AI into it instead of actually developing the app.
I have been using for more than 20 years, image editing softwares, 3D editing softwares and 3D game engines. And I can tell you that software really crash, bad software crash a lot, even with clean powerful computer.  
Some versions of Photoshop and Premiere crashes, with bugs that are documented. Some versions of 3ds Max crashed by doing a combination of actions, or just using  "undo". Unreal Engine crash a lot! Nothing to do with mallware.
Yeah, business owners want DIY until they realize the smart money pay a professional to do the work like you’re supposed to and came up with much better results. They may have taken a loss upfront by paying an expert in the field of photography, videography or graphic design. always remember it takes money to make money.. Just because there’s AI out there doesn’t mean that art is like us are obsolete. There’s a reason why some people are artist but most not.
After effects users hard disagree lol
I use after effects for work, I go through about 8 crashes every single day (it's absolutely not my system) and 5% of the time I actually get a reason or error message for the crash. This is on top of other time losing bugs or quirks that will just introduce themselves randomly.

Sometimes the effects panel gets stuck to one specific comp. Sometimes playback will just turn black for no reason. Sometimes it won't playback more than 4 frames unless I close and re-open (clearing cache is not the solution, and I have 128gb ram) just to name a few.

It also lacks support for 32bit footage (industry standard) for basic and commonly used effects like grain or luma keying.

The only thing I can think of that AE does that another program can't do as well is Rotobrush (that I know of), and if I use that at full resolution I have a 70% chance of it crashing. Every day I just hope fusion becomes as versatile so I can switch to it already and cop the learning curve.
based
Valid point of view.
personally fcpx has disappointed me the least out of all of them, granted i have a soft spot for it since i’ve used it since high school
This is the way.
if davinci did that it prob had a good reason
Oh no. Looks like that other guy was right...DaVinci hate post incoming. 😉
Gotta be iMovie.
He said Davinci Resolve, not catturd2.
OP got a lot to learn about companies doing bad and what bad really means...
Technically correct, although completely irrelevant to the spirit and context of the post.
Not a fan of Acer either.
You should try calling Microsoft these days. Unbelievable.
162 billion dollars profit this year, and speaking to a human is like getting blood out of a stone.
Go post in r/water about nestle then. This post is about Adobe
Not much for nuance, huh? Also not that great of a comparison. 😂
Switched from FCP7 to Premiere probably a little over 10 years ago now. I don't really use other NLE's because my clients don't and alternatives would cause problems. 

I've made probably a million dollars on this software by now. It doesn't crash that often for me either. It's fine, I use it daily, it doesn't make me angry, and in context it's not really very expensive. Maybe It's an attitude thing?
Text based editing in premiere is currently years ahead of any other NLE and is saving me and my author so much time. And by that we are making double the money, no joke, because we work so fast, but the network still pays the same days as non text based editing would have caused. I can't be more thankful to Adobe tbh.
Yeah hard disagree with OP, as a Premiere user who has also been at it since high school. Resolve doesn't compete with the package of Premiere and After Effects.
Nothing will make me use adobe software as long as they have their predatory subscription model. Which they have increased by about 20% recently btw.
Well if 19 goes as good as 18 went then it won't be long. Or when they realize Blackmagic also doesn't care about what people have been asking to be added or fixed for the last 7 years.
If something better comes along then why not. This is stupid logic.
Never. I didn't like AVID's workflow because I was already used to Premiere (but at least it was stable). Premiere was first, AVID was a necessary evil in my industry and then Premiere slowly got worse. Any more stupid questions?

Edit: Shouldn't have said never. If they mess Resolve up -- I'll happily criticize it.
I won't shill for any software (except REAPER because it's just so great). Not saying that's what you were doing, BTW.  To each their own! I would have preferred to stay with what I cut my teeth on but had to make a change. Use whatever works for you.
You're Premiere agnostic and you don't recommend beginners use Premiere Pro Rush? Why?   

>but if you want to work at a professional level I don't see it ever competing.

I think unless you're in every post house at all times this is lofty speculation, I've had a decent amount of broadcast work where I was asked to cut in Resolve, some of those projects have won awards; but the thing is all of them ended up being purchased by actual broadcasters and had decent budgets. So, it's competing in my eyes and I usually have a great time editing in Resolve.
I feel this comment on a deep level. With you my friend
The current version of 24 is borderline not usable
The latest release is legit. Lots of features added and other features tightened up.
Oh and also, now they're basically given themselves licensing rights over your content and the permission use your PRIVATE content it to train their AI. Absolutely ludicrous. I say we pick a day, ban together and all cancel our subscriptions on that same day!
It's so bad. It's caused me so much unnecessary stress. I feel your pain.
Wouldn't know. Realized I wasn't even following this sub after I posted this.
I hope so. I can't stand what they've done (and haven't done) to software I used to love.
$300 for lifetime updates is hard to beat!
Not trying to convince you to leave something that works but if you ever need to leave -- I was in the same boat. I actually synched some Media Composer shortcuts with my Premiere and Reaper key shortcuts so it wouldn't be as confusing. Can easily port the same workflow into Resolve and make it what you want.
Oh it's already happening 😂
That's a great point that I feel deeply. Using DaVinci feels like the beginning of a great endeavor that is (so far) very promising. Premiere feels like a rut I can't get out of.
Go into Creative Cloud into Manage Fonts (or whatever they call the stupid thing they decided was better than just installing the font like every other font). That's definitely the issue.
Mac vs PC seems to be a big part of this equation after reading all these posts.
I agree with all of this. I'm sure I will run into issues with Resolve. It has just alleviated so many frustrations at once that it seems like it's heaven-sent. What's going on with you and the Creative Cloud app?
This is right.
😂
Yes -- key frames and everything are present. My favorite feature i didn't know I wanted is that everything from Effect Controls is called Inspector in Resolve but also includes Stabilization and many other settings in one panel. It is NOTHING like switching to AVID. I went from Premiere to AVID and it was really rough but I eventually figured it out. I got used to DaVinci within a day.
95% of Studio features (and maybe 100% that are relevant for you) are found in the Free version so no risk in trying it out!
Another old schooler agrees with you.
It rules.
This is essentially how it feels to me. Unoptimized sludge. You'll get super used to Resolve and quickly.

Edit: Also, no one really goes into how bad the Creative Cloud app is. If it needs an update, everything breaks in nonsensical ways. The ten processes it needs to run is also asinine. Why I ever accepted it is beyond me.
Appreciate the thoughtful response! I will look more into FCX even though I probably won't switch. I have an Android but zero allegiance to Google; Windows but zero allegiance to Microsoft, nothing from Apple but the same attitude. I don't think it's smart to pledge allegiance to any of these companies with the exception of the REAPER team because they ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEIR CUSTOMERS and collaborate with them. A little aside -- one of the REAPER devs once fixed a Pro Tools bug and sent Avid the fix. They voided his warranty. 😬
Thanks for posting this info and the link. This guy’s explanation on FCPX is very helpful. Thanks!
Thanks! Gonna need this soon.
Same thing with Media Composer and Pro Tools at one point. Didn't make them better.
iZotope RX does and works as a plugin in several NLE.
*Nonsensically Variable Export Times

And I swear to f*** -- if one person mentions rendering from previews...I know!!!
Hyperbole due to frustration*
Rarely had to use AE so can't speak to that. 🤷
This is summed up perfectly using the example of syncing audio in Premiere. On the Adobe website you can still find the original instructions on how to sync audio (using ‘merge clips’) from about 10/15 years ago. This method was slow and became infamous for causing all sorts of issues, so users found workarounds by using the multicam workflow to sync audio.

To this day, that shonky workaround with all of its flaws and compromises has become the recommended practice by Adobe. It blows my fucking mind that they haven’t just fixed and improved on the original, much neater, much better (in theory) way of doing it.

Compare that to Resolve (and Avid) where audio syncing by timecode is both instantaneous and flexible. Above all else it’s the reason I switched to Resolve.
You've got that right, but probably not in the way you're suggesting.  I had an unrivalled experience in Premiere once - I think it's the only time i've openly wept at work.
You'll only get flack if you leave the details of why at that incredibly vague endorsement.
Yes I've tried all the things. Tired of hunting for the next one.
🤘
I'm on Windows so I can't speak at all to what it's like on Mac. I know all the workarounds and dealing with cache. I was having to do it waaaay too often.
Fair enough! Just speaking to my own experience.
1000%
I'm genuinely happy for you. Not the case with me anymore.
Well I know it isn't but you're entitled to your opinion.
Awe shucks. Whatever shall I do.
😂😂😂 LOL to the REAPER comment. Go tell that to the entire video game industry.
Funny because I wasn't even talking about subscriptions you stupid bot.
> Talk about not knowing your audience.

Oh they know the audience, and it isnt you. Its actually replacing you- its the business owners who want to DIY their own content/media with automagical ai tools and dont want to hire people anymore

This audience blindly pays 29/month for adobe cc (usually part of their amex benefits) and is responsible for adobe's stock performance
Sadly it's about targeting a new audience
Imagine if they removed the toolbar and all menu items and just had an AI button?  I wouldn't be surprised
They want all the fun parts taken out. 🤷
yeah, every time I see a Premiere is unstable post my head automatically goes to a timeline filled with 4k mp4s from a drone. or Iphone VFR footage......
That happened occasionally to coworkers. It (almost) never happened to me. I purposefully run a VERY stable and clean system. 

I am not saying Adobe makes crash-proof apps. I am saying they have been no more or less stable than other apps in my experience.
Not going to hear me argue with this!
I'd say that the requirement to support a variety of hardware is a failing of the PC industry, not Adobe. Yes, I realize that I sound like an Adobe apologist. I assure you, I am not. I am just trying to make a point. 

When you require that software run smoothly on an unpredictable and constantly varying hardware mish-mash - well - it's just asking for trouble. (I won't go into detail about now crappy I think the Windows environment is). And most software companies (Adobe included) have performed admirably in the face of such adversity. I cannot imagine how daunting the task must be to "support" so many configurations.

That's not to say that PCs are bad. I get that the variety of options is exactly what makes the PC industry so amazing and powerful. But it is also inherently unstable. 

No judgement. Not trying to be judgy here...

That's why I moved to Macs. One platform, one OS, one interface, and no danger of a gazillion drivers/RAM types/motherboards/BIOS configurations/peripherals. It just works (well, it works 99.99% of the time). Sure, I can't swap my RAM, but I bought an M1 Macbook Pro with 64GB RAM and it outperforms my Core i9 128GB RAM Widows 10 box (3080) in every workflow except 3D. One OS, one interface, and almost completely no crashes or instability. 

There's something to be said for system stability. 

A lot of replies to my above comment lashed out at me saying that Adobe apps are unstable. I would argue my original point; they are as stable as any other package. It's the computer they are running on that makes the system unstable. It is far more likely that the system is causing the crashes, not one specific software package (that is on its 120th iteration from a large commercial vendor like Adobe who may not have a super quick bug-response time, but addresses stability issues because it affects their bottom line). 

I used Avid Media Composer when I worked at Intel (for a decade). We had a dedicated machine for it that was air-gapped from the network (because corporate or Windows updates would break Avid). It was powerful, but I found it to be awkward and way too much work. I never liked the interface and found it difficult to adopt. We had to sneaker-net (carry) assets from the graphics team on CDs/DVDs to the editing machine to add them to a timeline. It was miserable. But it was "Pro". 

I was the first to pioneer the use of FCP7 when it was released. I LOVED IT!!! Not just the cleanliness of the MacOS, but the ease of use, responsive updates, stability, and the fact that we could safely have Adobe's Creative Suite (CS2? CS3?) on the machine simultaneously. It sped up workflow and was a HUGE gain for the department - and for pennies on the dollar compared to our AVID contract. 

I'll never look back.
That's much better than DaVinci's price tag of $300 and lifetime free upgrades.
i may need to edit a project with 6k vr.. you'd recommend DaVinci? Does it have good corrected overlay support etc?
Well unfortunately that's the one I've least seen actually being used on real, well-paying gigs so I've never used it. I was a full-time FCP7 user back almost 15 years ago but we all know how that ended.
Ask any **Sonos** owner what a bad company is.

And I say 'owner' versus 'user' as too often they are not the same.
Every time someone shit talks Adobe there's people like "Welll aschkuallllllly..." in every thread, which makes me think Adobe spends more time botting comment threads saying their product sucks shit, (something that you can search for and find hundreds of this same kinda post in a million subreddits), than improving their crumbling terrible program infrastructure
The best kind of correct.
I thought this post was about the worst company ever. Its even in the title.
I mean you *did* say "worst company ever" not "worst editing software company ever"...
Nuance? You said "Worst. Company. Ever."
An editor …with an attitude ‽
Yeah we've been heavily using that feature
Resolve has it too, but I tend not to trust it. How is eith premiere? Does it allow a multicam sequence with that?
I don't really need After Effects so I can't speak to that part.
Five fusion a try. It’s not there yet, undoubtedly, but for the most part, for the social network edit or small doc, it’s there. And with the power bin I din’t even need to do some fancy preser for other people, I just send them a project eith all the asset
Resolve and after effects compete big time premiere and after effects tho
OK but for that fee, £50, I can make 8 grand a month?
To be fair 18.5 was an incredible stable version to me. Just upgraded to 19, let’s hope..
The entire post seems pretty shilly. Use what works. And it’s genuine, I do not know these “issues” and haven’t ran into them through multiple post houses. Just interested in what and why.
There's always a buncha shills whenever this post about Adobe is made, search any subreddit that uses Adobe and you'll find identical descriptions as yours as to why adobe sucks highly upvoted and then a comment thread full of dorks like "well i think theyre a flawless company and ive never even experienced a single crash and Ive been editing videos since before Adobe existed, Adobe made me the man I am and I owe them my life"
1) premieres great, rush isn’t
2) premiere costs money, davinci doesn’t

That’s why I recommend it to students beginners starting out, no financial barrier and it’s better than premieres own “light” version. But once they graduate or start looking to freelance, I generally suggest premiere and/or avid.

Davinci’s obviously used plenty for color, and I’m sure there are exceptions to the rule (eg I know one boutique post house that uses FCPX for their unscripted work),  but no overall the number of houses currently using avid or premiere still vastly outweighs it in LA, and I’ve yet to see any signs of that changing considerably. At the studio level nobody even wants to touch it. I had to help a friends indie film do audio turnovers from their davinci edit and it was a horrendous experience. More power to anyone using it though, you should know all three.
who cares about what you like and what you don't like.  You want to make a living in this industry ? You learn AVID Media Composer, you learn Adobe Premiere, you learn Davinci Resolve.   Bugs, issues, things don't work - WHO CARES - this is what you have to deal with - and what we have had to deal with since day one of AVID (and every other damn software program, including FCP, FCP X, CapCut, Vegas, and everything else).  There will ALWAYS be problems, there will always be bugs.  You don't think that Resolve has problems with Blackmagic Cloud RIGHT NOW ?  You don't think that Blackmagic has problems with Cloud Store RIGHT NOW ?    You love Resolve, right ?  Why are you not on the [forum.blackmagicdesign.com](http://forum.blackmagicdesign.com) user forums for Resolve, and Post Production ?  

Everyone is a big shot - all these programs have problems. That is what updates are for.  When will things "just work "   ?     NEVER. 

Bob
I hope I'll never ever have to touch the "Exposure" or any other slider in that software again. Deeply disappointed and I used to love after effects but I can't earn money with this software anymore, so it has to go. In the end I'll be using the software that gets the job done the best.
Exactly!
Yeah I’m actually using Resolve for any projects that doesn’t need special effects or quick turnaround
Just because Premiere users (and some veteran users at that) are explaining that they themselves have no issues, and that most issues with Premiere are the result of user error, that makes them smug Adobe verified accounts? I don't understand the logic here...
I'm still in mild shock over the M2 Studio. I had a complex AE scene that took 57 minutes to render on an Intel Mac Pro (cylinder, not the latest one) - 7 minutes on the studio. My Studio, NVME RAID and NVME scratch disc was all about $3k (and I got like $500 for my old Mac and RAID). I've never had such a freakishly crazy upgrade, and my first Mac was a Plus, around 1990. I just never have crashes or freezes. My wife can't seem to access the printer through her laptop, only issue I'm still having.
Photoshop just stopped out of nowhere. Regular & beta. Something to do with the current + premiere beta install.

Then it took 10 days to actually get it working (some 6 service calls, then two appointments blown off by Adobe.) 

Creative cloud: I still have the “if I go from wired to wireless” aka switch networks, it takes a reboot to get the “App page” to work. The rest of the pages fine. But any network switch seems to prevent the app page from loading. Means a reboot as I need to check beta compatibility and new features.

And I could totally lean into a clients enterprise support - and I have some deep contacts inside of adobe itself. But nope, I’m going to wait until they actually behave. What I’m sad about is that I stopped documenting tech support calls (across the board) - because…well, again, alll these companies suck.
That's great and makes me excited to know, gonna check it out. And prepping for online like EDL's and XML's / OMF's prob also easy?
Lol Sort of a "no good deed goes unpunished situation" for that Reaper dev. Agreed on staying platform agnostic: Whatever the best tool for the job is, that's the way to go.
Adobe currently dominates the market for collaborative editing teams, and I believe it will take a long time for the post-production industry to transition to a different platform.  
  
Many video editor job postings I see are for social content, which  it seems like they could shift away from Premiere sooner. However, the social editing teams likely stick with Adobe due to the dynamic link with After Effects
Yeah I figured I’d need to get that or SpectraLayers… It’s just really impressive what comes stock in Audition though.
I hate admitting this but I've done that too. Literally wept. It makes finishing projects NEVER feel like an accomplishment.
Well kudos for at least doing all the right troubleshooting steps! That makes me wonder how unoptimized Premiere still is for Windows. Clearly it's more difficult to optimize for Windows because of the all differences in hardware and software, but I suppose the hardware/software parity on Mac gives it a big advantage in terms of performance.  
  
On a side note, how long have you been rocking Resolve?
Ah so you woke up and decided "I wish to be an asshole to strangers on the internet today"
fastest report to reddit I have done in a while. lets keep it civil. you have an experience and want to be heard. the least one can do in that situation is to hear others;

I love my experience with Adobe. it has made my editing 1000x better.
been diying all my own content including original background music before ai came around, feels like a bit of a smack in the face but at least I know my shit has much more of a human aspect than current ai could create
This is the case I think
Yep.
Yep. I naively went to adobe max a few years ago and they kept revealing all these AI tools only for the audience to react with huge applause. I was looking around thinking someone in the crowd would be horrified knowing our very jobs were at risk, but nope.
Where is CC $29 a month?! 
Our suite is like $100/user
AI bros will throw money at stupid stuff so maybe it's worked out for them.
exactly, especially with heavily compressed .mp4's
But davinci can handle all that, which makes it better
Oh you youngsters don’t know the struggle of editing with premiere back in the 2000’s, even before iPhone or 4K footage was a thing, and getting “unknown exception has occurred” crashes for no good reason, and losing all your work, repeatedly.
So you're blaming the problems that cause Adobe crash on third party applications?! Lol

Basically what you're saying is in order to have a good experience with Adobe, you must use a dedicated "clean" system that only runs Adobe software on it and nothing else.
Yes. It's also just one tool. It is a great deal, but when you compare it to other software, like Cinema 4D, it's really not too bad.
Blackmagic is a hardware company.
No I'm sorry for the confusion -- I was doing it in Premiere years ago. Just was pointing out what it used to be able to handle. Have no experience with VR in Resolve.
FCP7 was goated!
ain’t that the truth. i use it when i need to throw something together quickly but yeah it’s a shame the professional world sticks with adobe and avid
the Sonos debacle... Now THAT is fucked up.
I often think these kind of posts are astroturfing guerilla PR stuff by BMD. Its what I'd do anyway.
True. Okay, yes -- Blackrock is much worse than Adobe. I guess I really have to spell things out...
I mean... This sub is called "editing". And by all means -- keep pretending to not understand that statements like that are pure emotion and not literal. Oh yes...I definitely think Adobe is worse than Raytheon.
Nuance Communications got bought by Microsoft
You’re fun at parties
You would think a hundred bad decisions had already been made in front of them leading to constant stress and overwork...
Yes. We have found a workflow that's perfect for long interviews. Create static transcripts within your multicam sequences. Edit with them on your sequence -> success, you have a dynamic transcript on your sequence.

Trust? Well, you still have ears and your normal tools to fine edit. For a raw edit it works perfectly.
It’s not about that. I got the money of course. It’s about continuously paying money for something that should be a one-time purchase.
I'm sure there are many people who don't experience issues. I'm not discounting that and was just agreeing with you. I really don't feel like listing ways Premiere has glitched out because it's been my whole life as of recent. Do a search. You'll be able to do lots of research.
It was more a cathartic exercise for me because Adobe managed to mess up something even after quitting all their software. That's all.
>but no overall the number of houses currently using avid or premiere still vastly outweighs it

Agree, this isn't a very substantial idea to arrive at though, that's like, bleedingly obvious.

> At the studio level nobody even wants to touch it.

Are you in contact with all the studios everywhere to confirm this exactly? This is kind of bubble/regional-speak and while I appreciate you're in a big production hub where Avid and Premiere are used almost exclusively, and I do agree to agree in the obvious sense, I still see resolve being a factor in the future.

Ive had many more horrendous turnovers in Premiere than I have Resolve. Let me preface all of this by saying there are things that really irk me about all big-3 NLE's, Im not fan-boying anything here and purely commenting off of experience.
Bob, I'm old enough to have seen your get off my lawn nonsense on creative cow for 20+ years. Give it a rest. 

"Who cares what you like"? 

Obviously this guy does, and I do too. 

Did you learn every software in the industry? No of course not. You picked which ones you LIKED. Getting all high and mighty over product choice and valid complaints?

If I recall you're in the business of setting up people with the tools to do the work, do you not have preferences on networking products? 

No, that would be INSANE to have a preference like using qnap nas. And which cards do you recommend? 

Obviously not one that you're comfortable with that has reliability! That would be beyond the pale!

We used to get physical disks to install MC, fcp, and after effects.  You really think this new nonsense about constant updates breaking everything is just the way it always was? 

I'm pretty sure avid and apple used to actually troubleshoot their software before going gold and selling piles of physical media. 

Someone getting fed up with a company that has more staff working on stock buybacks than for product development on something like ae is nothing to bark at. 

Cloud services charging us monthly forever, holding our work hostage, and I still can't type out text in after effects without it missing some keystrokes. Since ae 5.5.

But hey at least I can use trash ai generator in Photoshop.

Having watched you all over the net for decades tear into anyone with an opinion is just ridiculous. You think you're the only one who "knows how shit works".  

Its actually wild to see you still online, jumping down people's throats after all this time.

grow up already.
Also -- why would I be on Blackmagic forums trying to convince Resolve users to switch to Resolve? You're a dolt, sir.
Hahahaha wow dude.
I'm going to say "yes" because it will annoy you and -- as your not-so-veiled insult revealed -- you are one of the smug ones.
I'm going to say "yes" because it will annoy you and -- as your not-so-veiled insult revealed -- you are one of the smug ones.
💯
You also hit on something I rediscovered with Resolve -- having FUN editing again. Glad you are too!
Only a month. 😂 It got real bad with Premiere.
How so??? You just made a blanket statement about software you clearly don't know much about. It's used professionally everywhere. I didn't say you shouldn't use Premiere. I'm talking about my own frustrations.
I literally thought you were a bot. Still kind of do.
That's why it will ultimately fail. AI is just the corporate mindset perfected into an algorithm of s***.
same here, at this rate i might just pick up coding and diy my own editor
Same business model as canva. they removed the complexity and learning curve of AI/PS and dumbed it down into a web app that any small business owner or marketing dept can use to make content instantly. No more hiring graphic designers or video editors for hundreds of dollars a day/hour, or dealing with agencies, hiring a creative director, etc. Just drag and drop your logo, a picture, snap the text, and post it on instagram

media industry is cooked✌🏼 highly recommend you get into prestige narrative/arthouse stuff or go find a local government job. those are the only two places that AI and tech companies wont touch, because theyre philosophically incompatible
I fully agree. These days I use the full Adobe suite 2024 running on a 2022 Mac Studio for 8-10 hours a day 5-6 days a week, but I've been using it in general since about 2005. I get a crash maybe every couple months and I never lose more than 10 minutes of work because of auto-save. Anytime I've ever worked with another editor who complains about crashes they are loaded with malware or have a ton of 3rd party plugins installed. It's almost always the plugins that Adobe has nothing to do with then people complain that Adobe sucks. They definitely have their faults but stability isn't one of them.
This. I throw everything at Davinci and it never has an issue. I hate the idea of crashes and jumping through hoops when DR just removes that.
I do, that's why we all used FCP or Avid. It was only "Premiere" back then too
I was doing this, by the way. 😂 That's the sad part. I was reduced to that incredibly inconvenient requirement.

Edit: It was BorisFX by the way. Just heading off the people that will think I'm downloading plugins off Kazaa.
So bonus points?
...and?
Just for the UI silver color alone
I guess people wanna pretend they don’t understand hyperbole so they can feel superior/more intelligent on the internet
That's what they tell me.
I agree and think it's a very slippery modern technique to sneakily grab cash off people. Everything is subscription. It's a bigger debate why this has happened. Apple for example are making money from hardware, so FCP can be a one off price. But Apple hardware is often purchased through loans (not many people buy iphones outright). Adobe doesn't have that as its pure software. 

It's basically tool hire. A carpenter can also hire tools and on shoots we hire lenses and camera. 

It also let's semi pros try the game without paying eg £999 up front (FCP 7 cost). The reason Resolve is "free" is they are trying to undercut the competition (and its sort of working). Capcut used to be free but now they stripped nearly ALL the features out of the free version and you must pay £9.99 pm
Nahh. It’s only interesting when someone is on here complaining.
If it’s ’bleedingly obvious’ why are you debating me when that’s the primary point I was making in my initial comment? It’s not a competition, and they aren’t making serious moves into the professional space which is currently dominated by premiere and avid. And fwiw I actually do know either post sups or editors/AEs at all the major studios in LA, so, yes, I can confirm none of them are using or interested in transitioning to davinci. Frankly even going from avid to premiere is an uphill climb most of these places, WB animation only recently doubled down on Adobe.
Adds a lot of credibility to your op, really... Good for you mate *pat on back*
wife often blames me to be a bot. but mostly in bed.
More like AI is setting the standard for mediocre. Much like comparing a factory made food in the supermarket to a 3 star Michelin chef's dish.
I wouldn't necessarily say so. It has its use cases but I don't think it's very good or at least as workable as Illustrator. But for pumping out invites for the company Christmas dinner? Yeah it should be free and take 30 seconds to make.
Then you know Premiere was unstable even in normal workflows...?

It only improved within the last few years, I think when Apple Silicon forced them to rework core components.
Even so I doubt it helped with the frequent crashes. Back in the day my company had dedicated editing workstations that weren't even allowed to connect to the internet but still behaved poorly
Software sales is not Blackmagic's business model so comparing pricing models between the software that Blackmagic basically gives away for free to sell hardware to other software that has to be sold as a revenue stream to keep the business running is not an apples to apples comparison.

I pay about $600/year to Adobe to have access to 4 core tools that I use to make money. I have a lot of complaints about Adobe,  but their current pricing model isn't one of them.
Fair enough
I'm trying to have a *healthy* debate with you mainly because you said this

>if you want to work at a professional level I don't see it ever competing.

Lets define "professional level", in my world, if you pay taxes on your work, boom, you're professional.

Are you loosley insinuating that anything that isnt coming out of LA or isn't theatrical / commercial work with big brand clients / studios isn't professional? Because that's just wild.
That didn't even make sense 😂 Why am I conversing with a bot? Premiere has wasted enough of my time.
All the better for the great editors to stand out and charge a premium price for a premium product.
Of course not, but You keep questioning my credentials, so I keep reiterating I’m a studio editor, so that’s the experience I’m speaking to. As I am not an omniscient all-seeing superbeing capable of having presence at every table with a computer within the known & unknown universe (happy?), I can only speak to what me and my colleagues are seeing in post houses, networking events and post conventions within my immediate area which fwiw happens to be the post production capitol of the world. And my argument is when it comes broadcast, theatrical & commercial industries, yes I don’t see it ever being a dominant player in this space. There’s plenty of ways, locations and fields to make a living as an editor and be a working professional, I certainly have, and I think davinci is fine for freelance and short for work despite again still not being a relevant majority in this field either. But it’s simply not designed for long form projects, and their company is not making serious moves in these spaces to be otherwise. I’m going back to work now
I mean...the people/corpo that support AI art are the same people who don't want to pay creative for what they worth or lowball them.
I'm not questioning your credentials at all Andy, I've checked your website out. Nice work. Im taking you to task about claiming you cant work in resolve at a professional level, because its just not true. 

I don't see this continuing on in a positive fashion as you're downvoting every one of my replies and it seems to be getting a little emotional. Take it easy!
You keep asking who I know/how I know, and I told you. I have never said you "can't" work in resolve at a professional level., I'm saying the industry at large isn't going there and nothing I've seen is proving me otherwise, including all of your comments - none of which speak to an experience outside your own either fwiw?

Go with god, work in whatever you want! Like I said 12 comments ago you should know all three. But if you want the big-jobs, it's premiere/avid full-stop. Prove me wrong, kids. I only downvoted your initial comment I didnt touch anything else, but it looks like some of mine were downvoted to? I frankly don't care. Get back to work!
Are you editing your comments because you want to continue on the conversation, or?
Switching from Adobe Premiere pro to DaVinci made me realise how bad Adobe products are.
Adobe used to be good but let's be honest they haven't done anything good since 2010 to improve. Their software must be built on spaghetti code by now it's quite embarrassing how bad and overly complicated it is.

DaVinci for me is more smooth user experience and faster software. With Adobe I thought maybe I have to upgrade my PC (RTX 3080) because it would be laggy and buggy. All these problems are gone with DaVinci. 

Wish they also made Photoshop and LR Alternatives - would switch in a heartbeat.
I mean... okay. I like Resolve too, but there's still no alternative to After Effects. And dynamic link + copying and pasting clips between Premiere and AE is a pretty neat trick. 

Right tool for the right job.
For me, I use a lot of masking tools. And da Vinci resolve does not allow me to quickly copy and paste those in the same way premier pro does, which makes editing YouTube content a lot easier on premier Pro.
Wait.  2010?  I understand this post is primarily hyperbole, but maybe shoot for 2020 as a comparison or something to be have your opinion taken seriously.

Both tools have advantages.  Utilize them to the max.  To have strict loyalty to one over the other is a poor professional decision.
I rather like Premier Pro, though.
Watch out, the Adobe defenders will come for you. In all seriousness, it's good to have experience with both. For my full time job, I have to use the Adobe Suite but for Freelance and personal projects, DaVinci all the way. I prefer DaVinci simply because I actually own my software and everything I need is under one roof. If you are looking for alternatives to Photoshop and Lightroom, Affinity Photo is essentially a stripped down photoshop and it's a one time fee for the version. Darktable is a Lightroom alternative that I really haven't played much with but it's free. Have fun with DaVinci!
Do you even edit with proxies tho?
What about for all you after effects stuff? I don’t have a single project I don’t use both?
I just like how modular premiere windows are. I always keep moving them for different purposes.
Can we stop with these posts? There is zero value in them.
I think it’s more that hobbyists find DaVinci a better fit for their needs whereas professionals who are used to the post-prod process get better use out of Premiere as a whole, even with all the hiccups you have to deal with. There is no such thing as a perfect fit for every single person and even more so today with casual users dipping into editing as ~creators~ who have a whole different world of demands from their editing software.
But photoshop audition after effects is more better from dr fairlight or fusion difficult win adobe ecosystem is huge
Premiere editor here who recently picked up editing on Resolve - I use either depending on the workflow. If the spot starts and finishes with me and has a fast turnaround (like YouTube/Social, etc) I’m in Resolve. If I’m working on a spot with a wider team, more media, and a longer post timeline, Premiere and After Effects. Since every workflow is different, it all depends on what the project needs :)
U know what? i use both of them and many others. Each software for where it shine.
Well I still prefer to use premiere because of dynamic link
I do not do Video editing, but have been using Adobe products for 20 years and it been a pleasure to use Figma for a couple of years now, going back to PS, Il, seem like going back to an old application that I do not want to use anymore.
I wish I could get off Adobe forever but the way I edit is so well fitted to how premiere and after effects work that I can never leave. Almost every project I get involves both and I can’t imagine giving up dynamic link. 

Maybe if I were to give up editing/animation as a career I could be free, but until then I’m Adobe’s prisoner.
Same boat as you. Davinci is way ahead
There are a few things keeping me from switching but by far the biggest factor is dynamic link. As someone who works with motion graphics a lot or in general just has a lot of reasons to pop open After Effects and sometimes Photoshop and Audition for something quick it's invaluable and saves insane amounts of time. I do color in Davinci and I hate needing to switch back and forth for that but it's necessary for me to be productive long term.

It's unfortunate but they just have that monopoly in offering a one stop shop for everything and everything being integrated into each other. It runs like shit and dynamic link is everything but perfect but it's better than the alternative.
Da Vinci learned me how bad their built in H264/5 encoders are compared to ffmpeg, main concept or codecs implemented in hardware encoding boxes.

General da vinci users thinking on this issue is - "its made for pro users, they do not render to H264 so quality is irrelevant, render to DNxHR"

Using external encoder is one more step you need to do.
I teach editing at a university and recommend to all my students to use Da Vinci, the free version is amazing for students. Adobe’s bullshit punitive measures when you try to cancel a membership is enough to never recommend to my cash strapped students to use it. 
Clambering for the day something feature-rich and as easy to use as after effects, but not slow as fuck, eventually comes out
Hate me for it but I switched to fcpx and never looked at premier pro lol I may get roasted but idc it’s easier workflow for me since i have an apple eco system and plus the one time payment va the monthly shit is a big factor also. yet all the employers insist that you know premier pro lol
I switched to Resolve because I don’t like Adobe’s subscription model, but Premiere has improved the last few years. It was a lot more stable toward the end of my using it.
LR Alternative ? Capture One Pro. Hands down. Same feeling from PR to DR. Adobe is in the past.
There is a free, open-source Photoshop alternative called Gimp.
It's interesting since DaVinci itself is based on old software as well, and they also stuck two other code bases into is (Fusion and Fairlight) which created some weird things like different shortcuts between the color and fusion pages or features that get introduced in the color page and aren't available in Fusion even though you want them there as well. 

This isn't just about complexity and age of the software. It might be more about the goals of each company. BlackMagic is just a much more customer first company while Adobe is a shareholders first company.
Still haven’t seen a professional job that required Davinci though. Everything is still mostly Avid with premiere being second.
I am currently in a state where I think all NLEs suck. Bigtime.

Premiere is schizophrenic and lags and has trivial issues.

Resolve doesn’t do all the stuff Premiere and MediaComposer do.

MediaComposer is buggy and less flexible. Editing a big TV show in anything else is suicide. Editing socials in MC is hell.

For instance synchronizing footage is a pain in Premiere or Resolve. MC is perfect for this. And no, I don’t wanna buy another software for this (Pluraleyes).

I need After Effects anyways, Media Encoder helps a lot too. Thus I have to pay for the whole CC suite.

Fusion (or Motion) have only a small amount of the features AE has… I could replace Photoshop with Afinity, but again - I have to pay for the CC suite already…

I am so tired of this, I might stop editing at all…1/4 of the time is troubleshooting why something doesn’t work. Sure, in a big post house you have people for that. I am not a big post house.
👍 cool story bro
What sort of work do you do primarily? Been thinking about making the switch for my next feature cause I’m getting a little tired of all of Adobe’s quirks…
I want for davanci to soar— so, so badly. Premiere really is a joke in 2024 built on early 2000’s code that legit bottlenecks the entire software. 

Sadly there’s still no good full replacement for after effects, much less Premiere. Especially 2D animation/mograph. Some small projects are lifting off the ground, but i’ll be the first one to fully jump ship when some other app gets 85% of AE/Premiere’s capability.
I’m glad you like Davinci! I tried it, genuinely, but after a year of use I still just didn’t like it as much as premiere. So now I sail the high seas and use premiere again lol
Affinity Photo and Capture one are some Photoshop and LR alternatives that work well.
Recently ( just 2hrs before ) Adobe released their video generative ai for premier pro, just like for Photoshop. Damn it's good, but after a while I think it can get better. It also has Sora integrated into it . 

I think Adobe has got the monopoly with content creation using AI
Is there a pros and cons list of both softwares that someone has posted here? Just would be interesting to see as someone who only does very basic editing and has no in-depth knowledge on the software.
I tried resolve this week and was also impressed, really thinkink about switching.
I tend to jump back and forth between the programs. Adobe Premiere is good if you can wield all the interconnected softwares (AI, AE, PSD...) and workaround the cons (some effects are absolute bonkers once you apply , nest on nest on est). Davinci I specifically use for tracking and painting / anything that needs to stick on moving motion - my launch missile option if AE fails to track lol. Proxy and master media processing really great on Davinci as well. If you can wield both Adobe and Davinci softwares, you walking on water
>Wish they also made Photoshop and LR Alternatives - would switch in a heartbeat.

I hope they don't do that. Part of the reason Adobe is so screwed up is the mentality that you need keep adding features , adding new products .... nah son , just make what you have work flawlessly

They should, literally, create a new version of Premiere from scratch, and let users use the old versions. The main problem with Premiere and After Effects is that a lot of plugins and workflows are just not compatible with other software.
I use after effects a lot because it’s amazing for specific use cases. as for completing and arranging big projects Adobe is a steaming pile of goat stuff
Agreed - the playback difference is unreal! I also love the ease with color correction.

I almost feel bad for whoever's working on Premiere - it's essentially Howl's Moving Castle.
So, how long it will take you for avid?
I also switched back then, ended up using both but client projects always lean towards premiere, ae etc.
The workflow is just superior when it comes to that. I feel like people who can fully enjoy davinci are people working on cinematic stuff like feature films etc.
I have switched to Luminar Neo from Lightroom! It's so much better!
I love all Adobe softwares.
This thread: My shit NLE is better than your shit NLE.
I mean yeah resolve is amazing but I'm curious what workflows in AE requires a beefy GPU for you. Im pretty sure only some handful of plug ins and effects use the GPU and most every task is delegated to the CPU. Maybe that's the issue. Resolve uses the GPU for most of its tasks. Apples and oranges. Personally I like to use whatever tool is right for the job.
Ive heard the reason the programs are so large is that they don’t redo code, they just keep stacking it and leaving last years. Something like that 😄
Damn, I mean, premiere is definitely a poorly optimized piece of software, but was it really that buggy and laggy for you? I’ve managed to run it pretty well on 2019 iMacs.
In 2024 you can’t install adobe programs in any folder/partition other than the system one. A problem known from like 2010. This says it all. I had to pay ease us to merge my partitions cause of adobe.
I’d switch in a heartbeat if Davinci would add “move playhead to cursor” without me having to write code to make it happen
I think their AI integration in Photoshop is pretty amazing
I was working on a feature in Avid off an external HDD without issue, but I couldn't cut a short in Premiere off an internal NVMe SSD without incredible lag or crashes.

And yes, I "cleared my Media Cache."
Agreed
Resolve is shit, but Adobe is far worse these days

I’m starting a job on Premiere today and dreading it so much!! I’ve been trying to figure out if I can just work in DaVinci and then use export my final sequence back to the premiere project for the other editor to finish it there?? It’s a multicam shoot with lots of media, so I’m not sure if it could work that easy?? But either way, I agree OP
[deleted]
Kind of agree RE dynamic link but it’s also an absolute mess management wise. Adobe doesn’t want to help the user in that department, which is what devalues the company the most imo. If they helped with the cumbersome task of daily management just a little, I might take them more seriously. Right now they just want splashy marketing BS improvements that mean little to nothing.
Dynamic link is so finicky that it's just as easy for me to export from Resolve and back than it was to do it through Adobe products specifically
Is this true? I was talking to an old client and they said they’ve switched to davinci. I said I’d miss the dynamic link and after effects, and he said there’s no need because davinci can do more or less everything you’d need in after effects. Although I guess it depends on what you use after effects for.
Have you tried Fusion?
Dynamic link is a gimmick for solo freelancers who need to do a shot or two here and there. If you're doing VFX or mograph work at scale, it's woeful.
Have you tried doing it through the Fusion panel, theres a lot of masking tools and every bode is easily replicable.
It’s ridiculous there’s no quick garbage mask tool or something like that in resolve.
It's a pretty huge piece of software.  I imagine if you had access to a git diff of Premiere, most of the code from 2010 is still there, pretty much unchanged.  Stuff has been added.  Bugs have been fixed.  Dependencies have been updated.  But I really can't imagine they went in and rewrote vast swathes of it under the hood since 2010.

I'd genuinely be surprised if that's hyperbole at all.  OTOH, the same is true of Resolve.  The underlying Resolve/Fusion/Fairlight code won't have changed that much either.  If you had a cryogenically frozen Digital Fusion developer from 1997, you could probably unthaw them today and start assigning them bugs to fix without too much trouble.
I actually think 2010 is right on the mark. Premiere CS5 (2010) was the last groundbreaking release from Adobe IMO. Since then the improvements have been a lot less substantial.
Ok 2010, or 2020... I threw a random year, but what new things did they actually do or UI improvements did they add since then, with all that Adobe money?

They boast:
GPU acceleration, seems like deaccelaration to me tbh.
Enhanced colour correction (lol...)
Improved audio edition (double lol)
Support for new formats...
Ok they added text to speech! Wow! Mobile apps have that.
But it's basically exactly the same clunk as it was in CS5 times, just use all the plug-in other people make to make it workable.
Yeah Resolve is very powerful for certain things but every time I try to edit in it, it just feels so much more clunky. I don’t know what it is but I just don’t like the “feeling” of editing in Resolve as much. I probably just need to get used to it but I can move so much quicker in Premiere.
> Affinity Photo is essentially a stripped down photoshop

True. But now it’s owned by Canva. And I think it’s uncertain if it will sustain development investment or if it will plateau and stagnate. 


I’m rooting for it, but mergers and acquisitions usually aren’t great for the software that got bought. 
Affinity is rad but I'm finding the AI stuff in Photoshop really cool for fixing stuff in real estate photo work. And Lightroom is good. At least the Photoshop/Lightroom tier subscription is reasonably priced so I can get rid of the full suite sub.
Only with 4k and up clips
Typically, I’d kill anything like this fairly early. NAB has me looking at /r/editors less than normal. So, stuff is more likely to get through. Once something has quite a bit of traction it’s generally easier to leave live.  Know that if two people flag a post it gets pulled until a Mod can see it.
This is an editors sub and OP is discussing the software choices for editing…this seems like exactly the type of post that should be here.
Sorry for your time loss
Also-- pros generally don't decide the software and post supes are (rightly) very conservative
Pre-2011 everyone said this about Premiere lol
I have the same experience using figma and came back to photoshop
I don’t use premiere because I like it. I use it because it’s expected of me by producers.
I agree with you on a philosophical level (and I love Resolve too), but Premiere is a lot more widely used than Resolve. Is it really the best advice to give students to recommend they avoid the most widely used editing software? They’re more employable by learning both (along with Avid).
Fellow editing teacher here. I personally prefer teaching Premiere at the intro level because of how easy project file management is, and how consistent the interface is. That being said, you’re not wrong about the yearly-subscription-paid-monthly model: it’s confusing for first-time users, and there should be a way for school/enterprise plans to grant offsite licenses to students so they don’t have to get their own at home (or maybe that’s just an issue with my school?).

As to Resolve, I like it a lot, but the free version doesn’t support the codec used by our cameras (without transcoding), and Fusion is harder to both use and teach IMO than After Effects. I still tell students to use it if they want a free editing program at home, though.

I know you said you don't want to pay for another program for syncing but I just wanna throw it out there that Syncaila is awesome for syncing. It's as fast as it takes for it to read the files- the time it spends syncing is not even noticeable, and the only mistakes I've seen it make are when I was trying to use it to organize and sync extremely vague waveforms over 12 hours of footage with unhelpful metadata. It's a one time payment and has a free trial.
Thanks bro 👍
I had been using Resolve as my long form NLE and then Ae for all of my Motion/ text stuff. Recently I didn't have access to Ae do to work and was forced to learn to do everything I was doing with Ae in Resolve Fusion and I could replicate a lot in Fusion.
Been using Darktable a free alternative to LR. It’s really good
What about Resolve is so shit? Have you checked out the latest release? It’s still in beta but it’s pretty damn impressive, IMO.
XMLs will get you in and out
RTX 3080 I think that's 12GB of VRAM and I have 16gb of RAM. 

I work with the latest studio drivers too. I have the same problem with Lightroom crashing constantly.
Basically my pc can run everything else, including new games at high 4k settings, but Adobe programs are choking every time.

I really don't get it.
I mean, productions, text editing, auto transcripts, enhance audio... these aren't nothing. 

Do I wish they'd double down on the basics, work more on stability and system efficiency? 100%. But there have been plenty of nifty features they've added over the past handful of years I use every day. 

And I worry a bit about being seen as some type of Adobe fanboy. I'm realllyyy not. They have PLENTY of issues and things I wish they'd do better on. I just like a world where Adobe and Resolve both exist. Options are good. Competition is good.
Ain’t nothing wrong with that workflow either.
Hard agree.
You can still use After Effects, it has no bearing on which NLE you use. Just import your AE exports to Resolve, no big deal and no need to use Fusion. The 3.2 seconds you save by using dynamic link is _nothing_ compared to the time you save doing edit/colour/sound in Resolve.
You can do a lot with Fusion, but it’s just not set up for 2D mograph work, especially when you are working with an art director in illustrator or wherever. Fusion is a compositor at heart. 

If you are just doing lower thirds and an end card, sure, you may get away with it. But the minute you need to do a complex rig, it gets pretty difficult.
Yep. Love Fusion... for compositing. 

But art directors and designers work in paths and they work in layers, not nodes. It's just not designed for 2D mograph work. Can you do a lot with it? Absolutely. But I don't know any dedicated mograph artists who will choose Fusion over AE. 

The combo of illustrator, AE and Premiere is pretty damn powerful.
Copying clips from Premiere and pasting them into a comp in AE with the timecode intact and all laid out is pretty great. Doesn't seem like a gimmick at all.
I haven’t, no. Granted, I tried resolve a while ago, and after a weekish I went back to Premier Pro. So it’s possible at the time there weren’t any YouTube tutorials showing the tools I needed, or an update for that wasn’t out at the moment. Or, could’ve been that my googling skills weren’t up to speed.

Either way, that’s what kept me away from in the past, and now I use Lightroom and Photoshop so often as well it just makes sense to stay in the ecosystem. Thanks for the comment!
There is if you do it in the color page (with alpha outputs). It's stupid to tab over to a different page to do it, but it works. But yeah agree Adobe masking in the edit pages is miles better.
Pro compositor or no compositor is Resolve's motto.
There literally is though. Colour tab. You don't have to use the software but don't throw shade at it because you didn't learn how to use it properly. It's significantly more powerful than Premiere at almost every editing task, but you do need to invest some time to learn how it works, which in some cases is a little different to Premiere. They all have quirks, but when you've used a program for many years, those quirks start to feel "normal" to us, and we forget that we have in fact just adapted to one particular software's way of doing things.
They did a UI change a few years back, which didn't really change much except for a more "streamlined" workflow. Wouldn't say it was groundbreaking, but that's the last time they actually changed things in a significant way iirc.

Aside from that I fully agree with you.
Yes, still the same 'buggy' copy paste behaviour since 2010... that we had in FCP7 before.
Have you used their new transcription plugin?

It's fucking incredible.
Same, I'm not going to speculate what will happen. I'm gonna use it until they give me a reason not to
If you resubscribe during their Black Friday sale window, the entire suite is cheaper than Premiere + After Effects.
There was a time when even television shows shot at 1080 and up were "proxied" and cut at 720. 

Workflows matter more than tools.
It's a topic that's been done to death. It's practically a weekly post at this point. Does this post bring anything new to the table that any of the others didn't?

At the end of the day, both NLEs have their strengths and weaknesses. Use the best tool for the job at hand.
It's not discussing the software choices - it's a rant with no substance. All noise, no signal. Which isn't useful in a sub for professional editors.
I remember! I was firmly a FCP7 head
This.
I went to school on FCP and within a year of graduating FCX launched. I went on to spend over 10 years in video. Going through that rug pull taught me that learning new software is part of the job. The more time school can spend on what end viewers see, the better. What sets good editors apart isn’t the tools they use, but the results they deliver. I think your point about Premiere making students more employable is valid, but I’m also against schools focusing on the tools too much. It made more sense when tools were more difficult to use, but today they’re super easy*. (Avid is still Avid.) So I’m a bit conflicted, but I think this adds to the conversation.
We teach premiere at our uni, but it’s looking like we’ll swap over to Da Vinci, the issue is access, it’s so expensive the students can’t get Premiere outside of class. Cost of living crisis is bad, but it’s even worse for students. Re: codec. We’ve had that issue too with the free version, but Handbrake is also free, and if you’re a student with no OEM version available on Premiere, DaVinci / handbrake is really the only choice.
But here is the issue - all NLEs have a sort of automatic synching. In Premiere you can select the clips that are supposed to be synched and it'll do it without problems.

I just wanna select 3 bins (2 cameras, 1 audio) and let it do it's thing. I know it can do it, because if I select the approriate clips in one slate, it will do it. But Adobe says noooooooooooooooooo, god forbid I select a few bins and it'll do by itself.

At Adobe they do not care about the users, they do not even care about features. We are getteing "generative fill", but the basic stuff does not work!
I want to love fusion! Can’t imagine the team has the resources to build it out to eventually compete 1:1 with AE but I can dream
basic functions are broken for several versions, some for more than a decade. Basics, that Avid and premiere did get right back in the 90s (like source patching, growing files, clip switching, syncing, merge clips, etc...). I assume the people who downvote me didn't use Resolve in a professional environment yet where new features a nice but a working and reliable software is much much more important and I've had instances where Resolve failed us greatly requiring us to resort to porting an ongoing project to another NLE. 
Other professionals agree, it's always the beginners who are flashed by Resolve's feature set, but in the end none of that counts if you can't work with it reliably.
16GB of RAM is the problem imo
Your CPU might be the bottleneck, Light room and most Adobe products are more CPU heavy than GPU, GPU is only worth investing in if you do 3D work. Video Editing and photography is not the same as playing a game at high in 4K, like all our workstations use Quadro M2000 with 3gb vram, 32GB ram but we use high end intel Xeon processors (film & TV).
Yeah as someone who just switched from Adobe to DaVinci I really miss the Capture Noise Print on Adobe Audition. Literally the only reason I used that program.
I think text/transcribing is good addition but the implementation of it is complete trash and almost makes it unusable in my experience.  Productions is fine.  Outside of that, I feel like things have either been flashy marketing garbage while the core functionality of the program has regressed.  I am glad some have had a brighter outlook but I'm honestly just happy if its a stable release, which never really happens until just before the next major release.  



Adobe is such a mid company otherwise.  BUT, its a million times better then MC!!
True. But to update ae projects and have it automatically update in premiere is super sweet. But I guess not a huge deal. I don’t even use after effects super heavy anyway so I should just move to resolve. I still hate that I can’t seem to have multi screen and a modular workspace like in premiere tho?
I have discovered this in the past few days. Fusion is REALLY not designed for doing motion graphics particularly anything related to text layout.
Agree copy paste is more useful; I was talking particularly about dynamic link, which creates a data management nightmare for data flow, shot versioning etc
I do recommend giving it a play if you get time (you can do a lot of trial and error in the free version), to be honest finding the right tutorials to replicate what you want is super difficult, I built out a 12min long text animated video (with callouts, video masking, highlighting) and almost every step of the way had to figure out how to do things myself. It only took a few weeks and I can do a lot of what I was doing in Ae in Fusion.

Though if you are enjoying the Adobe ecosystem have a look at incorporating Ae and dynamic linking give yourself a few more tools to build out quick and complex masks.
This is totally it. The masking in the color page is actually super easy to work with as soon as you figure out where it’s hiding lol.
The only change was instead of having an export popup you just get an export tab with identical UI
The 2022 GUI changes pissed a lot of long time Premiere editors off & now you'll find a lot less goodwill coming from the people who've paid Adobe monthly since 2014 since since they feel not listened to & unappreciated.

The people who make decisions for Premiere's product should give high priority to long time user feedback, rather than polling & catering social media editors who've taught themselves Premiere over the last couple of years & don't even know the breadth of the tools in Premiere(at least that is what it appears they've been doing)

I agree CS 5 was the last big change, but going to 64bit & standard GPU acceleration to enable real-time editing with HD & AVC codecs natively was all of the industry's last big change.  No, they haven't justified monthly payments for an evolving app after that. Change has been very incremental and changes often adding no net gain, sometimes upgrading modules with inferior replacements.  Even going back to CS6, removing the playback shuttle tool was a bad idea, especially coupled with the option of choosing your transport tools added at the same time. You can't let the editor make the choice of what to devote the minuscule bit of gui real estate to? "No. We're Adobe. We've made the choice. We're moving forward. Next Question!"

Then like PP22's redesign, changes over later releases really just affected the default steps they built into starting and exporting projects, were just a pia to editors who already had a good workflow or knew what they were doing.

Bad habit of shitting up the software trying to make it stupid-proof goes way way back. Replacing Audition with Soundbooth in pre-creative cloud Adobe Production Packages was emblematic.

  
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

  
So my opinion definitely doesn't match much r/premiere or r/premierepro attitudes, but is likely more relatable to r/editors , in that it's exactly because Premiere is reliable & quick that I find it indispensable right now. If Resolve ever gets me to the same productivity I have no issues dropping Adobe.
For sure. I do kinda suspect that development will squash bugs, make the software *very* stable - and then set it on autopilot.  


  
All while we start to see the same features begin to bubble up in Canva.   


As much as I would like Canva to keep developing Affinity as a "Pro" line for Canva....I'm too cynical at this point. I'd be pretty surprised to see that kind of good software stewardship.  


But yeah. Legit Adobe alternative (mostly). I'd hate to see it stagnate. Adobe needs competition.
Cool. I canceled and they gave me a good deal for another year!
If only they had Davinci
[removed]
I never changed my mind about Premiere being the worst. I was trying to point out the parallels between what you’re saying now and that’s exactly what everyone use to say about FCP7 compared to Premiere. If you used Premiere, you weren’t “professional.” Premiere didn’t suddenly improve overnight, Apple just misstepped so hard that everyone fled to it and it turns out it was “Post production ready” the whole time.

People like to use “not ready for prime time” as a way to describe various NLEs and I’ve never understood why. Resolve has a lot of newer features, but it is a 30 year old piece of software that proved its capabilities a long time ago. People seem to think of THEIR tool to be the one that professionals use. FCPX, Resolve, Premiere, and Avid are all great and viable tools. Using one or the other doesn’t make someone less of a professional.
This is what they said about Avid ten years ago. 
I guess I’d argue that having proper training on all 3 (even if students are eventually allowed to pick their favourite) is better than learning just one and then having to self-learn another NLE to actually land a job.

Also, it’s definitely easier to learn a third NLE than it is to learn a second one, if that makes sense. When learning a second you’re constantly up against questions of “how do I make it be like the thing I’m used to?” whereas by the time you’re learning a *third* NLE you can understand all of them much better because you appreciate how and why software might behave differently.

I do also totally take your point that learning the ‘art of editing’ is more valuable than just becoming competent with software. I guess the question comes down to how you view education: some people want something vocational that is more directly applicable to their entry into the world of work whereas others value a more intellectual/theoretical education.
That's pretty cool of media composer to do that straight from the bins actually, but it's not just syncing camera angles, it's also putting tons of footage in chronological order of when it was shot over the course of hours, which is what I usually use it for. Though it does involve a little more work than 2 clicks lol
It’s true that I’ve not used it in a professional setting yet, however all the features you’re mentioning *do* work now.  
Personally I think Avid is still the only sensible choice for most professional projects, but DaVinci _does_ seem to be the best next choice (over Premiere). I’m just starting a professional Premiere project this week and it’s quite frustrating to use. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Probably you're right.  I thought so too that 16gb is on a low side... I will upgrade soon.

But my point is why is it not a problem for DaVinci then...
I have intel i7 12th gen 2.1ghz
Out of curiosity, what makes the text/transcribing almost unusable in your case?
Respectfully, MC is a niche product. No apples to oranges comparison there.
Multi screen you absolutely can have! The modular workspace no. The idea is that everything stays in the same place, so your muscle memory builds up fast and you become insanely rapid at tasks since stuff doesn't move to different points on the screen all the time.
I agree it's a jarring change at first because you're coming at it from a standpoint of "I should have maximum flexibility" (I felt the same), but give it a try - you may learn to love it!
IMO you kinda gotta be careful about using words like ‘gimmick’. There are plenty of real respectable editors/mograph designers at real post houses doing real high value commercial work using dynamic link. 

For example if you are doing a supervised session with a client working the edit and the graphics at the same time, and there’s lots of alphas going on, dynamic link is a hell of a tool. And you can do things like nesting comps in AE to give some version control. 

Is it the right tool for a full VFX pipeline? No. Are some of those things you mentioned real potential issues especially on larger projects? Absolutely. But are there real pros using dynamic link on real work even at very high levels? Yup.
yeah but i agree i wish it was in the edit page
Says the person who has demonstrated they're ill informed of how things work.

DaVinci Resolve is def not ready for prime time but yeh all are great in their own little ways.
AutoSequence!!!! One feature that would cost a dev mayber 2h of work! And Adobe isn't able to do that in YEARS!!!!!!
I've read this so many times and in the end they never worked. I'm gonna try the new version once I finish a few projects but I'm pretty certain they didn't fix those. At least I didn't find notes about that in the changelog.


btw Avid: It has gotten worse too. TBH I feel there's no good NLE out there right now. All of them feel broken but resolve to me is the most usable one. 
It’s just not a problem yet lol. What CPU do you have?
Maybe a bug in my version but when I have the TEXT window open, Premiere erratically bounces my playhead all around the timeline.  So I lose the spot I was at, then I have to find it again, it's frustrating.  I've spent way too much time trying to figure out a fix or solution and the only thing that makes it stop is to close the TEXT window.  Real bummer b/c its great for cutting loads of VO.  Also, the TEXT box crashes all the time.  I realize you can just close and reopen but...
For what I do, MC is far and away an inferior product.
All fair points! Yes I concede perhaps gimmick was maybe a bit far, I do still think it's somewhat of a half baked implementation, but for sure those are eminently reasonable cases for its value.
My point is: why do I have to proxy with my power rig pc on premier when DaVinci runs smoothly without? Is it not a software issue?
What is it premiere can do that resolve can’t?
12th gen Intel i7-12700 2.1ghz
Understand. That’s what I was saying by niche product. Best of luck in your career!
Because some codecs aren’t built to edit with (h264/h265). You probably FEEL resolve running better because it automatically generates optimized media by default which is basically making proxies for you as you work.
You should probably google "optimized media" for resolve before you keep talking your big game
You should always use 720p or 1080p proxies (or even lower), with any NLE, doesnt matter if your pc can handle it. Not doing this just screams amateur and almost unprofessional to some extent imo. It's a good practice to abide by.
You know the answer to that and so does the whole industry, hence Resolve still not being a go to for prime time
One of the systems I use is very similar to yours with more RAM (12700k, 3070, 64gb RAM) and personally, Premiere runs great with only hiccups on larger projects. It might just be the RAM holding you back - granted you probably only need 32gb.
I'm pretty sure resolve does not generate optimized media by default. I have never encountered this.
I’m genuinely asking because I don’t know. I’ve been working exclusively in Resolve with a team since 2021 and we haven’t run into anything that makes us say “we can’t use this”
I'm an editor, not a motion graphics artist.
This is something I have to explain to clients time and again. I'm an editor, not a motion graphics artist. Those are two different disciplines.

Yes - there are absolutely folks that can do both, just like there are folks that can play piano AND guitar. Yes - I could learn, I choose not to. I don't like motion graphics. I don't want to keyframe my life away. Yes - I have lost, and will continue to lose jobs, because I'm not a motion graphics artist. That's ok. I'm not an electrician either. 

I prefer story. I prefer mining great performances, creating emotional ups and downs, and restructuring scenes to find the best and most efficient way to generate some kind of emotional arc for the audience. I prefer clarity of story, continuity of shots, and concise scenes. I've spent my career focused on these elements, which is why from time to time I'm chosen to lead a team of editors, or sometimes I even get to be creative director/story producer. For me, story is  priority. Motion graphics aren't.  


So yes, dear client, I can absolutely cut your social campaign. But editing and motion graphics are two different things. And if you're disappointed, may I refer you to the 1/5 stars on my resume for "After Effects". 
When the average listing for "editing" positions also require you to shoot and produce for $25/hour
Despite being the producer, I do both. When I say I do both, they want me to shoot drone video, own the drone, and then build their website too. It never ends.
Don't forget clients expecting you to be a graphic designer and sound designer too.
Dammit Jim, I'm an editor, not an animator!
This sounds like an affirmation one says in a mirror.
Sign up for a month of Motion Array, tack the fee onto the invoice and boom you're one of the best motion graphic designers in the world!
I don’t know if straight up editing jobs exist anymore. I just got hired as a shooter, editor/line producer.  I resisted for a long, LONG time but frankly -  I don’t know what else to do!
"Yes - there are absolutely folks that can do both, just like there are folks that can play piano AND guitar. Yes - I could learn, I choose not to"

I play piano. At age 58 I learned how to play guitar.  I was a video engineer - I made cables, wired patch bays, switchers, routers. I learned CMX, Sony 9000, ISC, Grass Valley, Calaway.

And then the world changed. I learned EMC, AVID, FCP, Adobe Premiere, Davinci Resolve.

I learned about PostgreSQL databases.  I learned Apple Servers.  AVID Unity, AVID ISIS, AVID Nexis, EditShare, Facilis, Studio Network Solutions.  I learned 10G networking with Netgear.  Now I do QNAP and Synology  NAS systems and Ubiquiti networking.

I like staying employed. I like eating in nice restaurants.  And I like playing guitar.   NEVER STOP LEARNING.  In my first job in video at EUE Screen Gems in 1978, they had all these old guys that knew Ampex QUAD 2" VTR's, and when they Chryon and Vidifont got delivered, they all said "send that new kid for training, we don't want to do it".   That was me - I was the kid.  I knew nothing.  And I said to myself then "I WILL NEVER BE LIKE THOSE GUYS".

Bob

ps - I also build edit furniture, and I also throw out all the garbage boxes.
This might be unpopular here, but as technology advances you'll be expected to do everything; each individual thing is getting easier to do. "Editing" isn't a skill that can sustain itself alone, **outside** of film/tv.

Knowing the basics of coloring, editing, motion graphics, 3d, and even shooting, could be essential for our own survival down the line. That's not mentioning honing the post producer and pre-pro roles, which catapult the value of a simple "editor."

The one place I draw the line is graphic design, which I am simply not skilled enough at to create anything worthwhile.
Explaining this to a room of *connected* stiffs gets really old.
At least we don't get asked to design DVD covers anymore.
Are you staff? Or freelance?

In the past i would have agreed wholeheartedly. I've spent 15 years dead set on being a narrative editor (which is what I call it to differentiate it from general editing). But, i was forced to open up my services in 2020 due to the dumpster fire that is the market, and i've changed my mind about this.

My take: you are right, but clients dont really care how you define "editing", they just want to be done with this video. Im there to help them get there. I dont do color, sound, graphics, design or VFX, but I understand the process, way better than my EP at least. And i've interacted with the people who do do those things. I could probably brief them on the project better than anyone... *I know enough to be helpful.*

My current answer for when a client starts asking for stuff that wasnt agreed upon is: sure, lets talk. It will probably take more time and/or more money. It might involve calling someone else with specific expertise. Im happy to recommend someone from my own network, help negotiate a price, do some coordinating and supervising - *for a price.*

If its not something big/specific enough to call an expert (meaning im doing it myself), its coming out of our agreed upon timeframe. That means less time editing, more time doing whatever it is they need. If that requires more time than we agreed upon, then lets negotiate what that extra fee is going to be.

I do this only with stuff im comfortable in. Basically just postproduction. If a client needs me to so much as look at a camera, im outta there.
I have never seen a job listing that requests you do both jobs that paid as much as the jobs I take for just editing. These people are not people you would want to work for anyway.
I do both because I get more work and get paid more. If you choose to just cut pictures then that’s cool too, but you’ll have less work and get paid less. This is the reality of post production in 2024
I've used after effects for over 20 years and I probably only know 20% of the functions.  For the type of editing I do, this is more than enough.

After Effects is such a vast program that can handle so much, that anyone who says they use the program 100% has me raise an eyebrow.   Not saying they aren't good at what they do, but different people have different specialities.
It's 2024, the days of compartmentalizing editorial and *light* motion graphics duty are firmly in the rear-view. Story is obviously important, but we live in a new world where style is at least as important as substance. If you have 1/5 stars for AE on your resume, might be time to bone up on AE.
I'm pretty sure the only reason I am not homeless is because I can and will do literally ANYTHING in this space for a client. It's great and also really frustrating at times. It feels a bit unbalanced.
I do both. I rarely ever get paid for doing both, just one or the other.
Weirdly, as a motion graphics artist, I can't seem to get work unless I'm willing to edit as well...

Let's team up. Charge more and outsource! Aces in their places
I'm fully aware of the problem the OP and others have outlined but I just want to play devil's advocate for a moment. 

Now be completely honest, how many of us here have tried to consistently educate these people? 

I'm not trying to be condescending but I've been involved in many conversations like this over the years and had many rants myself, but now I'm questioning whether rather than us grumbling between ourselves, if collectively a concerted effort was made to always educate, who knows maybe there would have been a slight shift in expectations. 

I also think this is where our industry suffers from not having any formalised set of required qualifications. Whilst making it open to all, it also leaves the expected valuation bar thoroughly all over the place, especially from an outsiders perspective. 

Whilst my marginally OCD brain would love for there to be an official well designed little handbook that neatly outlines every job role which I could reference every time a situation like this occurs, here's a simpler approach. 

Get two videos: 

Video A to showcase fantastic editing & video B to showcase stellar motion graphics. 

Ask the person which they want.
 - If A, you're the person for the job.
 - If B, explain you're not the person for the job. 
 - If both, explain that they need to hire an additional person. 

If it all falls on deaf ears, fair enough but at least the education was attempted.
Basic motion graphics to impress clients ain't that hard. Probably causing yourself more stress by not spending a few days getting it down
Day 1: "I SWEAR we don't need ahy motion graphics."

Day 14: "This is great, but can we make the whole thing look like it's flying across the room?"
I support your rebellion
Yeah, that’s why I can’t find a remote job. I work as a film editor (mostly feature films) and this job has to be done with a director in person. I would love to quit film editing and start making some YouTube videos or commercials if I could make it remotely. But every time I look for a job on internet it is usually said in the description that they need an editor who can also make motion graphics (sometimes even 3D), color correction, sound design etc and I’m, like, wow, so you need a team, not just one person, right? And funny thing is that these jobs are always paid less than I make now.
Templates satisfy 9/10 of my clients.  The 10% that need something custom I just sub it out and bake it into the hours/cost.  Having a few After Effects wizards in your Rolodex is the way.
If you are dealing with clients that want motion graphics work you need to partner with a motion graphics artist and mark up their work to your clients, problem solved and you make a few bucks!
Don't know what to tell ya bud, you're not gonna have clients for much longer if you keep that attitude up. 

Unless you're doing purely narrative work that kind of separation is more and more a thing of the past.

It's ok to know your specialty and pick a lane, but refusing outright is closing most of the doors available and this industry is moving faster than ever.
As a graphic designer I can relate.  
  
I went from a computer graphic designer to a graphic designer/web designer/photographer/videographer/editor and I'm still getting pressured for being "not quick enough".
I'm a long-form documentary producer/editor/shooter. The way I present myself to clients is if I don't know how to do something, I know people that do and will work with them for the desired result. The customer doesn't need to know who's doing what. Just tell them if they want graphic arts and animation in a video, it will cost them accordingly, and then go out and freelance the person yourself. Same with shooting. I'm pretty good at shooting interviews and b-roll, but if I have to shoot hockey or football, I might hire a sports cameraman.  Same with drone operators. Businesses hire free-lancers all the time. Just make sure you add the cost of the freelancer to your invoice.
I upvoted this with such resolute that I’ve almost broke my phone screen
I get what you are saying, but I know in the city I am in that motion graphics expertise will either make or break you from getting a job. Yes, we all love making stories and we all prefer that, but in order to make a living here I will need to spend hours making something in AE. It sucks, but it's better than working at the agency I was at making a story edit for some horrible people.  There are some people that are just straight editors here but it seems like their work is few and far between and the constant struggle weighs on them. Best of luck and I hope you build that career without motion work!
I wish we all so overemplyed such that we could laugh it off… as a VFX guy, I get it as well.
With the explosion of content and overseas edit farms the expectations are high and rates are a race to the bottom.
This!!! Came across a new client once who wanted a 30 min explainer video. Sure, fine. I used their previous videos as a reference, and saw they utilized stock footage, some text here and there, and so that’s what I did. After I sent over V1 for notes, they said to scrap all the edits, and sent a link to a 1 minute YouTube short with heavy mographs and typography and told me to replicate that style for the entire 30 minutes. All for $250? I’ve never dropped a project so fast.
I say I can do it to “get in the room” and try to get the client to specify what they need motion graphics wise. Sometimes that “we need an all-star motion fx person with rockstar skills” just meant “we want lower thirds that fade in and out and our logo at the end”
You should see what’s happened to news editing. Now it’s all about MMJ’s who can produce, write, shoot, edit and present  news stories.
Motion graphics person here- would love to collab and jump in on those projects with you if the clients have the desire and budget :)
It's a silly focus too, because most graphic artists they end up hiring just rework off-the-shelf templates and bullshit their way past a boss who isn't familiar with Adobe stock.
Presets and templates are my best friend for any sort of motion graphic I need to use lol
I HATE seeing this on job postings. And they’re always paying GARBAGE. Like those are two very different skill sets. I’ll make temp placeholders but you need to hire a GFX person. Who gets paid to do that.
I’m the opposite. I’m a VFX artist and constantly have to tell people that I’m not an editor.
It's always been a choice between being very good at one thing but not know anything else, or being just okay in a lot of other stuff. I started out as a colorist, moved to online editing, then VFX compositing, then motion graphics and some basic 3D. I eventually gave up on CG stuff coz I didn't have to patience to model or animate 3d objects. My motion graphics skills are passable but I would use templates when necessary. But my bread and butter is editing and with those extra skills, I am able to stand out from the majority who only know editing. So should you learn motion graphics? Not really if you don't want to but having some knowledge of it helps your editing capabilities. I used to hate photoshop but forced myself to learn it since some jobs require retouching. I got pretty good eventually but it took time. So gradually learn motion graphics even if only the basic stuff. It'll pay off eventually.
I'm with you bro, I can't agree more on this.
Motion designers also have to be social media experts, keeping up with the latest trends, know all the social media platforms, be a graphic designer for print, know marketing, know cinema 4D, be an expert in premiere. I'm sure I'm missing 4 other entirely different careers that are usually in the job listings. 
This. I'm a cinematographer. Or a videographer if we're stretching.

I'm not an editor, although I'll do that if I must. Color and sound design, sure, that's not the worst thing in the world either. I can even do concepting that goes beyond the visual aspects of a production.

What I am most certainly not is a motion graphics artist, a storyboard artist, a scriptwriter/copyrighter, or a bloody legal consultant.

I'm so sick and tired of this "having to wear multiple hats". If they want me to do 5 jobs in 1, they should pay me 5 times as much. But of course that's never gonna happen, because we are in a very fast race to the bottom and to the cheapest and lowest possible quality of work possible.
>Yes - I have lost, and will continue to lose jobs, because I'm not a motion graphics artist.

Sounds like you're also a bad business man. I'm also not an animator but I know a couple of animators that I can call and give them work in case a client comes up that wants something.
Weird hill to die on! But you do you.
Motion graphics / designer artists and editor are two different carreers. Once I tried to learn After Effects, and it was hell. What a difficult software to use. Hats off to those who master it. Also, what a pain of work to create just a 3 second full-frame card.
It’s 2024… gotta be both bud, it sucks but yeahz
I like it.
Mograph was something I was really hesitant to do but as I've gone on I started to enjoy it more. Obviously, it's not for everyone and I make it very clear to my clients that unless you're gonna give me time what you see is what you get.
Thats why i decided to go the route of more professional audio and color work. Even if editors can do motion design it will just never as good as a motion designer that can do basic editing. On top of that i dont like animating
See I'm both for my job but I'm actually the other way around. I can edit and enjoy editing things like sizzle reels and hype videos but when it comes to interviews, I just hate doing it. I prefer motion graphics and as you said keyframing my life away. Unfortunately, the job I currently work at does more editing than motion graphics, so for the time being I'm more of an editor than a motion graphics artist.
I’ve mostly tried to avoid adobe. I can work in premiere if it’s necessary. But recently I’ve done a couple minor things in after effects. I took advantage of the Black Friday adobe suite special. It’s been handy for my current job. And I actually like it and plan to start diving into it. 

It is a different set of skills for sure.  I think it’s helpful when we don’t have to wait on another department or vendor to do something, do notes, send another version, repeat. It saves money, for sure, and I don’t see those savings directly. But my time is important and I love learning new things. 

I’d love to be able to do proper split screens and wire and equipment removal.
I feel really bad for this breakdown, I for sure am on the other end, and though it is a plus for me I often find myself on large video essay projects where because I'm known for my motion design, I have very little time to actually invest in motion design that can really flow cause we got 2 hours of real estate to cover
Welp 🤷‍♂️

🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
i can put some things together if they're vital for communicating the intent in a rough cut.... as soon as i start getting graphics notes on top of editorial notes though, i just cannot do both. i cannot be thinking about fonts and colors and animations and also be thinking about how to add all of the requested bytes without destroying the pacing
Ok, but can you do web design?
I always make sure they know the difference but when they want motion graphics it lets me command that much higher fee which pays off.
Dude. I feel so stupid that I don’t know photoshop and after effects. Like my brain doesn’t work that way. I don’t paint. I can’t draw. I’m not an artist. And I mean artist like Picasso and shit. Every job posting is like DO YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE ADOBE SUITE THAT WE OURSELVES DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND. No. No I don’t 
I love, respect, and feel EVERY word of this post man. Agree with all of it like you were rummaging around in my own brain. I also haven’t had work in years so take my accolades as valueless in today’s world. Good luck, friend. You’re fighting the good fight. I love the pianist/ guitarist analogy! Dead on.
Preach it
Thanks a lot. Sometimes when I see posts here I want to shout: that's not the fuking editing you are talking about. Jesus fuck, people don't understand difference between editing and video making. Finally somebody tells it out loud.
I’m both. I started as an editor, but I learned motion graphics as I went. I charge more when I have to do more than simple text and titles
How long have you been editing?
This is why I don’t use After Effects. If I wanted to be a VFX artist, I would go be a VFX artist.
Im the cinematographer, editor, graphic designer, and motion designer at my company…oh and a little bit of a front end web design too
 I totally agree with you! Editing and motion graphics are indeed separate skills. I've always felt this way too. In college, we had a class on After Effects and I found it incredibly boring to keyframe everything. It's just not my thing at all.
I had to drop a client this year because they started to refuse my rate and insist on a lower rate of their choosing, WHILE insisting I do the shooting, editing, motion graphics, VFX, casting, writing, and campaign management. It's sickening that this client isn't apparently the only one that works like that.
I think a big part of it is it that a whole generation who grew up messing around with easily accessible software for all these different aspects of post production have reached working age and while they may not excel in any one one area or know how to run a session with clients in an edit bay or gracefully address feedback while maintaining the creative integrity of the piece etc., they’re often good enough and they’re cheap!
I'm just leaning into it. Work has definitely been slower this last year, so I spend more time learning motion graphics.
lol it must be this type as to why I've worked with post producers absolutely shocked I know After Effects. I'm looking forward to the reactions of me learning Fusion last year.
I am today, a colourist. If you want me to edit your shots, you best have a tight script, and a large budget for the edit to run into overage x2. But do be prepared for a grade that is less than my best, due to frustration and exhaustion brought about by an edit that took forever. 

Give me a  correctly pre-conformed project, and source footage and just enough, but not too much guidance.  I will deliver, more than you expect and much less of what you do not want. If you demand more, then my invoice will be interesting, and my retirement sooner. 

I have my colourist craft. It took effort to learn it, to earn it! The biggest of all being, not allowing myself to be distracted by all of the other creative opportunities. You do not want my opinion on the cut, the audio, the pace, or the script, you want me to deliver tone, hue contrast and feel to match your intent -preferably not at odds with your DP’s interpretation (that costs extra). The more I have to correct the less of what you want will be delivered. That is the way of it. 
Any editor can fiddle with the knobs, sliders and curves but just as I can mangle superb audio, they can mangle a good image by doing far too much fiddling in the wrong areas of the image. 

I will and can do almost anything is a range of disciplines that would baffle most corporate Human resource managers (and has). I could teach a master class on survival beyond the limits in several contexts of life illustrated by scars and history. Routinely surviving “the impossible” to stand on the mountain to enjoy the view. 

But I have no significant interest, inspiration, or motivation beyond my colour grading craft. If you want to employ someone like me to do a job that doesn’t inspire, the results will be not especially inspiring, and the cost to your production value immeasurable. In the meantime, my survival is entirely sorted, I will not be going hungry, or homeless even if I have no paid work. I work because I choose to. If not I will continue playing with refining the grades on those pet projects I choose to keep me occupied. Maybe one of them is yours.  If so, be assured it’s in good hands.
Sounds like you refusing to adapt tbh.
My job title is video editor, I mostly do motion graphics and I also have to travel to film things. I think the video editor title pays the least so that's what I'm hired as.
![gif](giphy|l0GtwcDSNteWx2vfy|downsized)
Use motion graphics templates. Tons of good drag & drop .mogrts for Premiere nowadays
see also: I'm an editor, not a VFX artist.
“I’m not an electrician either”
I'm a full time multi media editor but the company I work for thinks I'm a motion graphics artist, a sound designer, a colorist, and a magician. 

I've been trying to learn after effects because I think I should develop the skill, but it's such a difficult program to self teach.
I can keyframe and model 3d shit all day long but I know I'm crap at editing and production. I still did that shit badly but that's why you hire more than one person. Glad I just do that shit as a hobby now. Paying for 3ds max is impossible to afford now which is sad.
True, but you're choosing yourself money by not asking a weapon to your arsenal. I do both pretty well, but I don't do sound or color. I don't understand sound and I'm color blind lol.
I’m quitting my commercial production in Tokyo for this reason. Yes they hired me knowing I’m a film editor who has been editing features and now they were surprised I couldn’t make 5 animated transitions in 30mins.
If you’re swimming in work and can afford to not invest in related skill set, then do what you want. I had to learn the basics of motion graphics plus pretty intermediate level sound and music editing to stay competitive in my market.
I learned a lot of motion graphics as an editor at the studio I was hired at 3 years ago. Over those 3 years I’ve learned motion graphics fairly well. Still I’m primarily an editor, Our motion graphics guy can also edit. So when there is over flow either way one of us picks up the slack. If I have to do some motion graphics I can, when he needs to edit he can. First year there was a lot of YouTube tutorials going on in my office, it’s still the case. Our DP does the color, but I’ve also gotten pretty good at that and learned DaVinci last year. The only guy that never really steps out of his lane is the sound engineer. My résumé is constantly growing it feels like.
“Looking for an editor” “hi I’m an editor” “great what camera do you own?” “… I own an expensive computer which I put money into to edit on… Not a camera” … “You don’t own a camera!? You’re not an editor!!!”
Ive had to explain this countless times... im a motion graphics artist, not an editor...
When I first came to nyc I interviewed at a big post house and the super laughed at the idea of hiring an editor who couldn't do motion graphics too.

I think it depends what you're cutting. 

Social media and ads? Ridiculous to be an editor in that space now without at least trying to learn after effects
Love this! And please stay like this! Clients need to change not us!
I usually try to get clarity from the client what they really need. Maybe their version of motion graphics is simple 2D key framing and some masking. If the job is something I can handle then I let them know I can do it, but I also let them know if they need anything beyond that then they will need to bring someone more specialized to handle those areas. And I have a few of those people ready to recommend. I missed out on a job recently because it was with a client I knew needed more of a motion/3D/compositing artist. The producer was new to the agency and didn't know the client well enough yet. It sucks to lose out to work, but it also sucks to fail to deliver or cost them more money than what they agreed to (bringing in a specialist after the fact). Always good to keep an open mind, but keep it within your wheelhouse.
Jobs that need that are LOW END. Who cares!
I've definitely had big clients who want me to design (and sometimes even come up with) copy in their video content. It's completely crazy. They will usually attached a zip with their brand guidelines in it and expect me to turn out perfectly on-brand artwork even though I have zero training in graphic design.

I either refuse to do it or slap something on there knowing they'll book one of their designers to do it properly. A lot of people are really stupid and don't see that videos are made of components. They just think the video guy is a self-contained polymath.
Yeah I get you. I've spent 5 years of my life working as a graphic designer. And to be honest, I never liked it. I love to tell stories when I'm editing videos, but almost all the jobs I get is to design stuff for social media. I get that the ultimate goal of marketing is to sell things. But I absolutely hate thinking the way marketing does. There's no artistry, no creative freedom. They always want to do the same as their business competitors. There's plenty of great marketing pieces out there, but all I get is clients that refuse to think outside the box. They demand that I have knowledge of all parts of the creative process. I can't focus on editing when I also need to learn motion graphics, sound design, visual effects, screenwriting... So I've decided that this year I will stop getting those jobs and starting pursuing a career of film editor, and try to focus only in that.
Bro is so full of himself, he had to make a post about it 😭
Same
Dude mograph has become so easy to learn, especially to someone coming from an editing background. But no, fuck having skills that make me a better creative! P.s. Mograph and story and editing and all these things you mention are not mutually exclusive.
This is when you pull out the "I have a guy for that though" and you both know each other well
Genuine question : how is this approach working out for you?
You mean to tell me you’re not a video editor, script writer, video gathering film maker who also does the voice over, sound design AND ACTING??? Cmon man, that’s what video editors are after all!
I have the opposite problem. I’m a terrible editor and just want to animate stuff.
Sometimes they really just want an influencer to do TikTok clips but claim it’s a video editor role
Did you write this on LinkedIn today? It's funny how there's a person on LI who posted an article to their legion of followers that sounds very close to yours. Even has some same lines and quotation marks in the same spots. Grinds my gears when someone takes from others without giving the credit.
I started in web development and now pretty much an everything role. Web dev / programming, database & server management, graphic design, printing, social media, copy editing, filmography, photography, video editor, motion graphics, analytics & metrics, event coordinator, email campaigns, and manager. But that's also why I made sure to ask for a high salary. Don't sell yourself short on the pay...
Hahahaha! They are soo different in terms of disciplines! And it’s massively time consuming with key framing and rendering. I remember these little bastards wanted me to do edit the light saber effect on a no budget project. Back then you had to manually track each frame 1 by 1. Never again 😂
I’m about to do freelance for editing, is this just how I get into the editing space…? By having to deal with dumbasses?
As a motion graphics artist and compositor I get triggered every time someone refers to a graphic as an edit.

Plug and play templates are muddying the waters. Editors can drop in some pretty slick graphics these days without needing a mograph goblin so it's perceived to be the same job in the majority of cases.
Gonna get left behind with that attitude.
You admitted your inadequacy, at least.
[deleted]
And own the gear, and do their marketing, and write the script, and and and...
$25 per hour??? Slow down there Mr. Rockefeller, this isn't Hollywood budgets you know.

Oh I’m glad it’s not just me who’s drastically underpaid as well. 
Once upon a time I was in an interview for an editor role, and the guy started to talk to me about my experience behind the camera (which I have), but it took me a while to pick up on the fact the guy didn’t want an editor - he wanted a production crew. I’m glad I didn’t get that job.
Oh I know.. we all feel this hard. I’m at the point where I just need someone else entirely to handle clients and the business end I hate it all so much. Just want to sit in the dark and do the damn work.
Yea and the job title is “Preditor” which is ironic because it’s usually the companies looking to exploit and pay the least for the most amount of work that are posting those positions.
Reading these replies is like every Monday ever
I feel that. I do sound as well. I'm not as good as a high end studio but I'm better than your average bear and can get you a pretty solid mix. No one ever seems to notice that part. 

Also - the website thing is way too real.
[deleted]
Wanting is the easy part
I do this too 

Pay is good at least
That's a pretty unrealistic expectation but with page builders making a basic websites about the same skill level as after effects.

Granted you won't be able to do extremely customized things like creating css or Javascript from scratch but I don't think most editors use many expressions in after effects and get by alright.
I think a lot of this is simply because clients don't understand that there's a separate breakdown of these roles and that to them, anyone who does this stuff is an *editor.*
This is the way.

&#x200B;

In ALL seriousness, having gone through film school now, it's depressing that most clients expect you to also do sound mixing. The worst experience I've had: taking SCRATCH audio and using it in the edit. They had me do 27 passes of audio before realizing that they should've just invested in a Lav mic or SOMETHING besides the camera smfh

I just ended up handing in the project and moving onto a different gig LOL
It is interesting because I actually can do 2D animation, VFX compositing, and sound design. I also am/can be a voice actor and I can shoot and I can write copy and come up with stories. But I still run into pikachu faces when I point out I am not a graphic designer so someone else needs to make the assets for me to animate and no I don’t know how to create 3D models and texturing.

No matter how many things you check off on your resume people will always want you to do more.
>https://www.reddit.com/r/editing/comments/1b7syrz/i\_need\_this\_exact\_editing\_for\_10\_a\_video\_send\_me/

When people think VFX is actual "editing"
Lol. I probably have!
This is the way.
We have envato elements- roughly the same thing. Sell a few mediocre stock shots (it’s not as good as the big boys, but for the right situation or client…) and an AE template and it’s paid for itself for the year. Build in an add-on to ALL jobs since it’s a service that’s part of your kit now.
This is what I do
This works decently well until it doesnt
this is the way
Bob, from the top rope!
Yea a one trick pony freelancer is going to be very hungry in this generation.
I totally agree, but knowing all those things makes you more valuable. So we need to get paid more.
But that's the tendency across all industries. Workers are required to have more and more skills but payments are still the same as before. It's plain wrong.
Agreed — and tbh I don’t think it’ll survive on its own inside film/tv either. Imo the tech boom we’re seeing isn’t going to make jobs easier. The biggest change we’ll see is the type and amount of work that an individual is expected to do. The same thing happened in the 70s when “practical computing” came around.
My first job out of college was DVD authoring for an indie distributor. Most these films had like 50k budgets. OMG - the amount of times I had to design covers drove me absolutely insane. I had no idea DVD authoring meant "poster designer" as well.
Ok thats funny lol
Lucky you.
This is the most important point. While some people in this thread like u/Got_A_Turtle_Head are celebrating the race to the bottom, the fact is one person can't do the same quality of work as a team. Sure, they might be extraordinarily talented and can do a few things very well, but all the top editors or VFX people I've ever met in my career are specialists in their field. Bruce Lee said "I fear not the  who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." Same goes for editing. When they want someone who is an expert in two separate fields, they NEVER pay for that expertise. Which leads to a degradation of pay and quality, which quickly becomes the new norm, and the cycle continues.
These hybrid jobs pay more than 750-1200 a day? From what I’ve seen these types of jobs tend to pay PA rates.
That’s always been the case for me. I learned after effects very early in my career and now use cinema 4D as well.

I work in sports streaming and broadcasting and I have better job security than the regular editors, get paid more, and get the marquee assignments because I can take a project from concept to finished product.

I wouldn’t want to be limited to one small piece of video production. That sounds boring.
>but you’ll have less work and get paid less

I mean, if you exclusively work in social or marketing sure. But I mostly work in features. This social job is literally just a filler before I start a feature in April.
[deleted]
Yeah it’s understandable if you aren’t able to do a full blown flashy motion graphic explainer video or something but you should be able to do some basic text or lower third type motion graphics these days. It’s pretty simple. It’s usually just keyframing masks, scale, position etc.
Having a working knowledge of some things, perhaps. Like organic bottom third text or how to adjust templates, sure. 

But to actually build out a 2D or 3D motion graphic from at scratch is a silly standard. Not to mention, most of these graphics actually start in photoshop or illustrator which is even more of a cluster to have for an ask. Again, a working knowledge of things is fine, but they’re all very different areas of expertise, tool kits and hardware spec’s different.
I'll team up. I edit
should be the other way around, IMO. clients aren’t gonna have editors for much longer if they keep that attitude up. also OP already stated (and I agree with this too) that it’s ok that they’ve lost and will continue to lose out jobs. it sounds like OP knows how to maintain a manageable work relationship with their clients and avoid burnout.
Can't disagree more bub. You might have an attitude of "adapt or die", but I agree with his approach of being hyper focused specialized in a specific discipline, rather than being mediocre at many. 

It limits the opportunities for employment in the same way that I might live in a market where there's a MASSIVE demand for software developers, and I'm a chef.
I dunno, a lot of my work is in commercials and I've learnt a bit of basic stuff but I'm at a level if a client asks me for proper motion graphics it's better to be honest. For the most part I can't create animated titles that transform and interact with infographics to the level that is expected for TV commercials, why be dishonest and *really* burn that bridge for yourself?

I usually just say I know a great dedicated MG that I can put you in touch with or sort it out/brief my end and add the cost to the invoice.
Editing YouTube shorts is the worst. I hate how everything has to be snappy and in your face to keep viewer’s attention for more than 3 seconds
That was becoming a thing 15+ years ago when I left news. Are they finally getting better at it?🤣🤣🤣
I know how to story produce and often work as a creative director, what makes you think I don't know how to hire a team of people? Sometimes the gig doesn't have that kind of budget. In which case I don't take the job. If it's some small time gig that pays only 700/day, why would I sacrifice my paycheck hiring someone else just for the client's benefit? I'd rather just get a different job. If "pay more" is bad business then I guess I'm terrible lol.
As someone that does both, ive always loved seeing the difference in peoples' takes on mograph and the like. I know the huge push for me was just my ability to hyperfocus on it when I can barely focus on anything else without getting really anxious. I think my love for math and physics may, partly, have something to do with it as well.
Im actually shocked that if you are an editor you don't know After Effects
>Unfortunately, the job I currently work at does more editing than motion graphics

Keep your voice down! You're surrounded by editors, do you want to cause a stampede?
We duffers get pretty good mileage out of Pixelmator Pro, Apple Motion, and Final Cut -- and don't have to tithe the Adobe God.
i mean, i kind of see it like how i see it when someone asks if i can "crop" something out. you mean like cut the canvas smaller? no, they mean rotoscoping or masking lol.

it's like the "all game consoles are nintendos" issue but with editing.
If you need color grading in Resolve for NYC clients hit up- I have a suite with the advanced panels in Manhattan.  I do sound clean up as well in RX advanced
I'm one of the few editors working right now so I guess I'll cry about my inadequacy all the way to the bank.
This isn't the flex you think it is.
They also want someone who know SEO and how to read the metrics on digital campaigns.
Literally.
***$10***???? SWEET. That's a whole meal right there! All for a day's work!
What's sadder than that are the losers on that post unironically begging to take that pathetic offer.
On the sound mixing thing, they *do* notice, they just don’t realise they notice. Would be nice to get a pat on the back every now and again though, I agree!
Sound mixing is like editing, if they don’t notice, you’ve done your job well
Haha, that's not a bad way to keep expanding my education as well!

I'm actually hoping to get farther from production and deeper into Producer-ing rather than deeper and deeper into the expanding pool of responsibilities they want editors to have. As a result of all the previous asks I can edit, animate, do a little vfx, manage the flying text and graphics, handle our contractors, manage our swollen media library and am migrating it to a new media system I set up, and do posters and graphic design. All for peanuts, because it's a small place I work now, but it's a reliable daily job.

I've always drawn the line at code, websites, and the like. People always want HTML. I have a project management cert now, I just want to help plan projects and make cool things happen on budget, c'mon folks.
Is it??

I joke. I mean it could be worse. I work for a small place so it's not competitive, but I want to take my 5 years of Producer title experience and find a better gig.
I think it's more likely that they just want to pay one person instead of hiring several people. Which I kind of understand but also find insanely frustrating.
A lot of graphic designers don't do motion design. They bemoan the fact that they are asked to do tasks that they were not trained for.


I do motion graphics; most of what I do is moving text, which is not too difficult. I am not an animator though. Just a graphic production artist who learned Aftereffects 
In my opinion, sound mixing is a pretty crucial part of editing. I’m not saying you have to know how to master and do a mega pro level mix, but if you don’t know how to deliver a rough cut with balanced audio levels where things sound as close to the final product as you can make it, then you aren’t a very good editor, or you’re lazy and making another person have to do a lot more work later on, when most of this could have all been adjusted before you even started throwing clips in the timeline.

It always pissed me off when I’d receive work from other editors (if i was assembling a show or something) and they have certain clips where there’s only audio in the left channel, or levels are up and down so you have to keep raising and lowering the volume as you watch down.

Sound can have such a big impact on certain edits and I’ve always felt it’s very much a part of telling the story you want to tell. How can a producer get a sense of your vision for the edit if there are jarring audio levels and other things that take you out of the piece. You don’t want to remind people that it’s a rough cut unless it’s absolutely necessary.

It’s fine if people disagree, but every great editor I’ve worked with has had a pretty good sense of how to keep a decent mix going while they build everything out.
Yeah this is quite common nowadays especially clients looking for short social media content. I personally hate motion graphics and hate those that I have to make from scratch, but give me a mogrt that does it for me without crippling my pc and I'm happy to be your graphic designer.
This is the way.
I agree with you, and I can tell you from experience knowing how to do simple templated animations in and out for thirds and how to apply stock alpha'd graphics and create some simple wipes, etc in AE has increased my rates over time.  I think my freelancing has benefitted GREATLY by knowing how to do intermediate graphics work that bridges the gap and allows me to deliver more complex output than my rivals.
> These hybrid jobs pay more than 750-1200 a day?

Yes. Work direct for ad agencies or motion design shops and you can ask $1000-1500/day
[deleted]
Yeah true. I don’t work in features, I don’t have the patience for it and I’m not in LA
Yeah, same. Though that isn’t really a thing in my industry, any editor who cuts 30sec commercials and says they’re “crafting stories” is full of shit IMO 🤣
I'm not doing much 3D work but I probably spend an hour or two a day adding texture/drop shadows/bevels/light glints/etc. to 2D gfx in AE, in addition to the half day or so digging thru fonts and coming up with styleframe looks at the start of the project. It's a must for me every single day and I don't know any editors in my world who aren't *really* close to retirement age who can't get by on AE.
sadly every time i feel this way, i am shocked by the fact that clients will often just accept lower quality work rather than "learn something" from losing out on an expert. the blame is often passed down until it's far away from the people making these decisions and therefore they rarely change.
I work in commercials too and I'm not claiming to be as good as motion artists who are at the top of their game, a specialist would do that, of course. 

But for a lot of in-between work, I'm the guy who's expected to get the job done, I'm pretty decent and with enough time and a good reference I can do a seamless job. I've done basic motion for a lot of spots where it wasn't too fancy. 

As things become more enshitified and budgets shrink and responsibilities collapse, those who are flexible will be in demand.
You're Right
You're probably right. In my case, I have hyperfocus on things I like. This is an obvious affirmation but when I say this, I mean staying volutarily until dawn because it's something I'm enjoying to do. And it's not rare spend hours more than I should. But with mograph, as it's something I really did not like, I can't dedicate any attention to it. However, when I tried to learn it, it helped me to understand a minimum in order to know better about what a designer can do. At least it enriched my knowledge.
I've been an assistant editor for ten years and I've never worked for an editor who knew After Effects. But, my perspective is skewed since I only work on shows where an assistant exists. If production cannot afford an assistant, then maybe those editors all have to know After Effects, I'm not sure.
I had to learn the basics of it at some point just to update some letterings and schedules of TV shows, but every where I worked there were people just to work in AE. I know it's a reallity, but I get outraged that lots of companies require advanced AE knowledge from video editors. My opinion is that they want to save money by demanding two different skills from just one professional. As I said: they are two different careers.
Why is it shocking? I edit, I have no need to use AE.
Yes, yes I do, I want to see the world burn down around me while I light up a cigarette 🚬
Well I’m very very good at premiere pro. Starting to learn avid now and I fucking hate it 
What happened to the millions of teenagers who can cut video? "few editors" LOL
Yeah this is the one I’m seeing a lot now, and really confused as to why I would ever need to know this information to put a video together?
Preach!!!
I'm expected to do videography, photography, graphic design, web design, SEO, SEM, social media management, and email marketing, among a few other things. I own all my equipment and pay for Adobe. KMN
Don’t forget 5 years of proven experience leading marketing campaigns!!
I literally had to do all of the above (also social media campaigns) and they were offering 13.5 dollars an hour
Wow
And build their website.
also can you just create a simple website and embed the videos from social media there?
Woah woah woah there's still plenty of meat on that bone... You take that home, throw it in a pot, add some broth and potatoes.... Baby you've got a stew going!
I started out doing webdesign but unless you’re doing high level back end development which basically equates to computer programming there doesn’t seem like much opportunity in that field anymore. There’s so many build-your-own sites like Shopify these days, plus chat gpt providing more complex code.

Pretty much the only thing I *haven’t* done at this point is complex 3d modeling. Kinda dragging my heels on that hoping AI makes it easier.
Yeah I feel like when this industry and these kind of jobs were just starting to be a thing we could say they don't understand how different everything is. 

Now it's definitely just companies being as cheap as possible.
>o

Absolutely agreed! I always make sure to do a pass of sound design/mixing (at least based on a director or producer's notes) to see how it feels. And in terms of levelling audio, you never wanna blow out a speaker because you were lazy!

Mostly referring to clients who ask for completely polished sound. A lot of people seem to assume sound work is simple, but in reality, it takes a ***loooot*** of time
Very, incredibly rare from my experience
Right, and a smart editor would get that without having to do both jobs
So true, especially when there are a hundred CD's taking all of your creative control away anyway lmao
It sounds like you’re in a role where it’s already demanded. Like my role where I have to film, take photos, edit photos in lightroom and edit, virtually doing 4 roles on a day to day, similar to yours. So it’s really easy to say: “hey look what I can do! You must suck and have no ability to learn a program I’ve used for 5+ years” Well, great, you already have the skillset and implement them day to day. Where most video editors are just that. Maybe they shoot video, maybe dabble in photography, maybe know some of AE but they’re still completely different roles with different gear, hardware etc. 

Its still a good idea to have a working knowledge of other programs but companies are crazy looking for unicorns. It’s the same for a “social media manager” when looking for one who works in sponsorships, DE&I, content creation, legal, community management, presentation skills to CSuites with analytics background. Oh this is an entry level job with 5yrs experience, 45k.
The editors who know after effects are around. We just don’t generally advertise it. 

I do VFX editing a lot and prefer to do it in Avid so there isn’t any Temp Love.
I guess it depends on what software you use. I primarily use Premiere and doing anything with text in there is a nightmare, same for Davinci.
They want to hire someone who will produce the video for them and then shoot the metrics back to them, but they don't know what that person is called, so they put out one of those abomination of a job posting.

There's people who will be desperate enough to say they can do it, even if they have no idea, and these clients are too greedy and undiscerning to know they're walking into a disaster.
Because how metrics work will determine how you put the video together.
Location, Location, Location
Pretty common from mine. YMMV.
You should inventory your skills and your clients and figure out where the gap lies, either it's one or the other and easy to fix.  If your skills are solid, get better clients, if not, bone up on skills and THEN get better clients.

I'm doing this over 20 years, it certainly wasn't always like this but in order to get more opportunities on bigger/better projects it was necessary for me to widen my skillset and expertise. I did it after hours, taking courses in person and online, and putting in the effort.
I had a decent job lined up but I was honest about my experience with SEO/metrics. Haven’t heard back since. I should’ve just lied.
Worse, it will get done just fine, but poor quality. They either wont care, or will only look at the “returns” and say video is a dead end. To them it’s just pennies, to OUR industry it’s a death sentence
I believe they're looking for a video production swiss army knife and/or social media wizard/ninja/rockstar.
But that’s down to the Marketing team to know no? Or the Social Media Manager or even the Art/Creative Director?
They’re the ones who have created the idea that is the video and I’ve been hired to put it together for them under their direction.
I can see this being the case in smaller markets. Not really the norm in LA, things are still departmentalized, as they should be
I’m a picture editor. I have great clients, and great rates. Not sure what this is in reply to tbh
And I do, I just don’t have to do both jobs at the same time.
And I’m saying editors can get 1k+ a day without having to do both
It's depressing, yeah. I understand other tools--learning how to use a whole editing suite of tools is one thing, like color grading or effects layers and text and such, the sort of thing a lot of people want but call "motion graphics" and so on, sure. But the SEO/Metrics stuff is just frustrating, because it feels so obviously like they're asking for too much.

Thing is, if someone is asking a *video editor* to manage the SEO/Metrics/Marketing stuff then you need to reframe it in your mind. They aren't asking if you are a SEO professional, but if you can do what they think of as SEO/Metrics stuff, which basically means help them know if their video is getting traction and make sure it goes to the right places.

Whenever someone asks for some off-the-wall nonsense it's usually because they don't know what it is either. You can often bluff it back.

"Well, I know how to manage the SEO needs of a personal project, but for something like this for your company I'd need to be in contact with whoever manages your marketing front-end stuff." Which is true, you can't check the metrics if you don't have the dashboad or their account.

I've had people ask for stuff that they profoundly wouldn't want done, but sometimes you can't convince them, especially if they know a lot less than you. But you can always offer to help or collaborate with someone else on their team who does.
I went through that at my last job and honestly I think that’s a big part of why I was in the first round of lay offs. Didn’t know I needed to know metrics going in and they expected me to just know it and so no one helped me learn. What was crazy was we had people on the team who weren’t editors whose jobs were more focused on that and yet they still wanted the editors to be fluent in the metrics.
triggered…
You rang?
Alright, would you rather pay my ninja rate, my rockstar rate, or my wizard rate?
yeah, i do editing and Mograpg, but my motion is all text/bg type stuff. Think explainers with icon animations. I would not attempt a high end character animation piece, I know my limits, lol
This is the norm for the NYC commercial market, which is vastly bigger than LA’s.
You said the rates he mentioned were rare, unless I misread.  Common for my work too.  If you are happy with your rates my advice is not for you!
Well that’s why you’re not getting those rates then!
[deleted]
Honestly I wasn’t sure if I wanted the gig but after a couple weeks of seeing 10+ posts a day of lay offs and people unemployed as well as being incredibly depressed where I am, I wish I would’ve bluffed harder. I crushed the interview(s) but the last I heard was they had one more candidate who wasn’t able to schedule an interview yet. That was supposed to happen last week. The first time I spoke to them 6-7 weeks ago they expressed how quickly they wanted to move, and reiterated that at my in person interview 4 weeks ago. Now it’s been a month and they spent 3 weeks waiting for one other person to interview? Odds are they dicked around waiting for this last candidate and now can’t deal with the few weeks it’ll take for me to move. 

I don’t know why they even ask about SEO shit when they already have a marketing guy handling most of that, but it’s that typical “I’m the boss and I don’t understand anything you’ll be doing” bullshit. I think he asked me 3 times if I knew how to put music under dialogue.
Oh boy 26 days ago when I still had some hope of hearing back from said job. Now I’ve got an entirely new one that I’m currently giving up hope on!
Rare for combo jobs, the majority of jobs asking for combo work tend to be quite low and nightmare clients.
I’m getting those rates, my example range was the low end.
For sure. I cut for my studio during the day, and take on other edits during standby and off time. Yes, working more tends to make you more money.
In the same boat dude. Sent in a test edit the other day and hoping to hear back this week with good news at least getting me to the next stage.
Yeah that’s why part of my advice is once you inventory both and you detect your skills are cool, it’s the clients and you need to find better clients who understand the work and value the skill set and can afford to pay you what you deserve.  There’s a million crappy clients for all jobs but there’s enough good ones for the highly skilled to work with.
[deleted]
I had a great interview, immediately contacted to fill out some forms for the background check, guy I used to work for told me they contacted him the next week to ask about me. Now it’s just been silent for 2 weeks. Maybe it’s still a possibility but I’m very much on the side of businesses should have the deceny to tell you they aren’t giving you a job after a certain point. 3 interviews and I drive a total of 12 hours and get a hotel to meet with you? A simple status update and maybe a reason doesn’t seem like that big of an ask. And this one, what if there’s something wrong on my background check and they’re just ghosting me because of it? Shouldn’t you communicate to me if something came up? If something on my background check is preventing me from getting hired then that’s something I need to know. I can’t take it much longer I’ve spent the last 6 months straight being in hiring limbo and each job has fallen apart in a bullshit way.
I’m good, been at it for 20 years. I don’t deal with crappy clients anymore, which was the point of my reply.
Not really.
I don’t understand Reddit
I‘ve been on Reddit for 5 years. I’ve never said a single thing that could be considered offensive or even politically incorrect. Never argued with anyone. Not extremely active, but had a few comments that were upvoted and a few karma points. A week or so ago I commented on a request for a book recommendation and got a message saying the mod had deleted it because it was off topic. I felt like it had been on-topic based on the question, and just sent a very brief message to that effect, thinking it had been a mistake and hoping for a reconsideration.  I wasn’t snippy or argumentative in any way.  The mod  sent me a message about being respectful to the moderator. I just let it go (feeling a little puzzled).  Within a day or two, all my comments from all subreddits, from cooking to art to books to audio and video support topics, are gone, every new comment gets deleted by bots or simply never shows up. All old comments have disappeared, even previously upvoted ones. All karma gone. I don’t know what happened. It’s like this one mod went in and downvoted every comment I’d ever made anywhere on reddit. Can one mod disappear my whole history like that?
I will say, reddit moderators are often arrogant snobs drunk on their own power. I've had some ban me from subs before for literally no reason, some when prompted even admitted so but refused to unban me afterwards. Even appealing to other moderators didn't help, even after said mods were themselves removed from the group.

And these subs range from big to small. That's just how reddit is. Moderators have absolutely no oversight and just do as they please.
I think there is a sub called ‘Am I Shadowbanned.’ Maybe it’s something like that. They can check for you
Mods have no ability to do anything outside of their own subreddit. They can't do anything to your account, karma, or posts and comments from other subreddits. 

Sounds like this is a bug, and you can submit a report here:

https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205687083-How-do-I-report-a-bug
It looks like three things are happening at once:

* You encountered a site bug that lost your old comments, as supported by the fact that it happened to another user around the same time. The site admins are who you need to speak to about that. Perhaps they can be recovered, or will reappear when the bug is corrected, but first the admins must be made aware of it. This is best done through a bug report.
* By what appears to be a coincidence, you also encountered a not-so-great moderator, or perhaps caught that one on a bad day. For busier mods with large workloads, clearing the modqueue, which just means responding to all the user reports filed in the subreddits they moderate, can be a tedious and exhausting task, and one foul user interaction can set the tone for a moderator's following interactions with users without them intending it to. I do not believe this encounter is related to your missing comments.
* Your comments going missing also removed your karma, which is required in many subreddits as a way to combat trolls, since creating a new account takes mere seconds. This is why your new comments are being removed automatically.

So basically it looks like a run of bad luck. Once you regain sufficient karma or get your missing comments reinstated, things should return to normal for you.
when moderators arent cooperative then it might be time to say goodbye to the subreddit because moderators can do what they want in their subreddit.

***this can happen with no fault of your own.***

(edit: was was here isnt anymore)

sometimes they reconsider, but mostly not
I like to find a way to delete all my comments permanently- is there such an option? On Reddit account.
Subreddits hand out moderator to people who shouldn't be trusted to run a bath let alone a forum.
Hope you get it figured out! If you're still looking, Starter Villain is a good fun book
I had a mod ban me from replying on r/pics I haven’t a clue as to what was offensive or wrong
I don't understand reddit either for a different reason like why reddit decides to permaban us by mistake
I'm having a problem too.  Yesterday a mod removed my post saying it wasn't related to the topic. The topic was Medicaid and my post was about Medicare and Medicaid,  so it was related. Now reddit is reviewing all my posts manually before posting. Just before this they blocked some of my posts, saying the posts had "low karma." What on earth is that supposed to mean? My posts were not negative in any way. Just some innocuous comments and questions.
Some mods get on a power trip. It's sad.
No, one moderator can't do that or cause it to happen.  It sounds like you have logged into a different account you did not know you made.  Check your username and make sure it is exactly identical.
nope they can't
I still see your comments, OP.
Reddit mods can't delete your comments, unless all your comments were in like 5 subs that all happened to have the same moderator. 

I've said this before and I'll say it again. If you want an enjoyable reddit experience, stay away from subs with more than a million members
I hate this place so what else is new
Well, I just made a harmless comment in a sub once and received a permaban out of nowhere without any sufficient explanation. Upon request why it happened and asking for more details, I received only a conformation without any further explanation.

My tip: Just give it up, I feel like a lot of mods are just political activists who want to brainwash you by enforcing certain behaviour. Thus you might wanna consider leaving reddit for good...
ngl i agree. reddit is hard for me too, idk how the karma works and i get my posts deleted all the time. looks like there are millions of people on here but im legit watching youtube videos to figure it out
Some subs will permaban you automatically just for commenting in another sub. That should give you an idea of how psycho mods can be
[deleted]
This happened to me; I contacted a mod and they said I had been misidentified as a bot. I was pretty new so they were able to restore my karma 

Edit : they did restore my comments but it took a while and there were only a dozen or so at that point
Isn’t that a shadowban or temporary suspension? u/liberty91362 ik karma & comments temporarily disappear when you’re shadowbanned. Maybe you should check on r/ShadowBan
To summarize: Reddit is weird because it lets mods act like this. The amount of hoops you have to jump through to participate in some subs is ridiculous. I guess because mods aren't paid, the majority of them decided that this small amount of power would be their payment.
I got banned yesterday because I referred to a being  in the womb as a baby and not a fetus. There wasn’t event a precedent anyone set that I bucked or anything. I inquired why. Mod said I was a misogynist, manipulative, and something else, and gave me a lecture about something, something, whatever and banned me from responding to her for three days. She. Was. Unhinged. I muted that sub so I’d never see it again, permanently banned or not. I am a woman who has supported equal rights for women since the 80s.

I even got banned for commenting for the first time on a post in a completely different sub, and had never even heard of the sub that banned me! Funnily enough. I didn’t even know the sub I’d posted on. I saw the title, posted, then after I got banned by the second sub, went back and read the name of the first sub. I’m still flabbergasted about that. 

Kudos and thanks to good mods but some of them, oof!
I got banned and called homophobic on the MLP group for typing "I'm not fan of those rainbow things but it still looks cute" under the post where jesus was hugging Rainbow Dash. It was in the June...
If everything is gone and they obviously have you red-flagged or something, just create a new account.  F’€k ‘em.
I might have "low karma" because I stated that I am Buddhist on an anti-Buddhist sub reddit.  I got several nasty replies from posters, even though i didnt say anything inappropriate  or against any reddit policy, but simply because they don't like my religion. Bigotry is actually encouraged on this sub reddit. Not fair!
I got temp banned for REPORTING a comment that literally broke one of the rules in a sub I was in, and it was at "moderator's discretion". The comment I reported was literally against the rules and somehow I got a site-wide ban because of this one little c word.
I’m banned on several sub reddits ,if they don’t like what you are saying your gone , I have also been permanently banned three times but was successful with all of my appeals.Now I am very careful not to lose my temper.Don’t say anything they might see as hateful or racist and don’t promote violence of any kind ,in other words,don’t even agree with it .If someone chooses to be a jerk whether in the commenting section or messages just block or report them.
I don’t understand Reddit either 🤷🏼‍♂️
I was banned from the anti tipping sub for posting a meme of Cheap Pete tipping 50 cents and saying "Good lord, that's a lot of money."  Totally worth it.
You are shadowbanned my friend
Reading this post cursed me because I just got banned from 2 sub reddits I haven’t even joined because I’ve apparently been harassing people in other subreddits. Which, what? I give a bit of tough love on AITA occasionally but that’s it
That will teach you your lesson, now go to the corner and think about what you did.

(just kidding) this reminds me when I first joined Reddit like 3 years ago and it was madness with crazy mods banning all who they thought was a bigot, that and the new policy against APY caused a lot of users to leave the site, dont feel bad, Reddit can be like that sometimes.
>Can one mod disappear my whole history like that?

No. Reddit moderators only have power within the subs they moderate. With how many already use their power incorrectly and with reckless abandon, this is for the best. 

Whatever issue you're seeing, I doubt it's a moderator unless you've exclusively posted in one sub or something.
I'm an ancient one from bulletin boards, listserv, livejournal...

That old bully mentality thrives on reddit. In my time, I've made 2 posts, only a handful of comments. I honestly just read gaming and gardening posts. I found a community called UnsentLetters and wanted to write a post to that. Then I figured might as well post a weird experience to a poly group for feedback (somebody doesn't like my weird experience so they're downvoting lol). I'm likely not writing another post anywhere for another couple years.

One person - needn't be a mod - can organize enough people to remove you from the platform. I'm not worried about a few petty downvotes. Mostly, I do not want to be caught up in any residual gamergate nonsense.

I've survived a couple years here keeping my head down.
Got banned from some sub, asked the mod what rule I had broken, got a message that they had a bad day and got unbanned.
Looks like mod does not like you.
Maybe a change of name
Have I made a comment?
That sucks and must be frustrating. Reddit is far from perfect. I get a reoccurring bug recently where when I post a link to a video reddit tells me it has been removed because of 'reddit filters'. Then in a day or so the post shows up anyway. Thought I was shadowbanned or something but I couldn't imagine why. Your issue does seem weirdly targeted though ngl.
It isn't reddit, it's people.

Some people are good, nice, caring and others aren't.
I have been banned when I clearly did not break the rules, and they still cursed me out. I leave a bad review on Reddit app. If an app has too many bad reviews then they gotta do something to fix the issue if they want to stay available for download
Your oldest comment on this account was made 23 days ago. If you have made any other comments older than that then you have deleted them yourself. Moderators can't delete your comment history.
Agree with this.
Some Mods are very specific as to who they really want on their subs. What they say their rules are and what they really are are two different things. They don't like you, they'll go after you. Fact of Reddit.
Try having an opinion about crypto, in a crypto sub. Your house might blow up.
That's because reddit is garbage and there aren't any good alternatives.
Some moderators are pathetic individuals who are unpaid employees with no lives that crave authority and power. They are individuals who are prone to abusing their authority. And they have no accountability whatsoever. Some will ban you just because they don't like what you say. It is unfair and we just tolerate it. 

I myself was recently banned from a subreddit for a comment I made over a week ago. The reality is, the comment did not violate any rules. It was just a rule the moderator could stretch and very loosely apply because they simply didn't like what I said when they banned me. They went digging and that was the best they had. I am only speculating. That has happened to me before. Last time a subreddit banned me it was a comment from 6 months prior to the ban. 

It is the harsh reality of this platform. Moderators have no accountability. There is no due process. No facing your accuser in court. No arguing your case. And unfair punishment even if you did break the rules. And you can be banned for really doing nothing wrong and just saying something a mod dislikes. 

I don't think permanent bans should exist at all. They certainly shouldn't be the first thing mods jump to. Banned for life... over a mod being terrible? From the whole site over some mistakes or even admins unfairly applying rules? It is excessive. A life sentence. Technically. 

Anyway, I wouldn't respect the rules of this place too much.
That's very weird. No idea how or why this happened to you & I have no advice either but I hope someone else can help, good luck ❤️
Just reddit. A cesspool. I honestly forget why im even here anymore.
FREE liberty91362! FREE  MY MAN. JUSTICE FOR REDDITOR-NON REDDITORS!
Agreed, literally makes this app so boring.
I was banned permanently from a sub and still don’t know why.
TL:DR
I think you can appeal if they think it's your first offence or something small or just plain weird.

But hey, I would say that you are not alone bud, this place is weird and hard to understand sometimes :)
Had a similar incident happen over on the Alienware one. Went to post a question, got a bot response back that my account was either negative Karma or a spam account, (neither of which is remotely true), so I massaged back with the link below the response, explaining that that's not possible, and a thing that did happen to me on reddit once, none of which was remotely angry.


I get a snippy response back about how I should fully read messages before responding, (which I did by the way. Were they hiding in my house watching me read it and just assuming that I don't know how to, or just jump to anger within a couple words of something, not understand context?). Was just gonna let that one go, because is just sounded like policy.


Then whoever the mod was sent another message, getting personal with me about me coming in there with my anger and how nobody appreciates it. Wasn't angry, until then. Replied with a piece or two of my mind, (still being as  respectful and non belligerent as one can while doing so, because I don't think it's in a mods job description to make assumptions and come at someone in a personal manner), they mute me for 30 days so I can't report what they did, and permanently banned me from Alienware.


Reported this to Reddit, haven't heard anything back. Seems like it's just ok for mods to be personal and abusive with not only their words, but power.
This happened to me before.
Reddit shreddit.
Just depends which way the wind blows in here . 
X is better .
It's not just reddit, it's everywhere.. people who have really boring lives get mod status on some random little island in the internet and think they are a king.. sorry to hear that happened to you, sounds unreasonable as hell
I just started using it myself and have been struggling to even be part of a sub. It’s extremely hard to get karma to even comment and interact with communities.
Yeah reddit is weird an I even opened up a reddit for just me and just about me and it was deleted and or muted or whatever.  How can someone do this when it is just about me?
It's reddit. Sometimes people will read a question or statement wrong and run with it. Also mob mentality. It's happened where I'd misread a comment and asked a question. First few comments were cool most twisted my words and went bananas putting me down while saying I did that.
There is no way you have been on reddit for five years and are only now realizing mods are/can be power tripping individuals.
Nobody does anymore. 


I've been on since 2008. 




I got banned from cats. My name is kat. I love cats. My bed is cat pillows.




Let it roll. Go out and get sunshine and care not about Internet people.




Hugs. 
If you are not satisfied with how you are treated, you can contact Reddit. There are mods for the subs, but they have  the same rules as everyone else. Reddit goes to great lengths to insure users are treated fairly. Reach out , be specific, include links and or screenshots. Good luck, and I am sure this can be resolved.
Don't worry too much about it.  It is annoying, but it speaks more about them than you.  Just be glad they saved you time by doing this sooner rather than later. 
It's the mods who are destroying this platform. I rarely if ever post anything on here except to my own little subreddit.
Reddit moderators have reputation as highly pompous inviduals. I got shadow banned once when leaving rather neutral comment about European immigration crisis in 2016. Didn't realize it for a while, just wondered why nobody was replying to my messages anymore.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/)
Make a new account?
I feel you. I had a “mod” ban me for not adhering to their political view. No, I didn’t say anything that other people in the same community don’t already say. In fact, I’ve seen worst comments not getting banned! Such as insults and profanity. 

This and the fact that when you want to contest it the SAME “mod” has to approve the removal of the ban is just insane. Something needs to change to keep people from abusing their position. 

just a by the way, the same moderator that banned me from that community also called me “dumb”. Amazing 😂
Yes they can do that, at least on the subreddits they moderate. They did it to me.
reddit man
Reddit is a shadow of her former self. A group of mods control most of the popular sub reddits and will ban most users who don’t align with their views

The group also mass-reports accounts, communities, etc they don’t agree with 

They want this realm to revolve around them as they are selfish, narcissistic egocentrics
some mods are too sensitive or too arrogant
I suppose a mod should only be able to moderate his own subreddit.
Can somebody help me understand how to change my Reddit name as it shows with my avatar. As I accidentally misspelled the name and I wanted to correct it. 

Thank you to anybody who can assist me. I keep troubleshooting around and looking on my Reddit profile for different ways to do it, but it seems like I can't without having to create a new account.
I am trying to correct my name on my profile for Reddit, the one that shows up with my avatar that is spelled Celticmul... I didn't realize that I had misspelled it.  I should have double L at the end of the username. 
I have tried to troubleshoot on my own through my Reddit profile, but to no avail! I'm wondering if anyone can help assist me in this effort?! It seems as though the only way I can do it is to start a new account, which I'm trying to avoid.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you to those who can help!🙏
Same. Tried to create a thread about a question in two different groups, both got rejected and apparently I am not worthy to say anything. Basiacally read and keep your mouth shut.
My first account was banned because I posted an entirely green picture on r/red tagged “Destruction 100”.

  
At least that’s why I think I got banned. I did nothing else I can remember that warranted it.
Tbh if I were you I would just create a new account. Was what you faced unfair and unjust? Yes, but when you think about it, its just not worth the effort to argue / fight with people who basically run the site. Trust karma to get back at them.
Immsorry that gapped. I don’t know much about Reddit myself but I’m always surprised to learn how much power downvoting and mods have.
Yep. It's messed up. It's almost worse than fbook
Don't know about whole history, but I was banned from a sub for saying that someone that hasn't got 500+ karma should be allowed to post, and that just because they're not super active doesn't mean they're a troll
I agree, many of my post have been deleted because of shaming , or doesn't go with reddit rules.  I guess when you answer a question honestly, or write a post they / mod interpret it as wrong.
Yep, moderators can just completely abuse their power just because they were 'there first' and you can get rid of them and you can't do anything about them perma banning you 
I got banned from a book one. The mods said my comment (a quote from the book being discussed) was offensive 🤣🤣🤣
But mods have ZERO ability to delete comments on any sub other than their own. What happened to OP beyond the book comment has nothing to do with mods and more likely an account issue.
Not just often, almost always or always depending on the sub
AMAB
Amen… thank you.., I thought I was the only one….isn’t this a business?? And you need consumers so you have a hBusiness…..so why alienate decent, kind human beings bc you’ve got some superiority complex and get off on raining on someone’s parade bc you know you will never have one.. it’s just disgusting bc this is suppose to be💔💔
Tripping over their egos.
I got banned from a sub this evening over a post because the sub doesn't allow anything involving the paranormal. I never mentioned anything involving ghosts. Probably permanently banned now because I shot off a message to oneof the mods about jumping to conclusions. Seriously just couldn't find my kids ball where it should have been. Threw it over her head and saw it roll unde the pavilion. We both searched for it and couldn't find it. It was really weird. I never said ghosts were haunting my backyad.
Yeah, same thing happened to me was never rude in the least bit, never said anything offensive. I was actually posting a story that could help someone. Because I have went through the same thing. And they flagged it, and then when I asked them to explain. Why did you flag it? The moderator was so rude and harrassing. And then the staff told me? Oh well, your account can be banned and I said if you look at what's posted. I was never rude, or harassing in the least bit, but they were. And they're allowed to be. And I'm like that's not against the rules.
This.
I got perma banned for spreading 'misinformation' in a mobile game subreddit just for saying one character is stronger than another 
You can check by copying the url, signing out and deleting cookies (or use another browser) and then pasting in the url again, if your comment is not there, you are shadowbanned.
Removing all his posts ain’t no shadow.

The admins are just as bad as the mods honestly.
This is the right answer.
But in the r/Bangladesh sub, if you comment or react with certain subs, they will ban you. Isn't that doing something outside of their sub?
Nope. I made a comment on a sub and got auto banned from a bunch of pet subs. 




I contested with pictures of me and my cats and dog and my animal first aid certificate. 




It took a minute, but I can now comment on cats. 
That's false. The admins can get the mods to do things 
When posts are deleted, they do not affect your karma, negative or positive.
This is very helpful, and should be higher up.
Yeah what a 'coincidence' that there was a not so great moderator..I'm sure there's not many of those 
There is a Reddit add-on called delete suite. I use it every once in a while just to do a clean sweep.
robot
I would file a complaint with Reddit and also leave Reddit a negative review on apps (android or iOS). Reddit gets taken down if they get too many bad reviews, that is the only way to make them do something about it
Very similar to my problem. It’s insanely easy to run afoul of a moderator and then you can no longer comment anywhere on Reddit. It feels like grade school. 
Reddit is comprised of Subreddits. Subreddits are created by Moderators, who develop and implement Subreddit rules.

Subredditors (you and I are Subredditors of the r/Help Subreddit) must abide by the established rules of this and all Subreddits we contribute to.

# Subreddit Moderation

A Moderator is in control of their Subreddit and ensures adherence to all rules of their Subreddit and Reddits' Policies. Some Moderators may require:

■ 200 + karma before allowing a post / comment.

■ due diligence on various aspects of your entire profile, or your posts / comments (which could also trigger automatic deletions of a post / comment).

■ that you are automatically banned due to  posts / comments that you submitted to another Subreddit.

■ the use of AutoModerators (AutoMods) to assist them in performing Moderators' duties.

■ that your posts / comments are not inundated with negative (re: down votes) karma. 

■ that you are verified (make sure the correct email is attached to your account). 

• Verify you have the correct passwords for Reddit and your email account. 

• It's the only way to recover from certain issues (if something were to happen to your Reddit account). It's how Reddit knows it's you.

# (1) Tools

Moderators use certain tools and mechanisms to try to track (and ultimately limit) who has access to their Subreddits. 

There are many other types of checks / balances used by certain Moderators. 

Not all Moderators are interested in these types of mechanisms or actually use them. You will learn more about them as you experience everything Reddit has to offer.

#(2) Code of Conduct

All Moderators must adhere to the [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct). Utilize this link to report all suspected [Moderator Code of Conduct Violations](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

# What Can You Do?

How can you help yourself be a better Redditor? Try taking the following steps:

■ You should start to concentrate on contributing posts and making comments to obtain more karma. Maybe try posting about a variety of topics to get exposure to more Subredditors (who will then provide karma by up voting your contributions).

■ Treat all Subreddits and Subredditors with respect to avoid possible consequences. Try not to provoke implementation of a rule violation, restrictions, or other negative actions placed on your account from Moderators or others in the Reddit community. 

■ Read all rules of any Subreddit before making a post / comment to avoid a possible violation.

# Policies and Guidelines 

Be respectful and mindful of the following policies: 

■ [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

■  [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette).

■ [Reddit User Agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement).

■ [Reddit Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy).

A combination of all of the above steps will help signify to the Reddit community at large (and specifically, to Subreddits and their Moderators that check these types of things), that you have an established account and are a great Reddit contributor.

# Helpful Subreddits

There are some helpful Subreddits that you can access and explore in order to learn about Reddit; and increase your karma (while contributing posts / comments).

■ [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/fSpbLwbG7f) created to ask and answer all sorts of questions. It's one of the most popular and active communities on Reddit.

■ [r/findareddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/s/VfTmt0P8LM) enbles you to actually find Subreddits of interest. Post what you are looking for here, and someone will suggest a community for you.

■ [General New User Wiki](https://reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/w/index/faq?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Questions from the community with responses from other Redditors.

■ [r/LearntoReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/t5_5078wg/s/OeBF4UqJR2). A community for Redditors to learn how to use Reddit either our guides, and to test post to practice. 

■  [r/NewToReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/s/9MLDxo4Mrk) - Unofficial help community for all Redditors to ask and learn about Redditing. It is especially useful for newbies. It was created for Redditors to learn about the Reddit experience. It is especially useful for "newbies".

■ [New-User Friendly Subdeddits List](https://reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/w/index/newusersubs?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). This list contains Subreddits with low to no restrictions.

■ [r/NoStupidQuestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/s/BvVtsbpaHR). Ask your questions - no question is too stupid.

# What is an Established Account?

An established account is a new chat restriction reddit has rolled out. This is the description of an established account:

>*"Established accounts include a variety of signals such as a verified email or phone number, a history of good contributions, and past enforcement actions taken on a user’s accounts."*

# Content Quality Score (CQS)

Personally?

I don't really know what qualifies as a "good contribution". 

Who does? It's really subjective to the Subredditor who is responding to your posts / comments. 

Every single time a Subreadditor actually sees a post / comment that you created? They have the option to:

■ down vote | ■ not respond | ■ respond |
:-------------:|------------------|:------------:|
■ ignore        | ■ read                | ■ up vote

However? The requirements most likely correlate to your [Content Quality Score (CQS) - click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatIsMyCQS).

You can check your CQS score at the site link above. Create a post and you will discover your score!

Reddit is evolving.
> My tip: Just give it up,

No.  I tried that already. And to me it means giving up on reddit.  

I think it needs to be talked about - just a little. It isn't only "their" problem. If they just "give up" it doesn't help the rest of us.
Wow, you guys. After I posted here yesterday I got so many comments and votes it’s like it broke my curse. Suddenly people are actually reading one of my comments and replying and I have a bunch of Karma. So thanks. This appears to be the magical happy subreddit for me. Maybe all my posts won’t be auto deleted going forward.
> I got banned yesterday because I referred to a being in the womb as a baby and not a fetus.

Mate, anyone can check your comment history (unless you go back and delete or edit it now, anyway) and see that you've been going a lot further than that. Over on /r/AskOldPeopleAdvice, it looks a lot like you were replying to a woman who'd had an abortion, trying to shame and guilt-trip her over it.

There are lots of bad moderators on this site. You don't need to twist a story to make that point.
Could you explain: what do you mean by shaddow banned ?

I can read their post fine. 

I do have, at this moment some very strong concerns. a) There is way too much punishment b) You can not get anything approximating a fair hearing 

To me - not being able to even get a hearing IS  a serious problem a complete erosion of human rights.  And that IS largely because Reddit has willed it/allowed it to be like this.

Let me point out, I am a moderator of one sub - one that simply does not or at least very rarely has banned anyone..  

But moderators have "power." No one less does.  

In my case, I did nothing wrong to begin with but I can not get a fair hearing. Period.  It's now headed toward 60 days without even a hearing.
That's not a bug.

Whatever you are posting is triggering the auto-mod to remove your post, but then a mod goes thru the list of auto-mod and manually approves it.
Reddit is not going to get pulled from any app stores anytime soon.  People type reddit at the end of their searches when they want a straightforward answer for any kind of technical issue.  Unless that changes, it will stay on the app stores
I got rid of a few recent ones because I was notified they’d been rejected. But there are some years old that are missing 
FWIW, the OP isn't shadowbanned, but you are.
Facebook is the same.
Every ban includes a message specifically showing you the comment which warranted the action. Read it and that's the "why"
I got permanently banned from a subreddit for making a true observation about immigration and being diametrically opposed to the host nations way of life.  Seemed like common sense to me.  But it got me banned.
follow me on X @HouseLyndseyRN 😃
I agree with this   !!!
From my experience (in the comments) talking politics is the quickest way to get anyone banned here.
How did you get another account??
I can’t make a new account because they won’t delete the old one I have there blocking me from deleting it. Pretty said because it was a post where I was reaching out for help in a crisis situation and they banned me.
I got banned from a sub for quoting someone's offensive title.
I recently had a negative experience where I was discussing a conflict with someone on  R\politics. I only posted one comment that was advocating for peace, but people started insulting me, calling me names such as "Russian" and "Ivan." Despite the insults, the moderator banned me while the offensive comments remained visible. They even made horrible accusations against me regarding acting against women in the worst way and other, such comments, which I can't say here. 
I want to emphasize that I never engage in insulting, rude behaviour, group thinking, or mocking others. As people can see from my comments.  

All these people stayed active in the group on r\politics. I highly assume the mod somehow supports the war or is politically biased 
Never in a million years would I believe one comment calling for peace would make me the bad guy. Yet mods do choose sides even in this situation.
Except if it was a "super mod". A handful of mods control a huge number of subreddits. Piss one off, and they can go after you in every other sub they control.
Assigned moderator at birth?
Yep, I straight up got harassed and stalked by a moderator for a while, Reddit looked into it (apparently) and concluded there was no harassment.
It's a double standard for sure! Do as I say not as I do!!
That’s a lot of steps. Just use a private viewing tab.
Nerds
Yup. I'm one of them. I dared to disagree with a mod. Still playing games with me 1.5 years later. It's a pretty serious support group too. Been booted from a few of them for speaking my truth. I'm probably a tad more offensive though.
This is wild!  How do we know?
Seriously this!
Well not really. Banning you from their subreddit based on your activity in other subreddits isn't going outside of their sub. They're doing something is their sub based on outside reasons but it's still withing their sub

Think of it like a shopkeeper banning someone from their store because they saw that person stealing from a different store (dont come at me for the analogy it doesnt need to be perfect 😂). They don't have the ability to ban them from the store that they were actually stealing from, but they have the right to ban anyone from their own store for whatever reason they want, even if that reason comes from outside of the store
This is true when the site is functioning as intended, but if we’re talking about a bug that wiped every comment the user made, it’s possible it also reset their karma.
May I ask the rationale behind this? On a few occasions I've had conversations or witnessed conversations with people answering questions and explaining things, and then weeks later I'll need that info again and come back and "comment deleted by user" and I always wonder why

I don't even delete comments when I accidentally give wildly inaccurate information, I just edit it to clarify and leave it up for posterity
Where to download this?
How ?
r/pics is ran by volunteers, not employees. Leaving a bad review will do nothing but suit yourself.
Mods can’t do that though
r/AskReddit deleted my question about how to add Text to an Image post so it's not useful at all. Had to ask the question here.
This is helpful. Have no idea why you got downvoted. Often Reddit can be weird but that’s a user issue and mods are also users. Some are going to be fairer than others, and some might even abuse their powers. Unfortunately it all depends on who you encounter. For the most part, I’ve found many mods are decent - especially if you keep your head low - but really again it depends on the sub and the person. A good clue is to get a sense of the culture first, although I admit I also came into Reddit a little naively too.

Hope it gets sorted OP.
I already knew that, that people can look up comments. I do it. And  no I wasn’t trying to shame her. Can you actually read? Because I pointed out a flaw in her reasoning and asked her to make an even stronger one? How’s that guilting and shaming? You git triggered because I used the word baby too I see. Shoot me. 

I pointed out the weakness, **not even the flaw, the weakness** in her argument and said in next time, she can do better? Her argument was weak, and I pointed that out. 

And no, **she wasn’t focusing on her own abortion so I wasn’t focusing on her own abortion either.**  She focused on people who didn’t agree with her more-so than any effects of her own abortion on herself. So why are you concerned about any effect my use of the word baby had on her? **Again, I asked her to strengthen her argument**. Had she been discussing how affected she was by her abortion, I wouldn’t have din it. She mention her own abortion almost as an afterthought. If people can find my comment, they can find her post too. Of course those people will have their own opinions, and some will have opinions about whether I attempted to shame her by using the word baby once. 

Sorry, but I don’t spend so much of my time thinking about the topic of abortion that I automatically reach for the term fetus. I do spend more time talking about their babies/grandchildren so that term came to mind, **when asking OP to make her argument better.” **Weird way to shame anyone.** 

Still, didn’t know that I _had_ to say fetus instead of baby as the OP said neither term. 

So stuff your opinion I tried to guilt trip her.

**I don’t address other people’s past choices on abortion, as in I don’t shame them about it. Their abortion is not my business, and I would and have comforted people over that choice. Even here on Reddit. Why don’t you look _that_ up?! Her post was present as an activist argument, and I addressed it as such.** so again, no shame over her personal choice, but I did find where anti-abortion activists could quickly rebut her arguments, and told her so, so she can have better ones next time. Because I see some of Reddit as a debate forum and we can learn improve with debate. **Which is why SAID I was playing Devil’s Advocate.**

Seems some people want an echo chamber, not a debate nowadays. Sorry , I didn’t get that memo. 


I’m not a supporter, but I’m not an activist either. so it was easy to spot where someone else who isn’t could find fault, but OP’s post had the tone of argument, not personal experience. Don’t put it out there if you don’t want feedback. I provided feedback and asked her to strengthen her argument. 

ETA:  So did you dox everyone else or just me. Seems it’s your biases that are showing. 

Note:  Last paragraph was misplaced. Incomplete, and is a repeat. I thought I cut before posting. I left it to. E transparent because you know who wants to play gotcha.
yep      

can confirm as I've been on both ends of that
They might get the worse answers then. I have seen plenty of terrible advices on Reddit. I would rather search on Quora
If you're receiving notifications that your posts were rejected that means you haven't been shadowbanned, which is good. It seems that whatever caused your previous comments to get removed has been resolved. 

Some of your posts might get rejected until you build back up your karma. It's only at 44 which is below the limit for some subreddits. If you get another rejection notification you could message the mods in that subreddit and politely ask them to manually approve it. Usually the karma limit is for the purpose of avoiding spam. Sometimes it's set for other reasons, but if it's just for spam filtering then they'll likely approve your posts.
In general, deleting content when it gets removed isn't the best idea, because there are lots of ways a post and comment can be removed -- including just temporarily until a moderator double-checks it; and including by accident. If you ask a moderator for help, they can look into what happened, but only if you didn't delete it. Once you delete it, it's gone, and so are most of the records related to it.

The site will let moderators see how and why your content was removed (e.g. manually or automatically; by mods or by admins), but it won't always tell you.
Following . Keep on fighting . 👍
Different email
I quoted the insults someone sent me and continued "Why the insults,  let's be civil hey, I'm willing to have a debate here " I got banned for 24 hrs, while they stayed active as I saw after I returned a day later.
Mods are mostly definitely biased, but they shouldn't be.
I suppose Ukraine. Ukraine is in a phase where it gets tired of war, which leads to a peace with the current borders. As those borders are unfavorable for Ukraine, Ukraine tries to prevent the war fatigue as long as possible, in hope of regaining territory. Therefore, anything that increase war fatigue, like calling for peace, is highly unwelcome.
That's wild. It makes me wonder what they'd have done if you'd said you thought the war was a good thing and should continue? Some mods are on a power trip ;(
 This period I will check the issue but don't trust nobody else if you have seen the right 👍
Yep, got banned from a group of ‘ask’ subs yesterday because of a word I used in one. Not a slur mind you, a word. Muted them so they’ll never be posted for me again.
I've been running into the same thing on a number of Destiny subreddits and I've been banned from Bungie's own "help" because I lost my cool with a one of their so called mentors. 

Now I get similar acts to silence me across various media.  It's entirely aggravating.
Haha super mod
All Mods Are
🤣🤣🤣
Wow are you serious, that's not okay like is this what they stand for.
This made me lol 😂
That's still interfering with another sub. The point isn't to keep you out of their sub. It's to control the population of people who comment in other subs.
idk why you were downvoted. especially consider op's account rn only has the amount that i assume is from this post and maybe a comment or two, you're prob right that the rest was removed when the glitch removed the comments.
Probably because they don't like other people going through their old stuff
# r/PowerDeleteSuite
# r/PowerDeleteSuite
Reddit is responsible to keep everything running, they got admins for a reason. Admins are paid and they do nothing about it. Mods should not be untouchable
Your posts and comments are showing up. I just checked.

A Subreddit Moderator can't make every single post / comment you made on Reddit disappear.

Subreddit Moderators can only control posts / comments in their Subreddits.

Other Subreddits have other Moderators.

Before contributing to a Subreddit? Read all of the rules of the Subreddit to make sure you are aware of specific rules related to a specific Subreddit.
You're calling me "triggered" when you just wrote ten paragraphs hulk-raging at me with bold font, bro. You're also trying to have your cake and eat it too with the goalposts you're moving: you're now insisting that you were "refuting her argument" but you're also still trying to downplay your remarks as "using a word."

You're accusing me of "doxxing" you when all I did was spend a few minutes looking at your public profile. You mentioned that this incident happened just the other day, so I figured, "Hey, in about three minutes, either I can learn I should avoid a particular subreddit, or I can learn this guy's lying." I read a thing that you said, got curious, and went to look for easily accessible information about it, and you are trying to belittle me for that. Clearly none of what you're doing has anything to do with reasoned and accurate debate.

You are unhinged. Ciao.
Thanks for the advice. I don’t think it’s really worth the time and all the hoops we have to jump through. I’ve posted some really useful and labor-intensive comments that have been rejected, and a few well-received ones that have evaporated. It’s disheartening, to say the least. I’m going to invest a lot less time here in the future.
I got "warned" of a ban from a T-mobile sub. A customer was confused and asked a question, which was answered by telling him he's stupid. I pointed out how nasty that was and got warned, so I wasn't sticking around after the "warning". There's a bunch of T-mobile subs, so the power trip was... odd. But that one was just a bunch of employees who can't say what they want to customers at work.

Most likely agreed, propaganda is strong when it comes to Urk and Irseal. People didn't think about what was happening right now or what happened to the nations or innocent people. The worst thing they don't even notice the escalation, sadly.
What do you mean don't trust the right? Go there and make a  comment like mine or even say, " You want both sides to stop fighting and come to an agreement."See what happens on r\ politics. 
I'm down the middle of politics and agree with both sides on issues. Sadly, the left is the side  I see acting up the most while the so-called right debates mostly instead.  Mostly down to an age difference and life experience. 
In other matters, even a single point agreeing with Nigel Ferrarage's services is overstretched, which is true. He got a backlash with really nasty insults. , he gets name-calling, like "Naz... "Far right," add insult. "
As it's mostly kids or teens who leave, you look at the demographics. So one gets teen or kid behaviour sadly. Usually, people change in their mid 30's say 35 onwards, to more conservative values as they have learnt the system and know how it affects them. Instead of parents or uni days or mid-20s while at home or renting. 
It's impossible to be down the middle anymore, sadly.  We see the " so-called right " pointing out COVID had issues and the left claimed sadly were killing people,  evil, old people killers etc, see the Hamas marchers now all crossing Europe and the violence smashing up banks, acting police when they arrest like Manchester only a few days ago.
It's hard to call people like that civil or truthful.
I for one do not know what "don't trust nobody else if you have seen the right" means, and also it looks as if Shot Cupcake might have misunderstood it.
Happy Cake Day!
What was the word?
are you having trouble viewing mine too? i know you said Destiny- she’s my “twin” 💯😁

Mods are not untouchable. There is a moderator code of conduct. I myself have gotten moderators from very large subreddits demodded by admin and even suspended from this site. With both modcoc reports and regular reports.
I agree - they shouldn't. However, nobody has the resources to  keep up with the drama or employ someone to keep up with the drama.
Hmm, you didn’t address whether you looked other people up too after I asked you, whether you want to call you reporting back to the post what I in particular discussed. Why me? It’s your politics that had you respond like that, so you can have your politics, but I can’t. Gotcha. 

And again, I’m not a bro or a mate, and I already said so. This is offensive. So you really can’t read, or you just ignore what doesn’t fit your view or reality regardless of people’s preferences. Gotcha. 


I wrote what I did but because I’m triggered but to untwist your words. I took the time I needed to do that, and bolder to make it easy to skim all that. I guess you’re a minds reader now too  as to my motives about using bold. A TLDR which I would’ve used except I accidentally posted and lost my train of thought. I mentioned that in my ETA too.

So goodbye mind reader.
I guess that's customer support, always be polite. All it takes is a video of an employee insulting a customer, and it can cost the company a lot of customers,  money or reputation loss.
People try to provoke employees even these days. But working in the field of psychology as I do now, I have noticed that society is becoming ruder. It used to be understood that people were polite and the customer was always right, but sadly people are abusing that now for attention or just because they are rude. I still wouldn't react to such a person. It's not worth my time. 
When I was in college, I used to walk away and refuse to serve them when they came into the shop. Working in bars can be even worse; you develop a very thick skin doing that.
This place is a mess.
Propaganda has always influenced wars but never so much as nowadays. I once read a book that made the point if the ones who promoted the war were on the front line things would be different. There's also something to be said for the time when swords were the most advanced weapons. Getting up close to kill and pushing a button to kill unseen people are very different.

Or maybe each side/country chooses a representative and they fight to the death. No long range weapons, guns etc, just two men fighting it out. That way there's only one or maybe two casualties. I don't think humans can ever be peaceful, at least without a huge change in the way we think
Happy Cake Day!
Thank you!
Mod chewed me out for saying *baby*. Like once or twice. I didn’t use the word *fetus*. 

I so seldom use the word *fetus*. It’s not as if I was correcting OP. She hadn’t used either baby or fetus herself IIRC.
Oh, I have no idea. I don't think so
I did look up other people. The users I picked, in the time that I had, were bilingual, and I am not, so I wasn't able to find the comments they were talking about.

> I wrote what I did but because I’m triggered

Yes.
Yeah I've seen people threaten to boycott a company when the company reacted ideally to a bad employee (firing a racist employee), kind of shocked me because a franchise can't possibly know the personal views of every clerk they hire. Why punish the company who took action when they found out?

People just seem to enjoy being outraged. Or for attention like you said. Walking away is smartest, even if it's nearly impossible sometimes 😁
Sadly, it is usually down to money. The profits from war are vast. Urkiane is sitting on billions in resources, 5 billion-plus, also vast profits from building weapons which destroy a nation,  then we come in and rebuild " which already the contracts have been signed as I read "This cost further billions which the nation owes as debt, meaning contracts are giving in return or influence in the area. Before the war, Ukraine was being talked about as being used as a guinea pig even before the war. Cashless society,  bases on the border, etc 
An EU test bed and such.  Also, there will be USA, German, and British bases on the Russian border, which was planned even before the war, so that is a definite now. This means nuclear weapons, most likely. Which was the reason behind the escalation in the area.   It's like Russia going into Mexico or Scotland and taking over, talking about bases and weapons on borders.   People don't see it the other way around.  Also, we cut off their oil pipes and gas lines pre-war. I don't think we are innocent here.
Neither is Russia, by a long way.  
As we see, it's all about control.  We did with Afghanistan and Iraq, and even now, we are telling Afghanistan to leave the oil field alone even thou we " gave the nation back " we still have control of resources.  
Russia wants the same resource in Russia. We want them also. 

I agree. what you say is that the best option, I would like to see leaders of nations fighting, lol.  We wouldn't have wars at all if that happened. Instead, they send others and want to push conflict more, causing the suffering of others. 
Sadly, Boris Johnson stopped a peace deal at the beginning of the war, which made me think this way and more so now that we are turning down another. 
Our leaders aren't interested in peace they wouldn't take the early dea and push the leader of Ukraine, not to, and the same as the peace deal only last week,  just refusing and walking away.
They care not about the Consequences and e  total devastation of Ukraine, meaning people,  buildings, infrastructure, or even the future control of their nation by others.  If either side gets land after this, only the Ukrainians suffer. 

I totally agree that " humans need to change the away they think."  Most don't even know the history of the nation nor what is truly happening, and sadly .
The only way to change things a little bit is to push the government for peace or vote out the 
warmongers. 
Or make they fight to their death ;)
Reddit mods, man. The minute I find a good alternative to this place, I'm out
You dirty, dirty pig. XD
What story was that related to, and was it said? 
I have seen the cry of racism when people don't get their way either. Its swings and roundabouts, I suppose.  
Going after the companies is a bit much, and that all started with people trying to get people sacked from activists online and groups 
Used to be very Frequent for individuals on old Twitter to find people with comments they didn't like and phone up their jobs lying about them sadly. 
That's how far people will go now, we are having it in the UK with pro-Palestinian groups smashing up banks and businesses just because '  or might have done business or got employees and still doing Malicious phone calls to get people fired   The BLM movement was another lot for people who got fired and businesses wrecked because of that, and they were innocent. 
We live in that world now, for sure . If you disagree  and don't walk away, they want to make a scene or, much worse,
I believe in your right to posts views such as that. However, a lot of the details of your meanings were unclear. Please proofread the comment to which I am directly replying, the one that begins with "Sadly, it is". Especially that first paragraph, for spelling and grammar, for punctuation such as that lonely floating open (or closing?) quotation mark, and especially for unclear sentence fragments. For example, I do not know what is meant by "cashless society, bases on the border, etc", because it is a sentence fragment lacking context. Some of your other comments in this thread have similar proofreading/clarity issues, although I tend to agree with what points I have been able to decipher from them so far (which feels like somewhere around half of your meanings). Thanx in advance.
Same
Yeah it definitely can go either way, I just saw an abusive Mexican guy on bodycam who was trying to get into the home he shares with his wife while she was there to collect her things. Cops stopped him from entering and he said it's racism, ignoring the fact they were there to broker a safe collection of her belongings.

The one with the racist employee (and I'm trying to remember the name of the business, it'll prob randomly come to me but I'm going to see if I can find it on Google) was a customer coming in to return items. First the clerk followed the lady around, but only her, and then when she went up to the desk to return her purchases from the previous week, the clerk accused her of taking the clothes off the shelf that day. She also held the woman there and called police, but the video footage debunked the thief theory. The clerk was fired, and people were saying they'd boycott the business which made no sense to me. 

But she didn't say "I'm doing this because you're black", if I remember correctly it was kind of obvious. I'll def look for the store name so you can watch on YT to see what you think.
Sorry, I assume you know the plan for Ukraine from Europe. "A cashless society"  just means that there is no cash " cashless ",  all digital nation.  
"Bases on the border "is the other assumption I expect people to know, meaning NATO  military bases are allowed in that nation,  meaning German, British, USA troops and others right on the edge of Russia. 
It's just the same as Russia bases in Scotland or Canada.  I'm sure that would raise tensions or push a nation to war. The coup of 2014 February Orchestrated by America was the catalyst and start of this. 
We should have never gone to Ukraine full-stop. 

I gathered people would know the background or know the history and what the catalysts for Russia are going back into Ukraine with war, but sadly, when I speak of this, no one knows. Most truly think this started in Russia in February 2022. Sadly, even asking for peace these days is seen as bad. 


Hope that helps.
My god, that's bad , people make mistakes.  To blame race when race wasn't brought up is just an excuse for outrage.
Thank you for those explanations. They give me a starting point to research from further sometime. That being said, I will point out that the condition of a typical citizen of the USA, such as myself, just hoping for peace and for our nation to interfere less in the politics of other nations, is, perhaps ironically, a big part of the reason that we are not more informed about these things. In other words, our desire to stay out of these things ends up leading, whether directly or not, to us only hearing the reports that the news insists on telling us. And for the most part, news services insistence of what we needed to know about the conflict did not happen until what you referred to as "Russia in February 2022". 
With regard to our government and military, though, it seems like they'd eventually notice that a small nation we arm and train in one decade ends up using those weapons and that training against us in the next decade. Especially when that keeps happening over and over again. Doesn't it?
AMD naming wheel, why?
At what point did someone ask the engineer or manager that made this to go see therapy? Because after the release of the ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and ryzen AI 7 365 processors, I'm not confident this device works anymore and I worry about the creator's mental health.

Will there be a new wheel made and where can I buy one?
The wheel and digits at least had some logical sense to it. The AI 365 thing is just absurd.
I personally love the 8851Gx3D

It has integrated graphics and 3D cache. Granted it only has half a PCIe lane (shared between the GPU and M.2 drive) though.
Need to be able to confuse consumers so you can sell Zen2 architecture as the latest and greatest new CPU in low end laptops.
Praying for AMDs CPU naming scheme creator, wishing they get all the help that they need to recover from the amount of brain damage required to produce such an awful, dogshit naming scheme 🙏  It truly is a marvel that they haven't already died of cerebral atrophy.
They've put the generation in the third number instead of the first number? WTF
I never thought I'd say this but, ah the good old days...

The new naming convention is much worse IMO.
At this point I think this naming scheme is actually just hurting their sales.
Isn't this old news at this point? I thought they abandoned this.
Is there a printable version of this posted somewhere?
need the ryzen 4070 somewhere
Well at least they are not as bad as monitor model names..yet.. :/
This is what AMD meant by "investing in crypto"
Excuse me, what is that?
I don't understand AMD's naming convention at all. Can someone explain it to me?
Downvote me to hell, but new "AI Ryzen" branding is better than this BS.
Confusing names is part of the marketing strategy nowadays, we cannot understand, as plebeians without a MBA.
Yeah, this is horrific and possibly the worst naming scheme in the history of PC hardware. Intel Whiskey/Comet/Ice Lake has *nothing* on this utter trash.
Oh no, now we even have anti-piracy for CPUs? /s
https://i.redd.it/tngtmlp43xgd1.gif
Reminds me of a copy protection method from the Commodore Amiga days.
Not enough x in there
To hide the reuse of old designs for old-new stock used in products.
Hardware company retaining the same naming scheme consistently for more than 2 years challenge: IMPOSSIBLE.
Everyone loves rebranding ever since Twitter. Personally would not acknowledge any of that
I still think this is worse 

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/processor-numbers.html
Jumped the shark.
Bullshit.

It's gonna be AI SSJ SSJG UI Blue next.
You do not want to see the Intel square then.
9755
AI the new XP
Because they put more effort into naming than into quality control
Hey well at least now we'll have 5 SKUs but they are all gonna have 20 TDP variations. Yay I fucking guess
Cause now they can sell you fancy zen 3 chips on all future 8000 and 9000 ryzen mobile CPUs without you noticing it.

That's why.

The amount of times I had to compare the 5500u to the 7520 and 7530 is insane.
I gave up on the product names from both companies and just look as passmark to get a ballpark
Since the first number, is started at 7, and increase every year, i dont think that wheel gonna be useful for long.
It's not a wheel, it's a dartboard.
I don't remember if it was The Mummy or one of the Indian Jones movies, but I've seen this before. And it existed to unearth a treasure, not to solve what CPU you're buying.
I like AMD but their marketing team must consist of clowns.
I've seen these types of people. What happens is that some marketing MBA needs to come up with some project/initiative to do at the company, and they came up with this. Everyone else around them is "ughh what the fuck", but since the project is kind of irrelevant/secondary "promotion material", nobody really cares and this one guy is just let to fly with their idea, and "do their own thing." It's just a physical manifestation of the generic marketing vomit that people at these types of positions have a pressure to come up with.
I personally love the new ryzen 4070
This is gold, LOL.

Can I please buy a 7750HX tho?
Looks like your missing XT because AMD wants to confuse their CPU's with GPU's now...
Brave of them to think they'll stick to the naming scheme all the way from 2023 to the end of 2024!
Ironically the code names for processors make more sense these days.
Just ignore the fact the entire mobile market exists.
At AMD, there is a constant competition between between the product naming team & product name decoder wheel team to outdo each other. For now naming team has the upper hand.
This wheel doesn't work even for their Ryzen 7000 Mobile lineup, Ryzen 7 7435HS should be a ryzen 3
AI all year long
I agree with this very much. The new names make the last ones seem much more logical
In 5yrs the AI fad will go out of favor and we'll all have a good laugh about it.
You've got a point, but I think even this is giving the decoder wheel naming scheme too much credit.
The 365 stands for the remaining days of the AI hype
Say sike RN
lmfao im dying
Definitely confused me when I saw the 7320U and 7520U for sale
The naming scheme and architecture framework makes pretty decent sense if you know what the numbers and letters represent. And if you're researching products as a prospective buyer, you should be looking that shit up anyway.
Don't worry, they're going great, although when they were fired from USB-IF and the Wi-Fi Alliance, they were worried for a moment.
It's a gaggle of marketing bros whose job is to sit around on Twitter every day til they're given a barrel of cocaine, an exceedingly superficial understanding of the products' capabilities, and the task of naming said products.
To deceive you, to make you think their old-architect CPU is the latest one.
Ikr! The generation number is the first thing I look for
They replaced their new naming scheme for this AI shit just when I was getting used to it.
The naming system changes every other year. I wish I knew which good old days you were referring to xD
Soon we'll see cpu model decoders like we have for car VINs.
You are overestimating the average user. Look, a lot of numbers and AI stuff. I must have it, as it must be better than something withoute it.
The naming wheel was created last year but I didn't find out about it until recently when researching the HX 370. Gamers nexus or linus tech tips brought it up and at first I thought it was a meme but apparently this thing is very real.
Yeah, 8000 series technically uses the same scheme, but in practice, 8000 was Zen4-only.
A 3D printed one would be great
https://i.redd.it/jwseale1rvgd1.gif
I don't think AMD can afford that.
Monitor names hit bedrock and they just kept digging. I have no idea what's going on anymore and I haven't bought a new monitor in years.
Start with an ouji board and some drunk friends. Jk. 

I don't understand it at all so I made a list on the CPU tab of the spreadsheet below of every AMD ryzen mobile, desktop, and threadripper name I could find to try and spot a pattern. Any CPU intended to be misleading in a harmful way has been colored deep red like the 7120U as a warning.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SWqLJ6tGmYHzqGaa4RZs54iw7C1uLcTU_rLTRHTOzaA/edit?usp=drivesdk

Originally, AMD would use the first number to indicate the CPU architecture. Ex. A 1, 2, or 3 could mean zen 1 or zen 1+. A 3 or 4 indicated Zen 2. 5 was used to indicate zen 2+ or zen 3. The following numbers and letters would classify the performance and power consumption or features of the CPU. This was considered really dumb and misleading, so AMD replaced the first number with the manufacturing year to be even more confusing and moved the architecture number to the middle of the number where it could be more easily missed. It used this number scheme:

The newest naming scheme is even more confusing because Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 is extremely unique and scrambled.
Maybe the ai part is unnecessary but way better than ryzen 7754 7843 7725 7735 etc etc etc etc etc...
Yeah, although the new naming scheme doesn't have a lot of room for Ryzen 3, 5, 7, etc.
Ryzen Ayy Lmao 420 > Ryzen AI, just saying.

Idk whats wrong with AMDs "naming department" - somehow, Radeon Technologies group gets it, but the CPU side doesnt.
![gif](giphy|Y8CSMzUm7Md0s)

>Downvote me to hell
One would think some of these people would look at how successful Apple naming is and try to copy it.

Every random person can tell at first glance whether iPad4 is better or worse than iPad3.

No sane person can tell at first glance whether Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 is better or worse than Ryzen 9 7945HX3D
Don't think the MBAs that made this horrific shit understand what they mean either, they just understand catchy number catchy. Bigger number big profit.
Take it you haven't seen the "Intel Core Ultra 200V"... course maybe the V there stands for volts in which case it's pretty consistent..
Ryzen CPUs will support the Amiga in the coming year!
Yes! I still have my boxed Amiga copy of Starflight with the [code wheel](https://www.oldgames.sk/codewheel/starflight).

https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kVgfFQytGcWqifWXyGDHHc-970-80.jpg.webp
Preach. 

AMD's scheme is practically flawless compared to Intel's trash fire.
I'm not crazy about linus but when he's mad about something, he makes a decent good point
This. AMD may be a bit convoluted but it's practically flawless compared to the shit show that is Intel naming. 

Then again, no shocker considering what a mess Intel as a whole has been for the last decade.
I can't believe this is less confusing than ryzen ai 9 hx 370
Savage
Basically. I didn't even realize it was happening until I googled the processors and most people don't bother to check.
Wow, corporate beauracracy is a very weird world. I can see some sense at what you're getting at. A friend of mine is also under a lot of pressure to contribute something to earn a promotion and the requirements are very vague.
They fail to work once, every 4 years.
Hopefully we'll start writing "Turbo" on everything again
AI (deep neural nets) will be ubiquitous. The NPU hardware has been in phones for a number of years already and teenage girls have been using it to put sparkles on their faces in video calls. We're going to actually need 10G Ethernet, USB4, and 6TB hard drives sooner than you think as the models get larger and hidden in places where you wouldn't normally expect. AI is like color tv in the 1970's or wifi in the 2000's. Growth and adoption is here. It's not going away.
Hopefully
To think of the days when meatbags used us to draw!
I sincerely hope so.
False. AI may not end up where we assume it will, but it is absolutely here to stay and it's going to be absolutely revolutionary once it hits whatever zenith it hits. 

So either get with the times and adapt to using it, or unfortunately get left behind.
I think AI NPUs will be present in every chip, they will drop the AI from the naming, tho, because it'll be a given that the chip has AI capabilities.
If I had a dollar for every redditor who thinks AI is just a fad.

Yall must have no clue about the millions of kids who use AI everyday for schoolwork.
Considering even wallstreet is starting to have second thoughts on it, it may not even have that long for the "fad" side of things. There's a lot of valid uses for ML, shoving crappy chatbots in everything isn't it though.
Based
No. AMD genuinely has a pretty good naming scheme once you learn what the numbers and letters represent.
When a Ryzen 5 7520U is worse than a Ryzen 3 5300U...   
  
Sincerely they're bad and somehow in the neighboring country that I went to buy my i3 1215U laptop were selling the R3 7320U variant with 8 GB of Soldered RAM at 300$... Basically the same price as my laptop with 16 GB of RAM :/
I think what these companies forget (ignore) is that if they do manage to confuse their customers regarding what produkt is newer than other, they completely kill any desire to upgrade to newer products.

When Apple releases iPhone 4, everyone with iPhone 3 knows that there is newer tech and can upgrade.

When AMD releases Ryzen 124JHJLJ3487Y0XCGxAI, it just doesn't do that.
Not sure if you're serious or not. The naming scheme means a 5000 series chip can easily be faster and have a more modern chip than a 7000 series chip. Your everyday person is 100% going to assume that a 7000 series chip is going to be more modern than a 5000/6000 series chip. AMD knows this, and they chose this naming scheme.
Oh, so you don't find "USB-type-C 3.1" just a brilliant simple name that every average consumer will remember and be able to distinguish from "Micro USB-type-B 2.0"? /s
Its needed. They put updates to older architectures. E.g. old Zen2 arch but with updated Zen3/7000 IO die and/or with updated iGPU. This then becomes the lower/budget end of the tiers.

The new naming scheme actually makes sense for this. Zen2 mobile 4000 is different from Zen2 mobile 7x2x
A month ago lol :P

It was still better than this shite. Not that that's a high bar.
The Athlon times.

Good ole Athlon II 64...
> You are overestimating the average user. Look, a lot of numbers and AI stuff.

The average user is less than enthused about 90% of AI shit. It's mostly techbros blown away by shoving chatbots into your phones and your OSes and everything else under the sun.
IRL customer sees a random meaningless number, gives up and buys Intel, because "everyone knows Intel is better".
I was definitely not going to buy the 370 at first. I mistook the 370 to mean it was a first or second gen ryzen with much poorer performance than the 8845HS. Bigger number better was how I was raised.
They have a cpu called the Ai 9 365.


Why would you assume memes were off the table?
Dells/Alienwares names are pretty alright.

AW - Alienware series

34 - 34 inch diagonal

23 - year of release

D - 1440p resolution

W - ultra wide

F - Freesync
Yup, exactly, hopefully nobody will speak "ai" part
Because GPU side has a huge competitor in Nvidia which follows a simple convention - bigger number better. 4090 > 4080 > 4070 > 4060 > 4050 etc. There is some between generations bs but you can also assume that 4070 > 3070 > 2070 etc. AMD is already outsold 10:1 so trying to package old cards in new names is how you lose few remaining customers that even consider Radeons to begin with.

Although to be fair AMD can't stick to their naming scheme in GPUs for long either. In general they break it every 2-3 years.

Still, on CPU side both AMD and Intel are engaged in random name generators in laptop space so they can sell you an outdated CPU for the price of the latest one.
actually, to make it even more stupid: RAIZEN <number> <3D etc.>
Underestable, have a good day
Now do the macbook lineup
If it was a competition, Acer would’ve curb stomped everyone else with “Acer Nitro KG272M3bmiipx UM.HX2EE.303” and the likes.
AMD's mobile processor naming is nonsensical. What reasonable person would conclude that a 7520u is (much) worse in essentially every way than a 5500u? (4 vs 6 cores, 2 vs 7 GPU units)? just.. wtf?

Intel's mobile naming is kinda bad, but at least (generally) has a coherent bottom to top theme in a series.
Quite the leap, Ai must say.
TURBO EXTREME!

Can't wait for my smart fridge to have AI, so it can tell me what to eat today.
Most of the time what they mean by AI is basically not an AI at all. Any technology that has more than two options in decision making is basically an AI for big companies.

Your motherboard can recognise 4 states of CPU heat? Well that's almost the same as leading a ship to another galaxy while humans are in cryogenic pods.
> 10G Ethernet

Why specifically? Any model would be local to the device, or accessing one via the internet. 10GBE does nothing for that.
> If I had a dollar for every redditor who thinks AI is just a fad.

Next you're gonna tell everyone how blockchain will revolutionize databases and record keeping.

How the "metaverse" is the future of the internet.

And how "self-driving" cars that don't run over people are "just around the corner".
The thing is no one knows, and it’s misleading to push products that seem “newer” but in reality are built on a earlier process node
Sorry but AMD has a terrible and misleading naming scheme for their mobile\* CPUs
If the naming scheme has a dozen revisions that the consumers have to learn, it's a poor naming scheme. 

Just go back to the simple scheme.
It was okay, but how can you have a cpu named 7xxx but is from the 5xxx generation?
Bruh, that is an insane rip off.
I didn't realize how bad it was until I got myself a laptop. It had a 7520U with 12GB of RAM so I thought I was set. 

Nope. That thing was slow. I guess I should have figured because it was going for $250 refurb.
[deleted]
It's hard to imagine a 7640HS is as fast as a i7-11700k where a 7520U gets destroyed by an overclocked i7-2600k@4.6GHz, a decade-old veteran 9 generations older than 11700k? This is insane in an uninitiated eye as 7640hs is only "120 points" higher than 7520u.
It actually is using 6nm silicon instead of 7nm and is also DDR5. So it's not just a rebadge of the 4300U. But yeah, stupid naming.
This is a very helpful explanation. I wish AMD marketing understood this.
Thats why im considering Lunar lake, i don't want a 2024 Mendocino 7xxx cpu
You forgot USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 😉
True, but folding them into the 7000 series is an issue.

I'm somewhat OK with them folding Zen3+ (mobile 6000) into 7000 series since mobile 6000 was so uncommon.

But they shouldn't have done Zen 2 or found a different name for it. Maybe use the Athlon name.
Lmao yes
Ah shoot, I mixed up the name with ryzen AI 7 365.

Lol I'm surprised there aren't more memes for amd shinanigans but maybe I have yet to dive into the deep end
That is relatively tolerable/decent. Been a while since I had something to be happy about with dell
Samsung's monitor names are pretty good too. I think it's better that the name captures the quality/experience than all the technical details though.
Yeah as far as wild monitor naming schemes go, Dell pretty much nailed it even as their naming schemes evolve. The 3 that I commonly use are 2007FP, 2408FP, and U2312HM. Without looking anything up, I'm fairly certain:

20/24: Display size in inches  
07/08: Model year  
FP: Flat Panel (CRTs were still in existence, though getting scarce, in 2007/8) 

U: UltraSharp series  
23: Inches  
12: Model year  
H: [Full] HD? It's 1080p  
M: Monitor, probably
- "I wonder if MacBook Air 2024 is better than MacBook Air 2022"
- "I wonder what is the difference between MacBook 13" and MacBook 15"
- "I wonder which has higher performance - MacBook Pro or MacBook Air?"

Beware of evil androids.
We have to shovel these models around. The amount of compute required to generate them means we'll want to save and distribute that work. You probably won't locally train a model. It will come pre-trained and embedded in pretty much everything, leading to bigger files.
This, 100%
Desktop is mostly fine, at a glance it atleast tells you were it lines up in the stack, the problem is its inconsistent for how far its behind the higher tier offering. Mobile is where it goes to complete shit though. Its best to just research the chip and make sure the lappy you are looking at has the one you want.
I mean if they can be learned, then they can make sense. Just because you neglected to do your research doesn't make it a bad scheme.
Yep sadly very few offers at the sub 300/350$ from AMD were I live, I surely won't buy a R3 3250U or R5 3450U when there's better offering like the i3 1115G4 and specially i3 1215U, sadly the single model with an R3 5300U wasn't that compelling when it was more expensive and would perform slightly worse or similar to the 12th Gen i3 :/
Sincerely they’re more fit for Chromebooks considering that they only come with LPDDR5 and a VERY weak Radeon 610M iGPU.
The i3 1215U is between the R3 5300U and R5 5500U in multi core performance while being faster than both in single core, it also has a fast enough iGPU to match a Vega 6.
It’s a pretty decent entry level CPU for budget laptops and sadly I don’t see many AMD offerings to beat it.
I didn’t claim it was a rebadged APU, but even with LPDDR5 and a slightly better node is still worse overall than a R3 5300U because of the insanely weak iGPU and for the price they’re charging for laptops with these APUs it’s simply not a compelling product compared to its predecessors and competitors (i3 1215U)…

If they were set to compete with the N100/200 price wise they sure would be good enough.
Oh don't tell me that... oh... oh no... what a terrible day to have eyes.
Just consider 7000-series Zen2 as Zen2++. 5300/5500/5700 mobile as Zen2+.  
  
They do still use the Athlon name for the lower end dual-core Zen products. Most, if not all, Zen2(++) models under 7000 series falls in the lower Ryzen 3 category anyway. In the event that a higher Zen2(++) model performs similarly to a Zen3+ model, they might have the same tier (0x00) or the Zen2 model probably will go lower tier.

Not exactly. 5300/5500/5700 is a refresh of 4000, the codename is literally "Renoir-R".

7020 series is completely new and on 6nm, DDR5, with RDNA2 iGPU, although only 2 CU's.

It's likely more efficient than its Zen2 predecessors, albeit capped at 4 cores.
5300/5500/5700 are Lucienne.

**Lucienne** (5000u Zen2) is Zen 2 Renoir with an upgraded memory controller with support for both [DDR4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR4_SDRAM)-3200 and [LPDDR4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPDDR4)-4266, faster iGPU, and more.  *(*[*AnandTech*](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16451/amds-ryzen-5000-lucienne-not-simply-rebranded-ryzen-4000-renoir-)*)* Its effectively Zen2+.

**Mendocino** (7020u Zen2) has another memory controller upgrade (LPDDR5), RDNA2 iGPU, and more. Its then effectively Zen2++.
Opened a brand new M2 MacBook Air like this
Merry Christmas everyone, certainly not to me tho lmao

Got an M2 MacBook Air delivered last Thursday, took it home, wrapped it and stored it safely in my closet. Today I took it out as it was Christmas, cardboard and MacBook box looking like it just came from the factory and...boom. My excitement turned into horror when I saw the Apple logo appear. 🥴🫠

I submitted a report with photo evidence, hopefully I hear back during next week. 

I got this from Czech retailer Alza, so not Apple. Hoping I get a replacement without having to wait for 30 days with the warranty stuff. 🙃 And this was a gift to my parents too. :))))

At least you can laugh at my misery and I hope you're all having better holidays than me haha!
It’s beginning to look a lot like a trip to the Apple Store 🎄
That screen is broken. Is 900 some dollar fix from apple. Def exchange that shit or have em fix it..
Are they making foldables now?!
"You opened it wrong"
Shits fucked mate just return and exchange probably
“Merry Christmas, fuk you.” - Tim Apple
I hope you get a full replacement and not a damn repair because you’re paying full price for a refurbished device
take it back where ever you got it and get a relplacement.
Alza is pretty good about this kind of stuff, you should be fine.
People always complaining that Mac's Don't do split screen windowing. Now they complain when it does.
You're one of the first consumers to test Mac Fold F1 model. Stop complaining George and enjoy it!
Always knew that camera notch is a bad idea. 🤣 Looks like they fucked up while cutting out the notch.
As much as I love the Silicon Macbooks the screens are so damn fragile. I had mine in my bookbag in the back laptop sleeve and just the pressure from stuffing the front part with a few too many clothes was enough to crack the screen. I didnt drop it, throw it, nothing, just put it on my back and when I got home the screen was cracked. I didnt have Applecare so it cost $900 to replace. Then 6 months later I spilled a tiny bit of coffee on the keyboard, flipped it over and cut power immediately. Took it to a 3rd part shop to get it checked out, they said there was barely anything in there. Worked great for 2 or 3 days and then it was black and wont charge, logic board fried.

Picked up and M3 Pro 16 the other day, def got Applecare this time.
U got a software update intended for the macbook m69 fold
I bought an iPhone 15 Pro Max as a self gift around a month ago. and got robbed last Tuesday, so, it happens man. Good luck with the warranty
Shit.
'Crack’ing unboxing experience
They are testing the new split screen technology
It’s important you officially notify them of the damaged device you received so you can get your legal rights, just in case their exchange policy is not that good. You have a legal right for a refund within the first 30 days. That’s on top of their returns policy
Apple is beta testing a new window management system on selected MacBook 😃
So sorry this happened to you.  Hard to believe any major retailer wouldn't make this right for you, so try to enjoy the holiday.  Perhaps you can celebrate the new year with a new Mac!  Best of luck!
Send that shit back. If it arrived damaged prior to your acquisition of it, the liability lies with whoever sold this MacBook to you.
Super-sorry for your parents (and you, too, of course). Get a replacement. Good luck! :-)
Alza was pretty good with returns when my electronics broke down.
Two screens; nice!
This forum is always full of *I just got this* ***NEW*** *Mac that appears broken…*

And skim down and it was always bought via eBay or some dodgy retailer or a guy in an alley…

Not ragging on OP. This all happens a lot. The world of reselling electronics is full of thieves. Sad but true.
Mhm…  Quality.
All the best to you. It looks like if you aren't talking with complete heartless people you are gonna have your refund.
I has a sad seeing that.
GG
damn, that sucks! I hope you get it sorted man D:
Bin it 👏🏻
Hello? More like hell no
Refund it, that’s ridiculous
If “fuck my luck” was a MacBook …
That sucks lol return it
Damnnn I’m sorry to hear that man.
I thought this was the Surface Duo subreddit and it was docked to a keyboard lol. Hope the exchange process goes smoothly!
No worries. They'll only charge you $100 less than the cost of a new one to replace the screen.
Please return this and request an exchange as this is highly likely physical damage inflicted on the unit during transport.
My condolences friend
So annoying and disappointing for you. I would be turning the air blue! Hope you can get it replaced a.s.a.p.
May Christmas bless you once more, just once more
That’s the new split screen version!
On the bright side, you'll get to open a *second* brand new M2 MacBook Air soon!
My 16inch 2019 Pro randomly gave the same issue. Hairline crack. Laptop is clean on the ultimate OCD X Germaphobe level. No scratches, dents, scuff marks. Never dropped. Nothing ever placed in between the screen. Absolute disgrace. Waiting to hear from insurance.
Bro it's split screen it's the new feature don't believe look all these people agreeing
Take that damn thing back and either get a new one or get your damn money back
It's an iSplit Screen iFeature, you probably just ticked split my screen by mistake when you were iOrdering.
Put it in rice.
Alza by snad neměla dělat problémy. Ze zkušenosti to s nimi vždycky bylo ok a na zákaznické lince vždy byli milí. Problémy podle mě dělat nebudou, je to pro ně úplně nic v tom šíleném odběru co mají
Damn, they must’ve threw that damn thing
oj. co jsem slyšel tak Alza není úplně dobrej Apple retailer, každopádně s reklamací s nima jsem neměl nikdy problém, takže věřím, že všechno dobře dopadne.
If Steve Jobs was still alive. He would say, 'you opened the box wrong.'

Honestly, what is it with their new M1,2 and 3 MBP? I seen two like that. For the amount of money they charge. It should be perfect out the box.

Sorry to see. Happy Christmas.
Zero quality control from Apple 🤬
That’s had pressure on the lid while closed to do that. Former Genius, that’d be known as an ‘LCD fracture’, basically the back layer of glass (closest to the lid side) has cracked rather than the front layer (where you’d see the actual cracks themselves). 

Not ordinarily covered by warranty as it’s damage. If that was on my desk, I’d be checking the lid for *any* dents. That’d 99% be an escalation to get sorted at no cost to the customer in my day.
Omg the horror. Hopefully it gets sorted out quickly and you get a new one.
"May foldable phone na pala ang Apple?" I thought when I saw it.
Had to manually onboard 50 iPhones to ABM due to our reseller not being able to add them into our account - had an iPhone SE new with the exact same issue. It can happen.
This can always happen even with top notch (haha) products.
Simple, buy from Apple!
Plot twist, OP broke it and staged the photo to make it seem genuine, little do they know that Apple devices store accelerometer events in flash storage.
Do they not have spellcheck???

/s
I would be so mad that I would for sure make them do an exchange or get my money back and have them give me something as an apology. My first Laptop was a MacbookPro but it only lasted me 2 years and it died one day and Apple expected that I pay 2K for the repairs. I said no and switched over to an actual PC. I didn't want a Mac at all. It was my Dad who wanted me to have one.
Haelo
Cool. Foldable screen. Watch out Samsung, Apple is coming at you.
Why did you buy it from a dodgy Czech retailer??
Back it goes to Appleville
Did you piss off Santa again?
Apple’s rumoured new foldable?
Looks like my surface duo
All these fold jokes are making me chuckle lol, thanks for making this unfortunate event a bit more funny haha
Say goodbye and bring it back
Take it back to the retailer that you purchased it from. If they are not an Apple authorized retailer you may be out of luck if they don’t help you out.
Had to been damaged during shipping  or storage. It wouldn’t leave the factory like this. The panel would have failed at the vendor level, and even it slipped through, failed again at the final assembly test.
I bought a brand new MacBook in 2019 from Apple Store and even playing videos burns the board. Was ridiculous. Had the board underneath Touch Bar changed,  still it heats up easily.  And it broke after 4 years. Overall it was not a good user experience.

Now I just got a REFURB Apple silicon from Amazon, functions perfectly, quiet smooth no heat at all, hundreds of dollars cheaper than brand-new, and Amazon allows return within 2 or 3 months. Completely satisfied.  Long live Amazon.
Hi. It shouldn’t be like that. 
Regards
It looks perfect except for that one thing.
Is that a rumoured foldable mac ?
It's a foldable mac
Fix Apple
Book feature
F
That’s just a background mate.
Wow the dual ipad edition. Nice!
Split screen fresh out of the box
We haven’t had Christmas yet ☹️hope you had an amazing one!!
That’s a nice welcome Christmas surprise.
with all the amazing tech and stuff these new macs provide their screen durability is dogshit. applecare is a must
halo. sorry
Opened it a touch too hard?
R
post like this scare me of newer macbooks, ill stick to the 2015 15" king macbook.
I wouldn't laugh so quickly there is always the possibility they don't believe you; especially considering you didn't open it on the day of purchase.
I think I should open it in the store to make sure everything is alright. The quality check looks bad. Screens, scratch, colors pigment...
christmas pain
hallo 👋
I thought it's foldable tablet just like that Microsoft one
I think alza should take it back even if it wasn’t broken
hallo
i opened a base model m2 air in midnight absolutely perfect I'm in love with it
Me and my buddies bought quite a few MacBooks during pandemic, and the shop owner asked us to check the MacBooks while we were there. He mentioned how common it is for MacBooks to have a broken something right out of the box. 

Unboxing them right there helped both the buyer and their own process. 

Even with all that precaution, one of us did get a battery issue and we had to return the damn thing after a months worth of following up. Unfortunate for him but 2 new MacBook had the same exact issue and we had to go through the entire round all over again.
In Hungary there’s a rule that you are eligible for full refund for online purchases within 15 days after delivery (minus shipping fee), no questions asked. Isn’t it an EU-wide rule? If yes, why not just send it back?
The displays suck. My M1. Rapped out at 18 months. I regret buying the new pros only Apple product I have ever owned that had an issue.
Time for a new computer!
Apple know it’s customer is rich. Once I bought the new iPhone 7 for my sister, and the screen was faulty out of the box. They refused outright saying this happens one in a million, and if I am not covered under Apple Care+, I’ll have to pay for the replacement. And in those days, there was no Apple Care + available here.
🌟goodbye🌟
The screen is foldable
Is that a foldable?
I'm returning back to my country Tommorow. So yeah, good Christmas for me.
There is a 7 day warranty after purchase for issues like this. Contact apple immediately
merry christmas!!!!!!!
Kaputto
Must be one of those folding screens I've heard so much about
Womp womp that sucks sorry :(
why are putting a baking parchment over the keyboard ?
Wow macbook with split screen. Sounds like a limited edition from Apple.. :p
Tl;DR When did u got it delivered, you shoud have 15days to return it back, no questions asked when you order online, it's some common EU consumers law. This ain't warranty thing
Beautiful, dont mind me asking is it special made?
That’s the new dual screen model. Enjoy!
I taugh it was two iPads
Disable the split screen mode
hallo
They forgot to make keyboard foldable too.
It’s a feature!
That’s normal, they are in splitscreen mode out of the box
It’s german
You sure this is not an Apple feature?
haIIlo
Return it and google ppm
Oh it’s the new crying island version? You’ll get used to it 🤪
Former Apple employee here. Apple have an extended returns policy during the Christmas holiday period. You’ll be able to have it swapped over
I see no issues here. It just booted up in split  screen.
ha|lo
14 day return. They have to reimburse the full amount.
another day with another crappy mac post, fuck those laptops
microsoft would never
CuStoMeR sErvIcE
The new MacBook Fold
For a second i thought you were joking with surface duo llol
To se skutečně stalo mému bratrovi nedávno😬😬
Fantastic dual display layout, emphasizing the OLED’s camera cutout—a testament to Apple’s exceptional engineering prowess.
Eu sou técnico, meu amigo. Essa tela está quebrada!
UPDATE 1: The retailer has issued a pickup by the courier for Friday. Now I need to package it as if my life depends on it. 

They say they will give me more options and information when the courier picks it up. 
The approximate date being January 2nd, 2024.
How does that work? No idea but better than waiting for a month I guess. 🥲

I'll let you know how it goes. Hopefully well. 🙏
This poor sod is in Czechoslovakia or some shithole without an alphabet. So you dűmbass Americans and Canadians harping on about bla bla in your cűntries are patently more useless than the demented fool called Brandon.
Wow, didn’t know one could get split screen right from factory, sweet !
Goodbye
It’ll buff out🤔
“Hallo”. “Byeeeee”
That was a good one.
cc: I set up a return, though here it's different so they'll have 30 days to make a decision. Hopefully it's fast.
Bought it at a retailer from my country, at least the EU laws cover my ass in some way.
On the flip side, split-screen but dont cheat.
Been making them since the iPhone 6
I think the problem is someone folded this one the wrong way.
"Just don't open it that way"
I set up a return, though here it's different so they'll have 30 days to make a decision. Hopefully it's fast.
fuck your pfp
In a parallel universe the Apple return policy is worded exactly like this
"Just don't open it that way" — Steve Jobs
For sure. I'll see what they offer me, their support is gonna call me at some point in the next 2 days.

If they only offer a repair or a refund I'm taking the money- I don't want to get my brand new device back scuffed from the screen replacement, as you said, full price for refurbished. 😩
Yep, doing that on Tuesday when everything opens here. 🙏
V to doufám, s tím expresním řešením poškozený zásilky..snad to nebude trvat 30 dní a že se mě nepokusí ojebat s tím "že jsem to rozbil já". 🙏
Oh man, glad to hear this, just thinking about OPs situation and the “up to 30 days” made me anxious… especially because here is a no brainer defect, replaceable the same morning.
I spilled like 200ml water on my M1 MacBook Air two years ago, had it in my bag during a bike crash, working perfectly
Ya, AppleCare+ is an absolute must if you're going to get an Apple silicon laptop.
I’ve read that the tolerances are so tight and the components so small that a spec of dust can destroy them
The same thing happened to me— it sucks. I will get Apple Care the next time, deffo!
Oh man, that's horrible. Sorry to hear that 🥲
Yep, did that within 5 minutes of opening the laptop. Hoping they'll get back to me soon
Most likely stolen goods
I did sorta that, reported damaged shipment, need to wait till things open again here to go return it. Hoping they do exchange it. Thanks 🙌
Doufám že to všechno dopadne dobře. Dneska ráno jsem dostal email s požadavkem o další fotky se zněním: "Fotografie přepravního obalu jsou nezbytnou součástí reklamačního řízení, abychom celou situaci v mezičase mohli reklamovat buďto u dopravce jako poškození z přepravy nebo případně u výrobce jako vadu z výroby."

Ptali se i na to jestli na krabici byla nálepka "Křehké/Fragile/Neklopit" atd, což nebyla. Foto jsem poslal a teď jen čekat.. 
Tak snad všechno bude ok 🙏🥲
Ajajaj tohle mi nedělej.💀Ale děkuju...já doufám že mě zachrání ta služba poškozený zásilky/reklamace. Šťastný a veselý 🙌😄
[removed]
That does not sound good....

I took it out yesterday to make photo evidence in case they will say things. This thing has not been touched in any bad way or used at all, after the initial pic I posted it was put back into the box and safely stored. Idk what pressure it could have been, maybe it has fallen during transit somewhere? I certainly did not pressure either the box or anything else. 

No dents [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/601467375723741204/1189018199929389136/IMG_3515.jpeg?ex=659ca27d&is=658a2d7d&hm=e9557535e060f069ea3d531e16ae5e8f11baaa1925d928cf73cf5b824fcb8035&), [nor any visible cracks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/601467375723741204/1189018477789446284/IMG_3512.jpeg?ex=659ca2c0&is=658a2dc0&hm=9fc77545ae64b777a94f3bd4553c5c998e0e97a0eaad678f09b520bea835b529&) on the [screen](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/601467375723741204/1189018200378200064/IMG_3513.jpeg?ex=659ca27d&is=658a2d7d&hm=7fac3d55f18d91cc620c291e89121333706ac99bdfc645344d95b4834ad46206&). 🥲
Thank you!
If they had a store here, sure, I would prefer that, but they don't even offer AppleCare+ to bother buying it from their website. So there is not really a difference here between the partner retail store or them...except being more expensive but no one is surprised.
Also a common breakpoint when ppl add camera covers and close the lid.

It's too bad macbooks don't have the built in lens covers anymore.
What do you mean?
[deleted]
I don't think a retailer used by almost everyone in this country, with a yearly turnover around 2 billion euros, is dodgy. And because it was 120€ cheaper + I could get it delivered the next day and it had damage-during-delivery insurance.
They are Apple authorized! 🙏
Yeah...not a single crack or scratch anywhere. Which is also why I'm hopeful for an easy replacement process. 🙏😩
Wish we had AppleCare+ here 🥲
I’ve used Macs since I was 4 (I’m 36 now). My last computer was a 2014 MacBook Pro which my wife now uses; even after over 9 years, the screen works perfectly (it’s had several keys, the internal drive (twice) and the battery replaced, but never the screen). None of my previous conputers ever had screen issues, with the exception of a 2009 iMac which I handed over to my father and was subsequently dropped by a thief who broke into my father’s house and found it too heavy to steal, so that hardly counts. So I’m sorry, but I have no idea what you’re on about.
This is what I fear the most, however, I paid for Shipment Damage insurance which can be reported for up to 14 days from pick up, so I hope that helps 🙏
Snad jo 😅
Hi, we have the same thing, unfortunately this applies to only undamaged items, in this case I don't think they would accept it back so I chose to submit a report for "Express solution in case of shipment damage" which I paid for when buying it and having it delivered. That also has a timeline of 14 days to do, so I hope that covers it. 🙏
That's the screen cover thingy, that's in every new macbook? Or is it a joke? 😅
Not bought from Apple, but by their authorized reseller. Hoping for the best though!
Ajajaj 🥶 a taky byl novej? Jak to řešil?
UPDATE: 2 
The retailer has issued a refund as they could not send a replacement (they don't have them in stock).
I saw the midnight color on even a bigger discount, so once I get the refund, I'll for for that! 
Hopefully it gets sorted this week! 🙏🙌
Now I just wish we had an Apple Store lmao
God bless EU consumer rights
Sounds good. Good luck! Also my price quote was for macbook pro i have not sent out any airs to get fixed. Prob close (intels are about 730$ for screen fix).
Alza tyhle "těsně-po-nákupu" reklamace bere fofrem a skoro vždycky vrací peníze.

Teď přes svátky toho budou mít hodně, ale myslím si že to novýho roku ti vrátí peníze.
EU law allows you to get a refund within 14days with no reason if you bought it online
Did you file the returns with Apple or with the retailer? Just curious.
Damn, I'd be pissed as fuck if I had to wait 30 days to process a return. Hell, if they tried to make me wait at all, I'd be on the phone with American Express getting my money back that way. I don't know if you can get Amex in your country but if you can, it's worth it for purchase protection (if you lose it or it's stolen within 30 days), return protection (if the seller refuses to return it), and extended warranty (an additional year after the mfg warranty when Amex will pay to repair or replace it if broken).
Good luck!!
Wdym “make a decision”? You bought a product, it arrived damaged, they’re legally required to either give you a refund, or a replacement. It’s not up to them to “make a decision”.

If that decision is anything other than “we’ll replace it for you/refund you”, you better sue.
Neviem, či máš okamžitú výmenu, vtedy by to mali riešiť fakt expresne. Ak nenájdu vonkajšie poškodenie a známky pádu, podľa mňa to vyriešia v tvoj prospech. Nestojí im to za naťahovačky. Kľudne sa to mohlo stať buď pri výrobe alebo pri preprave.
That’s why MBA’s are so awesome. No openings means no dust!
Nope. 

It's just willfully ignorant design. They don't design with safety margins, fail easy/fast and literally no design to avoid moisture damage.... 

Source: done microsoldering on a handful of MacBook pro boards
The aluminum shell is hard enough to protect the inside screen from damages, so I think that happened in the screwing phases…

I have encountered an issue before like this when I bought the iPhone X and turned it on to find the screen presses from it self in different areas and was not able to even complete the setup of my new iPhone. And had to return it back to apple to replace with another iPhone.
Best bet is to go via your retailer for an exchange. But it’s a guarantee that that Mac has had some impact against it at some point as that does not just happen. 

Best of luck with it, the M2s are great!
“/s” means sarcasm.
Yeah Alza are usually pretty good at putting right this kind of thing.
Volume doesn't make it less dodgy, have you heard of Temu?
Their delivery or quality control sucks then
thats a bummer, hope they make it right for you 🤞🏻
[deleted]
How did it turn out?
Ano, byl to zbrusu nový M3 Max, má stejný problém jako ty. Ale naštěstí pro něj to Alza vzala zpět a vyměnila mu ho.
Docela škoda.
[deleted]
[removed]
The US has returns too lol
I don't think god has anything to do with it.
😂 they’ll fix this in the us too. Apple has great customer service
 Možná bych ani nechtěl vrátit peníze, spíš by mi stačila výměna za funkční kus tbh. V mailu mám "V následujících hodinách Vás bude náš pracovník kontaktovat s nabídkou řešení pro Váš konkrétní případ." Tak uvidím co se bude dít, jestli vůbec něco, nebo jestli spíš v úterý... 😅 Šťastný a veselý 🙌
That applies if the item is not damaged, in which this case it is. Can't do that 😪
Retailer, can't file it with Apple because I didn't buy it there. I will have to bring the MacBook into the store during the week.
30 days is the standard wait time for normal warranty cases, it depends on the case tbh. I'm in the EU so no Amex here. I'll just hope for the best 🙌
Thanks! 🙏
I submitted report for a damaged delivery, (which I bought extra insurance for). They say that they offer a quick replacement in many cases but idk. 

If they took the MacBook away instead of replacing it or refunding me on the spot, they would have 30 days to resolve this within the warranty time. (which I hope will not be the case)

I’m sorry if I like, make mistakes or anything it’s just been very stressful, especially since this is my first Mac product I’m buying new, so it’s been a bit of a horror. I have to wait until tomorrow when they open everything up again because it’s the holidays here. Did all I could in this situation. Gotta wait now 🫠
Thank you, they asked for more photos of the box and if it had a fragile sticker on (which it did not) etc, so I hope all goes well. 

And yess I know! The M2 is nice, I have the 13inch M2 MacBook Pro from work and it's been great. That's why I decided to get one of my own. 🥲
Oh!..I've seen some people use it as /serious. 😅
Thanks 🫶
I have one from 2021 whose screen is doing perfectly. My brother has one from the same time period, same thing. Does thet qualify as new?
They refunded me because they didn't have it in stock. Currently waiting for them to stock back up so yeaaaah. I'm like...painfully thinking about the M1 air but idk. They have NONE of the M2 base 13inch airs in stock lol. But yeah- it ended well! No issues from their side.
Tak to je masakr docela..hlavně že dostal nový. Tak snad i v mém případě to dopadne. 🙏 Díky za info 🙌
nakupujte na alze… 

Ježíš já ty reklamy mám už v hlavě asi 10 let
Ya, so this sticker is red and that means it was dropped into the ocean. It's definitely not triggered by humidity. Trust me. I'm a genius
I can't send it to Apple since it was not bought from them + we don't have AppleCare+ here. :/
Up to each company, not codified into law
Yeah everyone acting like if you had this you’d be screwed in the US. It’d have to be the shadiest backdoor retailer to *not* get a no-hassle exchange on this even here in the US lol
Not protected by law though.
Yeah I bought a laptop like 3 weeks ago from best buy (US). I still have like 3 more weeks to return it for any reason, no questions asked.
It's alright, let the Euros have this one. They have to spend like 50% more for the same laptop lol.
Oh you poor naive person.
There's no comparison, the EU is far superior to the bought and paid for politicians making consumer laws in North America.
Consumer laws offer protection outside your warranty and return period in European countries.
Hope it goes well for you OP!
Ah, I thought you were talking about the retailer taking 30 days to do a return. If you haven't exhausted those options, I would absolutely try to get the retailer to exchange it rather than get a warranty repair. This would be an open and shut matter with most retailers in the U.S. The EU's policies are even more consumer friendly so I'd expect retailers operating there to be prepared to take care of you without much hassle.
Sorry about this incident, but I don’t know why you think AmEx doesn’t exist in the EU, of course it does. It’s not as widely accepted as VISA and MC but it’s been getting more widespread over the last ten years or so. By now even places like Aldi accept AmEx here. (Of course that doesn’t change whether the store you bought this from would have accepted it. There are still a lot of places that don’t, for sure.)
I’m regularly seeing Amex ads in Germany, for what it’s worth. I don’t know if they are available in any other EU countries though.
I’m sure someone has posted already but Amex is becoming more and more available in Europe. Available in the UK (okay Brexit) but also Ireland, Italy, etc
Don’t let them play with you. You are completely in the right here, both morally and legally, stand for what’s right and make sure you get what you deserve.

Hopefully they just give you a refund/replacement without a hassle, but if they don’t, remember your rights…
Bylo to tak, věděl jsem, že je rozbité, protože mi přestaly fungovat uši, když jsem ho viděl otevřít. Pokud posloucháš pozorně, můžeš slyšet ozvěny ‘kurva’😂😂. Ale žádné starosti a hodně štěstí ve tvé situaci.”👍👍
This comment was downvoted but there’s a video where the reporter broke a MacBook and took it to Louis - Rossmann repair group, worth checking out if you’re in the US which I’m not - and a Genius Bar employee

Genius Bar offered a quote for a 1000$+ dollars (I forget the exact amount, I believe it was close to 2000) and a list of parts. They included pretty much every part except the one that was broken

Louis fixed it for like 50 bucks (or considerably less don’t remember exactly)
That's what Samsung told me when my tab died. And it was suspicious that the only thing that got damaged besides the water damage sticker was the battery connector in the middle of the device. Personally, I've never had an Apple device get a hardware issue (only software issues), but YMMV.

US Consumer Law requires a one year warranty against defects on all devices. This is a defect, and would be covered by exchange or free repair.

Apple in Canada has extended returns from anything bought from Nov 1st to be returned by 8th Jan, probably the same for the US
Depends where, a few states have provisions that require returns be accepted unless the store posts otherwise somewhere conspicuous to the consumer in the store.

Also retailers and manufacturers have obligations under the law in every state to rectify sales of defective products. The pictured laptop would fall into that category.
That’s why I choose to buy from companies that have fair return policies and avoid those that don’t. And once returns are offered, NOT honoring them would really kick in the law (in fact lawyers must be drooling daily just thinking about that possibility). 

So, since it isn’t codified into law as much, companies have the choice to offer reasonable returns or not. Those that don’t, sell less or sell a lot cheaper, the consumer can decide to choose the gamble here. Most of these companies don’t get farther than a corner shop somewhere and bankrupt often.

I’m not in the US but we get a lot of spill from their ways; that problem OP has? with the non codified laws? would have taken couple of hours of that same morning to get a new one (if it is a default model config) with a visit to an AppleStore or Best Buy or wherever it was bought. 

And if not, would get the cash back no question asked to buy another one or anything else.

And if not, ask for a replacement where a return box with a new one would have been sent the second or third next day, where the consumer put the damaged one in and ship it back (the consumer has about 14 days to send it back).

In conclusion, even with un-codified laws, they are still bending backwards to compete for the best possible hassle free return policies and defective products protection.
Yet perfectly legal in the US. That’s the difference, the legality of a No Refund policy. In the EU, that’s a no go when it comes to new tech
Depends on where, in Rhode Island you have 10 days from the date of purchase unless otherwise stated/posted in the store.  


Also, in the condition pictured, this would qualify as defective, meaning that the retailer would be required by law in every US state to either repair the product or accept a return.
Yes, protected by law. A minimum one year warranty is required.
In retail I always ask questions for a lappy return. Primarily did you do the factory reset. Not fun having some random person getting your personal information lol
Thanks!! 🙌
Yeeep, I hope they just exchange it tbh. I submitted a "Delivered package was damaged" thing, now i gotta wait till they open stuff up here and get back to me, as 25th/26th are nationwide holidays here. 😄
AmeX does not serve regular consumers in my country, it's only for businesses. (If those even want to use it)😅
Tak to se mu nedivím. 😅Já jsem jen v šoku zůstal sedět. 😂 
Díky, a přeju hezké svátky. 🙌
Apple replaces entire parts and if it’s liquid damage, it’s a flat rate (which is expensive). Rossman will go in and replace individual capacitors, etc.

The main reason is that it isn’t feasible for Apple’s volume of repairs to spend the time to figure out what individual components on every part can be replaced, and then spend the time resoldering, etc. Apple repairs thousands and thousands of devices.

Neither is inherently wrong. They just prioritize different things. Time vs money. Rossman quotes up to 6 weeks for a logic board repair because they are replacing individual parts on the board, which takes longer to diagnose. Apple will just swap out the whole board in a couple days.

Right to repair, ideally, lets you make that choice for yourself.
It's especially a problem when it's within the market of original sales. They didn't get rich off honoring hardware repair
Haha. Fuck you. Nah just kidding love ya
I'll see what I can do, I live in the EU, Czechia to be exact. If Alza will not cooperate, apple will have to be my only choice. Thank you!
EU requires three years.
 A charge-back on Apple bans you from buying from Apple ever, lol.
Easy fix: don’t buy expensive goods from shady retailers with poor return policies. Any reputable electronics retailer in the US would happily exchange this. All the big names are Apple authorized sellers.
In the US, there are extremely limited circumstances where such a policy could apply to a defective product, especially when sold as new.
We used to do the factory reset anyway, even if it booted up to OOBE. I thought it was a waste of time when I was younger but time and experience have made me wiser and I now understand why the store manager insisted on this.
Didn't mean it literally
Yeah, that's a bummer for sure. I hope your Christmas is otherwise merry! 🎄
I think people will make the choice of the cheaper repair most of the time. Sad to see Apple have positioned themselves as the go to guy for anti-repair shenanigans.

How they know it’s gonna be you buying from them again?
You’re missing the point.
Yeah. That’s helpful.
Except this, it was nice! Hope yours is great as well! 🙌🎄
Oh, so Sweden went and added an extra year to our laws then. I thought we just went with the EU standard.
I think it depends on the price range. At least in my country. (barely eu)
You could've always been referring to one. Nothing proves my point invalid unless something was specified beforehand.

No, I’m not. Just because it’s not signed into law here doesn’t mean us US citizens are any more at risk being stuck with defective electronics. I get that EU Reddit loves to dunk on Americans over topics like this but this ain’t it. I don’t know a single person who has been screwed by the US’s lack of consumer protection laws in scenarios like this unless they explicitly bought an item from a shady non-authorized source. And anyone who does that anyway is a moron and deserves it because it’s extremely avoidable.

Just buy from an authorized source and 99.9999% of the time any defects or issues with a new or warranty period product will either get it replaced or corrected for no expense with little to no hassle.
The point is there, just look at OPs problem. 

I’m not even in the US but we get a lot of spill from their ways, it would have been solved that same morning at an Apple Store or Best Buy or wherever, not in “up to 30 days”. There’s no replacement? Cash back, instantly, buy another model or something else.

Companies compete for the best service and returns, and not honoring a return after being offered does trigger the hammer of the law.

The point is: personally I prefer to be able to fix OPs situation in an hour (and can ignore that it isn’t law for all companies to offer this), than a lawful “in 30 days” for all.

I would understand pressing hard for it if nobody for some reason wanted to offer guarantees, consumers would still continue to buy from those sources, competition somehow didn’t catch that they would sell more than the others if they offered any sort of peace of mind to the buyer… THEN you got a big problem, kind of a perfect storm problem. Is that what happened in the EU?

2 year warranty (25 months, actually) and an additional year of reclamation for a total of 3 years.

Norway is even better: 2 year warranty, 3 year reclamation period, for a total of 5 years.
Dutch warranty laws are basically tied to the price of something, at minimum 2 years from EU laws, but then the reasoning is that if you get a €1000 laptop you should and can expect a longer lifetime than if you get a €300 laptop
Mfw when dont buy from apples website:
'Just because it’s not signed into law here doesn’t mean us US citizens are any more at risk being stuck with defective electronics."

You literally admit you are. You follow this with an explanation to not buy from shady shops and to check the places you buy.

In the EU you don't **need** to do that... because it's signed into law.
