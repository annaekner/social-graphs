I’ve been watching Demon Slayer with my mom, and she never gets the characters’ names right. These are their names according to my mom…
I saw someone do this on the MHA subreddit, so I had to get in on it with Demon Slayer. My mom and I have been watching one or two episodes a day together for the past month or so. She likes it, but she’s always so confused 😂

Dw my mom calls every character Goku.
Of fucking course Muzan is Michael Jackson
Tapioca 😭
Well, she almost got Tanjiro and Nezuko right. 🙌


Pretty unfortunate for Annoying kid and Worm Lady, though. 😭
my mom called Rengoku, Inu Yasha. 😂😂😂
Is your mother’s name ‘Hashibira Inosuke’, by any chance?

Also, some of these are quite accurate (Zenitsu’s especially)
Please tell your mother that “you are right”.
✨Feral pig boy✨
Normalise all parents naming anime characters
This is atrocious. She should at least remember Kamaboko Ganpachiro ....

Jokes aside. I hope she enjoys the Demon Slayer.
lost it at "tapioca" 😂🤣 hard to unhear Shinobu saying "tapioca-san" now
i fucking giggled when she called daddy muzan “Michael Jackson”
is your mother's last name, by any chance, Hashibira?
Feral pig boy 🤣

![gif](giphy|EiCNPURy9WiEAKHRiL)
Lol!!!! The mom had me at Michael Jackson x'D
Annoying kid...

Is your mother single?... Available?
Her description of Haganezuka is very straight to the point 😂
If this is real, at least i'm not the only one who call Gyiu Tapioca, the names sound so close
Tomioka to Tapoica is just too much lmao
She sounds like Inosuke lol
At least she got annoying kid and Micheal Jackson right
At least he got Michael Jackson right 😂😂😂
She isn't that wrong
At least she watches with you😂😂
The only one my mom gets right are Tanjiro, Nezuko, Rengoku and Muzan
I was already cracking up when it got to Inosuke, but I completely lost it at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm your mom. I can barely remember ANY Demon Slayer or My Hero Academia names and I'm super fans of both. I have an easier time with Spy Family because they're all western style names.
Lol that's actually what I called Tengen during his introduction.

"Wow, seems like Everything's Flashy Guy has a whole arc to himself."
Lol can’t say I disagree with her 😂 they’re perfect!
I have gojo ans other anime characters on my wall. And they're all Goku's to my parents.
UMAI!
My mom thinks every anime guy is “boy/girl/man” and anime girls are “hot ones”

LOL 😆 🤣 

She's not wrong though
The Michael Jackson one got me, i’ll never look at Muzan the same again
Annoying kid and worm lady got me😂
Accurate
Last one's accurate
Inoske would agree with your mom
Technically the truth lol
Inosuke should be her favourite character
I understand I know them but still end up botching it
Seems accurate to me lol
All are similar... Most of them
"Tasty Guy"😂.. Lol all of them are pretty much spot on...
poor Tomioka and Muzan xD lmao
I love how even PARENTS say that Kibutsuji Muzan is just Micheal Jackson X'D
As a mom who can't remember any of their names, I LOVE this. I call Zenitsu "French fry guy" or "French fry head." My 11 y/o just looks at me with disgust when I can't remember their names 🤣. Hey I'm trying 🤷
Lol
That's quite accurate!
I can hear the accent from the names.
She at least got one right.
I see nothing wrong here. Carry on mum.
My mom knows Mario does that count
Is your mom the real life reincarnation of Inosuke?
She gave them better names yo
I actually thought Michael Muzan Jackson Kibutsuji was the right name
I convinced my brother to watch it and he calls Tamayo everything but her actual name lol. He called Zenitsu, zenRItsu. Lol
If she says Zenitsu is annoying what will she think of Naruto?😂
Is your mom Inosuke by any chance?
Wdym? Those were all spot on!
I couldn’t even show my mom demon slayer.
Wdym, she got them all right. Inosuke could learn a thing or two from her 😛
I think Feral pig boy told your mom names of the characters 😂
Definitely nailed Zenitsu.
michael jackson 💀😭💀
Be gentile, age will come to you too some day and it will be harder to remember strange names... At the moment, enjoy you can watch anime with your mom and just have fun 😉
Michael Jackson😭😭😭😂😂😂
This is completely accurate
My father calls every character ”Wake sqwueck dragon” (Blue eyes white dragon)💀
Your mum is inosuke
Tasty guy is best guy. Fight me.  
Lol'd at Michael Jackson
wdym? that is Micheal Jackson...
besides Tanjiro and Nezuko she does have a point with these 😂
She’s not that far off 🦋
Is your mom inosuke?
My mom calls everything Kakashi
my dad can’t get names right or remember them either…😔 (all he knows is Genya and Nezuko, and Tanjiro(?))
Micheal jackson is universal
Your mom is based for that third nickname
She got them all right though
lol hahaha tapioca and feral pig boy are my favorites
I mean she ain't wrong though and also is your mother is Inosuke? if so, then you got the best mother in the world
Pretty cool mom you got there willing to watch stuff like this with you. I'm 36 and I still get "when are you going to grow up and quit watching cartoons and playing video games?"

And no I don't live in my parents basement lol, I'm married and we own our house.
She got the last one correct
Imagine her meeting face to face with Inosuke. 😅
The fact that she got the last one right is impressive
No, she's spot on with most of them.
Is she the feral pig boy?
So friggin good.
Fr, everytime I see Rengoku all I hear is: UMAI!
TAPIOCA😭😭😭
I CHOKED ON THE TAPIOCA
Not me, being the one that has to correct my kids constantly on how to pronounce everyone's names.. Am I the odd parent out here??  😮
Tapioca straight up made me lol
LMAO NOT TAPIOCA 🤣

I will say though, Muzan really does dress like Michael Jackson 💀
Based
Number 6 was correct wdym
LMAO NOT TAPIOCA 😭🤣

Daddy Muzan really does dress like Michael Jackson though 💀
Your mom’s inosuke.
LMAO FERAL PIG BOY
I also call Zenitsu "annoying kid" even tho I know his name lmao
OP’s mom ain’t wrong on most of these!🤣🤣🤣
Close enough lol
"Flashy" is repeated more than "Tengen" so it's fair that's what stuck with her
TAPIOCA
I love her names for everyone! 🤣
i mean they’re technically not wrong lol 😂
Good to see everyone agrees Muzan is secretly Michael Jackson
“Tanjino”? Does your mother think Tanjiro is Hispanic or something?
FERAL PIG BOY
Your mom and Inosuke would get along really well
Special :3
Worm Lady is easily my favorite, not what I would expect.
To be fair everyone calls him Michael Jackson... I do too... When we talk about Demon's slayer, me and my husband, he always is "Michael Jackson". She's based to me... Than again I'm a mother too, but I've been watching animes since 1989 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
eh, close enough
Your mom has the Inosuke spirit! I mean that in a good way, of course.
She's not wrong...makes sense ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6756)
Her description of Rengoku to Muzan is pretty accurate tho
Lol your mom is basically a superfan I don't see anything wrong here😂😂
My mom calls Giyu Tapioca too! Rengoku is ‘fire guy’ ‘loud guy’ or ‘loud fire guy’ Nezuko is ‘the creepy one.’ 

When she fist started calling Rengoku ‘the loud guy’ I was like: “Do you know
how little that narrows it down?” 

And when she says ‘loud fire guy’ I still think she’s referring to Natsu from Fairy Tail eight times out of ten. I think that was actually his nickname first.
Atleast Michael Jackson is correct.
your mom actually got it right
Bahaha ! thanks for sharing.
Michael Jackson 😂😂😂
Annoying kid is RIGHT! Go to sleep Zenitsu 😂
Ong to my mom calls Rengoku,  Ranguku or Goku. She calls inosuke hog man, Tanjiro is tangerine, Zenitsu is cry baby, Muzan is Michael Jackson, Giyu is depressed guy, Akaza is blue berry toes, Tengen is the three wives guy, Daki is Taki, Nezuko is Tangerine's sister or demon girl. 

It honestly makes me laugh 🤣
I saw “Tapioca” and I paused because in 2019 I drew this silly doodle of him specifically eating a tapioca pudding cup. It was an inside joke, but it’s so relevant here 😂

https://preview.redd.it/elt6zinn7kfd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=761677379c3407d5833c118428fd31979f3813d6
I cannot unread "Tanjino" lol.  Sounds like an Italian mafia name.
Is your mother inosuke?
Micheal Jackson! Lmao!
The Michael Jackson is so real
Tapioca and tanjino got me dead 😂😂😂
It’s normal. Even Inosuke be like: Kapanchiro, munjiro,…
Not surprised about Muzan Jackson. 

Also some of the other names were funny too
Your mother might be inosuke
You've got 6 right (according to my mom) lol
She did my boy Zenitsu dirty
Honestly, annoying kid should be his name lmao
these are cracking me up
don’t worry mom, i too call tomioka tapioca 💀
My mom calls anime by her favorite arcs. So Demon slayer is Train show and Bleach is Zanpacto. Idk what happened with AOT coz its n*ked babies
inosuke just found his match![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)
In my bedroom hanging Inosuke poster and my grandma just call him "ugly pig"![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)
Are you a Spanish speaker by chance? We sometimes call giyuu "tomioka tapioca" in the Spanish speaking community lol
I would love to see you an your mom watch an episode and give your thoughts about it.
Tapioca is fucking hilarious
Nah, My mum thought giyuu was "water sword guy", like what the hell?
Annoying Kid is The correct name

Seriously
My mom calls every video game system “The Nintendo”
My mom is loving the comments guys! Thank you all ❤️😊
Annoying Kid 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
TAPIOCA

(I'm dying)
That's not tasty guy. He is 🍩 donut
The tasty guy💀 donut
Nahhhh but the Micheal Jackson is FR 😭👍
NOT TASTY GUY 🤣
Is your name inosuke?
ANNOYING KID?! NAH, THATS FOUL
my mom would never sit down to watch this with me so W mom
No no, these are accurate
I CALL HIM MICHAEL JACKSON TOO hahahahahahahaha omg
My God it's inosuke if he was a female
Would smash worm girl
tapioca 😭😭
Your mom is awesome.
Feral Pig Boy is amazing lmao. Also a great metal band name.
Tapioca Guyi
I don’t get it. She got anything wrong?😭
my mom, waking in after missing the scene where tanjiro found his torn up family: he cries too much
At least she got Zenitsu’s name right
She is not wrong with any of them
At least she got Michael Jackson’s name right
So your mum is just Inosuke in disguise? 🤭
Getting Micheal Jackson should net her a positive score though
Tasty guy is awesome.
Mine doesn't even remember the name of the show, everything is Steven Universe to her???
I do the same but Michael Jackson was the best. I can’t unsee it lol
I know someone who called her Octopus lady 😂
Tapioca got me howling
Accurate . Tapioca killed me 😭
Pretty accurate
I’m watching all demon slayer episodes for a second time and just finally getting the names down bc I was more interested in the story than the names. Now, I’m getting my act together and paying more attention to the names. Certain details that were once irrelevant to me are now making more sense.
Netscape!
Theyre pretty accurate tho. Go mom
She's following along just fine😂
I mean she only got the first two wrong.
Really... REALLY?! Everybody knows number one is Gonpachiro Kamaboko!!!
Wait those aren't their names?
My friends and I call Kibutsuji Muzan Jackson
She got the last one right
I also called Giyu “Tapioca” for a while before bothering to learn his name. It is the closest I could get to Tomioka at the time. I love it
Oh I should do this with my mom
Lmfao
Hold up did she really just call Daki, Worm Lady?
Accurate I’d say lol
At least she got Michael Jackson right lol
Damn this Michael Jackson finished me off (old meme?)
Topioka😭
I've read the manga multiple times now and your mom isn't that far behind me to be perfectly honest.
Cap.
Bro my mom calls everything's Goku, Naruto, and Pikachu 😭
I was watching demon Slayer and my dad walked in, he asked why "annoying whiny ginger bitch" (Zenitsu) was so annoying. And when Akaza was fighting Rengoku, he asked "why is the flashy flamy guy so fucking obsessed with food? It's not like it's his last meal or anything.."
I mean the last one is correct
You're trying to tell me that isn't michael Jackson?
inosuoke will be proud at your mom
I really laughted here
But the last one is obviously clayface
Mommynosuke?
I love this so much bc my bf does the same shit
Tapioca
I don’t know what you mean? The only one she got wrong was gonpachiro.
The Micheal Jackson at the end killed me🤣🤣🤣
The Michael Jackson one made me go HEHE out loud.
Valid
tbf! the Zenitsu, Inosuke, Sword guy (I forget his name), Muzan, Rengoku and Tengen correlations are spot on 🤣
She’s channeling inosuke 😂😂😂
Feral pig boy got me rolling off my bed (I probably have a bruise now)



My mom would just mix up names. I remember when she called Nezuko Inosuke on many different occasion.
"Annoying Kid" LMAO, your mom is correct.
10/10 for Zenitsu lol
I mean she's not wrong with muzan being micheal Jackson
Lmfaoooo 😭😭😭
So your mom and Inoske are aot alike...
Wonder what she’ll name the annoying kid later lol
zenitsu being “Annoying Kid” made me rofl
Annoying kid, feral pig boy, and Michael Jackson are spot on, though.
Muzak is accirate
The last one is honestly correct we treat the villain like hes Michael fuckin Jackson if he was a demon in japan and I'm pretty sure the people who made the series knew this.
Michael Jackson though🤣😂😂😂
I’m just jealous that your mom watches it with you. I couldn’t even get my parents to watch into the spiderverse because it’s animated. Animated movies are for kids only apparently. I said it’s one of the best movies ever made and the second one is even better and still a no from my dad. My mom watched but fell asleep.

I said Demon Slayer is anime that is targeted at adults. My mom says she can’t watch it because of the way their mouths move. My fiancé thinks the same way. She loves animated Disney movies and movies like Into/Across the Spiderverse, but doesn’t like to watch anime because of the way their mouths move. 

I’ve still at least gotten my fiancé to watch anime with me. She likes my hero but that’s it. I try to get her to watch Demon Slayer but she doesn’t like when they fight, which is the best part of demon slayer IMO! Lol
My mum knows Tanjiro and only Tanjiro because I asked for a Tanjiro plushie once and now she gets me every piece of Tanjiro merch that we see when we’re out. My bed is just covered in Tanjiro now 😭 and she always says that Tanjiro will protect me whilst I sleep, fending off everything from Michael Jackson to the smallest bed bug (yes she said that).

If you see this mum, I love you but Jesus Christ.

I see nothing wrong with this.
The last one doesn’t surprise me 😂
Well, her nicknames are lowkey canon.
I’m right there with your mom. LOVE the show. Can’t remember their names.
I loved Feral pig boy and Tapioca
She's not wrong about Inosuke
Ok. But the last 1 is perfect.
TAPIOCA??? IS THAT A BRASIL REFERENCE????🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well she got one correct in the end
well she got Michael Jackson right, whatchu complaining about?
at least Michael Jackson is right
The last one really got me😂
She literally got them all right wtf
I don't see anything wrong with these names😌
Some of the names are hard

Ubuyashiki took me 4 seasons to learn. and don't ask me his name
Weird flex but my mom saw Aot with me.
My mom knows how to pernounce there name, but she will call Skinobu a different name just because it irks me. The way she calls her sounds like misubi or something Like that
At least your mom got michael jackson
Does your mum own a hog head mask
That last one’s understandable.
At least she’s closer to Tanjiro’s name than Inosuke 
Congratulations for making useful names for the characters
She got the last one right at least.
Sometimes I say Rengoku like ‘he’s literally the sun 🥰’. But fr, your mom is spot on
I mean she’s not wrong hahahah 😂
lol
https://preview.redd.it/zsd8uzkpxjfd1.png?width=351&format=png&auto=webp&s=69124701af7a116003be461cacbdf9b333313388

hihi
Tapioca had me rolling ngl. Also my mum is the same, Tanjiro is Demo Slai (she doesn't know English, so she doesn't get even the title of the show), the Sister, Shit Boar (Inosuke and Zenitsu made her take pills for headache at least twice), and then the Hashira are just Fire Pillar, Sound Pillar, Love Pillar etc.
You can never go wrong with Michael Jackson
I see. K thing wrong here
I mean, she’s not *that* wrong. I know their names and basically call them the same thing. (Except for Giyu. “Tapioca” kills me!)
Michael Jackson was crazy! Lmao
She's damm right with Michael Jackson 👍🏻😂
at least she got the last one right
The last one is according to the whole fandom
I’m glad we all agree on Michael Jackson being right
TAPIOCA WHY 😭
My friend watched it and said they found that characters thinking out loud/narrating their move so often is very annoying
I mean that is Michael Jackson tho
Tasty guy goes crazy dude🤣🤣🤣🤣
Inosuke's gone and reincarnated again :o
Some of these names are valid lol
Your family doesn’t know anime
My dad and I call Muzan Micheal Jackson too.
Your mother has the inosuke curse with names
Your mother is like inosuke
No no, your mom is right. 😂
"Worm lady" I cant😭
CRAZY WORM LADY IS CRAZYY
How cool mom
Annoying kid, tapioca and MJ checks out
thank you for the loud ass laugh 🤣🤣🤣
Cansino Nozupo Zenizo
Tasty or feral pig boy 😂😂😂😂😂
WORM LADY? 😭😭😭
Once my mum asked me if i can tell her the story and she couldn’t memorize anything so we went with nicknames 

Inosuke: masked boy

Zenitsu: blondie

Rengoku: flame-y

Tanjiro: main character/ brother 

Nezuko: your  favorite 

Mitsuri: marshmallow 

Obanai: snake boy

Enmu: victorian child

( all the upper moons go by ranking)

Tengen: three wife style

Giyu: depresso espresso 

I cant remember the rest
Inosuke looks like a female and he's raising u lol
Michael Jackson got me 😆😆 .
Correct
at least she got Muzan right
Rengoku is indeed a "tasty" guy
So accurate lol your mom knows best
You mom did great! My mom calls Pokémon Pokeman 😭
Why tf tapioca 😭
Nezuku sounds so good
My dad's favourite anime is demon Slayer but every time I say a characters name he doesn't know who I'm talking about so I have to describe them like if I say inosuke he'll be like "Who?" And I'll just say "The pig guy" he just goes "OOOOOH THAT GUY" 🤣

(also Michael Jackson one is valid)
Okay, at least she knows Michael Jackson.
She got the last one right
Lmao
MICHAEL JACKSON HELPPP
😂😂
As a Demon Slayer fan, I understand why she would mistake their names like that, I can't even say 'Tanjiro' properly ❤️😂
annoying kid is so real tho
Micheal jackson 😭
he is really like michael jackson
😂 lol
Michael Jackson’s accurate tho 😂
Your mom has a one of a kind beef with Giyuu 😭💀
I have engraved gojo saturo's name in my mother's memory lol she doesn't know who he is and how he looks but she knows there is a gojo saturo that my daughter likes ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
lol Tapioca!
Feral pig boy goes hard
And that's why every KNY lovers are commenting Micheal Jackson "why you killed Tanjirou and his family?"😂😂
My mom calls every character "Fushiguro", though Jujutsu Kaisen isn't the first anime I've watched.
Ah yes,the Daidus sickness
The last one killed ne
She got mj's name right though
Your mom gets it
She got the last one right
Is your mom Inosuke?
There's always a micheal Jackson
Annoying kid. It's an accurate observation
At least she got the last one right
She got them right tho?
Correct
Is your mother Inosuke?
Wym, she got Michael Jackson right
She got Michael Jackson on point
As a mom who watches it,  and can't get names right. I also call him Tapioca!
lmao but they wrong names are so right
Poor zenitsu, he's hella powerful when he's not scared.
At least she got the last one right
Is your mom Inosuke?
(Also she did get the 3rd character correct)
Well at least she got Michael Jackson right
Accurate names imo

Especually Muzan "Swag" Jackson
That's not your mom, that's inosuke
Tasty guy😭
Michel Jackson is pretty much right
micheal jackson is too accurate
Les noms svp il son trop drôle 🤣😂🤣 nezuku 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She got one right tho
I approve of Tapioca.
She had one name right"Muzan jackson"
MiChEaL JaCkSoN Is AlIvE
So she’s a simpleton
I'm impressed your mom knows a single anime character, much less Goku. Mine would know Pikachu at best
same 🙏😭
I have a gojo poster on my wall and my parents tell me you got another Goku poster?
Is this the anime version of how dads call every game system a Nintendo or a PlayBox?
shout out to the moms who used to call pokemon ‘pokemans’
Both of my parents are calling any anime character Goku, it’s funny as hell
Based mom
This is my dad but Naruto lol
Das my mom too lmao I can only imagine how annoying my brother and I were when we were kids so she remembers
My mom calls them Yu Gi Oh people. My dad cartoons.
“We have Goku at home”

Pulls out Bible Black DVDs from the 90s….
Every anime I watch is Naruto
Hahaha! This reminds me of a game I play with my brother-in-law where I ask if every character we come across at our local fan expo is Goku
Goku is crazy
Do we have the same mom? Everyone above the age of 55 in my family calls every character I watch "Goku".  Then there's pikachu. They know pikachu.
I have a feeling she does it on purpose
Muzan Jackson is quite the *Smooth* Criminal
Why did you just write Michael Jackson twice in your sentence
He really do be looking like MJ.
![gif](giphy|oz8jiKqcBTKnu)
This is definitely what Inosuke calls him.
This one got me too 😂
💀
Ah yes, my fav character, Tapioca XD
My mom calls him that too!
I died at "Tasty" Guy, haha.
Almost is right. And tbf, Zenitsu is supremely annoying. Also she borrowed “worm lady” from Inosuke lol
I meeaaaannnn. 🤣 I can kinda see it.
Indeed. Lol I have joked with her that she’s like Inosuke in the sense she struggles with the names
WAIT SINCE WHEN DID HE HAVE A LAST NAME? How am I not remembering this?
We don’t accept zenitsu slander around these parts
It starts with calling everything a Nintendo or Forknife.


Then it evolves into “Is that skipity do da sigma toilet?”


Edit. While my ringtone still Skibidi from Little Big.
>daddy muzan

Oh no the voices are back.

DADDY MUZAN 🥵
I wish there were a Demon Slayer Quad City DJs mashup but I can't find any.
She is 😂
💀
I was going to say, at least she got one completely correct! =P
Daki aint that hard.
lol same.
UMAI!
Same here! The first time I heard this was back when I was listening to an anime podcast that was discussing the movie train arc!
“French fry head” is accurate. Now I’m hungry for some French fries tho 🍟
lol Lady Tamayo’s name was easy for me, because it makes me think of a tomato sammich w/mayo 😂
I took a risk getting her into it tbh. I started her introduction to anime with Pluto, because I knew its themes would resonate with her. Then I got her hooked on Kaiju No. 8, and then came her introduction to Demon Slayer. I’m thinking MHA is next 😁
I am! It’s actually a lot of fun. She pauses the show every five minutes to ask me questions, which can be a bit taxing at times, but at the end of the day, I’m spending quality time with her and sharing something with her we both enjoy. Sometimes she’ll be so let down by a cliffhanger that she simply must watch the next episode 😁
❤️
We’re monoglots, but that’s funny! Good to know 😁
That could be fun. It could be a series called, “Watching Anime with My Boomer Mom” 😂
I do believe my mom would be a riot.
Muzan jackson is the absolute best name
WeLl MoRe LiKe ReBoRn InTo MuZaN
Ur parents know Pikachu?
My parents dk wat anime is let alone Goku or Pikachu 💀
She knows it because we grew up watching DBZ on cassette 💀 But it's the only character she remembers from that time LMFAO
Never got the chance to ask my dad if he was saying "pokemens" ironically or was just trying to take an interest in his 7yo son. RIP
I was 15 in '99 when I first saw Dragonball Z at my cousin's house in Austin, Texas. Anime wasn't broadcast in my city but my cousin had it on Austin's local channels (I don't know how). I was mesmerized. My mom knew it. We learned the name Goku at that time.
My mom made me watch dragon ball back when I was 5 years old
Ultra Dripstinct
My mom does nintendo even for my PC xD
I had completely repressed that 😂  
Everything you could play a game on was a nintendo or just "vidya game". Never heard playbox tho
Nah mine just calls them gameboy
Oh my lord 😂❤️
Holy fucking shit I have never seen anything more relatable 
How did you get the Kaburamaru thing, I want one 😂
Mine usually calls everyone Yukio (Yu-Gi-Oh!) or Narudo (Naruto but replace the T with D)
My 9 year old is obsessed with saying this
Plot twist: Kibutsuji’s real blood demon art is dance fighting like MJ in the 1990 Sega Genesis game, *Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker*
That’s my head cannon now
Tapioca… which is better? Tapioca gummy, or Tapioca ginger?

(Also my fav character)
Based  opinion  to be honest
I can't unsee it now 🤣🤣

After he finishes beating up Zenitsu for blocking Nezuko’s box
True, but easy to forget since her character is only in one season. Hell, I don’t remember most of the 12 Kizuki names, and a couple of the hashiras’ names are even a bit fuzzy lol.
https://i.redd.it/2k7hu9z75ifd1.gif
Before 1/11 this year, she had something against what the show name was for religion reasons. I kept telling her that this was not the case that these were different. Then I have to call her out for the stuff she watches.
I figured. If you ever do, please post a link here so that I may watch it.
My mom knows Naruto, Goku and Vegeta since she grew up with them for some time as a child in the 80s and then we watched DB as children as well while eating with her.
Dragon ball and Pokémon were fairly common kids shows back in the day, can guarantee most millennials' parents would know at least one
Dude, my dad asked why we were watching "cartoon" at 11 PM.
P.S. It was Death Note
HEE HEE
Why is your 9 year old watching a show designed for young adults?
*Hee hee* *shamoneh*
That's honestly amazing, I love it. 🤣🤣
I must have forgotten after so long.
I doubt it will come to fruition, but if I do, I will. 😊
Naruto was in late 90s early 2000s
Your mom watched naruto as a child?! How old is your mom?! and how old are you... 😂
I’m surprised he knew his own name 😭
he forgives you
Happy cake day
I meant DB, her brother grew up with Naruto later on.
Definitely not late 90s, the manga wasn't published till 1999, the show started some time in 2002
She didn't but her brother did later on, while my grandparents just watched sumo lmao. She did watch some Dragonball as a teenager tho. She's 47 and I'm 19.
Like u said it was published in 1999, which is the late 90s by definition
Ngl thats pretty awesome, none of my friends or even my brothers would watch anime if i even paid them to
Wow, that really went over your head...  
  
He was talking about watching anime and I'm trying to tell you that her watching it in the 90s is literally impossible since the MANGA didn't even exist until 1999, and unless you think his mom was a huge weeaboo who not only imported brand new unknown japanese mangas, IN JAPANESE BTW, i think we can with great certainty say she didn't read it, and definitely not watching it in the 90s since it didn't even exist yet.
Me and my sister grew up together in the early 2000s watching Great Mazinger (which even my mom watched as a child) in Italian tv. It's truly the best meca anime out there.

Nowdays I've got closer to my sister again in life, so we watched together Attack on Titan, Baki, Overlord, HxH and many more anime, she's only 25 so it's good to have someone to watch things with.
I would be furious
But how can tanjiro smell emotions??

But did you know Zenitsu can hear emotions? It actually happened in one of the light novels...
I'd assume it's better than having him say he wants to smell my armpits, but that's just me
like, wth anger smells like anyway? 💀

Honestly different emotions do smell different due to biochemistry.

Fear is bitter and so is pain to a lesser degree, anger and rage is acrid, joy is light and somewhat sweet, happiness has a sunshine/amber note to it, sadness has a musty or heavy note and arousal... well that scent is distincty yet complex and the easiest to pickup, but different person to person.

But these scent notes are layered on top of the person's base scent, so it's easier to know when they are someone close to you or who you interact with often so their base scent is something you know.

My sense of smell isn't the norm but I always thought others got this to a lesser degree.

I am empathetic but these scents also let me know how people are feeling sometimes.

It also helps me when picking out perfumes/colognes as a gift as I can pickup on what would work with the base scent.
Nah, she seemed more relieved than mad.
Regarding the question about tanjiro being able to smell emotional status of a person everyone release pheromones just like a dog knows when the owner pregnant or in distressed, tanjiro is capable of smelling those pheromones too and the trio is based around senses
Tanjiro is smell he can use his nose like a dog
Zenitsu is hearing he can detect sounds like an directional microphone 
Inosuke is tact he can sense air vibrations and can feel when people are looking towards him like a sixth sense
That’s hilarious 😂😂😂
Tanjiro diff :3
Could never be me
I fucking died reading this😭🙏
This is how I feel when it comes to Sanemi.
LMAO 😭😭
But u already mad

I would probably throw him off the roof

GIRLY I HAVE THE SAME IMAGE

I WAS GONNA INCLUDE IT BUT I DELETED IT FROM MY CAMERA ROLL SO
Imagine making your uncontrollable rage constantly for the fandom to say yr happy and joyful. I would snap.
Womp womp
I wouldn’t believe my ears 😆
Well, he's not wrong...
Tanjiro is part Labrador.   Dogs can smell human emotions by detecting chemical changes in the body that happen due to moods.
This makes the situation much more funny to me
He didn’t skip nose day
Its funny to wonder if he just guessed and didn't actually use his supernatural smelling.
Why is that so relatable
I'm still sad how she went. Just such a brutal end to her character. It's fitting though and isn't a bad end to her character at all. I feel like out of all the hashira who were 'grounded' she was probably one of the more developed ones of the bunch.
Tanjiro:

The Kamoboko squad is just the personified versions of the five senses.
WHAT IS THAT ABOVE YOUR MESSAGE!?!?!??!?!!
At least that can be explained, like when people talk, and he's very acute to the tone (and therefore the emotions) of the people talking.
Bro that makes sense because anyone can hear emotions lol and with zenitsu’s hearing it’s even worse
Do tell
bro wtf, lemme guess Inoske at can hear colour and see sound

Very true
It’s a flair
Theoretically, certain emotional responses elicit different hormone expression which could affect the smell of a person… but it would be so subtle that Tanjiro legit has to be superhuman to catch it. Also it’s funny that we never see him suffer from enhanced sense of smell because that sounds like a NIGHTMARE. My mom is just sensitive about average but bad smells throw her off very quickly

Sorry about those downvotes, but you're right. Rengoku is awesome
good bot
Inosuke got enhanced sense of touch, that's why he needs to be shirtless all the time. Beast breathing let him sense thing from really far away. He also got enhanced 6th sense. 

Kanao is the one with enhanced vision.
Second one, Tanjiro-Smell, Zenitsu- Hearing, Inosuke- Touch, Kanao- Sight, Genya- Taste
https://preview.redd.it/8qzwi6i9tzpd1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d58936d348f7dd4fcddafd1d02c93a744b3b042
There’s a fun theory about how different breath users have enhanced senses.

Water breathers have enhanced smell: (Urokodaki, Tanjiro)

Thunder breathers (and derivatives) have enhanced hearing (Tengen, Zenitsu

Wind breathers (and derivatives) have enhanced Touch (Sanemi, Inosuke)

Flame breathers (and derivatives) have enhanced Taste (Renkogu, Mitsuri)

Flower breathers have enhanced sight (Kanae, kanao)

It also led to the theory that Genya could have been a flame breath user
Yeah, I knew I was probably wrong about that, thanks for the information mate 🏴‍☠️
I really wish we got to see Kanao’s *special eyes* before the penultimate arc…
Pretty sure him being shirtless is cus he was raised in the wild

Ironic (>!She becomes blind in an eye after the final battle!<)
Enhanced vision until the vision wasn’t very enhanced anymore… she could probably count as legally blind by the end of the manga
Genya makes a lot more sense.  I was thinking nezuko specifically couldn't taste, because demon eat human.
https://preview.redd.it/k01e122ytzpd1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=539afa0fd80103611c1f78d9612ae46d7e8c54a5
Genya didn't *taste* anything, he just *ate* the demons' flesh. I don't think he has a very enhanced taste, or else he wouldn't be able to eat demons (I suppose demon flesh is yuck).
Nice theory 
I like it and there is material to argue your points.

Not seeing the Genya part too much but the others are very interesting.
Stone breathers are just built different
It’s probably both
Have you ever put something on a cat for the first time? They get so confused lol I imagine inosuke would've the same problem
The manga ended but some people are anime only, y'know  
don't spoil
Well, Nezuko is more of the heightened sense of all 5 since she's a demon, while Genya not only has the most strongest jaw but can also get the powers of a demon after eating it
🤨📸
The Genya theory sort of has it that: Genya tried to learn Wind breathing to be like his brother, but not being attuned to it, he couldn’t learn it, twin that with his abilities to eat/ie taste demons, it lead to a theory that he was attuned to flame breath, just that nobody realised, and by that point, Rengoku was dead.

It’s better than the “Genya is Asthmatic” theory IMO
Stone breathers actively Nerf themselves to make it a fair fight against the demons
Probably because cats have no concept of clothes and think it's a trap
Yeah I just forgot genya existed
Genya couldn’t use basic breathing techniques regardless of which type of breathing. The issue wasn’t that he was trying to learn wind, he would’ve been able to make a modicum of progress even if he wasn’t attuned to it.

Shinobu when she sees this:
BRUH MITSURI TOO-

I literally read it, took a picture, and posted before reading any more lmao
It sounds weird af by modern standards but in the Taisho Era that’s just a pretty standard compliment for a woman, especially for someone raised hyper-traditionally like Tengen.

This would be giyus reaction
He said **"GYAT!"**

Also, Tokito's thoughts on Tomioka!!! 😂 "He's just sort of there." 💀
I read this before and I like how almost every hashira has this honest thoughts about each other while Gyomei was like: "I'm gonna confirm every fan's ship and spill the tea on who likes who"
tengen really wants to have 5 wives then
Tengen trying to catch wives like pokemon.
Regoku's face 😂
Man said, and I quote: “Would” to both of the female hashira wtf
It's a phrase that old people used to describe fertility. [safe birth delivery body type](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/zh-hans/%E5%AE%89%E4%BA%A7%E5%9E%8B)
Apparently, it's a compliment back then, which makes sense because birth back then usually led to death
Wait is the data book in ther world cuz if all the hashira read it…. I would love to watch there reactions😅😂🤣

What the fuck did I just read?

Edit: I just noticed he said the exact same thing for Mitsuri.
HE DID IT TO MITSURI TOO OMG
WHAT hips Uzui, she's 37kg 😭
Not surprising coming from a guy with three wives…..
It’s poor phrasing for “child bearing hips.” (Not as bad as the direct translation of “deliverable butt” though.) The point he’s getting at is that she’d be capable of birthing healthy babies without dying. Childbirth is as the number one killer of post puberty age women in that era (and basically any era before that). Tengen’s back story focuses on the deaths from childbirth women in his life experienced, so he’s not being a lech to say it.
‘Good hips for giving birth’ is fucking insane
>He's just sort of there


Muichiro is such a mood fr

Flashy opinion :3
Bratty 🤣
Everyone complains about Zenitsu (a teenage boy) being perverted, but Tengen says stuff like this and no one bats an eye.... I'm going to get downvoted, aren't I? (⁠;⁠ŏ⁠﹏⁠ŏ⁠) He's still a good character though, just a bit... Ummm, well... It's pretty obvious...
HE A FAN HE A FAN HE A FAN
Nah but why is he commenting on all the women's hips like that 😭

Bro has no enemies (except demons)
This whole time he’s been a hip man.
Yall need to chill, it was a compliment back then because childbirth could lead to death and wide hips reduced that risk 😭
this is hilarious
TENGEN ?!?!
I DROPPED MH PHONE AND SCREAMED SO LOUD I SWEAR WHYY
HE EVEN SAID THE SAME THING TO MITSURU

WHAT
He literally said that the only two female Hashiras “have good birthing hips”
Man has only one thing on the mind besides flashiness 😭

Wtf with "good hips for giving birth " ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise) BTW giyu's description is best.
Muichiro saying Giyuu "like sorts of there" boy you're him but just younger!?
Are we also not mentioning Mitsuri as well😭🙏
These always made me laugh. None of the other Hashiras gave positives for Giyu lol
Wait... what?⚡
XD someone post the entire book, i gotta read this LOL
"he's just sort of there" 😭 felt
I don’t see anything wrong with it lol.
Poor giyuu the most abused hashira :(
GURL- HE HAS FOUR WIVES- WHY DOES HE NEED MORE??
He said it on Mitsuri too
He's just sort of there 

Ooof
What book is this?
I guess he may have considered both of the lady Hashiras as potential wives with those comments and I don't blame him.
Help I read this wrong and thought they were calling tengen's hips good for birth 😭
No way did Tengen said that to Mitsuri and Shinobu
Not him calling Sanmei a bratty boy 😭
Well "child bearing hips" was a common saying back then so, pretty normal for during the era standards. Also back then wasn't it considered blessed to have a big family?
He says that about mitsuri too like yeah no shit Sherlock they're women 
What the hell Tengen
I hope he is talking about Gyomei's body size
https://preview.redd.it/kq6adl2ihh9d1.jpeg?width=582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3c7b71d4f9d8ef875b5bd551ccd88056273a5a0
I really want to like Tengen, but he's such a pig. Of the two female hashira, his final thoughts are 'they are good for making children.' Honestly, it'd be less offensive if he just said 'has nice tits/ass.'

He's shown to have depth and to actually care about his wives, and I can only hope his shit behavior towards other women is just a front but ug. I want someone to punch him in the face so bad (Akaza maybe).
Tengen's right asf 🥵🥵
It was a complement back then
Tengen ain’t wrong though
Please tell me which book this is
Where'd you find this lmao
Looks like tengen wants kids👁👄👁
It is hard in the medium to deduce if the grammar issues are intentionally part of Tengen's character or just the difficulties of translating from one languages grammar to another. 

Japanese grammatically and from a word choice perspective is a lot more simple and straight forward than English. A lot of English translations will add synonyms of words and extra descriptors to try to make it sound more like the tone. However sometimes translators infer a different tone than what the panel indicates which can create unintentional changes.

Even though everyone in Japan has to take mandatory English classes, it is still not a strength for them. The poor grammar could just be the translator for that dialogue being too literal or not seeing an issue with the English grammar. Or it. Could be intentional... just hard to tell.
What book is this from? and is it worth buying?
That why he the goat fr.

Is this a special volume? Or what
Honestly, birthing hips are a must. Don’t blame him
Well, he was brought up to think of female ninjas as expendable so at least our boy’s taking baby steps in the right direction.
I about spit out my food
where can i get this book?
Bruh, he had one mutual detail for each of the lady Hashira, and it's their hips.

https://i.redd.it/tsmus8dj3m8d1.gif

But he ain’t wrong.
My dude is on the hunt for the best birthing hips possible
Haha tengen

  
Anybody know his location?
The good hips for giving birth is killing me 😭
Bet, shinobu😍😍😍😍
Tengen always on the lookout for wife #4
its all about the hips
When people remember that wide hips=less chance of death for mother and child when giving birth 😯
For a sec I thought it was her opinion on Tengen.
You gotta upload for all
Um......wtf Shinobu
Well no shit females have good hips for giving birth ( Mitsuri has it too )
good hips for giving birth...
Bros planned the 4th and 5th wives fr
Bro, if you read Shinobus comment on Tengen, it just disproves that shinobu can blitz tengen and stab him in the eye. Also, he was seriously weakened
Good hips for giving birth though.
where can I get this data book?
I can’t keep defending my boy like this 😭

Read Mitsuri’s never mind that’s just Tengen being his weird traumatized self 💀
And Mitsuri’s lmao
Giyu: "He looks sad all the time."

Rengoku: "He's kind and flashy."

Mitsuri: "NICE ASS-"
Where can I find this ? 😫
Tengen's just horny
lol so what are bad hips then?😂
Apparently it's like some sort of compliment in Japanese culture?
tengen really just said "shinobu and mitsuri have a fat ass"
Wait till he sees that Mitsuri’s is the exact same
I mean.. did he lie?
Well he ain't lying.

Shinobu gave Mucchino a "she" ermh no.
In that era, it is considered to be a compliment back then because women at that time it was difficult for them to give birth. And it is there tradition to have a big family.
MITSURI TOO? Does he just think “good hips for giving birth” everytime he meets a woman. ALSO WHAT DOES GOOD HIPS FOR GIVING BIRTH EVEN MEAN

Can we please get all the others? I wouldn't be able to get this book because of where I live.
where did you read this from???
Same for Mitsuri

I wonder if he thinks the same for his wives as well
Tengen when he sees a woman :
I wonder what those hips can do
A summery for all the female hashira’s is that they all have good hips for giving birth.
Look at Misturi's
Post Giyu’s opinion on em all
What’s the name of this book?

(Tengen also says the same thing as Shinobu for Mitsuri)
Well he's not wrong
He says the something about the love hashira. Combined with having 3 wives and the only Hashria to actually be married it's likely he has a big obsession about birthing.
It isn't that big of a deal
What about Mitsuri's?
Ah, a hips man. A man of culture
Mitsuri's too😭
I mean.. am I wrong?✨✨✨
"Your sons a sick man with sick thoughts"
Shinou and mitsuris is vile lol

not many people have read this so they dont know he said it but LIKE?????
Wouldn't that be a compliment?/gen
why is shinobu saying she to men lmao
Nahh tengen is wild
That’s a real compliment I’ve heard in my country

Tengen @ women:
hey what book is this? i want to buy it
He said it about Mitsuri too 😭 bro is fiending
It’s crazy how universally loved Rengoku was by all of his peers.
He's not wrong
Why did I think that was Shinobu's take on tengen
Does the data book come with the boxset or do I have to buy it individually?
Is this volume 15?
him and birthing hips 😭
We got to remember this is not modern times this is after world war 1 right when Japan was being westernized there's going to be some weird shit in there he probably meant it with good intention now is this socially acceptable for the times I have no idea someone's smarter than me probably will explain it better and I'm not defending his actions I'm just explaining it of why he might say it
Lmfao giyu is just sorta there is crazy 🤣
Tengen @ an 18 year old and his friend’s apprentice: let me impregnate you
He says the same thing about kanroji
wait can you post the cover of the book? i don’t know which one this is!
dont forget mitsuri 😭
he said the same thing about mitsuri but im dying at mui saying "he's just kinda there" for giyuu
I mean..  Can you blame him with the hips thing.  Though I agree more with the overly flashiness of the other girl though. Even for a boob guy like myself,  it's such an aggregating design choice with these sorts of characters in anime. 
UM-
Can anyone give me a link to this?
I must see the rest!
Ew. That’s gross.
nah, Shinobu knows something no one else does 😭
What book is this?!
“Child bearing hips” was a Standard compliment in traditional societies, just a change of times in this sensitive ahh generation.
He basically just said that Shinobu has the best ass out of all the Hashira 🤣
Me low-key
He said the same thing about Mitsuri. Tengen, watch out for Obanai 💀
Mitsuri too???
What’s with his grammar, he was using somewhat correct terminology to describe what the others are like? You sure you don’t need to hit the books g?
is my reddit tripping why is every single comment in one thread
Why does Tengen like Rengoku's flashiness but finds it weird in Mitsuri? Make it make sense 😭😭
He's quite the ladies' man.
Uzui Tengen and his love of child bearing hips
She got the girth for the birth, know what I'm sayin?
It looks bad, but it's a compliment for the time, lmao
Tengen out here looking for his fourth wife

What tengen said about Mitsuri
not mitsuri too 😭😭😭
Bro Tengen Really Wanted 5 Wife's
Which book is this?
I feel so sorry for Tengen at the moment lol.  
SHINOBU YOU ROCK!
Based and true
WTF?!?! TENGEN HAD BETTER HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS SHIZZ!!
….gives me a few flashbacks when I was growing up as a young preteen girl and was commented on having “birthing hips”

Lots of dismissive comments in this thread too 😭
As a female, it wasn’t “fun” or “appreciative” to get such comments, ya know? 💀

She do got birth giving hips (put a bullet in me already)
Tengens got good taste
Tengen got his priorities straight ig
What about muichiro’s comment about her at the bottom?  Thought it said she likes to swallow!
I don’t blame Tengan, I would love Shinobu to Conceive My Child💜

This pic is good now I'm gonna steal it from you, thanks👍
No she wouldn’t saying women have wide hips was a compliment back in the taisho era
didn't yall read mitsuri?
With that exact smile too💀
Ahahah
Where to read the rest of these?
Need to see gyomei
"BRUH"

god how I wish this sub didn't have so many children. I guess that's what standard for mainstream anime
When a Chad is written by an incel.
Somehow when u think of Tenten hyper traditional isn't the word that comes to mind. Considering the era it would look like traditional to us though
For a long time it was actually seen as a plus to be broadly built and a bit heavier. It signified food wasn't an issue for the person. (Usually then a sign of wealth). For women it also meant birth was less likely to have complications. (Underweight with narrow hips could lead to more stillbirth or even death for the mother in child birth prior to modern medicine.) Another reason why everyone used that ridiculous white powder and makeup. It was to prove you don't work the fields to show a sign of status.

It is only a relatively recently in terms of human history trend of women needing to be super skinny, men desired to muscular/tone and everyone tan. If you look back at even the early movie stars of Hollywood you van see how some of the male actors were considered incredibly hot but all of them have basically an "active" build. Not overweight but no ridiculous hypertrophy. It was the late 70s to 80s fitness craze in America that promoted excessive hypertrophy of male stars and  emphasized the skinniness of female stars as the beauty standard.

Now being in shape is the sign of status because it often means you have the ability to take the time out of your schedule to train. Can afford the proper nutrition and equipment/memberships. Your single parent working two jobs doesn't have that kind of time.
Actually, it's based on his brother. Tengen brother would sleep with women not caring for their own safety as during this time, death during or after pregnancy were high. So, to not be like his brother, Tengen rates wide hips, which increase the like of survival after birth very highly.
I think so too! Also considering how he was raised where women are kind of less than and are given to the men to be baby machines.

VERY nice birthing hips
Very
It was a common compliment for women back in the Taisho Era.
I was thinking the exact same thing
He isn’t wrong though
tbf, i deem Shinobu's weight one of the most unrealistic thing besides some BDAs. She literally has god core strength with muscular gyatt and thighs on top of body weights of poison. no way she is 37kg.
She isnt 37 kg, the author just has no idea how weight looks, other characters also have whack weights, pair this with very strict focus on weight in japan over just how someone looks
Ehhhhh, he’s kinda being a lech about it. But it’s just not a joke that translates well. He’s saying “Nice ass,” in a relatively polite and circumspect way (for his time).
I think what Tengen said was actually a compliment back then. Personally I don’t think he’s perverted, but I respect your opinion!

Also, I will die on the hill that Zenitsu is a good character who suffers because the author decided to impose the ‘perverted character’ trope on him, which is apparently popular in Japan.

(I mean, he might have had *some* pervy moments anyway due to being a teenager, but I don’t think it would be nearly as bad.)

Edit: Honestly though, he’s not that bad to begin with.
Tengen is hot! And flashy. So all is forgiven😇
Classic Flirting vs Harassment 
It was a compliment not a perverted thing.
everyone seems to forget he slapped Aoi's behind
FREAKY AHH NİNJA HE A 6* GOD
Actually most of the hashira said neutral/positive things for Giyuu, except for Sanemi and Obanai. Tengen wasn't insulting Giyuu here, he just wanted him to be less somber
Rengoku basically just says he's quiet but works hard. Sounds positive to me
Mitsuri actually called him adorable. That speaks for something. And Gyomei’s observation of him is neutral…. But he’s a blind man 😛

I thought that first as well but all the other grammar looks fine so idrk lol

I did see some people saying that the meaning of what he said was lost in translatino so maybe the grammar was also lost in translation and while it was cool and funky in japanese it's just incorrect in english

As for whether or not it's worth buying I'd say really only if you've read the entire manga. For me, I speedran the manga in a day so that I'd forget most of it and thus be able to enjoy the anime as if I was watching for the first time, so this is probably gonna sit on my shelf for a few years now until it finishes airing LOL

That said if you have finished the entire manga it is 100% worth getting since it's not too expensive and has a ton of cool stuff including bonus epilogue content (which I'm dying to read and barely holding off lol)

Bruh his sentence structure is wack for like half of them lol, not to mention starting sentences with and which technically isn’t wrong but it just reads really bad. Also “With good hips for giving birth” is completely incorrect lol
But you do call yourself Vergil's submissive fleshlight so it evens out.
I feel like Gojo and Tengan would be Great Friends
Shinobu has the same voice actress as Yamato from One Piece, Maria Campbell from an Otome anime that's too long to write and I'm lazy, it's about a villaness. Yor from Spy x Family. Kaguya from Fairy Tail. Himawari from Boruto. Rachel from Tower of God. Ikaros from Sora no Otoshimo, etc.

Kyojuro is so wholesome with his description of everyone. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
Rengoku being the most humble always gets me 😭😭 I love him
Sanemi checking in on her whenever they meet, that's fucking wholesome.
Where can i find this? Id love to read more of these
Flame Hashira always the best guy 😭😭
Sidenote but the way Rengoku has only positive things to say about everyone 🥲❤️
I love how she says that she loves Mitsuri. It‘s too cute 😭😭😭
Where can I read this? I couldn’t find it online
lol Kyojuro is like I LOVE EVERYONE -
The Sanemi one😭😭man I love him sm
How can i get it online 😭😭
She really had to mention "in swordsmanship" lol
(Jetstream) SAM???
why are there amogus in her eyes ??????
I bought it for $20 CAD [here](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1974736024?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) since I couldn't find it online. Be warned like most of the book is talking about the final battle so if you're anime only or like speedran the manga so you'd forget the details then probably not worth the purchase? If you'd like I can send you pics of the other Hashira's and their opinions about the others. If you have read the entire manga though absolutely worth the buy esp since the end of the book is filled with bonus epilogue chapters which I am SO tempted to read but am holding off on them lol (I'm one of the people who did the speedrun thing)

He’s traditional enough to have a harem, just like his family has done before, lol
I think he meant something different about his only surviving little brother.

It‘s true! There is the obvious ones like Obamitsu and Giyuu and Shinobu, but I lost it at Sanemi‘s "He likes Kanae“ 😭
No wonder bro is mad 24/7 if his girl got murdered
make him the 1st, now he have 6 wives, hell yeah
already included
Well, to be fair you are judging a guy from the early 1900s lol. Tough to apply modern standards
It’s obvious Tengen would be sexist by today’s standards. He objectifies his wives and treats them like shiny objects instead of human beings.
No.

But he needs to keep his eyes away from my wife. Especially when he already has three wives of his own. 🦋

What do the percentages at the bottom mean?
What is your favorite image of Tengen?
Muscular gyatt 😭
I mean even if the author isn't really educated on weight it's still the stated fact in the manga which makes it canon :p I do agree the author didn't think the weights through, Mitsuri for example is also relatively light/average for a girl when due to her muscle density she should be a lot heavier
Yeaaa I don't think zenitsu is nearly as bad as some animes I've seen lol. I think of him as more as the comedic relief, he was hilarious in the entertainment district arc, I loved his snide comments lol.

It was spanking, normal for the time, also normal in many countries today.
Lmao I can’t believe it took this long for someone to put the 2 together.
ha. nah, i don't use discord.
I’m sorry u got confused he has three right?
Thank you!
Which one???
*complimentary Official Databook/Fanbook.
Okay! Thanks for letting me know :) I think i’ll go ahead and buy it, then :)
Okay yeah I have that one, sick. Thanks!
ok thank you
That is consensual, fam. Big difference lmao

Comments towards me when I was a preteen during puberty while I was too naive to truly understand what men meant wasn’t consensual at all☺️🥰
Funny how Tengen has the same EN voice actor as Sukuna
no because gojo covers his flashy eyes up and holds back his powers. which isn't flashy.
For real, pick one wife Tengen 😂
He's everyone's big bro 🥰
bro is too pure and innocent
I suspect it is because he senses they both have anger issues lol
These are in the second fan book :>
I’m guessing it’s in the manga somewhere but I’ve only seen the show so far
Is it available in India?
Could you post or comment  Iguro and muichiro please
I am surprised no one asked giyu's pov , can you please share? Also shinobu
lmao love how my boy is so into pointing out who likes who
Gyomei has tea on EVERYONE!!!
How is he the one to know who likes whom? Well I guess that’s how Gyomei sees.
He's just telling everyone's business, sir that's not what we asked 😂😂
I need to read this 😂😂😂
My b I Kay be stupid lol

Then 6 cause Rengoku is an honorary wife
...brother, what? Didn't he go out of his clan's traditions to tell his wives they are NOT objects?
That’s like the opposite of what he does???⚡️
He literally told them they weren't objects. If he saw his wives as baby factories, he'd dispose of them ASAP. Did you watch the fucking show?
Did we watch the same show or..?
I think you skipped most of Tengen flashbacks, that's exactly the opposite of what he does telling them to think on their own and they're not objects
Bro what? That's literally the opposite of how he treats his wives
Dude's been watching Demon Layer 💀
Someone does not understand Tengen’s character at all, lol. Or saw the flashbacks where he made a point of treating Makio, Suma and Hinatsuru as persons instead of just brood mares (like his brother did) with their ass.
Bro's watching Devil Killer lmao

"He's like a decorative object"

He did not have to be this savage😭
Open mindedness I think
    
EDIT: No wait it actually says level of openness meaning how open they are to others.

It's this one
[deleted]
Isnt this death to the author? If the author is just kinda wrong you can dismiss whatever they say.
I think something that helps is that pretty much all his "pervert" moments are more "stupidly infatuated." Still bad, but he's not actively groping people like Mineta. Plus, we see him early on protecting Nezuko's box from Inosuke without even knowing who she was, solely because Tanjiro, the guy he met a few hours ago, said it was important. He's a good guy, just cringy at times.
![gif](giphy|GRk3GLfzduq1NtfGt5|downsized)
You don’t spank someone else’s kid. Also within the context of him kidnapping her I think it was a pretty bizarre thing to do. I still like him as a character, but let’s not pretend that wasn’t weird
Oh I meant here on Reddit lol
Yeah I think so unless he got another one in the manga or something
It's the databook, I got it [here](https://www.amazon.ca/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-Yaiba_Corps-Records/dp/1974736024/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CO33TCLSRQWU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kPc82aJOrk8NsVnLSMVKBA0byu7iRWns-h8moC0vSkDU1gOHFBwghAJY4e-x-1ePzKvkvnBiPb7RHo1fcq_KKD--tjW1-yeWQn8MqgbB34hkSWbXY39rJuzVH7pU0IpRKEcgtkg-EInV8XMbfShIvloLFvSCwTP6f8BNyfTu77eQQjbX5-YWMCOLmQeuGx20IwWkjeAlFALr2SAWKGyJrI0bixjMyLqzG7zSE35TMk0.5klAJfNJpnlx3JVeg9667yC92_g4YdnZlYjTEkhMOUQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=demon+slayer+data+book&qid=1719344979&s=books&sprefix=demon+slayer+data+boo%2Cstripbooks%2C80&sr=1-1)
Where can I find it?
Np!
Oh yeah no fuck that, that's obvi, I've had men tell me that when I was 13 before 

But Vergil fleshlight is wild tho
Wow Really? Interesting
Really? I didn't notice that, and Tengen's EN voice actor stands out to me. I've noticed him in a lot of things. Maybe it's the way Sukuna talks that throws me off. The majority of the DS EN cast also voiced the majority of the 7DS EN voices. 

I did notice, though, (all of these are the EN versions btw) that Sanemi's VA is Gojo's. 

Yahaba (the arrow demon who had the arrows in s1) is Toge's voice.

The Spider Mother Demon's voice is Maki's as well.

There's a few others I recognise but they're from 7DS and not Demon Slayer. It's cool how often shows overlap when it comes to voice acting.
I'm still mindblown that The voice Actor of Zenitsu is the Same Voice actor that does Dabi in Japanese
Fuegoleon too
Edit: Has the same voice actor in Japanese
Huhhhhhhhh huuuhhhhhhh huuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😧😧😧😧😧🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨😧😧🫨
I swear to god, Ray Chase has one of the coolest voices. Huge fan of his work, from the Owl in AOT to Tengen in Demon Slayer
Well, he’s too powerful and holds it back for other peoples safety, also In the 2nd season, didn’t he start wearing Sunglasses?
I like he didn't bother to twisted what he said about the wives into a positive, unlike what he said about Shinobu & Giyu, lol,
Yes that could be

But Sanemi was close to Kanae (Shinobu's sister) before she died. And I feel that's why he checks up on Shinobu often.

Yep check dm
Yeah that also confirm to us that giyu x Shinobu isn't a thing
He senses everything
In one of the light novel he was able to know kanae and Shinobu are sisters by sensing their aura so maybe he did the same here
Idk if you already looked it up, but if not someone posted it in the comments here:

She is not someone else kid, she is a demon slayer who ranks below him.

Just like a General punishing a cadet.

Thanks!
It’s not a one sided relationship promise 🥰 LMAO
Lots of talented VA's, that's for sure. Always cool to see what other characters they voiced
He’s also Kamina from Gurren Lagann
And Alex’s Le does the English VA for Zenitsu and Sung Jin Woo, talk about range of characters lmao
He also voices Choso in JJK and Neuvillette in Genshin. Goated VA
non bedazzled sunglasses aren't gonna be flashy enough.
You're right, it *is* canonically because of her sister.

"He's just sort of there" to Giyu.
Muichiro, with all due respect, don't do my man like that😭😭
the way he compares every other hashira to an animal but for giyu it's "he's just sort of there" 💀
"he's a monkey" Frieza?
Of course muichiro would compare them all to animals
Aw I love how he calls Mitsuri very cute. She is so adorable and my unintentional favorite.
He was the one who saved them from the demon attack years ago.
No wait it actually says level of openness meaning how open they are to others.

Stardust Memory on a CRT

Giving big Top Gun energy
godamn does that intro slap! everytime man
I GOT A BURNING HEARRRRT
God I love Stardust Memory.
0083 on blu ray looks better than any modern gundam today. Besides Hathaway's Flash and maybe Cucuruz Doans Island.
Every day I regret not holding onto my old CRT. It simply does not get any better than this.
It looks so nice and crisp! Holy hell. I weep for the young ones that never had a chance to watch it like this. Maybe in the future we can have a filter for OLED to match this?
I swoon
I can hear that photo and it sounds 80s as fuck.
My sound is off but I can still hear the image.
0083 and 8th team are my fav gundam content

There's something about classic anime on a crt that's just 👌
I get serious 16-bit title screen vibes from that. The whole thing could be a Sega CD intro.
So nostalgic to me. My favorite series.
Exactly how I watched it.  Over vhs glory
The CRT whine being louder than the music adds to the experience.
Classic
My N64 cries out for a functioning CRT.
it feels like your watching it for the first time when you just got home from school
Ohh, I can hear the sax even when the video is muted
Storytime!

In 1999, I enlisted in the Navy and was shipped off to Great Lakes NTC, north of Chicago. Long story short here, I got sick, barely passed Boot, got even sicker, was hospitalized, and was being pushed out of the military. However, while they were figuring out what to do with me (red tape takes forever), I was given leave to go home for Christmas.

I get done with leave and fly back to Chicago, and there's like 5 feet of snow on the ground. I managed to get back to base, but my leave isn't up yet, and I've got nowhere to stay for a day, so I snagged a room at the Navy Lodge and popped off to Gurnee Mills Mall for fun.

While there, I see a Suncoast Motion Picture store. I peruse the anime section, and there are the first two volumes of 0083 on VHS. It looked interesting, and I'd heard about Gundam before, but I never got into it because there seemed to be so much. I was overwhelmed by it all. But they were on sale, and the covers looked interesting, so why not? I bought them, headed back to the Lodge, and sat on my bed eating pizza while watching both tapes. 

What you're showing in this video is literally how I got into Gundam. Almost 25 years later, I've got over 1000 Gunpla, watched every series, played as many of the games as I could get my hands on, traveled to Japan and seen the Unicorn Gundam and The Gundam Base, 

Thanks for this hit of nostalgia!

Brough back so many memories. So many bootleg tapes watched. So little left.
😍😍😍...
Peak fiction
The only problem is it’s hard to really translate that over our digital screens via Reddit
I was literally just watching Stardust Memory!
Looks so much like the exact CRT I had in college and watched so much old anime on. Thanks for sharing!
One of the best openings of all time.
The running in pace anime intro has been lost
Good old Top Gun-dam. GOAT
Man, that's how I used to watch 0083 all the time!
Top Gundam 💪
Paid 30 bucks for a vhs of a single episode once.
That op is still fire
THE WAY THE FEDERATION INTENDED
The god damn nostalgia kills me.
The dream… aka “back when I was young”.

I still have all seven tapes of the *0083* dub, somewhere. Need to find a Sony CRT/VHS combo, and it can be early 2002 again!
matsubara miki 😢
I still need to build a coupe kis from 0083
Best time in my life guess I'll binge watch it
Ugh wish I had this on DVD or could stream it...
top tier openings
Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing 
BEEEEEEEE BAAAAAAAAAA
BUHH BUHH BUHHHHH BUHHHHHHH
Feels right watching it on CRT
It's just so freaking COOL! This was my intro to Gundam as a kid and I will NEVER regret it! It brought me such cool suits and even if the animation was before my time I still absolutely loved and adored it...still do! I own the whole series on disc, and I'm so glad I can watch it now pretty much on my console if I wanted to.
I've read somewhere that old shows and games are actually made with the CRT screens in mind, that's why they look wonky in modern screens
Just the way God intended it to be viewed

#🙂‍↕️🙂‍↔️
Huh, so we do actually loose a little bit with upgraded medium. Creators knew what they are making it for and made good use of its flaws, this bloom is actually looking good with the kind of effects they used.
80s/90s anime had so much more details. Nowadays everything looks as if it was drawn with way less precision and its often cgi.
Yup, right up there with Recoa and that blue-haired brat Queef.
She is the snake that keeps on giving.

Peak Gundam in during this time I fully agree. Screw Nina she was a horrible human being, Kou deserved so much better.
It helps that they had MIO do the vocals.
Whaaaa what about


Standup for the victory!!!! Or is that the credits


Damn I miss the outro first season of GWitch that guitar, damn that was such a good show the feels the lady starts going "hoooooaaaaaaaaa" feels train is here
FULLY AGREED! I still give this Intro AND the Outro a listen from time to time!
The official subtitle is Top Gundam of course. ;)
i mean its HEAVILY INSPIRED BY highway to the danger zone. what do you expect. lol.
It's that and the 08th MS Team intro that gets me every time. Love them both
0080 looks great. one of the few ova that got a 4k scan
But what about the other stuff, like the curved glass and built in 4:3 aspect ratio, that high pitched whine once it turns on, the warmth it radiates…
Peak Gundam, I loved War in the Pocket too though...which I realize came out the year prior to the start of the 90s.
Touche' 🥂
MIO was Men of Destiny for OP 2 - OP 1 was the late Miki Matsubara.
The 90s just had banger openings in general. Victory, Wing, the ovas. What's not to love
I like how this scene put into perspective that most of slayers are just kids after all
Think about it for a minute, isn't just Tanjiro (15s) and Muichiro (14s) but the large majority of low rank slayers we seen in the show seem to be around 16s at best.

 And yet they have the duty of fight against a menace that most of humanity isn't aware of, fighting in the shadows and most of them die in the process.
 
 I'm appreciate the simplicity and beauty of the original scenes of the anime where Tanjiro and Co can enjoy for a brief moment the happiness of being the kids they're.

  It really was a genious move from Ufotable for make us root even for the unnamed characters.

I like how they worked in canon info from the databook into the anime. Muichiro’s favorite pastime is origami.
Oh yeah, it's kinda fucked but the average slayer starts around 15 and dies before 18. Unsaid details of the world.
I'd like to think that alone is just one factor as to why Gyomei is the strongest hashira. He's more wise, practiced, and experienced than the rest of the slayers, and he generally has had a longer time to hone his physique and skills. I was thinking that most demon slayers don't make it to adulthood, and only a small percentage of them make it to hashira level.

Muichiro is the youngest hashira ever and became one incredibly fast, so he isn't as experienced due to that. His body isn't even fully developed yet. He is a literal child and already has incredible power, and we saw him have immense growth when he solo'd Gyokko. >!Imagine if he lived to see Gyomei's age. If it wasn't for him getting literally eviscerated by UM 1, then his mark would have killed him anyway. Iirc, anyone who has a mark dies young. Sanemi most likely would be Gyomei's level once he has a few more years on him. And if Gyomei didn't die during IF, then he'd be a retired master, which brings me to my last point!!< 

We have an even smaller percentage of hashira that are fortunate enough to stay alive, retire and make it to old age, and become teachers and masters, like Urokodaki. Despite all the numbers and odds being stacked against them over the years, the DS Corps has never been eradicated. Ubuyashiki wasn't lying when he said they are eternal. In a perfect world, a larger percentage of slayers would make it to hashira level and have longer life expectancy if large-scale, organized training regiments were more feasible.
this is part of my reasoning of why i dont like the final selection, in this case if most active slayers are still children/teens imagine the age of all of those who die in the mountain in vain without even being officialy part of the corps
Agreed. That’s the way I felt when watching this scene. 🔥
exactly this. but unfortunately, all ive seen r ppl complaining about this scene without even trying to understand it.
I agree. This is also a bit sad too. They have to go through so much so young 😭
you can really tell that the people who don't like this scene are only watching for the action. i loved this scene, they got to be kids again. they're not fighting for their life, they're just having fun.
I really liked that whole arc because of the stuff like this. They really are just kids after all, orphans at that too.
I feel as though Murata should've been here. Haven't gotten to this scene yet, but it would've been nice to see him happy and relaxed
Tokito is so cool
That’s what happened when you deal with a violent vicious enemy who wants nothing more than your blood. 
Look at Hamas, if you look closely at the resistance videos the majority of them are kids, early 20s and less, Abu Obaida, the spokesman, I don’t think he’s older than 25. we got the superpowers of our world launched a fall out killing campaign on every person on that land, and yet they still losing to kids. 
Different worlds bro, a 12 yo gazan kid is more of a man than 30 yo average American, you can even take it in reverse, 30 yo gazan man is purer in heart and mind than a 12 yo American.
fr i loved this scene so much
kids fighting demons
what adults doing 💭 🤔
Child soldiers.

From what I can find, the minimum age during the Taisho period was 16. It's tragic that these kids are being sent to die.
Isn’t Tokito literally 14?
Ye, sadly it is brutal reality :3
This scene reminds me of The Wind Rises final scene. Planes fly away without returning.
To quote TFS Perfect Cell, “with hair like that I bet you’ve never lost a game of spot the protag”
Even their leader is only 23. Young adult 😭😭😭
One of the saddest and most beautiful scenes of this series. Really reminding us the courage & youthfulness becoming a demon slayer takes, and the youthfulness usually stolen. A perfect scene of duality. Fuckin stunning.
Btw, this scene represents them all going to heaven...
How old is tanjiro in this season ?
I agree, I loved this scene 🌸
I cried watching this scene.
Bravo Vince
Yeah, I forget how young they are, and they all call Gyomei "old man" and he's only like 27

this post helped me remember that Muichiro is only 14 years old
fr, many of them are no older then me Mui literally being my age, I'm glad they can all act their age in their freetimes because this scene made me so happy to see Muichiro just be a kid for even just a second
Most of them only came to the corps because they had nothing else left. It’s a little sad🐍
I honestly feel like Tanjiro is at least 17!!
I always thought they were mid twenties
Even the Hashiras are younguns
Do you wanna build an airplane?
Yeah it’s crap when you have to remember that the main cast is 15 and I think 16(?) I can the wrong.
Then muichiro is 14 and a hashira 😭 most of the hashira are also pretty young and only in there mid or early 20s.
They're just babies, they deserve to live a long happy life 😭
Child soldiers
Honestly, I found this scene really corny lol. The entire episode was pretty much just filler as well.

It also showed the low-rank demon slayers being absolutely terrified of Muichiro for no reason when he was simply trying to train them. They were all shaking in their boots just at the sight of him and it really doesn’t make sense. They were acting like they’d never even held a sword before - or that Muichiro was trying to kill them. It was baffling to watch and did them a disservice by making them look pathetic.
I mean . . . It's messed up but that's how Shonen goes. As an MC you usually reach peak power by the time you turn 17 after saving the world or doing some super significant thing. Most MCs are like 15 to 16 to start with.
Muichiro being 14 is such a slap in the face to Tanjiro's progress and Tanjiro already makes most of the corps look like babies.
no they're not 16. they're around Giyuu's age. as Murata represents the average demon slayer. at least that's what i like to think so.
Or even less in some cases. Sabito, Giyuu and Murata started at 13, Makomo while doesn't have a canon age looks even younger than them probably like 11 if we are generous.
They're like the scouts in attack on titan
>I like to think that is a big factor as to why Gyomei is the strongest hashira.

I was thinking that most demon slayers don't make it to adulthood, and only a small percentage of them make it to hashira level.

 I think most of the reasoning behind this ultimately lies in natural talent.

 And I'm with Shinjuro here, but a sad reality of the DS universe is that despite you can put all the effort to improve yourserf, the harsh reality is that not everyone have the potential to reach the same level if they didn't born with the talent. The other slayers who trained with Gyomei for example give up because they couldn't succed where Tanjiro could.

 In that regard I think DS is one of the few shonens that have such a crude message of only people who born with talent can go so far, and while hard work is requiered it doesn't mean you can catch up with a prodigy just because you put effort on it.
I think they train them young to make sure someone is able to become a Hashira, and to also make sure someone is there to pass down the breathing style. 

Most of them are children, but given the fact the Hashira have a very high chance of dying in the field fighting, the only option is to train the kids young to a point where they can become Tsuguko or Hashira quickly if one dies.
Dude this is an anime discussion - spoiler tag for people who haven't read the manga like us, you're ruining important moments of the final arcs xD
Sabito's death still hurts, he could have been a hashira for sure.
Yes. I really don't like the part of the final selection to which some were able to get through because of sheer luck. I mean, I am sure there are a lot of youngsters who died in the final selection can reach at least near hashira level if they are still given more time. If some passed the FS because of some luck, some talented DS-in-trainee died during the FS because of bad luck.
Well i wish the final selection was more supervised, like take them out if they arent ready. Sure they wont beat any other demon if they cant beat those ones but why let children die?
The final selection is genuniely a stick in the ass of the series worldbuilding
For real. They need a much better way
I don’t get why they’d even allow people to die in final selection. It seems like such a useless waste of the corps’ likely limited manpower. It takes years to train them, and you’ll let them die because they failed a qualification test? I don’t get it.
Even if they were older, it shows an innocence among young men/adolescent boys that doesn't go away.

Do you think the urge to dig a hole ever disappears because your balls dropped and you're working a 9 to 5 dead end job?
Yeah coz it’s out of place
To be fair, the fact that most slayers are minors is not actually realistic but it's fiction  and fiction doesn't have to be realistic so it's whatever.
I mean, you can not like this scene and also not want only action. Your comment has "if you don't like Rick and Morty" you are not smart enough vibes
Is tragic either way, if they're orphans they probably don't have anyone who will miss them except by their friends in the corps. 

 If they have families they will always live the fear of every night can be the last one the parents see their childrens coming back home.
Dying obviously.

Demons are like Leonardo DiCaprio, when you get to a certain age, they throw you into the bin.
most demon slayers don't really reach that age
Most hashira are barely in their 20s with gyomei being the old at 27 and the only former hashira being 4 counting uzui 
a lot of them are adults well into their 20's, we know Murata is same age as Giyuu (21-22)
At least those Japanese child soldiers aren’t fighting  actual gods unlike the Greek child soldiers of Sanctuary, Athens, Greece:

Luckily, [the adult Greek soldiers are there to guide them.](https://youtu.be/NWLryKsMhoM?si=QKPutSkDJ7XlxWF1)
I think the Western world vastly underestimates how "free" and "privileged" they have become. The collective West unlocked this after the Industrial Revolution, but Japan continued to keep things real until 1945. 

The transition of "kids should be involved with hard work and the harsh reality" to "kids should be mindless and free" is a Western-led concept. Its a much newer concept in Asian parts of the world.
And Makamo literally 12 😔
Less of a reality and more of a parrallel.

Like how in WWII, Japanese children were conscripted into the army to fight for his majesty. So if you were old enough to learn, you were made to run track and hold a gun.
Tanjiro will go to heaven?
15, by the end of the whole show, he turns 16.
It’s because your fully developed at 25 so 27 is pretty old
And Tanjiro is only 15 years old 😔
And tanjiro too
In the beginning he was 13 and then he trained for 2 years so he’s 15 now
Nezuko turned into a demon at 12 😢and Makamo and Sabito died at 12-13
Naruto and Gon were 12 it’s crazy lol
maybe. still really young tho. sad to know most will die before they even reach their mid twenties
Well Tanjiro is 15-16
Yeah, I went higher on the average because we do have people like gyomei and uzui who seemingly started later
Murata is 2 years younger then giyu so he started at 11
while I generally dislike the message despite knowing it's somewhat true 


I like the way it's presented in demon slayer the npcs are not jealous they are not just here to show how mc is the best but the mc is here to inspire them to do one more run before giving up
I both agree and disagree with this. To some extent yes in slayers like Gyomei, Tanjiro, Muichiro etc natural talent plays a massive factor in them being able to withstand training and fights but on the flip side, there are slayers like Shinobu, Genya, Giyu (partially debatable) who had to rely heavily on hard work and dedication to get to where they are. Shinobu in some sense had the luck of her older sister being a Hashira but she studied poisons etc for years to be able to conquer her weaknesses and Genya cannot master a breathing style leaving him short in so many ways when his brother is so naturally talented. It shows both sides of the battle of talent and it’s beautiful in the way it does it.
>and to also make sure someone is there to pass down the breathing style. 

 I don't think is 100% necessary that the breathing user is alive to pass their technique, after all we know breathing styles are well preserved >!(with the only exception of moon breathing)!< and can be learn by just read and study registers. Remember that breathing is kinda like martial arts in nature after all.

 Training kids also suppose a logistical advantage in the sense that by starting the body preparation early, they could take more adventage later on during the years a slayer peak on their abilities. Which is around the 30 as we seen with Gyomei, and also how the dialogue implies hashiras like Rengoku (who was 21) could have perfected their level in a few years.
Lol, are you good? There is a spoiler tag.
In the scene of him this season his uniform had gold buttons
Wait, he died?

https://preview.redd.it/1upchey95bcd1.png?width=350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9328474ada7d534055413b66fc71fb2a99a5103e

I'm still waiting for the full dub to come out so I haven't seen much of anything.

EDIT: Nevermind I forgot who Sabito was.
Yeah it’s like Sabito died due to bad luck while all of the weak slayers in the Hashira training arc survived due to luck.
Sadly
That's how real world works...

There's maybe some kid somehow more talented than Messi in football, but family circumstances, unlucky injury or just straight badluck prevent him to become star
The whole system is so fucked up. It kinda feels gambling in a way, because they have no idea of the actual progress and as we can see kids like Giyuu who aren't skilled enough at time only pass due luck but they can improve and be great slayers in the future, while talented kids like Sabito more likely will die for unfair conditions and all their talent is waste on nothing.

 That's not even touching the fact of how ethical really is having demons (you know former humans) trapped as animals and going crazy like the hand demon.

 The moral of the corps is very questionable in this case.
People will argue and argue but allways fail to explain this point, like if they arent cut it to be demon slayers just let then go on with their lives no need for them to just die
What a fine interpreation
Is in place
The whole season is about exploring personality of characters and preparing for the last episode that starts the last arc. Sorry that origami didnt transform into demons and attack them.
disagree
i mean its pretty realistic. not only is demon slaying a job where most die young, but the story is also set in the 1920's. medicine and technology were not as advanced back then so ppl often passed due to illnesses. and i dont think majority r minors, but older teens to those in their twenties (like all the hashiras) whether the ages r realistic or not has little to do with what im saying anyway
well clearly you're not smart enough because the quotations should've ended before vibes 

"'if you don't like Rick and Morty you are not smart enough' vibes"

also i was kinda giving the general basis of what ive seen from criticism about the episode. if you didnt like the scene, you're there for the action.
No Murata is 19
We got 10 year olds working in meat plants now.
ig but until he's 25
He’s 15 until swordsmith arc and hes 16 in training arc
it just means their system of ranking and the test is horrible.
so what
You gotta consider they all come from different places and usually join after being affected by the demon attacks. The Corps isn't well known, it seems only older people, helpers/suppliers or survivors are in the know
I dislike the message BECAUSE it's true. Life isn't fair. The notion of keep pushing and you'll get there doesn't align with how life actually is. That's why chasing dreams is the hardest thing to do. Because really only a select few can truly reach them.

But you're right. They do give one last effort before conceding. Gotta respect that.
Oh weird - it didn't show up for me until reloading the thread just now. I just saw the un-spoilered message in full.

Reddit bug I guess?
Wasn’t Sabito’s whole thing he killed every demon except the hand monster and saved everyone else? So the guy who did all the work is the only one who didn’t pass
Yeah, that's just sadly how it is. I guess that is why Giyu and Aoi don't feel good much about themselves because they feel like they don't deserve the spot they got within the Demon Slayer corps.
No it doesnt, real militaries dont send their trainies to die before even becoming actual soldiers

Thats after they actualy become soldiers
>Sorry that origami didnt transform into demons and attack them.

 That would be a sick BDA though.

 Imagine a demon who can fold himself like paper and take different forms while creates paper monster with extremely sharp edges.
There are too many teens and too few in their twenties and early thirties.
Hummm what? So I put the quotation marks in the wrong spot because I wrote on a hurry, therefore not smart...

...

Not sure what your problem is buddy, I didn't insult you or anything. My point was that you can't dismiss a critisisim just because you think differently, many people that enjoy action can like or dislike this scene, AND ALSO many people that enjoy quiet moments can also like or dislike this scene.

Quiet moment doesn't equal good moment. To me honestly it was a meh moment, nothing special, doesn't mean I only want action and things go boom, I actually liked this season better than most, doesn't mean they hit it out of the park with everything they did.
at the start or end of the story? Cause I could have sworn Murata says he and Giyuu are the same age during the final battle
more like demons r just ridiculously strong. even among the hashiras, the oldest is only 27
The fun thing about the system is how it has like 10 different ranks and a magic symbol that manifest in your hand for indentify the slayer, yet all this info is only ever explained in a humor scene that comes from nowhere in EDA and it's mostly used for a quick gag.

 The slayer ranking system is totally irrelevant story wise, as the only thing that matters in the end are hashiras and non-hashiras. 

 And on a related note, the concept of tsukugos is also wasted. The only real tsukugo in the story is Kanao and she doesn't appear very much anyway.
And if a family gets attacked the parents will sacrifice themselves for their kids.
You’re missing the message, it’s about doing YOUR best. For Tanjiro, that is high level training that will put him up there with the Hashira. The other slayers that “give up” aren’t really giving up, they are just understanding that they’ve hit their limit in the specific thing they are training on and decide to do everything they can at the level they are capped at to contribute.

It’s about finding your role in something bigger than yourself and putting everything you have into it. Not everyone will be fit for the same role though.
Yeah and he could’ve killed the hand demon if his sword hadn’t become so dull from saving everyone.
Well, technically he should have passed the selection if he did not die. THat's why it was unfortunate luck for him to encounter the hand demon when he was exhausted and his blade was a bit rough because of carrying the whole batch of selection takers.
Yeah but I know Giyu deserves it because he’s always had the potential he just needed a friend and sister dying to push him that hard.
i dont think we've met anyone in their 30s
No I have to agree on the final selection being a really bad test system. It has flaws everywhere.

 The worst part about the final selection is how talented people like Sabito ends up dying for nothing due a lot of arbitrary bs.
idk i don't think most demons are as tricky as swamp demon where they have blood demon techniques.  what's weird is how nobody can use breathing techniques except named characters. but they somehow how pass the test. their ranking and test system as a organization sucks.
But your last point is the same as mine, and the dark side of the message. Your role doesn't equal to what you may have wanted. Who's to say some of the others didn't want to shine like tanjiro? Or reach hashira level? 

In life you never know what your office colleague could have truly wanted to be, but they understood it wasn't meant for them. So they settle for doing what they can do. There's nothing wrong with settling for something else, being a supportive role, playing the shadow to someone else's light. But don't undermine the hurt from realisation that what you had wanted to achieve wasn't meant to happen. 

Like I said, dream chasing is tough because most don't reach it. I didn't say most don't find something else they can do as a replacement.

EDIT: Overall my point is your best can still not be good enough. When that's the case, then what? Gotta be realistic and scale down the big goals you once had. There's plenty of examples of people who are doing fine in life but still had to change aspirations.
Hence there are too few of them.
genuine question: what would you suggest to improve it?
>what's weird is how nobody can use breathing techniques except named characters

 But they do is just that nor everyone can manifest their breathing effects to a visible level.

 Murata character page explain the effects are just visible on the most talented slayers.

 The story makes clear how the only breathless slayer is Genya, the rest of people who can't use breathing techniques at all became kakushi probably.
actually, all the fodder characters can use breathing techniques. otherwise, they wouldn't be in the corps. the only ones we know who have no talent for it are senjuro and genya. it was stated in the manga that the most common breathing style is water breathing (its the easiest to learn) murata and aoi use it and im assuming most of the others do too.
They all can use breathing techniques. They arent as good as the named characters, which is why they arent visible and animated.
I disagree, Tanjiro doesn’t want any of this. He wants to live care free with his family away from violence and death. You are projecting a different lense on the plot here to be about dream chasing rather than rising to meet responsibilities. 

The series is about understanding that you are insignificant by yourself, but when understanding that you are part of something larger and doing your best to fill your role (whether or not it’s something you WANT), humanity can achieve great things.
THEYRE DEAD
More like replace it entirely. 

 Because how the higher ranks of corps even do the evaluation of the applicants once they're inside the mountain? We never got indications of them watching the process (realistically they don't have any methods to do so).

 Is just like they expect some of the kids to survive and that's enough for them, even if like in Giyuu's case they only do survive because a stronger person like Sabito did the hard work. That doesn't really test your skills then, is kinda a waste of time and potential.

 Idk how really they should to the test, but it sure should be something more self contained on a place that can be supervised by actual people.
If the effects aren’t visible they’re weaker than test tanjiro who was already very weak.
>I disagree, Tanjiro doesn’t want any of this. He wants to live care free with his family away from violence and death.

 I mean you can have the talent to shine on something and don't want to follow that route anyway, isn't like both concepts are mutually exclusive.

 Besides while Tanjiro definitely isn't like Inosuke and Sanemi who live for fight demons, he certainly still have a big sense of responsibility and treat the slayer duty with all seriousness. He also can admire and aspire to be like people as Kyojuro, who are the ideal slayer role model on his eyes.

 I'm glad the mangaka didn't make Tanjiro a whiny protagonist like Shinji Ikari and have him constantly complaining about his duty or have a complex with his own abilities.
But I'm not talking from Tanjoro's perspective. Of course he doesn't want it. He's a natural prodigy. There are some people who DO want it but are not a natural prodigy. 

Also, I'm not really talking about the series so much. My emphasis is on real life. I agree with you. Filling your role in something bigger and doing your best is best. But I feel like you're really undermining people's individual aspirations and wants. 

It's easy to say, "I'll play my role regardless of what it is...". But truly meaning it is something entirely different. To wholeheartedly be happy that despite all your efforts, you couldn't achieve what you wanted. But understand your role is something more minor only comes from overcoming the feeling of not achieving the initial goal. 

I don't know how old you are but I'm getting the impression you're still fairly young (I am myself btw, I'm 28 but I'm realistic).

EDIT: Example: One of the swordsmiths had actually wanted to join the DS Corp too. But they was not up to par with a sword. In the end their role in the big picture is being a swordsmith. But respect they initially wanted to be on the front lines fighting with the DS Corp. Don't undermine their own initial aspiration.
There should be 30yos joining the corps.
Tanjiro is never really shown to have innate talent though (maybe some creative ways of thinking and a superhuman sense of smell though). His entire thing is that he doesn’t quit and finds ways to motivate himself (or draw motivation from others) to push himself through and level up through effort rather than natural talent. Others don’t make it as far as him not because they are missing talent that he has, but because they don’t have the drive he has to push past their limits.
I’m 35 and am married with kids and my own house if that helps you. 

>Also, I’m not really talking about the series so much.

Could have stopped there, I’m talking about the series and its themes. You are projecting your own life experience onto the show and twisting its themes to feel relatable to you.
Considering how much pressure the slayer have to put into their bodies to reach the bare minimum I think a person in his/her 30s would actually have much more problems in long terms and they would end underperforming even if they become at least low ranks.

 Because think about this, we have multiple hints of slayers reaching their peak before the 30s as Gyomei is on his maximus power in the present. Kyojuro also trained since kid and he was close to peak at his early 20, even Akaza comments that he would have reach a perfect level in few years.

 I think slayers are kinda like athletes in the sense most of them probably would have (with much luck) a useful time spam of fighting until they’re on early to middle 30.
>Tanjiro is never really shown to have innate talent though (maybe some creative ways of thinking and a superhuman sense of smell though).

 That's pretty much debatable, considering Tanjiro is descrived as the best student Urokodaki ever had and he could complete a supposedly impossible training routine his master made on purpose. He sliced the giant rock and killed the hand demon despite the lack of experience.

 The whole thing with learning the Sun Breathing is a talent on itself, and Tanjiro is the only person in the series who show mixing breathing styles on a more creative way. Even using lightning despite he only hear Zenitsu talk about it like once.

 There's other feats that show Tanjiro's talent but you get the idea.
peace out mates 
 age 28 guy is right about what he is telling about life 


and you are also kind of right that series gives the impression that finding roles where they can be their best version is a better decision and
This sub thread was about life though lol. My first comment is in relation to what is before mine.

I'm also not projecting. I'm being realistic. Like it or not.
Any mid 30s guy is going to be in better physical shape than a 15yo or even 13yo.
What is your favorite life-size Gundam statue and which Gundam would you like to see next being built as the new life-size statue?

They're keeping him from us because they know he would lead us to the promised land
Zeta!
I've been to all of the statues in Japan (excluding the old RX-78-2 statue in Tokyo). My favorite is definitely the Yokohama RX-78F00. Got to see it in person during my first visit to Japan in 2022. In addition to how impressive the statue itself was, I loved that it had the backdrop of Tokyo Bay in the background, instead of just a generic looking Japanese mall like the Unicorn and Nu Gundams.

Also Yoshiyuki Tomino's message where he apologizes for how "boring" it is because it's not freestanding is hilarious, and definitely sounds like something he would say. (See image below.)

As for what they should do next, I think we're well past due to get a Zaku statue.

Still waiting on Exia getting a life-size statue
Rx 78 because it so damn iconic.  


I wanna see a life size wing zero endless waltz version. Wanna see the wings up getting ready to take flight
# BANDAI, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE A LIFE SIZED ZAKU! PLEASE, I BEG OF YOU!
#BANDAI GIVE ME A LIFE SIZED Z'GOK STATUE AND MY WALLET IS YOURS
Exia or Barbatos
we need an F91
I want a Life size Justice Gundam in the USA. It would be cool if it was near lady liberty so we can have liberty and justice for all
I’d kill to see Nadleeh. Won’t happen but a girl can dream.
Does Sazabi count? I would like either the Ver. Ka or the RG version.
Penelope or Xi. 😁

I'd love to see a Zeta, Gundam Mk II, or Alex.
I would like one (1) fully mobile, semi-functional Guntank please.
Endless Waltz Wing 0, or GP02.
I love the Unicorn just for the gimmick.

A U.S. Based store with a G-Wing suit would be fitting given G-Wing brought it to the west. Perhaps a large Tallgeese with smaller Gundams all around it. Like a family photo. Though a Wing 0 would be interesting.
Give us a Zeon statue, to many feds.
i challenge them to build a life-size Ex-S.
Give us G Gundam Fans and 00 Fans something; God Gundam or Exia as the next statue. But I feel like Aerial is the next one.
I think I liked the Unicorn the most of the three I've seen (I haven't seen the Freedom), as I'm a sucker for the "Midnight Chacha" video that plays sometimes with the transformation at night. The RX-7800 was also very impressive though.

I just want a Zaku II.
Definitely barbatos or Gundam X or double x

Oh damn gundam x that has a backpack transformation every night would be so cool
Where are the 1:1 balls?
Memes aside, I want Barbatos battle damaged kneeling statue
exia or virtue. 

  
imagine big boy virtue 🤣
I'd love to see a Burning or Shining Gundam. It'd be so cool to watch them transform and maybe have their hands glow!
life size barbs or aerial would be fun
Grandpa and the Nu
I need to see the 1:1 Freedom gundam at least once in my life
hear me out, life size neo zeong statue
Wing Zero, Endless Waltz

Or

Barbatos Lupus Rex
Controversial but I'd pick Wing Zero Custom
Current statue: Unicorn

Like to see:

https://preview.redd.it/7ekb5vyz4fxd1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fba46431be9650b6813690bf1da0f2922f111db2
Aerial. Its my favorite.
Freedom, but I'll probably never visit Shanghai to see it. :\\
Gundam ASW-G-08 Barbatos, and have the eyes glow bright red
Not Gundam, but there's a 1:1 Valkyrie VF-25F in Gerwalk form at Asakusa Skytree
My favorite gundams are exia and wing zero, but a lot of the main character gundams look kinda similar. Would be neat to see something different like a zaku or maybe epyon
I’ve seen three out of four in person and for me, the unicorn takes the cake, Also it’s the largest. The Nu Gundam is the only one I’m missing.

The picture is from early in the day so the lights don’t really stand out.

https://preview.redd.it/xnfb2zph9fxd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d064145be9af132350a6b7f4cb423f7cd6b0d801
All of the life-sized Gundam statues were good in their unique ways, so I can't decide for real.

But one unit I want to see a life-size statue would be the GN-001 Gundam Exia. 00 Qan[T] is a better pick personally but given how complicated the design is, I'd settle for Exia as my pick.
3 and 4 are both Nu? I’m still on Zeta, trying to watch in order so haven’t made it to that one yet. Also where in Japan are those? I was fortunate enjoying to catch RX-78 at Yokohama and Unicorn at Odaiba 🙏
Destiny gundam but I know they aren't gonna make it but one can dream
I would go for the freedom.
It's a wonderful world where we get to pick from multiple 20+meter 1/1 scale robots to call our favorite.
Gundam Exia
Coping for Exia one of these days
JDG-00X Devil Gundam

Do it you cowards
Exia or 00 or Barbatos place either of them in Malaysia hehe
The freedom never fails to impress me, its design is just so damn perfect
Gundam Aerial
Freedom for obvious reasons, but the og was the best pose was great. The walking rx78 was a cool rendition on the rx78. Freedom was pretty awesome, the nu Isn't the nu sorry it's not and the unicorn is in a bad pose.
either a kowloon/master gundam in Hong Kong, or gp01 in Torrington
I can't give an opinion on my favorite as I've never seen any in person, Nu Gundam is a dope kit so I'm leaning toward that one a bit.

As for the next one, I kind-of want to see Char's Zaku. But I could see a Wing in America as that's the series that broke into the west.
They should do the MK-V
Holy shit! That Nu Gundam with the lights on looks freaking SICK!
Nu Gunsam is so cool, so there’s my vote

God Gundam posing in the direction of the rising sun would be pretty epic
sazabi
ZGOK
# GUNCANNON GIVE ME THE GUNCANNON PLEASE MAKE A LIFE-SIZED GUNCANNON STATUE PLEASE I NEED IT TO EXIST PLEASE THE BIG RED DUDE NEEDS TO COME HOME TO REALITY COME ON TOMINO
Unicorn, and Sazabi.
I’d like to see a proper life sized Zeta Gundam. I used to live and work near Miyao, Okayama where they have the slightly famous, non-official 7m tall version. Was impressed but it is a bit janky looking.
I wish they could have made a real life-sized og Nu but the fin funnels would topple it and cause fatalities. 

93ff is Ok but I’m not into the vivid blue.
I am a sucker for Gramps variations so F00 is pretty neat too.
ALL. (Except last pic (forgor name), not that i hate, just never found any love for it)
Only seen the Unicorn in person and I had never even heard of Gundam when I saw it. 😭

Sure I'll get back to Japan one day. Right?
A zaku would be nice
Next I'd like to see a life-size Psycho Gundam Mk-II
Barbatos
Hi Nu Gundam.
I know it would be a logístical nightmare, but I would love to see a ZZ Gundam statue
I wanna see Ariel and barbatos dapping each other up
I'm kinda hoping for a Ground Type Gundam.
Life sized Neo Zeong🤑🤑🤑
But like seriously I think there should be a suit from one of the villain factions or the Turn A
I kinda liked the RX-78 at Odaiba, the one they disassembled where you could go on an exercise bike and make the eyes glow
i want the whole 8th MS team full load out.
Anyone knows if the GP01 has been done yet?
I saw the fourth one it was cool that it tells you the certain time in a day that it operates and do the light show. I would love to see the other ones and if possible, zaku series would be really cool to see in life size
I like the original gundam but for the new one barbatos would be great especially the first version it’s missing parts and disheveled design would look amazing irl
The Gundam Factory statue in Yokohama.
Gundam Maxter in NYC
Leo, my love!
Surely a Zaku or the Sazabi
Unicorn for me. 

Banaji Linksu! Unicorn Gundam! Ikimasu!
Turn A just to have something that looks drastically different from all the other Gundam statues.

I kinda doubt Tomino would greenlight any of the Zeon suits since they're supposed to be space Nazis.
RX-78GP02A Gundam "Physalis" ...
Akatsuki would be nice 😂
Favorite is RX-78 so far.

I wouldn't mind it if they made a Wing Zero EW somewhere though.
Epyon!
The Freedom.🤙
Would love to see the mk.II next!😎
Favorite is the Nu. I need to see a heavyarms statue if they ever make a base in America
Barbatos
Unicorn is my favourite 100% but I would love to see Barbatos.
I'm honestly surprised they haven't found a spot here in the US for a Wing Zero (not the EW version).
RX-93 ν Gundam

https://preview.redd.it/f0tocerr0jxd1.jpeg?width=613&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a68540f58babdd069b91dbac09bbe78a9a7d33b9
Hmmm where is Nu Gundam located?
I'd like to see zero or the mk2. They'll never do tallgeese but it's by far my fav unit in all of gundam.
Definitely the one that moves, since it's the closest thing we actually have to a real Gundam. Personally, I would really love to see them build a life-sized Gelgoog, especially the Gelgoog Marine, the Psycommu Zaku, or the Kshatriya. However, I think it would be really cool if they built a life-sized Gundam statue at the Space Center in Houston, TX. Something like the Wing Zero (EW) or Turn A Gundam would be perfect for that.
I want a Strike Gundam statue in my life
I want a Zaku if I am gonna be honest
I like the Freedom Gundam statue, for ironic reasons. The best kind of reasons.
Bro a vidar statue could go so hard
Give me an AGE-1 statue to mirror its fate in the series.
Unicorn, went there trice.
I have seen them all and have to say that Yokoyama TOPS
I never knew they had navigation lights on the shoulders before seeing this photo... cool. 

Do they have an anchor too?
I've seen the OG RX78 at odaiba before it was replaced, RX78 F00 at Yokohama and Unicorn at Odaiba. I think the new RX78 (G)E Gundam EX would be sick!  Just watched Requiem for Vengeance last week and it looked so good. I was instantly loving it.
Wing Zero Tv Version
Psycho Gundam
Exia.
I've seen almost all the 1:1 statues in Japan. I had the honour of seeing the original RX-78 at Odaiba, before it was officially open. I still remember the awe I felt at it. Today, I still feel the RX-78 looks best in life. There's something fundamentally *real* about its design and stature, whereas the rest tend to look a bit fantastical. So for me, the classic will always be the best.

(OK, OK, I think the GP01 is another very compelling design, but I doubt we'll ever see one at 1:1).
i wanna see a gp03s statue but its such a obscure suit that a gp01 statue is close enough
ZZ. Bonus points if it transforms
Unicorn
My favorite Gundam statue has to be either the nu Gundam or the freedom gundam. As for a Gundam I want to see get a statue, I really wanna see the Destiny Gundam get a statue
I heard they made one of Deathscythe Hell, but someone actived the cloak and now they have no idea where it is.
Still crazy how we haven’t got any Zaku yet.
Ez8!
I would love to see a permanent US gundam base with the good old EZ8 as it's 1:1 scale mascot
Psycho gundam
The Ball
Arche
OG was my favorite. Nu was runner up.

I would love to see Zeta though. Maybe a Zeta and a Waverider next to it?
Love the Nu but OG granddaddy Gundam really takes it
00 Raiser
My favourite statue is unicorn and I would like to see a V2 Gundam statue next (just cuz I really like V2. I know it's probably not gonna happen since Tomino dislikes victory)
Char’s Zaku or sazabi will be deserving.

But Aerial with the floating gun bits and permet effects (sort of like the cosmo effect parts) will be more impressive and draw more crowd
I've only ever seen the OG RX-78-2 statue and the Unicorn both at Diver City, Odaiba. Between the 2, the RX-78-2 is more impressive visually because of the color and it's a lot more mechanically detailed with the many warning labels and panels. The Unicorn's transformation gimmick is pretty interesting although it's not 100% accurate. So I have to say I like RX-78-2 more overall. 

Would love to see a GP01 or Zaku if Bandai dares to do something non-Gundam.
G30th. I just want G30th back. If it has to be a new MS, then a standard green Zaku II.
I dare them to build a zeta with some transformation.
00
Fully functional transforming ZZ Gundam
Give us Zaku II, cowards
upgrade the freedom to a strike freedom
Wing Zero. Either version.
I'd love to see the RX-79G from 08th MS Strike Team.
In terms of just MS, i wanna see Sazabi or Sinanju, if it's a Zaku II, I want it to be really juiced up.

If it's a gundam, definitely Zeta in a hangar with ful transformation, it can be slow and be supported with machines, but just seeing it all come together would be epic
Love grandpa and nu. Would love to see a mk ii
Endless Waltz Wing Zero for me since it was my intro to the series. EZ8 or Barbatos would be a close second though.
I just want Wing Zero somewhere in the US, lest we forget our roots. that or Turn A, even though no one here knows that show it is the one Gundam designed by an American.
Is the Unicorn lifesize? 

It kind of looked too in the torso to house a pilot.
For the love of Gjallarhorn, give us Barbatos Lupusu Rekusu. until then, no flags shall be raised.
Nah they need to go back and redo nu Gundam. 1 fin funnel isn't enough suffering.
The 2012 RX-78 in DiverCity is my favorite so far.the first one with the beam saber looked like it was holding a fluorescent tube. Top three on my wishlist would be Ball (the TV version, not the Ver Ka design), Zeta, and MKII.
Zeon unit preferably Sazabi, Zaku, Gouf custom or Kampfer. If it's another gundam, just give me EX, although chances are very low.
When are they gonna put up a life size zaku statue, or any zeon ms for that matter
Time for a zaku, 

but if we are just taking about looks, give me a Hyaku Shiki ✨
Borjarnon.
My favorite 3 Gundam are already there but I’d really like a Unicorn here in the US, though Char’s Zaku would be really cool too
I need a Gundam Ground Type. There's enough flashy designs, we gotta give something to the slightly more grounded design.
Calibarn
Give me char's zaku II or any zaku II
Gundam Xi
I like Wing Zero but... I'd like them to try Dendrobium
Yes, all of them. But next there must be Sazabi
Tallgeese. It’s the greatest mech
00 Raiser would be spectacular.

Probably just as a statue, as the 0 Raiser would likely make it awkward for attaching to a movement frame. It could still do a decent light & sound show like the Unicorn, though.

I can dream…
I wish we could get one here in the US
I didn’t watch most of the mainstream Gundam series, so I’m just going off the models I’ve built. I’d like to see a life-sized Gundam Deathscythe Hell, or a Unicorn Gundam Phenex.
Give me master gundam and god gundam
The 78
If it weren't for the fact that a US Gundam Base is nigh impossible given how niche the series is still, I'd kill for a Wing Zero or Wing Zero EW statue somewhere in the US.
I love the classic RX-78-2; definitely the favorite so far.

If I could pick any? The Rick Dias of course.

But the Turn-A and the Borjarnon are close contenders.
G Saviour on the ISS
I am honestly impressed by the Yokohama gundam. 

As for next gundam, it is a hard pick, but Strike would be the closest to have a new statue tbh.

For my wish, I would like to have Exia, mainly because the lighting will be impressive
I would like to see a Zeon suit.

What we will likely get is the 00 Gundam or Quan[T] next. Wing or Wing Zero after that. Then maybe the Aerial. 

If one is built in the US, it will probably be the Wing or Wing Zero, or the Gundam Maxster. Maybe even the Heavyarms or EZ-8, but I'm leaning more toward the Wing Gundam tbh.
![gif](giphy|NK5h6Eh7kP267YI6zp|downsized)
If by some miracle they made one states side it would be a wing gundam variant
Still think the Freedom should have been here in the US.
Neo Zeong
XVX-016 Gundam Aerial
Give us a Wing Zero statue in the USA!!!
GP03 when?
These statues are smaller than I thought
Honestly, Psycho Gundam Mark II
Realistically, if we are going by what people who are not fans would recognize, probably Barbie.
Where exactly do the gundams from the last two pics stand?
Is there a life-size Aerial yet?
Barbie. I want to see how they gonna pull that waist off lol
Hmm. Something about my reddit presence suggests a bias here.

Zero or bust!
Saw 2 of these in person. Rx-78 is the one that moved us to tears.

I’d want Aerial or Calibarn to be the next lifesize installation but I doubt wfm will get that treatment anytime soon, if at all.
Epyon, wing zero, deathscythe hell, shenlong, Tallgeese, god gundam, dragon gundam, master gundam, devil gundam, & spiegel gundam
Exia.
I want Tallgeese
Exia
Mrk 2 titans
Sazabi or Destiny
Zaku
Need me a life-sized God Gundam.
I am kinda upset they never got a chance to make a life size wing zero ew , that would of been a great one
The Nu Gundam is a personal favorite.
The unicorn with its transformation to the score from the series is God tier
Woundwort!
WING gundam
Build the GP02 complete with Atomic Bazooka 😈
I would like the burning Gundam or wing zero TV , maybe the Quanta
I want the Wing Zero
just sell us a 1:1 HG kit already
Exia or barbatos
Yoooo where is that nu gundam build located?!
I'm a casual fan, so I don't know how you all feel about Gundam Wing. Personally I think the show isn't that great, but the Gundam designs have always been some of my favorites. Any of the ones from that show would make for a pretty sick life sized statue
Unicorn. Because unicorn
I still pray and beg for anything with mono-eye. 

It would propably need to be something popular, so my choices from that would be either Gelgoog or Gouf Custom.


And if not something with mono-eye then at least some visored ms. Just anything thats not a gundam.
It's about time we get a Zaku II
I’ve been a Unicorn Gundam fan since my uncle first showed me the series
fuck it, give us a life sized gundam astrea type f.  
or one of the main TWFM MSes ig
GIVE ME A ZAKU 2
Wing Zero EW
MBF-P02 Kai Astray Red Frame would be awesome to be build and functional
Gundam GP-01
Netherland Gundam
Guntank
Make a Sazabi. Ok maybe not a Gundam.
I’d love to see any variant of Barbatos
Wing Gundam/Wing Zero

Burning Gundam.

Ez8
Imagine they're making Xi Gundam for the next Hathaway movie.
Good ol' GM w/Spray Gun
I'm torn between the Exia, Zeta and ZZ The designs are so good!
Zeta would work but I also wouldn't mind Aerial or Barbatos
A strike freedom.

Like I know the freedom's there,but we got 3 rx78 and a nu...also dreaming is free so yea
It's gotta be the Freedom because the pure irony of it being located in 1 of the least free countries in the world. I feel like Bandai is low-key trolling the CCP with that.
Sazabi
I'm an old fart and I like the OG Gundam
gundam oo maybe next
A zaku statue is truly needed
Any guntank, because you can actually make it work. Contract komatsu, mitsubishi etc to make a chassis that looks like it, the make the cannon shoot fireworks. Would be one hell of a tourist attraction.
Unicorn and I love to see either Char's zaku or Wing Zero
i don't think it would ever happen but i would swim to Japan if they built a life sized Turn-A , it is my favorite mobile suit and so much of it's promotional imagery is showcasing the domesticness of Turn A in the distance,
A Nightingale would be awesome. But if needs to be a Gundam, Gundam Barbatos 4th form would look nice imo
I want a life size barbatos
Still find it so funny they put the freedom in china
need a zeon suit now
Death Scythe. My edgelord soul craves it. Now build it and send us all to HELL!
Windmill Gundam, or bust!!!

  
But I'll settle for the TV version of Wing Zero...
Personally not a big fan of grandpapis, but as a statue he had the most presence. 
Either a Zaku, or the tallgease fluegle.
Give antagonist ms a chance as well
I WANT AN AKATSUKI OR DESTINY (maybe with the zeus silhouette for either of them too)
I'd like a Zaku or the Barbatos
I'll take a large order of Heavyarms please!
Put gundam x by nasa
I wanna see an RGM-79 or a Jaegen
not a gundam but the nightingale or the Zeong
THIS HAND OF MINE BURNS WITH AN AWESOME POWER!!!
GN-0000DVR Gundam 00 Diver
Gundam Wing EW
IBO
OO
GP03 and the Dendrobium. Make it an entire building.
I think it would be cool if the did gundam wing zero because that's how alot of Americans got into gundam
Can we get a Shining Gundam already 😅
either Zeta or Wing Zero
1:1 Devil gundam... in line of sight of the vatican city. and God gundam in Hongkong to replicate the scene it landed right before the final gundam matches

Gpo2 in Australia.



time for  villain gundams
My favorite was the original rx 78 2 that they took apart, and I'd like to see the ez 8 become a statue one day
The Freedom Gundam in Shang Hai is my favorite because its the only life size gundam so far with a Big Backpack . 

I want to see a Neo Zeong  NT version life size!!
I would like to see some zion suits. Zaku, Char's zaku, gouf, Kämpfer, Dom. The scale might be a little big, but Sazabi. I would also like to see either the Titan or AEUG 178 mk 2
I want Zeta next
Give me Barbatos! I need to see those scuffed proportions in real life
The Barbatos Lupus Rex
NU
Probably an underdog choice but I’d love to see them make the Alex. Bonus points if it’s designed to raise its arm and have the weapon pop out.
The unicorn is the best without exception especially now that the moving rx78 has been unfortunately taken down.
Destroy Gundam
Genuinely amazed we haven't gotten a Zaku yet... Like be it the 'common' green trooper oor Char's Red Zaku oor heck even a Kamfer... Zaku NEEDS a statue!!
Give me a life size barbatos🙏🏻
Mine is the rx 78, and for my pick I'd like the humble GM.
Turn A, that mustache is too majestic to be stuck solely in the realm of fiction.
I liked the Nu-Gundam most out of the existing ones. The animated performance with Beyond the Time playing was sweet.

They should do Exia or Barbatos next, although I'm not sure the latter would be feasible without violating many health and safety laws.
It’s honestly surprising we haven’t gotten Sazabi to go with the Nu or Char’s Zaku II
Give us Turn A you cowards.
I'd love them try their hand at Barbatos or Exia.
I really like the Nu-FF. 

Give us the Sazabi-FF you damn cowards!
Barbatos
I recognise OG, Unicorn. Other two are ?
I need to see Gundam Epyon in my life time. I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE!
I want to see turn A
Imagine drunk driving these mfs
Please I need to see a life sized Zaku
ZAKU TIME!!!!!
Nightingale lol
I liked the original RX-78 at Diver City best.  Just liked that design.  It would be nice to see the RX-79 ground type life size, although I can't imagine why they would.
We need a GM or a Zaku.

Preferably the GM custom, or Zaku II.
Zeta
Xi Gundam or Penelope
freedom got shin asuka'd

Nu is awesome 

Unicorn is awesome 

F000 was the best
Is the 4th picture of the Freedom Gundam?
all of em. more zaku!!! 😁
I want a Wing Zero (TV Ver) built in the UK...

It would never happen, but a man can dream
I want Barbatos Lupus.
Guntank or Barbatos
Build an RX78-GP02, that's a big boi
I'd love to see Aerial get made, especially if they can rig her lights like they did with the Unicorn.
God Gundam :)
Life size Neo Zeong 😈
Unicorn
Either exia, aeriel, calibarn, or xi
Barbatos lupus rex
I really like the gundam from Gundam Requiem for Vengeance
Tallgeese <3
Barbatos Barbatos ~
Gouf
Wing zero or reaper death scythe
Ramba rals gouf just for the laugh
Freedom always my bae
Can we have a fucking zaku already? I will buy a fucking ticket to Japan to diver city right now if they build one.
I would love to see wing or god gundam as a statue in my country (Philippines), they would probably put it somewhere like Mall of Asia or megamall.
Sinanju or the Kshatriya.
Strike Freedom with Wings of Light
Guntank
Still waiting for a life size Neo Zeong to pair with the unicorn
The most epic one would be wing zero custom, in the buster cannon pose
Did someone say Exia?
Turn A. I beg of u
The unicorn gundam statue, I love that thing.
I would like to see Barbatos lupus Rex as the next statue!
How about a Wing Zero Custom statue? Wings spread out!
Shining, exia, or wing zero custom
Hard to beat the moving RX-78, rip

Shining Gundam lol
Give me either: Wing Zero (EW or not), Epyon, Deathscythe  Hell (EW or not), Gundam MKII (AEUG), GP-01 Full Burnern, the Gouf Custom or Zaku II Solar I custom from requiem for vengeance please
Unicorn, because it's the one I've seen in person.
I don't want life size statues, I want mobile suits
Neo zeong
Man, I think MBF-P02 would be sick. Specifically, the one with really big shoulders!
Freedom with deployable wings would be so lit!!
Sazabi
Life size Zaku II JC Ground Type
As a grunt suit enjoyer I'd love to see a life-size Jegan, GM, or Zaku II
The Nu Gundam Statue, and I want to see a statue of Barbatos Lupus, specifically that form, and make it have Master Grade detail and tell everyone this is a Future MG
Barbatos
devil gundam
Exia or barbartos
I need a barbatos statue, presumably barbatos lupus cuz he looks so awesome. I love the barbie variants but number one is lupus for me, second in line tied with fourth form is rex as well
I would love to see a heavy arms or heavy arms custom one day
Wing Gundam from the Endless Waltz movie.
https://preview.redd.it/e1abkrfcyrxd1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a32d048eb5f288d41cedfe0c843451a364e0c765

ASW-G-11 Gundam Gusion Rebake Full City. The dude was raw strength. Reminded me of a sumo wrestler! Tank, strong, agile too when needed!
MA-08 Big Zam
Permanent RX78-2
Zaku 2 or a gouf
Lolz, i know it isnt a gundam...
But Dangaiou still does it too for me🥰
For me it’s between a Zaku and Barbatos
Give us a Qubeley statue
I won’t be satisfied until I see a Deathscythe-Hell or Altron
The rx-79 with a dude parachuting in the background at ft Moore 😂😂
It would be pretty cool to see the aerial
A Zaku I or Zaku II.
Epyon and Zero-1
Would love the strike gundam!
God Gundam actually!
God Gundam for me.
God Gundam in Hong Kong
Devil Gundam.
I find the funnest one is the ironic statue in china.

The best one is by far is the moving gundam. Then unicorn cause that one also has the transformation gimmick.
Wing Zero, Burning / God & The Strike Freedom 
Those are some of my favorite Gundams and I would like to see life size.!!!!
Life sized devil gundam
Char's Gundam
Any Zaku would do!
Well I don’t need to comment, someone already said it

![gif](giphy|10DGylh1WIDeUM)
Yess!
For real, it's high time we got a Zaku. Either built in Sydney or I'd love to see it stateside
Nope.  Z’gok.  If you’re going to build a statue of a zeon suit it’s gotta be the weird ones.
Chars zaku II would be so iconic I second this. If not give us the Sazabi it would be massive lol
No joke making a real life ball is actually feasible.
There was one close to full size at the Fuji q theme park where there was also a full sized Gundam inside a building for one of the activities you could do.

I went there in 2007, you had to tap your special tec kit box onto parts near the gundam for it to get fixed so lights would come on and boosters would smoke.

Great fun, often forgotten large gundam model. The ball was outside the building it was in.
I’d love a 4D game where you get inside one of these bad boys
The only correct answer. Can't believe they ever went with the Seed units before a Zeta one.
There used to be a smaller zeta “statue” before
There’s something so poetic about the replica of unyielding death machine designed for anti war media being seen as “kind and gentle” by the man who created it.
Two of my four favorite Gundams are already there. I think we do need zeons unit now.
TLDR from that poster I got is “tied down by gravity”
The Yokohama one is one of my favorite as well.  My son loved watching the moving Gundam.  He wanted to go in to the cockpit like he saw a person did on the show we watched about it being built and was sad that was not an option.


Still have a soft spot for the OG one when it was in Odaiba as it was one of the places my fiancee suggested we go to when we were in Tokyo.
We don't deserve this man
Isn't it also very Japanese to be humble and have very high expectations like that? In the form of apologies as well. Definitely very Tomino but also I don't think it's unique to him in Japan.
I would coom. Im not setsuna btw
I am Gundam
https://preview.redd.it/turfhtysqfxd1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91ca3e90422b8e063a2b7312f4e88dcbb8093192
You know there's a 1:1 00 arm in Shenzhen right
Id book a ticket to japan as soon as this is completed no questions asked.
The lighting would be insane. Imagine if they put a bunch of small lights across the body so it can go trans am
Same, tho considering how they couldn't even get the Nu to have it's original funnels due to wind, they probably wouldn't be able to give the Wing much wingspan
I share this same sentiment.
Same. RX-78 is too iconic and good looking.

Wing Zero EW is also one of my favorites so it would be pretty cool to see a real one.
I would settle for any of the main suits from endless waltz tbh. Heavy arms, death scythe, epyon, and tall geese 3 are all super dope.
Be cool to have a squad, like 3 Zaku 2s numbered 101, 102, and 103.
# I SECOND THIS
Wallet? Nah
My
# LIFE
is yours
Nothing truer has ever been said.
Would a Z'Gok E type be acceptable?
Scrolled way too far down to see first mention of Barbatos lol
Asking real questions
It would be cool but I think the hair would be problematic
Profile pic checks out.
A mid-armor purge Virtue/Nadleeh would be amazing and insanely impractical to build
That would be insane.  I was going to suggest Xi too
I'm trying to remember the biggest treaded vehicle we have besides that excavator the size of a mountain
GP02 at an American store/facility. The jokes and publicity write themselves. Though Wing might fit better given the series is still for some reason the most popular one over here. With some people thinking, it is the only Gundam series in existence.
Probably not a popular opinion but would love to see Sazabi or Sinanju. Too much?
I like the idea of a Zaku statue but maybe it's better if they don't build a space nazi statue.
Altho Unicorn by technicality ended being a Zeon suit
Controversial, but I like it.
Oh god, I can hardly draw that thing, I can't imagine building one 1:1
Added bonus if they build it on a Gundam base at far east
I demand a life-size Tequila Gundam!
or zeta
Perfect Zeong
Ooh, if they built the five Gundams in places corresponding to their pilots' nationalities! Wing Zero in Tokyo, Deathscythe Hell in New York City, Heavyarms in Berlin, Sandrock in Riyadh or Ankara, and Altron in Beijing.
https://preview.redd.it/ocsd6xu4afxd1.png?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eeb8ed9bdc55e82851a87657a95c587d5c89c8ec
I second this
OH? 👀👀 This id love to see! Husband was watching a train video, and we saw it go by what looked like a decommissioned patlabour on a truck bed ;A; ive yet to find out where it is.
3rd one is Nu, while the 4th one is the Freedom Gundam from Gundam Seed! Nu Gundam Statue is in Side-F Fukuoka while the Freedom is in Lalaport Shanghai in China 👍
had to control F to find this, would be great to see
I would like a space colony statue placed on Sydney, Australia.
Functional?
Pfffffft
Gonna cost Bandai its whole company to make it
Hyaku Shiki..
Zaku 50?
I counter with the much weirder one, Zok
You mean hygogg if we're picking amphibious suits gotta go with the bad ass one
Ngl tho, terrible weapon, and I'd bet it'd also be a death trap like in universe XD
I can see we using something like that when we start having wars in space. The main difference is that we would arm it, with.50 cals and missiles since there's no minovsky particles.
Seed is very popular in Japan. Very popular
I mean it definitely has most heroic design(insert some Setsuna "Gundam is the one who ends conflict" speech)
Setsuna would still coom
Exia isnt 00

And No, I ddint know
Damn physics and logic! The biggest obstacle for gundams to exist on our world
I’m surprised they didn’t use lighter materials, while the new redesign is cool, the original will always win. On another note MKII Gundam would be the next feasible thing
There’s always a solution if the budget allows. They could for example build it onto a building for extra support.
Only if there is a life sized Infinite Justice Type 2 inside.
It’s not hair!!!!! /screams in Tieria.

Yeah but that aside, it’s just not popular enough. It’s my favorite MS and mecha, I’ll have to settle for cosplaying as Nadleeh which is not, sadly, impressive.
“Hello, fellow human. I, too, am a fellow human.”
Yes. Yes, it would.

There is gunpla of it and I own it but it would not work on any kind of scale. And even then, it takes quite some finicking to model.

I blame gravity.
On second thought...Pyscho Mk II. Go hard or go home. 😂
You’re joking about being shock that wing is still the most popular series in the west?
Hold on, there are others?
My first thought was Sazabi. That would be epic.

https://preview.redd.it/bvc3bo8m8fxd1.jpeg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb9b433c77511cd17d29dc40ea5012b669c40c8c
Heck even a Zaku 1 might be a stretch.
Personally a kampfer or efreet.
Zeong would be cool. Doesn't even need to be 100 percent finished.
If we're talking zeon suits, my vote is Kshatriya or Goof Custom
Then make it a seed variant, totally not Nazi based.
or turn a with light up moonlight butterfly
That would be super cool
Has to be
https://preview.redd.it/98750h5zsgxd1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b3768f1a2fa9b4e16a760d67ee3a1636d08dec2

Char's custom gundam.
Shiki is debatably a gundam. Rick Dias on the other hand…
Hey watch your language
You dare question my fealty to our lord and savior?
Tbf it wasn't designed to be a weapon.  They just slapped a gun on top and called it a day lol.
Hence the nickname "Flying coffin".
Freedom is in Shanghai, China, and indeed it’s very popular there.
I always really, really liked 00 and I just love it more and more with time. Initially, it really stood out for me for being hard*er* sci-fi with updates that all felt *Tomino*, but, ultimately, for Celestial Being. I love rooting for them.
The weight wasn’t the issue, it’s the fact that I’ll catch the wind and the whole thing will come tumbling down
The daily cleanup would be nuts, though.
Show us your nadleeh cosplay please!
You’re definitely not connected to an AI or server, definitely a fellow human!
33 meters?  That would be crazy lmao
Yes and no. I get why it is. But let's just say... Even though I am one of the ones that it should have that effect on, it was my first gundam series, I just don't see why it is so beloved.

I guess I just missed the nostalgia bullet it fired at me.
Sazabi all the way
for sure mate 😄
do you think it’s because of the rounded parts, difficult to fabricate? Kampfer does sound good as well.
Zeong is big enough to be its own building and house a small shop or two

Neo Zeong could be the entire shopping mall by itself
oh good ones as well
https://preview.redd.it/vykf4x8zmfxd1.jpeg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29da94f85d5d2037d38d718274b0abde66460043
[deleted]
Just to add to the comment chain and why Seed was picked, my gf and I were in Japan few weeks ago and she doesn't give two flying haros about Gundam. But when she saw the PG Strike Freedom on display at the Gundam Base in Diver City, she pointed and said, "I like that one. It has so many colors and looks shiny."

So case in point. From non-Gundam fans perspective, Seed does have visually appealing models. I mean even to this day I love Aile Strike; just a solid looking Gundam.
00 is my favorite after Zeta and Unicorn
I am still working on it. Not sure if I want to go for a more humanlike rendering- which was my first idea- or make it more MS-like. 

Either way, it will come down to the wig, as that is what sells it as “Nadleeh” so I will almost surely get it custom made, then maybe string some LED lights through it to make it a bit silly.
“Look how convincing I am, got humans all fooled! What did you say, Veda? Veda…? Hello…? Computer has deserted me, 4040404040404040404-“
That's fair. I'm getting into the wider Gundam fandom as an adult, but as a kid, it really was the only Gundam I cared about. I got very attached to the characters. Now, I appreciate the absolute balls-to-the-wall insanity of it. Une dropping a guy out of a plane and shooting him as he falls, Heero's suicide quest, characters saying things that make no sense at the strangest times, Wufei shouting at hyenas, everything Relena ever says or does... It's nuts in the best way. I don't use pot, but if I did, I imagine the high would be like watching any episode of Wing.
Probably the skirts would be difficult to balance. 
That or popularity,
IT'S A GUNDAM!!!
wqsnt the rock doas the first mass produced suit made usinf gundarium alloy?
IMO Seed has the best Gundam design style.
Keep us updated! I know it will come out awesome.
yeah, nah would probably put the Feds to shame 😂
Prefer the real mechanics look of IBO. Frames that are compatible make a lot more sense.
Thanks! That’s…doubtful, though.
Been trying to get a piece of jewelry that looks like the V fin, too. 

Also trying to figure out if there should be skin visible- and how much- as a more organic feel sells the androgyny better.
Infinity Castle has got to be the coolest concept in new gen anime
The way Ufotable showcasing Infinity Castle throughout the anime was undoubtedly astonishing and they did such a great job adapting from the manga. While other anime series may share some similarities i think Infinity Castle is unique in its own way.

* happy twangs \*
I know it hurts my brain thinking about how it works
So good I wanna steal it for my manga. Jk
its gotta be a really unique and creative bda
That scene where Akaza is falling isn’t that where >! Shinobu fights Douma? !<
I enjoyed the whole concept of it so much I convinced my DM to let my artificer have something like it in the DnD campaign we were running
It is cool 🦋
It's very beautiful and feels very surreal
so fucking beautiful look too wow

Cmon now
It's cool, but does it have a bathroom?
Don’t say you like the anime if you haven’t read the manga

I kinda wished we saw what was in that palace surrounded by the lily pads
I thought it looked kinda similar to Yubaba's bath house from Spirited away.
That whole Hashira and Demon slayers entering into Infinity castle are was an extremely good sequence.

Also, the music was just🤌

You just can't praise the visuals and not mention music. It really brought out the gravity of the situation and beginning of something grand which hasn't happened yet in the series. I am really looking forward to hear only OSTs as well.
You do know the idea came from the manga and not an anime idea right???
Hhmmm, the concept may have come from the God's hand dimension in the prequel arc of Berserk which came in the early 90s

Replace the Japanese theme into medieval/baroque, and you got the God's hand dimension
Pocket dimensions aren't really unique in anime but ufotables depiction of the infinity castle is excellent.
All of this came out of a damn flower
Hell nah it's cool and all but calling it the coolest concept?
Infinity?

Would you live in there ?
I thought it looked kinda similar to Yubaba's bath house from Spirited away.
I'm like 99% sure the castle is CGI, but it's done so well and gives off the effects amazingly. I really want to see how it looks in the manga.
What scene does the akaza picture come from?
The concept of an infinite room, dimension, whatever, itself ist really anything special but the execution of it was superb
It is epic :3
i will NEVER understand why people add “in a new gen” or something like it. just creates a pissing contest of fans going “nu uh” and makes the community more toxic. just say “this is cool” and move tf on why does everything have to be a contest
Ufotable makes it interesting*
Is there any word on when the infinity castle arc will be coming out? I'm assuming 2025
Interstellar's Tesseract
This my crib fr
A labyrinth of japanese castle
Do I have an anime for you
honestly amazing. i hope they go crazy with it in the movies and make it a spectacle
I feel like it's less about concept and more about execution. Ufotable have both the talent and the motivation (from Mugen Trains success) to really make something outstanding. They stand alone on the top of the anime studio quality totem pole and they're going to outdo themselves again with these movies.

It’s the backrooms of anime and I love it
Ryōiki Tenkai
Reminds me of the millenium puzzle from yugioh
closest i can think of (and its not even an anime) was Maze Runner
Middle left looks like a shot of a big Japanese city, like for example Tokyo, during the Taisho era
I feel like the Demons who are going to a meeting have to go there two weeks in advance because they would get so lost would take them two weeks to find the spot
I prefer Infinite Fortress...
And to think we’ve already seen the Cult Garden where Doma and Shinobu battle.
Was it really well done for animation? Absolutely. Was it the coolest thing in new gens? Hell no, not even close tbh
This is once-in-10-year animator blow manga concept sky high. Cherish in it Imax, friends
The animation is really wonderful. I saw the manga references and the difference is astounding. It truly comes alive and the theme and coloring is also exceptional.
I want to know why all the non-hashira demon slayers didn’t die to fall damage.

I love the infinity castle, but I was confused, because wouldn’t you just let them fall instead of giving them platforms to stand on? I know the gravity is all wonky but still lol
Tbh although I disliked some of ufotable pacing and story-boardwriting decisions, though I appreciate how they honored the concept of the infinity castle, no other studio could have done it better.
And top left is douma
I wonder why there are a lot of pillars. Koku likes pillars ig?
She's an upper moon, right? Is her blood demon art the entire pocket dimension?
Wtf was in Muzan’s doctor’s medicine that could give someone power to create another dimension?
Ask Nakime how it works😂
You are really thinking about feasibility in a shounen show like Demon Slayer?
You know there's a quote ,"Good artists copy. Great artists steal"., so go on.  Looking forward to your manga
Same comrade I already have a sort of simular concept
It reminds me of the western air temple from ATLA
I see it as a Domain Expansion from jjk
it only took you a year to realise that?😅
I need the season and episode number plz
Doesnt need one.
Just you wait
Patience, my dude.
Name a cooler one?
r/beatmetoit
yeah
Why wouldn't you, I'd absolitely love to
Both have the traditional japanese look.
That is definitely not hand drawn but it’s still cool so who cares
You mean the mangaka.
Thr infinity castle works differently than real world; you can stand up side down like the upper moons in the first opening of s1.
The Demon Slayers are still stronger than an average person. They were all trained and selected before becoming a Demon Slayer. I think that they all can handle the fall.
Gravity, there most likely isn’t any fall damage, a kind of limitation that makes the place possible.
Gravity pulling from different sides negates the force a bit. If you're getting pulled from all directions (because there are no up or down in this realm) it's significantly less acceleration than a monodirectional gravitational force.
I think they did the manga more than justice. The anime is actually better than the manga. Just the way they have expanded battles, the music, the animation - it’s a masterpiece.
Ah  yes, the perks of being an upper moon. A city sized room. In another dimension only problem is you don't know where the kitchen .
Douma's crib is so pretty ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6744)

Hm…
Yup
**MAGIC**
Another dimension? Another dimension
Yeah tbh. What was man brewing that allows people to create infinite sized pocket dimensions?
Its gonna be a while
Except that you dont get fall damage (evident that even the weakest of slayers survive falling)
https://preview.redd.it/82104rfu6jed1.jpeg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f95d4be49dddadb9046ae30dfe868eefe4dc08e1
Of the image? It’s the first episode of Swordsmith Village
He means ufotable makes it interesting
I know, but it all depends on where they are. If someone falls for 50’, it doesn’t matter if there is a guy standing on the ceiling 100’ away. Their perspective has them falling 50’ to what they would see as the floor. The one standing 100’ away would see them falling towards the ceiling. 

Gravity wouldn’t feel different to you in the infinity castle since you would be experiencing it from your perspective. It’s all relative! 

I think the Hashira + Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke could survive a fall but I think the other Demon Slayers would be struggling if they happened to get a big fall lol

It’s just fun to think about. I’m not hating on the infinity castle whatsoever lol
I’d hope so. There are plenty of demon slayers who couldn’t cut it and had to quit too. It seems like most Demon Slayers can’t use breathing techniques very well aside from the Hashira and MCs.
I am not arguing those parts; we all know their art and music are good; I just had some issue with their pacing especially in the swordsmith village arc; if you compare it to something like Mahoraga Vs. Sukuna which was extended substantially while keeping the pacing consistent, in SV Arc ep.7 and ep.9 felt inconsistent even the manga was more extended both narratively and pacing-wise. There was also missed opportunity to expand Mitsuri fight in ep.11; also we haven't seen Zohakuten utilized like how Mahoraga did. 

 My 2nd criticism is the these anime-original dialouges are not the way I like them; in the HT arc we got alot of repeated dialouges; Let's defeat Muzan; he's looking for Nezuko; etc. A single scene of Kanao talking to Tanjiro is more important than all these interactions that don't add anything to the series.

Remeber unlike many who cares only about flashy fights, I care about execution more; when I read the manga Gyokko death felt fine, but in the anime due to the pacing issues it was underwhelming to a high degree.

I saw also many animators pointing such issues with the storyboard.
I mean SSV had a lot of pacing issues, but the fights themselves were stunning
You don’t really need a kitchen as a demon,  food poisoning is not exactly an option to need to cook
Nooo.. I didn't mean it like that 😭
It is the blue spider lily; based off of Japanese mythology and culture, so its powers, such as the infinity castle, come from divine forces if I remember correctly.
No worries take your time. Rooting for you!
I don't think that's where she fights doma though...  

If u remember , kanao opened a door and saw her getting absorbed
Must be some enclosed space , definitely not that big like that mansion in the picture
??
I think they struggled a bit, but they ARE demon slayers, so they are stronger than normal humans. You can see the demon slayers with Murata fall face first and struggling to land correctly, while the hashiras landed perfectly
That really surprised me. I assumed most could at least a little
They are probably average at breathing techniques. Tanjiro and Hashiras are just outliers lol. 

They could also do the same move that Tanjiro did at the Arrow Demon fight to negate the fall damage,
I can agree with Zohakuten and some of the dialogue stuff - though overall I still feel the expansions from the manga have been overwhelmingly positive.
[removed]
Aw man
Yeah, but I’m sure the fella forgot to add it in due to Muzan searching for it, so whatever he had earlier just did that fr.
Waterfall basin!
As I said the manga chapters are restricted to 18 panels, it's the job of the studio to show us how creative they're; ufotable did an amazing job with music, cgi, artstyle and animation; but I think Mappa storyboard writers are more creative with there extensions.

That bluray Mahoraga vs Sukuna speaks tales.
LMAO, this had me giggling, spoiler tag this just in case tho, this is too funny
spoiled again damnit
True but they also have to get the OK from the Manga Writer as well they can’t just Toss in extra stuff just because it would make sense to (even if they should have I agree with that) We all know Demon slayer prefers to stay to the Source material so no filler episodes or moments really. But some things do get the ok, for example Muichiro 1v2 against Sanemi and Obanai that was clearly put in for the specific purpose of showing how massive Muichiro’s accomplishment was and To show how much stronger he had gotten compared to the others. Wasn’t in the manga but was put in for expansion of the story.
I don't think the author is involved in any of the episodes her name wasn't in the credits of revisors; 

I personally didn't like the added stuff because there was an opportunity to flesh out Kanao relationships with Tanjiro hell even Shinobu but they didn't do it; instead we got scenes that don't add anything to the story.

Anime-original episodes never add anything of value; Naruto for example.
Huh I didn’t know they could just make the anime entirely separate without any input from the author
However I do agree they could have used the anime originals to flesh out the characters who need it from the short amount the got even in the manga
My guess is they have get the green light from the author to adapt the source material; I don't think Gotouge cares alot about anime-original contents; because it's the consensus in Japan that authors don't get involved in filler episodes.
Ok wth is this

Bocchi the Lock(on)
this is peak fiction
I cant believe Kita-chan is fucking dead. It is Ikuyover
just so everyone knows Bocchi and WfM aired the same season and I think their airtime gap is about 1 hour
The difference between two otherwise socially-anxious girls is that Suletta’s big sister is a giant robot.

Bocchi is the big sister **already**. She has a higher mountain to climb.
This is fukken incredible, is what it is
Least chaotic Bocchi scene

Aerial digivolved for that smash just to contain Bocchi's power
If they say this is season 2 of BTR i'll believe it
They call her a rock for a reason.
Witch of rock or bocchi from mercury. Anyway, that's the best thing I've seen in a long time!
Of course its Bilibili, I have seen so many good anime edits from there that are just absolute top tier. This is pretty on point next to the Frieren RA2 edit, chef's kiss.
a masterpiece is what it is
Art.
this was amazing
Just an average bocchi day
Bocchi edits are always so high tier, wtf
Welcome to the glorious world of Jaoanese memes that are way too well edited for no reason.

Love the yamcha reference
It was amazing.
bilibili always gives u the best
I would have been very disappointed if there was no slap
This would of made the show better
Peak cinema is what it is
This is pretty funny, but since Suletta is Hitori's #1 fan, why would she fight her?
Bocchi solos
bwaaa
Made funnier by Tieria as Bocchi artwork, which is a thing.

Lockon  Lockon
Instant best friends that season.

And their babysitter is Kobeni from Chainsaw Man, so yeah it’s perfect
Considering Suletta shares the same VA as one of Bocchi's only two fans in the world, not gonna be too terribly surprising.
I wish you were here back in Autumn 2022 anime season.
this is from BiliBili in China though
that's her default ground state, why'd ya think Nijika and Kita have to look out for her
nah, Suletta won't allow it. She's [one](https://bocchi-the-rock.fandom.com/wiki/Kessoku_Band_Fan_1) of the only [two](https://bocchi-the-rock.fandom.com/wiki/Kessoku_Band_Fan_2) fans Bocchi-chan has, after all, and she promised that Kessoku Band will perform live under Aerial to kick off their big tour.
The sheer anxiety in that room needs to be weaponised.
As I heard somebody put it:


"The fact that everybody expected Kobeni to be the anxious girl of the season, only for her to get double clotheslined by Bocchi and Suletta, is the most Kobeni thing that couls have happened to her."
the Shingeki no Anya was pretty good too. lol
Asian shitposts. Happy now?
Eri Samaya: <<I can help with that! Power-san!>>

Power: "With pleasure!"
the worst part is that so far, Kobeni hasn’t recovered as far as the continuations are concerned.

As of the most recent chapters of the manga, Kessoku Band is actually making good progress in their career. As of E24, Suletta is a married woman. >!As of this part of Chainsaw Man, Kobeni’s brother is in a weird cult and probably ultrahypermega-dead.!<

Kobeni really is just built for suffering.
You wake up and see albedo in front of you, what is your reaction?
She isn't agressive towards you, and have a lot of questions about this world. What would you do?

Best scenario: instant death

Worst scenario: Happy farm
I’m not Ainz so I’m probably dead.
Bold of you to assume I will be alive for enough time to have a reaction
Terror. She has been transported away from any conceivable way to reach Ainz/Momonga. She is basically a walking/flying tank. She wakes up and you are the closest target for her rage? Nah
Tell her that this is Ainz's homeworld. Now she will no longer hate humans
Pandora's Actor, what are you doing in my room?
Go back to sleep to have a tranquil death.
She looks pretty eepy, so I warm her up some tea

Oh fuck im about to die
Are you that desperate to lose your virginity?
well, if I'm still an human, die I guess
Have my name legally changed to Momonga.
Go back to sleep and wait for my death
I offer her a drink and anything she would need, and then treat her very respectfully
IM GONNA DO IT BATMAN
Since I'm not Ainz, I'll probably think of my last words.

I wouldn't recognize her, so I would ask, who is she and what she is doing in my room.

Lets be honest here, you wouldn't believe she is Albedo.

Besides, I would get way too lucid to treat that as a dream, I only ever stoped in 1 dream where I recognize I was in a dream and was kinda of an accident, so I would start to question my on sanity after that.
My reaction is to do whatever the hell she demands of me in the slight chance I don’t die
OH SHIT....RUN
Take my medications to make sure i'm hallucinating.   Cause if I ain't, then i'm fucked, and not the good kind.
Walk Away (I am scared of women)
"Albedo! Welcome to the homeworld of the creator gods, where worlds and universes are created every day. Are you here alone? Are the others late? While we wait for them how about i show you how the world of your master was created. Yes you heard me correctly, Momomga or Ainz is part of a creation, if you want you may have a look at it. You would be able to practically read Ainzs mind, do you want to know what he really thinks?"

Then i would give her my ebook reader and slowly back up.
I am fu©ked
Ohhhh. I fucked up. I fucked up baaaadddddd.

Depends: If i have a bad day, am tired and at my usual rate of unperceiving probably something along the lines of: "Damn cosplayer get out of my house."

In the unlikely event that i grasp the situation: Cowering on the floor, hoping for her hatred to hit someone else and that she does not know that ainz is not here.
Cry
Id probably shit myself 

because im not Ainz and shes probably going to kill me if shes just a tad bit unhappy.
Be extremely polite and useful. Ainz Ooal Gown/Nazarick are primarily a bunch of psychotic, sadistic ********. I don't want to end up flayed and infested with maggots. Or die in some other horribly ironic manner.

Sex. Is that what you want people to tell you? That they would have sex with a fictional character?

What are you doing man, be better.

Shit am I about to die? probably that or the rest of this entire kingdom just great
First thing first. Check to see if I am injured already. If I was and now I’m not, then it’s a toss up between fate-worse-than-death or new-hire. If I’m wasn’t injured and now I am, then I’m at best going to die swiftly once she gets what she wants from me. If I’m in the same condition I was when I fell asleep, then all bets are off. 


After that, listen to what she says, because unless she somehow thinks I’m Momonga I am in real danger, and the best way to avoid said danger is to do as I’m told.
Run...
fuck, fuck, fuck. I gotta run, nah it's too late I'm already dead as hell
Probably shit myself
Uhhh
Fuck
I would probably say something like: “Hello there. I have no clue what’s going on, but if you’re not a threat to me, I'm not a threat to you. Now, how did I end up here?” Politeness and staying collected are vital, especially when faced with a succubus who can mop the floor with you.
Be concerned about why someone's in my bed, most likely after screaming
Say what’s up to her
realize im probably about to die
Well I'm dead either way so might as well ask if there's a chance to at least die happy
First of all… which crime was I found guilty on? Second… which one was she?
I'd look for a way out of where we're. You've to remember what happened to philip! And she's programmed to be in love with ainz as well as hatred for humanity... I'm good... I'm passing this off to the other homies~

She may not be aggressive but the hatred is still there.

Sharing is caring :D

Remain calm as possible i possibly can and ask her who she is and if i'm lucky that she's not offended by that or my presence, i probably ask her what she wants me to do (asking her what she wants to sound too rude for me)
Bend over and hope.
Ummmm hi?
Praise lord inze
Wonder how I'm not already dead 😂 then try and go back to sleep
Run.
i'm afraid of women
.... (Looks down and realized I'm not bone day) Oh shit
I prostrate before her and ask for forgiveness and she's free to go wherever she pleases.

If she asks for explanation, I'll tell her I have honestly no clue and hope to Ainz-sama that he's around and he's willing to hear me out.
Better question is, if we had the mind control WI would anyone use it on her?
I'm gonna die, if I'm lucky
Well give a shot, if no your prob dead anyway so what’s to lose
I'd be just as confused as she is
I’d ask why the hell is Ainz trying to summon me?
Step 1: Scream
Step 2: Ask what she wants from me
Step 3: Answer her Questions about this World and also tell and show her that this is Ainz' Homeworld.
Step 4: Ask if she would like to stay with me.
Step 5: etc.

Ask her about every great thing ains own goal has done.
Breed then probably get killed by her without regrets
I'd sigh and go back to sleep. This wouldn't even be in my top ten weird shit that's happened to me.
“I’m dead…”
Be surprised, get context if I can, handle the situation from there. If we're both in prison like her clothing suggests, learn the hierarchy, guard schedules, security features, etc. Find a way out. Seeing as we escaped prison together and (hopefully) having proved myself to be competent, get employed, and forever be stressed because I'm pretty sure everyone there is going to be triggering the uncanny valley response in my brain. If I can, befriend Yuri because she is, as far as I understand, the least likely to kill me. If it's an interrogation, answer every question asked honestly.
As for other scenarios, no clue. There's too many of them. Again, I'm pretty sure she's in prison, and I'm blaming Shalltear because I can, and it sounds funny.
Are you WATCHING RULE34 again soldier?!!
Who the where the what the why the the the
Do you want a sandwich? :)
I will try to wake up again.
What did I do to piss her off?

How many of my family members are already dead?
Ask where I can apply to join Nazarick, better chances of survival that way.
Pretend to be Lord Ains and act confused to why my body is suddenly human
Take a feel because she hates humans. Might as well cop a succubus feel
Oh no, I’m in jail. Just hope for the best that she doesn’t kill me.
\*in sobbing screams\* PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!!!!!!!!
Depends on if I'm still human.
Panic. If Albedo is here then Ainz is definitely looking for her. And she’s definitely trying to get back to him. I’m not trying to be in between them.
Depends by the context and by her expression
RUN
Do what Momonga did
Do what Momonga did
Ask her “tried to steal Ainz’s bath water again? Girl you know it’s alive”
I do my best to get to Show her the Anime, also be very respectful and explain everything to her she wants to know
Im gonna die
Id comically launch my tongue and eyes out of my head while shouting „ZAMN“
I'll show her the Overlord anime
am I ainz? do she loves me?
Panic over how she will respond to the mousepad of her I bought.

Hopefully she will be flattered.
Where is my holy water! I need a high level exorcist!
pets
i guess ill die.
I’d be confused
My first thougd wpuld be 

Sid i realy wake up

Then say goodmorning
Praise Ainz and hope that she will spare my life, then run away at the first opportunity
Quickly check and see if I am ainz if not begin to talk ver fast and hope I live
One question.

Is my name Ainz? 

If not, I'll probably just prostrate myself and ask for forgiveness.
"It was a good life. Please do it painless"
pussy is the price
![gif](giphy|55itGuoAJiZEEen9gg)
If that happens I'm gonna go to sleep again and slip from reality
I’m scared but also a bit horny
WTF WHY ARE YOU HERE?!?!
Well shit I’m dead
She also wasn't (openly) aggressive towards Philip, and I'm not Ainz, so...


...still, at least she's not Demi
Scream " Master Ainz al goal is the best" until she leaves me alone lol
I'd simply offer her tea and cake, and try to calmly talk with her. No need angering a cornered animal as they say.
Look in the mirror and if im lucky clap some cheecks
SMASH

Time to die mutie
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit.
Beg for mercy
First, I look to see if I have become an elder lich or something like that.

If not, I immediately express my admiration and loyalty for Ainz Ool Gown.

Acknowledge that this is an apocalypse scenario where an unlikable with anything below nukes succubus with bloodlust for humans landed on earth.
if albedo was In front of me i'd probably say something like "oh great what do you want" or something, she's to horny for me to like her
That chick is fucked up, I suicide myself with the nearest thing at reach
Well normally I would be like "yes!!"  but if she had that expression on her face I'd be like "what have I done this time?"
Fear first but then the horny will help balance things out and I’d eventually calm down and try to converse with her to figure out wtf is going on… the rest will depend on how she responds/reacts
Albedo! How'd you sleep? Want some coffee?
I'm probably just dead, honestly....
Scream the blood of Jesus
“Why am I prison?”
![gif](giphy|cVCRlZeyLk1Y9Cgp5C)
🍇
“ I know the secret to winning Ainz’s heart.”
Bow, apologize for the intrusion, ask if she would like assistance locating Ainz-sama, pray (quietly) that she doesn't immediately tear my head from my body through my anus.
Roll over, crack a loud fart, and go back to sleep. 

I have no idea why I was recommended this sub and have no idea who this woman is, but I know for a fact that she isn't my girlfriend. The horns make me think she's probably a dragon or demon, though. Maybe I'll get lucky and she'll get bored and go away.
SMASH!

Get out of my house
Depends. If I isekai'd as Ainz, then I'd be happy!

If I am not Ainz, then I'd be going to Happy!
Let's play UNO!!
Weebs
Running, not messing with crazy....ever again
The real question is what does she look like? Like an anime character in the real world ? Or like a really well made cosplayer? 
I would probably just think it's some kind of weirdo for the second option, and question my sanity for the first one.
Hope to God she understands English and say, “Please, I have little value, beyond service. Spare me and my family and I will do what is required to the best of my ability.”
Confusion, then horror.
Did you pray today?😈
Please don't kill me.
Shit. I'm about to die aren't I...
Check and see if I'm Ainz and if I'm not I'll be praying for a swift death
If she isnt hostile than just dont make her angry and you are good to go! 

Pros:

1. Cute waifu
2. Cute waifu
3. Cute Succubus waifu
4. Smart waifu

Cons:

1. Constantly make sure shes not angry
2. Dont anger her
3. She can get angry even when you dont make her angry
"How did you get in...I locked the door"
Fuck! I didn't altered her personality and her settings...
Who? (I don’t recognize this character, but I’d probably try to answer the questions)
Convince her I’m a reincarnation of a supreme being or an equivalent to a supreme being like a player from another guild or something. Then proceed to tell her to take me to momonga. What happens next is a problem for future me….
''Can i touch your breast?''
what even is that thing?
https://makeagif.com/gif/plastic-nee-san-8-itQ_dj
I'd first be confused, then give her a possible explanation of how she might have gotten into her predicament, like trying to explain the mutiverse and pataphysics. Not sure how she would react, but I'd also give her just basic info on the world, she already sees humans as inferior, but hopefully tell her to think of what Ainz would do before she makes a decision, don't want her to cause world war 3 ok. 😱

Edit: Well, I will not be surprised if a religion or cult starts if she was real.
Scowling at me like that. "Oh fuck!"
Ask, what she doing here?
"She's not aggressive" ...will we know that before or after the initial "throw everything heavy while running" panic attack?
I read that so wrong
Say that I am Ainz but I got stuck on human form not even my all powerful magic can put me back in my normal form. Or just kill myself
I'd stop watching anime.
I'm probably dead inside lmao
Pretty sure she’d just kill me on the spot if I said literally anything directed towards her so ima just accept my fate and hope for a fast death
Panic (freeze, hold breath, wide-eyed). The usual items that would adorn my bed would have been moved to one side (three of them no doubt beheld with disgust, if not destroyed), a humanoid figure is sat on the other end of the bed with a disgruntled and frustrated look on her face.

Unlike the average human she's got horns, very long hair, and glowing, hostile yellow eyes.

Then I'd recover, give her the kind of look one should give an unforeseen incursion, and then lay back down before tentatively asking her how she got here.

Assuming magic and related things simply don't work IRL, she'd be no stronger than an average brawler-built human as the system doesn't reach this far beyond fictional reality.

She'd follow up with a lot of complex questions I'd try to answer, leading her to (easily) persuade me to buy Ainz merchandise for her own comfort - more a reminder of home - in exchange for warming up to me and accepting a simple mortal fact.

She's got no way to start a life of her own here; if she kills me, she's the one in trouble as she's not human, and she's in a world where she has no such power.

That, and her somehow still looking 2D in a 3D-real environment would be a bit of a fascinating anomaly.

I'd assume she'd become a gamer NEET, as there's no logical alternative besides getting into streaming - and even then she'd have to wear a disguise to avoid copyright infringement (which she'd also be frustrated with).

At the end of the week, this specific instance of Albedo would've likely come around to the idea of being friends (if only for her convenience), as well as finding her hatred for humans both challenged and affirmed...

Which results in her developing a frustration at how humans treat eachother among other things, which could improve her kindness towards people like the 'friend' she's stuck relying on for basically everything due to how our world works.
Am I going to die?
"Oh, shit. I didn't put my hands on you, did I" that type of you're screwed
![gif](giphy|W038TiB3SHLIBAnkYM)
Ask to die quickly or be left alone
why the hell am i in prison
I’m going back to sleep
Tell her that I am from Momonga’s world, but don’t know him personally. Using his real name might buy me a little bit of time and has less of a chance to trip her… “possessive” nature since I’m not a part of Ainz Ooal Gown.
...sleep
Immediate submission to the greater d&d demon with classes in antipaladin, unless passive effect of her mere presence are actively killing me.
Otherwise, complete submission while evoking the deepest poetry I’ve ever known
*Utter terror.

Negging the verse
I praise Ainz every 5 seconds as I Answer all her Questions.
"Ew, AI art!"
Run for my life. Considering what she wanted to do to Ainz, I would hate to find out what she would want to do to anyone else the hard way
Die
Get up and run, fuck that I ain't dying today
Die
I am dead

Yes, this is a BakaTest reference.
If the rest of the NPC came im selling out the US  to become a demon
I freeze up confused and ask she here?
"The fuck is this?"
"Magic doesn't exist here, magical beings last only 5 years in this world at best. You are an anatomical junk, you are not suited to life in this environment, and physics applies to you differently than before." Use her shock to run away and call for the HDF.
"Did I forget my meds again? (My hands have blood on them)"
Immediately swear eternal loyalty to Ainz and hope to be spared death and the farm... I would gladly become a lowly servant if it meant saving my skin.
Where's this art from?
Looks like it's an anime frame ngl

kill it with fire idk I dont read trash
Depends on the situation for me. But if I saw her like that, assuming we're both arrested for something. I'd simply greet myself, or try to. And move the conversation from there. Probably something like this.
"Me: hm? Oh hello my name is-

Albedo: I'm not interested in conversing with a worm like you.

Me: .... well what are you in here for?

Albedo: And why would I tell you?

Me: Just curious is all. Because I'm pretty sure that if you wanted to, you could easily break out.

Albedo: ....

Me: .. or not? Were you ordered to be here??

Albedo: I was told to do my time, worm. Apparently I need to learn my lesson, but I don't even know what it is.

Me: Well, I could maybe help

Albedo: NO!... I was told I had to figure it out for myself.

Me: A little help doesn't hurt. If anything I'd just ask questions for you to answer. Like if I handed you puzzle pieces to put the puzzle together.

Albedo: *displeased but gives in to the idea*

*from there I ask what happened before getting thrown in and if it was an often occurrence to get her to get her own conclusions, and to suggest a few answers. Most likely to treat humans with respect being the culprit*"
Go back to sleep
I’m going to fucking die.
Go back to sleep
sit there frozen in fear, she's absolutely brutal to anyone that isnt ainz.
There are worse ways to die...
If I see this id ask how I can help the supreme being
"Well. That saves me the trouble. Take me to Lord Ainz, please. I'm sure he'll be happy to know he has an information leak. His adventures are being transcribed against his knowledge."

Then, if appropriately rewarded, ask for a race change item and to learn a class so I may serve Nazarick
Go back to sleep
Valhalla or greatness awaits, possibly both as she turns my hips into paste.
I just want to a hug
I would shot her head off
Answer her questions and hope that she doesn't fucking murder me. Given her attire I would offer better clothes, but considering her stance towards humans that probably wouldn't be the best idea.
Fuck yes and no
https://i.redd.it/4onwiq7yd0yc1.gif

So you need help getting on that bicorn, I'm your man.

If she is my follower and horny than no questions just bang her non stop.
Ask how the rest of the story went
https://i.redd.it/rdekd9j7j0yc1.gif
Don't know where she comes from but severely concerned with how she got in my premises and pray that the Lord rebuke her cause I don't trust horned individuals.
Oh God, I've been isekaied.
"Uuuuh... Excuse me, what the fuck are you doing in my house?"
I go back to sleep
Oi, ain't you the lass that works for that Ainz mate?
Probably loud screaming, followed by either the passing of out or the subsequent loss of my life
“Get the hell out of my house”
I'm going to wake up, and this time for real
Suicide. Even if on the off chance I'm just being like recruited wouldn't I be tossed into a pit and eaten from the inside out by roaches anyway like every other human who got recruited to side with Nazarick? 

Yeah, I'm killing myself.
Nah I am cooked. If she gave me a hour to live i might read Don Quixote or try to grind to celestial in guilty gear.
Say her name. Maybe she’ll be so taken aback that I know it and about her that she’ll give me a few seconds to answer some questions and beg for my life lol
Youd be the bag of bones mc and thus you cant even fuck. Cus your a bag of bones
Say "I have something amazing to show you!" and turn on Overlord Season 1 episode 1, then ask if she's hungry or thirsty before we start.
“What the fuck”

Immediately cream my pants

Momentary joy, Followed by unendurable terror. I Die from shock
Wait, is she in a cell? God damn, she's in horny jail
“What the fuck are you doing?”
My first thought would be “what’s going on and why am I not dead yet?”
Instant death (she hates all humans)
I wouldn’t hear what she said and I would just say “suck it out already” then I would get sucker punched in the jaw and disintegrated
Given the subtext saying she's nice, imma help her acclimate to this place, and see if I can't like learn some powers stuff in exchange. Or help her find her way back as best I can. It'll be fun
Bullet
Momonga is a great guy isn’t he?
Realistically, I would have died on the spot:)
I'm a human... She will hate or kill me
I'm shooting my shot with her my life be damn I can fix her.

Good chance humanity’s fucked
Would will did
"ALL HAIL AINZ THE SUPREME RULER!" because I don't want to fucking die instantly, and then proceed to slowly back away from the situation, book a flight to the opposite end of the world and just live my life as if every day was my last, because at this point it just might be...
......oh god we are f*cked....( No like seriously. Floor guardian? In prison? Even if its some scheme im screwed regardless)
I’m going to be as polite and cooperative as possible, I know what she did to her arranged husband and it still gives me chills
Unknown person.
Attack without hesitation
I would bow and try to reduce and breathing.
Go back to sleep, obviously I am having a nightmare
I dont even know who she is, so probably I ask her who she is and whats doing in my room
*What the-*

~~to be continued~~>
https://i.redd.it/7tplhturz0yc1.gif

I show her this
Give her a cookie
Umm run?
Un-ZIP...
"Yuck, AI shit"
Tell her not to be a dumbass and start killing people. I don’t give a shit if you are some magical demon bullshit. If you pose enough of a threat to humanity we will nuke your ass and you may be strong but you are not nuke strong.
"whoawhoawhoawhoa. So many questions already, and I haven't even gotten out of bed. Put a hold on them until I get some coffee, damn. My brain doesn't work that fast, it needs a kickstarter."

I see a lot of people not reading the flavor text. They put that image for attention, and it definitely worked...
Tell her that I'm Ainz's biggest fan (aside from herself, obviously) and that I want to start a fan club. I imagine that's the best chance of not getting my skull caved in.
JIZZ what were yall thinking
"I am ainz ooal gown and it seems we've been transported to another world" too easy
Istg I can be of use to Lord Ainz, PLEASE DON'T LET ANY OF THE FLOOR GUARDIANS TAKE ME!
If it's saying that she is a slave or a prisoner, then let me save her😏👌
Rizz her up
Easy, panic and desperately trying to escape.
Depends on who I woke up as, am I ainz then she getting it, if Im not then Im getting it.
Go back to sleep.  I'm not Ainz so she'll have no interest in me.
Step 1: prepare to die
Step 2: ask how I may be of service to the supreme being.
Step 3: pray the answer isn't either "die", "happy farm", or "cockroach seedbed".
Seems i landed in horny jail.
this is AI. look at her left foot. what the fuck. gross
“I’m so fucked”
"What the fuck is going on!"

And that's how I met my roommate from another world
![gif](giphy|14ut8PhnIwzros)
"Good morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep well?"
Smash
Run the fuck away, are you serious?
First thought: I'm gonna die.

How to survive: Talk about how great Lord Ainz is.
I'm doing my best to make peace with God and hoping my death will be swift, painless, and final.
Mate, I'll just ask her to make it quick.
Albedo, I only going to ask, where am I?




I'll explain later how I know your name.
Can I edit her character sheet before she starts killing me?
Run
If I’m not Ains she gonna kill me 💀
Excuse me lady, is it okay for me to ask the reason as to why you are her-- *dies*
Probably just accept my death
Albedo?! The fuck? Wait, I'm not in my PC..... Albedo, who else is here?
“How the hell did truck-kun reach me on the fifth floor?!”
Offer her tea and nibbles before moving on to wine and I'll tell her all she wishes to know. I really would rather be on her good side, after all.
In logical thinking she wouldn't be here Infront of me away from her idol without a strong reason, so i will just ask i suppose in complete fucking fear
"Why are you here?"
And what will i say/do will be depending on her answer
Dropkick her
id call that tshirt Mating Stripes lol
Me: Hello there Then i am dead

![gif](giphy|xTiIzJSKB4l7xTouE8)
When the new season coming our?
I guess I'll just die then...
Death is imminent
Proceeds to call 911
Okay what did I do and is my death going to be quick
Immediately prostrate myself as a lower lifeform should.
Well I'm probably about to get my existing license revoked for the crime of being human.
Lady Albedo, guardian of The Great Tomb Of Nazarick! You serve  the supreme beings! (Kneels) It is an honor to meet one who serves the great Ains Goal Gown!  I doubt anything I have is worthy, but may I offer you anything.

She may let you live if you are sutably reverent to Lord Ains.
Lore accurate Albedo? I'm going to take off running and hope to god I can get away before I evoke her ire.
Why am I in jail?
If I want to live I will fall on my knees and praise Ainz 

If I am feeling frisky I will beg her to kill me while I jerk off.
You know that scene from fallout where the radiation bear is chasing the power armor? And he's just running away panicked yelling fuck fuck fuck fuck. 

That's my reaction. There's no way I'm living
Shoot my shot. I’d say something stupid like “don’t you just hate humans” and then she’d say yea and kill me cause I’m a human
Better to get far away from her.
I scream and then I die? I'm a filthy human.
"Im dead"
I honestly don’t know?
I answer her questions the best that I can. And then I plan on telling her about the omniverse, and reveal the anime she came from.
Can you still not ride your bi-corn?
I would bang her.
Welp. I’m gon die.
Ask if I can see Lord ains and wish to offer my everything to his greatness
Well, I Guess I'm going to die or be used in some fashion. I would prefer death to being skinned alive repeatedly.
i'd die because im not a supreme being or part of nazarik
Ask her if she wants to ride a bicorn.
Clap
Ask how her fantasy biology is holding up in realistic physics.
Put her in my bed
Put her in my bed
Fear, terror, scared to death. Horror. I have seen what she can do and what tics her off.
Answer whatever questions she has that I can answer and become friends with her. Thats it.
Oh fuck
I pray she doesnt kill me
I’d just ‘Nope’ out of there, by any means necessary.
Ask for a quick death
Is albedo is in front of me and i am not Ainz then i am dead or will be worse than dead.
Answer her questions. Y’all idiots
Attempt and fail to flee
I'm fucked in more ways than one.
Albedo it's me Ainz i've turned myself into a human Albedo i'm human Aiiiiinz
I humbly ask to be converted into a servant of Nazarick physically, for I've always longed to be in their ranks and to not be a lowly human (or something)
Go back to sleep. I'm too tired for any sort of shenanigans at the moment.
Mommy
To get a restraining order
Going back to sleep to see if this is a dream. xD
Who the de fuq are you
RUN!!
Run
we getting dirty tonight
How did I end up in jail is my question I thought was I was a good sport🗿
Yes
Royally Sorcerer King fucked. Like sinister demon or sadistic vampire fucked. Bad. It’s pretty bad.
It would be disturbing to find Sebas below your bad.
Realistically? Fine. I know his true (username)name, so I could at least identify myself as someone else who got isekai-ed. That alone would prompt momonga to help me, assuming I got the chance to speak to him directly. 

I wouldn't dare mention that I knew his name to any of his followers, though. They might torture me to find out how I found out, and no thanks for that.
Start praising momonoga and you might survive
Asking the real questions...
Things are already pretty bad with Albedo, unless she can be convinced to not be evil.
Theres a happy farm waitin for all of us yay
"How the fuck do you know who Philip is" *kills you* and that's supposedly the best possible scenario lol
Yeah, out of all of their members. She is literally the worst one for anyone to meet. You could probably reason with the others to some degree. But anything you say to her would just increase your odds of death. 

Asking her to speak to Ainz directly will probably earn you a fate worse than death, in fact. Your only real hope with her is to basically prostrate yourself in front of her like you would a god and hope you amuse her enough for her to let you live.
I’d probably just say “Can I help you?” - don’t offer anything specific, don’t mention anything that might piss them off.
This is the only answer lol
Death by grasp heart would be the best
death truly is a mercy in nazarik
Where did you get this from
Don't threathen me with a good time
This is the realest answer
I don't think she will believe you
My exact statement will be “praise the great and magnificent ainz ooal gown. I wish to pledge service to the great tomb of nazarick.” I’m either dying for knowing too much or getting turned into a demon undead thingy with magic.
Or can show her all the ainz merch and stuff you have. And say you can help her get more.
theres no connection between ainz and humans in her mind, to her shed just be amazed that Ainz managed to overcome such flawed roots to become something so great
Bold
You are going to die screaming my friend
Hahahahahahaha hahahahahaha 🤣 😂 😆
Love? Did I miss the part, where she's in love with me? 

I just hope to be able to convince her not to kill me.
You also seem quite desperate to lose your life with that response.
She’d kill you for being so brazen as to take the name of her lord and love.
And even after all that, she'll throw you in the happy farm.
She would kill you before you could even get out of the room
That might work…
Not of I get there first.
the only good answer if you are going to die you might as well have your last words be a line from skyrim

She would kill you.
Rest In Peace
she would kill you before that anyway
OR!!!! THINK OF IT THIS WAY, you watched the anime, you know of momonga, bugubuguchogima, and all the other friends he knew. You also know about his plans and his base, who his other identity is. You can legit say you were friends with the others in the real world.
Like our entire kingdom is getting raised fucked
Nah, just ask him if he wants to cuddle.
See the "Im gonna die" portion of the comment.
No just say ainz is the best of the best he is my god I shall worship
after the villagers got stakes up there ass I wonder what will happen to my family
If its even remotely anything like a heart attack I would not recommend it. Those can be pretty painful.

True Death is where it's really at!
ill show her the anime
"and ooal gown" I'm sorry bro, autocorrect has killed you
There's a lot of this in this sub. Just look at the newest posts. All about x or y character in love with you
I lose my life, she keeps her virginity.

I ain't losing that fight.

Rest in pieces
That works with anyone that isnt albedo. She will just kill you lmao
yea yea ik I am saying this would also lead to that
I think you underestimate how little she thinks of humans, and how greedy she is about Ainz' attention. Overpraising Ainz is only slightly less likely to get you killed than trying to oppose him.
She’d probably kill you for daring to say Ainz’s name. Humans are worms to her. And worms shouldn’t be speaking.
Depends on who is tasked with your area. If it's demiurge, just kill yourself.
Its near instant , much better than the other options
Smart
Might not be the best idea then she will see that ainz programmed her to be this way as a joke
It giveth and it taketh away. Much like she shall taketh my life for insulting ainz like this
Yeah I just found the solution one further down in my feed.
You do realize she can just pick another person down the street right?
Why yall acting like she's desperate to lose her virginity. she wants to fuck ainz not just any mf
Nah bro
Rest in bologna mist
Yeah, people tend to forget that she literally assembled a special force behind Ainz's back just to hunt down other Nazarick members
Yeah, she is absolutely the worst member of the entire crew to meet face to face. Almost anyone else would be easier to convince to not immediately skewer me, and she would be the worst person to notify that you know Ainz personally. 

Ainz would be the best, and hopefully just him alone. I could reason with him and mention Earth. I could probably convince him to give me the demon transformation treatment so I could survive as a minor advisor, because screw trying to survive in that world as part of any other kingdom.
Okay, but the post says she's not aggressive towards you.
Like that'd do you any good. **"TRUE RESURRECTION"**
"If Ainz sama programmed me to love him, he probably wants me to be his wife, I couldn't be happier."
She is aware of that .
Didn't ainz directly tell her that, just to be met with "i dont care"?
If anything,  she'd be happy to know
Bold of you to assume she'll do it with anyone else besides Ainz.
That person will probably run away from seeing a horned woman.
I mean, dying isnt so bad, could be worse
She did
Oh, well.. in that case....


Scream at the top of my lungs and run away slightly slower.
death truly is mercy in nazarik
Yea pretty much
In this day and age? They'll just assume she's a cosplayer and that it's fake.
true
It's funny how an actual demon can roam the street and people will think of it as some cosplayer lol
Yeah that is crazy how nobody would suspect a demon right in front of them, by the way, do you have some worldly desire that you'd give **literally anything** to fulfill? Maybe a desire for Fortune, fame, power?

Not that I could help, I'm just a regular guy... Unless you have a desire like that?
Thanks I'll pass black cat
"Do you remember love?"

Not seen is Hideaki Anno having his heart broken as we need to include the mandatory Macross love triangle
"Do you think love can bloom, even on the battlefield?"
Doomed yaoi
Will never happen in my lifetime, but the great pipe dream of mine is a Macross x Gundam crossover with Breaker's customizability but combat from Project Aces and FromSoft. Yes, this knowing that only 00 technically achieved warp/space-jump tech and that the overtech of Macross would make writing a coherent story tough.
I keep thinking that bouquet of flowers is a giant photoshopped in Crepe
Irl Char x Amuro
Why is Yoshiyuki Tomino dressed as Junpei Iori from persona 3?
Judau steals both Misa and Minmay with his harem newtype powers away.
Now I want a karaoke powered Gundam.
"But I'm sex pervert like you too, Tomino-sama!"
I love Gundam AND Macross... the two are BOTH near and dear to my heart, and always will be... :)
Yeah I'll ship them
Fantastic. Fucking. Song
We got Kawamori's designs in Stardust Memory, that's good enough for me. GP01 my beloved.
Whelp, it's stuck in there. Time to listen to [Ai, Oboete Imasuka?](https://youtu.be/nnND91h-cgk?si=MMLQAAT9L9Fb2i1_) Bless the Little Queen version...
So whens the macross games coming to the west?
Was just listening to that song
Tomino... my beloved.
Tomino: Bro, not infront of the cameras....meet me back in the War in The Pocket display.

Kawamori:  Oh yeaaahhhh..pockets...riiiiiiight \^\_\_\^
Leeeeel
sorry, Tomino's heart belongs to Nagano
Is this actually real or just photoshopped?
This gave me a new idea for the next gundam.
We already have art of Eli being Frontal's replacement pilot for the Sinanju.
God now I want a Love Live crossover (Hello Kitty Style, not metaverse Miku style)
Nah, the triangle's third is Leiji Matsumoto. 

Anno is off to the side weeping and worshipping. I'd be right next to him.
Certified Kojima moment
Well, Setsuna once did that.
Bro, I always wanted to have a Union between
Macross x Gundam X ace combat x armored core. It just is soo.... PEAK!!
It's not exactly "combat from Project Aces and/or FromSoft" or "Breaker's customizability", but there's a PS2-era mecha crossover game series called Another Century's Episode (1-3, ignore Portable and R) that feature many mecha franchises including Gundam and fully transformable VFs.... made by FromSoft lol. Think of it as an action game version of SRW.
The closest we have is the Super Robot Wars giga-crossover franchise.
The man likes his baseball cap and dress attire combo.

#And the show has a Uraki-Purpleton-Gato love triangle to boot.
I like the Walküre Girls' rendition. But for nostalgia, Lynn Minmay's original version is the best.


But two of my favorite versions are:

2. [ANIMETAL USA](https://youtu.be/TMGMCI_X8LY?feature=shared)
Who’s Nagano?
Where would Go Nagai figure in all this? Shouldn't this be a foursome?
NANI!?! (Ty ;3;)
Damn,we need a rerelease for those games on modern platforms,PC included.
There's also the SD G Generation franchise.
Even though I am not into gundam and this post was recommended to me, I must say he got my respect
Nagano is the designer of Hyaku Shiki, who also cosplayed  as Sailor Venus. Tomino also has a love hate relationship with Tomino, who buddied up with him because of his artistic and fashionista flair, but Tomino has a crush on a girl and that girl was in love with Nagano and married him

Honestly the other three are probably bowing to HIM.
as their guardian angel...

wait, why does his angel have demon/devil wings... and that's Shin getter's scythe in his hand
What decade is that from?

And then we see Nagai bowing towards Ishinomori Shoutarou who is then bowing towards Tezuka Osamu
can't believe they left out Ishinomori smdh
Ishinomori sensei is a step above tbf
Do, you think it would be a good ending if Ainz. Was trapped alone forever. 
Like, the series began with Ainz sad about how all of his friends had moved on with out him. So, a good of ending would it be if after all the evil he had done, or the people he killed. He ends up being trapped in a void the he can never escape from or be rescued. 

Just alone with a throne and no one to talk to. His undead nature forever keeping him alive. Only thing to keep his mind occupied. Knowing that his journey ended as it began, him being left alone, and forgotten. 

Also, this would make sense, given how no one in the new world can kill him. So, trapping him would be a good counter, and something Ainz wouldn't expect. It could be like a Wild magic item made to counter the OG players who arrived in The new world. 
His good ending already happened in Vampire Princess of the Lost Country where's he's true to himself, made friends, let go of the past, and isn't anxiously playing a role to satisfy his subordinates who don't know the real him. 

Sadly, main story Ainz is probably doomed to always be miserable and alone while Nazarick destroys any hope of him building real connections.
I've read a fanfic a little similar to this, Ainz isn't imprisoned, but he conquers the entire world, but after thousands of years he just becomes vegetative and depressed, he orders the guardians to only interact with him if it's something extremely important (level a new player or another mind control of shalltear) and sits on his throne in a vegetative state, thousands of years pass and people in the new world think that ainz is the god that the guardians worship, because no one sees him anymore, albedo is extremely depressed about no longer interacting with her loved one.



However, all the guardians believe that this is also part of their 10 thousand year plan, and in the meantime Ainz is just lost in thought for eternity.
Such heresy and treason spoken before lord ainz
Well written maybe but not a good ending for him. Heartbroken, a lonely god of death with no one but the computer generated children that he and his friends created and the endless graveyard of his and their victims.
Our definitions of “GOOD” are very different
There are no good endings for the main timeline. Like the other guy said the good ending was the vampire princess story.

The ending for main timeline doesn't need to be bad, but definitely evil and dark, that's what we're here for.
Yes. 

He's a monster that his previous self would have rejected.
No. And frankly, it would feel lazy.

It's much better as it is right now. He's also trapped, but in a more constructive way. As an undead, his goals are bound to slowly drift toward single-mindedness. And he only values Nazarick and the NPC, so this will keep him going. He'll remain trapped in the role that he forced upon himself, never finding peace, never finding balance with the NPC or the New Worlders.

A metaphorical prison with walls painted to look like the outside world, or something like that.
A good ending would be the restoration of his normal human emotions.
I somewhat agree, i dont think a happy ending fits Overlord (or Ainz)
Nah, he will eventually open up to the npc's is a matter of time he will at least be himself with a few of them and have a real connection, is just a matter time, something he have a lot of.
This really wouldn't address any of  Overlord's themes. So no. Do I think he is going to meet another player? Prob not, but I think he will accept his fate with the NPCs. With only 2 left Vols left (if it doesn't get extended again), I can't see the world-shattering satisfaction of an ending right now. We will see with the new novel soon what direction we will go.
I would agree with your statement I don't know about "Trapped" persay but I would say him ending up alone would be the best ending and I believe that is where we are headed. We have seen multiple times in the show/LN that he is afraid of telling his subordinates how he feels, we have seen him constantly say he wishes he had his friends back and he sees the guardians as representations of them. 

The best scene I believe that represents this is at the end of season 1 of the anime or the bloody valk volume where he gets a flash of his friends in the guardians place and reaches out to them followed up by albedo reaching her hand out. I believe there will come a time where he will finally see he never needed his friends back and his guardians were his friends all along at which point it is too late.
Wild Magic & World Items wouldn't even work on Ainz because he has his own WI (the red orb in his chest), so your conclusion makes no sense.

Besides, Overlord basically *is* the bad ending. As others have already pointed out, the side-story novel was the good ending. Even if other players were later transported into the New World, they wouldn't be his friends & the NPCs would exterminate them anyways.
What if Ainz just didn't care about his friends and straight-up go bonker crazy.

His life in Nazarick gonna be free of stress that for sure.
Lol no, the GOOD ending is him conquering the world and accepting his new life, both things that will eventually happen, thats it, you dont need to go unecesary philosophical ending lol.
I know my opinion will be both unlikely to ever happen and probably unpopular; I want him to embrace taking over the world and creating thst utopia he wanted, and also reigning in/supporting his npc kids in developing their own goals and desires (like he wants for Aura ,& Mare). When you have ultimate power and rule the world you can use it as your playground BUT you don't have to be an evil dick about it. 
Failing that, use a race change item, die a few times to loose levels and become an adventurer. 
Yes I'm being silly.
Not at all, I want to see Nazarick at its peak with him ruling. I couldn't care less about the people they topple.
I feel like people who ask the question still don't understand the show. You are not watching a Shonen anime. Stop looking for a hero or the good guy. Ainz is still going to do more massacres and nothing will happen to him.
Yup, him trap fits his evil actions and ends as an evil sealed in a can.
What if AINZ was BETRAYED and TRAPPED in the HYPERBOLIC NAZARICK CHAMBER for 1000 YEARS!??
it would be a horrible ending, for me he already got his happy ending in episode 1 where instead of having to be enslaved in a shitty world without his favorite game, he becomes an immortal wizard with everything he loved being real.
I think for an end he will find no others of his guild, and will bring about uniting everyone under his rule and slowly roll back his governing until he is like the platinum dragon lord in guarding the world at large. But he won't let xenophobic tendencies stand or mass crime.
First of all, never gonna happen. And second of all that's a bad ass picture.
how is this a good ending???

Ainz conquering the world is the good ending
The best ending would be Ainz sitting in his throne after conquering the world, finally having satisfied Demiurge's plan he gets ready to sigh and relax for once when Albedo storms the throne room and informs Ainz that a portal opened and extremely powerful monsters from a new world are invading and already making demands for Nazarick to surrender, Demiurge gaslights himself into believing Ainz already knew this was going to happen and Ainz just dies inside knowing he will never be free of prohlems
Traped in the persona of the overlord,  never being able to be himself until Suzuki Satoru fades into silent solitude.
My money is on him making the perfect world for his friends children and finding a way to leave and return to real life (or to return to the real world he needs to die in the new one but the twist is nothing in this world can kill him so hes stuck playing a role forever that he doesn't want to play)
Good? No poetic perhaps. But in said scenario the guardians would do everything possible to bring him back and that could be a good ending.
remedious stop posting.
In a way he already is.
He already is
My perfect ending for Overlord would be a call back to episode 1 where players try to invade Nazarick: 

https://preview.redd.it/qlj3wui9gnyd1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a0a14cb248881f51c235a040cc0309f49f0a9c

After he successfully conquers the entirety of the new world and Nazarick is established as the ruling evil overlords of the world, **we skip 100 years to a new set of Players arriving in the new world**. 

They attempt to attack Nazarick and are easily slain, and we see Ainz emerge, this time backed by the NPCs instead of his team members, whom now treat him as his friends treated him. 

He laughs and is happy to be living the Yggdrasil experience again. 

would be a good ending and a perfect way to round out how the series began.
Like, being betrayed and trapped in the time chamber for 1million years? Theoretically
He is.....
Honestly, with the author being so over writing the story he should give him a better ending.  As others said the good ending was in the side story, but that was him giving up everything as he had nothing to hold him down like the tomb.  I just want what he thinks he has with good friend jirvinchi but actually wants to know ainz more personally.  Currently he has too many buffers ie npcs.
If thats the scenario, i believe he will react a breaking point and off himself.
No if he is trapped without anyone then he will slowly buy surely began to his sense of self and start Turing into a monster than he already is and probably soon he will try to destroy the world after losing himself
What if Ainz gets betrayed and trapped in the time chamber (throne room) for 1000 years.
I feel like the ending is gonna be either Ainz dies but is ultimately glad he goes out the way he did and that he got to live this life or it's gonna be an "I've won, but at what cost?" type ending
Do you think it would be a good ending if *insterts 7th layer of hell experience*? 🤔
He who took everything that didn't matter, lost everything that matters.
What if TouchMe is  **Tsaindorcus Vaision** (the Dragon with the puppet that almost killed him in Season2?)

You then can have them reconciling, and Ains using his necromancy to make Touchme an Undead to serve as a Light god to his darkness!
I think it'd be a good ending if you used punctuation properly.

I say this as a non-english native, mabey a few mistakes are easy to overlook, and I won't keep you at fault because of them, but punctuation is the same everywhere so I don't understand how you didn't use it properly twice in a title
I’m hoping for a somewhat good somewhat bad ending where ainz gets everything to where the world has no more war no more hardships then just seals his tomb in Nazarick to sleep for eternity with the statues of his friends. It would be a fitting end for the man who conquered the world because of a little slip of the tongue.
WHAT IF AINZ WAS BESTRAYED AND TRAPPED UNDER THE NAZARICK TOMB FOR 10000 MOMONGALLION YEARS?!?
I don’t think overlord will have a happy ending, I don’t think it will be ainz alone forever but I do think that all the terror that ainz has caused will catch up with him in the end in the form of maybe some other players will appear and destroy all of the floor guardians
Bros role playing as the God Emporor
It would be great if Touch Me and the other 10 came in to save momonga
no?
He’ll nah I think he should have skeleton babies with all the guardians.
The only silver lining in this is that Ainz/Momonga is aware that his 'humanity' has been slipping further and further after the world transfer; by the time he lost all of it in the future he'd probably no longer care about being lonely- or nothing else at all, for that matter. 

At that point he'd be no different than an automaton that fully commits into the role of Ainz Ooal Gown.
Depends on the context. He still have no idea what happened to Momonga.
Nope. I love Overlord as it is... its the uniqueness of evil characters getting what they want and win in the end. Not some cliche and stereotypical "oh bad guy in the end must be defeated, sealed, and repent for their actions." No. The despair taste sweet lies in toppling down the good, the innocents, and where the typical 'heroes' cant do anything about it and just hope for this useless miracle as Nazarick completely conquered the whole planet with nothing stopping them.
Maybe it could be but I would be really sad, because for that to happen there would have to be a huge k.o. in Nazarick and a lot of characters would die
This would be the worst ending ever man u depressed or something like wtf
Overlord will end with Nazarick finding out Ainz isn't an Overlord Super Ruler of Death and just a normal dude, and accepting him anyways.
I want to see some one do to him what he has done to other humans take his guardians kill then revive them and experiment as well on them... then he will know what he put everyone through. But the character I hate most is the princess I want Cline to kill her horribly. Sabause promised to pay blind and brain back but will never get the chance to because one is dead and other has been crippled and is willing to turn himself into an imp because he doesn't know the truth about the one he has been following like a dog blindly...
It would be a Theatrical masterpiece. It's absolutely boring watching him steamroll the entire globe uncontested. But they're probably not going to, because everyone wants a happy ending at the end.
I would like it if he had a son but right when he’s born he disappears and nobody can find him until they go to the mausoleum and see how he now has a statue signaling that he has gone to where the other 41 supreme beings have gone then 18 years later the baharuth empire tries to rebel and the get all the way to the entrance of the tomb with an army of 800,000 thousand soldiers and all the guardians are out front ready for battle along with his son and as he steps forward he says I”’ll make you proud father” then suddenly a massive spell hits the army’s rear and a huge beam of light shoots down right in front of the son and Guardians and Ainz Ool Gown steps out and in a commanding voice that is heard by everyone he says “I have Returned” before decimating the rest of the army
I personally would love a classical good triumphs over evil ending.

Suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere (at least from the perspective of Nazarick) a group of unlikely heroes appears and somehow and somewhat begin to manage to defeat the NPCs.

This way Nazarick meets its end as what it was in the game, a dungeon to be conquered by others, with Ainz as the final boss.

Tragic for our protagonists, but very fitting.

And maybe as an open end note, have the epilog show a new player arriving to the world. This way Ainz and Nazarick join the previous players and npcs to the legends and myth of that world.
Oddly enough that's his happy story with a possible bad ending. But he had over a century of fun and adventure so even if it ends bad he had a good run.
That dose sound good and i didn't know the light novel already ended.

My bad
Can you tell me weather i can read 'Vampire Princess of the Lost Country'. I have watched all the seasons of the show (i have noy seen the movie nor have i read the novel). I want to know how much i need to cover for me to be ready to read 'Vampire Princess of the Lost Country'.
Is there an audio book?
That sounds very similar to what happened to the God Emperor of Mankind in Warhammer 40K. Sitting on the golden throne forever without being fully alive nor fully dead. An awful fate indeed.

https://preview.redd.it/ogm654mttkyd1.jpeg?width=587&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb1c64267b60a69c1ee53bd4e2d6472e71b0a1a
Come on man you gotta drop the sauce
That sounds very interesting, do you happen to have a link to it?
I mean the only reason he conquers the world in the first place, other than misunderstanding, is to spread the name of his guild so that his friends can find him, if they came along with him.
I imagine that if he achieved his goal and got no reply, it would absolutely wreck him.

But I can also imagine this situation, where he is depressed and drifting through his eternal life, when one of his friends finally appears in the new world. I could only imagine how they'd feel about what has happened, how he has conquered and killed.
How much their non-human nature would effect their minds as well.
Bro got interned into the throne for thousands of years.
... That sounds terrible 🤷. Then again i dont like fan fics almost at all the level of writing to the orginal is usually horrible. no hate ofc.
Happy cakeday
I’ve written something similar actually! Although I’m a sucker for a bit of a happier ending so there’s a twist to the one you’re talking about (which was great btw, glad I got to read it).
How dare you assume that The Grate Ainz, would be offended, let alone pay attention. Too the speculation off a low class citizen.
I mean like story wise. We have seen there are no happy ending in the series. So, it would be fitting, that Aniz doesn't get one
Haven't read it. Sorry i didn't know the series ended 

And this isn't dark? 

Knowing that in the end, that you weren't the main character. All the evil action you committed ment nothing and just like all games, thier is nothing left. For your character once the game is over.
I wouldn't say lazy.

It would be dramatically fitting with how the series started. Like he would truly have nothing and with no emotions or feeling no distractions. Forever in paying for the evil he committed.

However, to each thier own.
That would be even better. Because all the guilt and of what he did would hit him. He probably would be unable to live with himself and want to die. But, can't die.

Also, it would make being trapped even better, because he would be unable to think, about anything else.
The happy ending is in the side story. The main story is likely to end with the "perpetual dread" ending.
The thing is he is already opening up but the NPCs think there is more than what they hear and it is some ploy to a grander scale. Ainz will forever be trapped in this cycle as his luck is so high that even some nonsense he thinks and do will always magically do favors for them in return
It was more thematically speaking like story wise.

It was just a fun idea i had
I know that. I was just saying would it be a good ending not that it will happen.

Also, it would really fit with the whole Ainz won't be beaten in fight and wouldn't die for his actions.
Then is left on the moon and 10'000 years later people open it. Freeing his evil across the world, and world needing 5 teenagers with attuned to stop him
depends on the perspective. I kinda like this ending. The one with world domination will just not have the spice i crave. I mean, I like the story as it is, but it on world domination will just not be much of an ending. Also, we have only 2 volumes left, so it'd take a long time skip to do that
I am interested in how any enemy would get to any place of worth. Nazarick "has" a path to the boss room but the defenses can loop players infinitely or even trap them. In the old world/game you would be penalized for making a base that does not allow you to complete it. In the new world we dont know if any penalties exist.

Honestly, him winning and ruling the world only to see that there is nothing for him makes more sense to me. To be stuck and kept alive by all his kids driven to madness.
Not really. I don't really find Anzi sympathetic and i just think this would be a more interesting ending. Then the Ovious he wins
The side story is a what if scenario, where Satoru/Momonga is transported to the NW without Nazarick. The main story hasn't ended yet, but with the amount of volumes left, we are probably going to get a open ending that will leave us wanting more.
The LN hasn’t ended, we’ve still got two novels to go. The Vampire Princess of the Lost Country is a side story of what if Ainz left Nazarick just before the server shutdown, and came to the New World in a different time and place.
Light novel is not over yet. Still two more volumes left.
Nothing really, you can read it as a standalone issue. It's just Ainz meeting Landfall
there are many on youtube if you dont mind artificial voices
Would he really cool if Ainz did the G-Man resurrection, where he comes back a hundred? years later then see and solve anything if possible
Main difference is Ainz can get off his bony ass and do whatever he wants. Big E has to stay on his divine toilet seat or Terra gets dragged into the Immaterium.
Now that you bring up Warhammer... as someone who knows the existence of space travel and an infinitely expansive universe, might not Ainz want to explore the possibility of colonizing and expanding the reach of his empire beyond the stars, if not for the sake of reaching his friends but to satiate the ambitions of Nazarick? It would also be logical to assume that if thereis life on other planets, it is possible that players could be summoned to that planet, although I dont have a good understanding of the>!wild magic that caused Yggdrasil players to be summoned to the new world.!<
The god emperor of mankind is taking a nap because he saw the true unbeatable horrors that awaited him in the warp.  (Gork and mork) They're the strongest

Well don't just tease like that! let's read it!
How dare you assume that i assumed the great ainz would be bothered by speculation. The skelly lord has an interest in treachery. You spoke ill of the almighty and now albedo is gonna do horrible things to you  (i guess thats a win for you)
Story-wise Ainz always has a world item on him. Wild magic and world items don't work on him or Nazarick. His \[Gate\] has 100% success rate of teleportation so you can't seal him off like that. You would need a Deus ex machina to seal him off.
Vampire princess is a one off short story l, the series hasn't ended were eating on 2 more books from maryuama.

I'll leave the writing to him, but given the contrast of the vampire princess alternate timeline I'm guessing he goes for a less than happy ending.
>Forever in paying for the evil he committed

You're \*really\* lost if you think that's the angle the story is taking.
I’d love to see the NPCs finally find out that they are video game characters and their gods were humans, who only made them so twisted because they needed an outlet for their own pain.
No, ainz hasn't open up at all, he is just more relaxed around them he is getting comfortable, but he hasn't open up with them at all.
The closest he has been is with Pandora's actor, he actually talks with him a bit more open than anyone else but saying he had opened with someone in nazarick yet is a stretch.
But with time I'm sure he have at least one person in nazarick, my bet goes to PA or maybe even tsuare, but will have someone in sure if it.
I know I am late for this but no it won't fit the story at all the show doesn't have to be melancholy at all infect if you read the end notes of Maruama at the first volume the whole reason he made overlord was because he was sick of the other stories such as you describe, where heroes have to be good for karma where they offer to help and risk their life for a poor sole without expecting payment.

 Plus shows that end of such make no sense and feel forced take death note for example the majority of people who watched it still say the first 17 episodes where the most entertaining whilst the rest was just forced for the good ending of this story

I also think the way you find Ainz's  action to be cruel insanely hypocritical and extremely narrow, humans are responsible for the most extinction on this planet we separate and kill baby/kid cows for their tender and juicy meat, we bread and geneticaly design chickens for the sole process of devouring them, there is roughly about 100 to 200 billion chickens slaughtered world wide that excluding the unborn babies everyone makes their favourite breakfast with including renoun deserts such as cakes and ice creams. 

Can you imagine other species doing that wether it be aliens mystical creatures desighning mouth watering (to them) recipes  of how to cook a kid, a baby an unborn baby, prioritizing the body parts and such, we will be calling them demons and race to be exterminated without exception. 

In parts of japan intelligent life forms like whales are being hunted to make delicacies other intelligent creature including our fellow primates like Orangutans whichs  we share a DNA similarlity of 98% with, and other  primates are being hunted to near extinction, just imagine if a more powerful an intelligent creature hunted us like so, we will refer to them as the greatest evil and a surge on the earth. 

Even animals that can potentially hunt us or hunt us are looked and treated with even mote animosity a bear, tiger would be tracked, targeted and euthernize for doing what a human can do to countless chickens a day. 

You get it Ainz ain't human as he is now they are powerful grotesque which with their prowess don't and can't see humans as equals a True vampire, a High demon, a Dragon nor an Insectoid clearing out a kingdom of humans for their benefits is like a human smoking out a bee hive for their honey or a human kinging out a bothersome ant hive from their backyard, or eradicating a nest of hornets near their vicinity. 

You'll find that equally powefull beings such as dragon lords are the same take Cure Elim sacrificing millions of humans and possibly 100s of millions of species for his experiment and to benefit his strength by becoming an undead himself  even the Platinum dragon views building nations and causing wars as meir experiments them taking the life of a human insn't even considered murder in their eyes it's like me preping a thanks giving turkey. 

Plus these politicians you see today don't even care going above Ainz's mental capacities and causing a mass genocide to other fellow human with equal human rights over stupid reasons, even though some might be understandable just take H*tler as an example the guy massacred nearly the same number of people as Ainz's army just cause of hes racist beliefs, unlike Ainz he wasn't trying to solidify his power as a nation thus solidifying his nations protection. 

Ainz barely used a percentage of nazarrick's forces to finish the deed with the kingdom whilst he exhausted his nations wealth and manpower killing people who went even an enemy, even now we seeing wars that people are trying to justify as just, Russia, middle East, China also with Hong kong and it's plans for annexing Taiwan and a large number of people mostly natives call these people just not thinking of the millions who are going to loose their life ove it. 

There's a reason why no nation made a stand of the Sorcerer kingdom decision to attack the Re-estize kingdom, they could see that their corruption was far from just. 

Plus ainz is the is one of the few rulers who want to build a kingdom where every sentient life form has equal rights to each other  and core exist, whilst the slane theocracy want's the complete opposite you see you don't even have to look far to my ealier points to get an answer from my ealier points. 

You need t o also consider that the slane theocracy started a never ending war as old as Zesshi 100+ cause one of their personal got mol*st*d by the pig of an Elf king. 

I understand that the r*** thing is horrible but starting a 100+ year war and an international slave trade to all elves with most victims being children cause of the morality of their king when using kids in war, over a black scripture member who has killed tens of thousands if not 100 000s of people throughout her life,like why didn't they plan a grand assassination of the pig of a king, they had enough forces and material to resist and even tame a level 100 player. 

but they had to envolve innocent civilians who either died or how we saw in season 3 were used as fodder or mules for the monsters, a cruel tactic which was almost implemented by the King of the East on the Angu goblin tribe which though they had brains traditions and tactic were fated to be used as emergency rations

The goal of the theocracy  was to destroy races such as goblins, lizard men, elves, even dwarves were hanging on a thread towards their desrimination, and many more races that even though showing sentience and intelligence to uphold traditions and pass knowledge down families and generations and also have the intelligence to out a floor gaurdian in battle tactics, farm fish, use magic weapons, learn writing and even communicate using the human language which is why they made guilds throughtout other nations as well. 

With all these factors and candidates I see no Ainz as evil,He is just doing what humans are doing now, with atomic bombs and bio weapons stretched to the most. Our weapons are quite similar from the world items and his position now, If it's true that the corona-virus was ment to be a bio weapon you have proof of a world wide weapon there
I take back what I said, your idea is better
This would be a interesting read
Didn’t someone said that Maruyama sold the rights for someone else to write the story after his last book?
where would i go about reading this?
The wild magic used the the Emperor Dragon I think was to call upon ancient relics or powerful weapon– however said weapon are the World Class Items we know and also the chair Ainz used is lowkey functions like the Golden Throne from 40k. Its also World Class Item named the Thrones of Kings from the Prequel Part 2.

Although i wished that he does Necron style where they sleep for thousands of years (not 65 million years 😭😭🙏) or the entire nazarick in sleep mode.
Thanks also happy cake day
Thanks also happy cake day
...now I'm depressed after reading that 😭
I clicked out of the this page to see other fan stories and just the tags made me regret my decision immediately. People are degenerates.
Wow, I love that story
Ah, right! I completely forgot to actually link it. 

Here you go: https://archiveofourown.org/works/43463979
How dare you assume, that i assume, that you assumed. The Grateist of the supreme beings Ainz. Would cast his mighty gaze onto the whispers of a lowly mortal, whos life is just a blink in his eye.

You have offended him and will now be send to The happy Frame.

Also, how dare you assume that i am, at the level to be punished by a floor guardians.
I more ment thematically. Like it would be fitting ending for the characters. Someone who starts the story, sad that he is alone and had spent his life playing a game. Now trapped, alone in another world. 

Also, you could just flat out. say something like the world item can't take you to another dimension. So, it would just take you do where you want to go in the void.
You can read it, it's called the Vampire Princess of the Lost Kingdom. Check the FAQ for this subreddit, should be there.
Check the subreddit FAQ for the link to the Google Drive. Fan translated LN's, Bonus Material, and the Side Story are there.
I thought that the chairs main functions were involved with centralized defenses for the base? Ik its a world class item but I think it just has a lot of insane defensive capabilities.
That was lovely! I wish it went into a bit more detail, but it was nice to read as a one-shot! Thank you.
Who is the bug humanoid creature?
Lowley mortal. Sir i will have you know i am on par with lord ainz as i own a home and have trained subordinates (huntsman spiders) to defend the floors of said home. Not to mention i have a beer fetching servant who also wont eat their tea and refuses to go to bed on time.
I think you're assuming Lord Ainz is some kind of cheese because you referring to him as "grate" 🤔. Is your inner Albedo betraying you?
He isn't trapped. He has the capability to make friends. In light novel, he gave up on his friends and now cherishes their relic, the NPCs. In the side story, he created a new guild and lived happily for hundreds of years. So when he is alone, he doesn't just say "Let me seal myself for eternity because idk melancholy?"
Ah ok cool
w blood kite
Glad you liked it. I’ve purposefully kept it short, but definitely there’s space for more detail in there.
I left it ambiguous on purpose but there’s a very heavy implication / foreshadowing within the story itself.
"....yeah, I have a cat, and, um...."


*Nervously fidgets around*
I'm not saying he is trapped. I'm saying it would be a good ending story wise if he was.

i haven't read the side stories.

I more ment he get sealed by someone else.
I feel like the the floor guardians at least would have been able to recognize >!one of the supreme beings. !<
Excluding wild magic and world items, there is nothing in the world nor Yggdrasil powerful enough to seal Ainz. He is a player, he is designed to be always active and in the world.

It doesn't matter if it's good ending or not. If it doesn't make sense, it's shitty ending.
So, you have never been AFK in a game before (Joke)

Also, we don't really know that.

And most of all it was just an idea i had.
dont worry lad , this guy is one of those people that aren't fun at parties .

That one panel at the very end when Inosuke showed that he really cares for Tanjirou. Honestly for the whole series I never felt much sympathy for him, but in this moment right here my opinion of him changed a lot.

Ps. Also for some reason text jumps at the end of the screenshot and I don't know how to change that. Sorry
This one right here gives me chills every time

A perfect example of show, don't tell. Kokushibo may have held deep resentment towards his brother, but over the thousands of years he lived, he still held onto some love for him. This panel always gets me man.

This is by far my favorite moment in the manga. The moment Muzan dies twice is the moment you know that it’s truly over and it is so satisfying.

This one. All of her close relatives and disciples died because of demons. And she must work with a demon to kill a demon. Her life is sad. But it is a good end that the upper moon 2 died because of her joint efforts with Kanao and Inosuke.
I don't want to bother finding it but the one where some random demon slayer tells yushiro that it's okay if yushiro eats him if it would help defeat nakime.

*(I am fucked)*
My favorite panel is the final panel showing the upper rank siblings as they die together with him telling her sister to go to heaven but instead she yells and cries that she’d rather be with her brother
And so he takes her on his back and that panel shows them walking together to the pits of hell.
That chapter showing their backstory makes me tear up EVERYTIME I read it since I also have have 3 younger siblings and I just understand their love for each other. 
I love that he wanted her to go to heaven since even with all their murders, technically he was the one that allowed his sister to kill so much, so she had a chance at salvation 
But I also love how they chose to be together even if it mean suffering forever
I really need to find that label
I love how they make the spirit world and the living world so close where dead family members is actually talking to them and is just not the regular hallucination

It's not super flashy or mechanically interesting, but the small details of this smile mean so much and have always stuck with me. It holds so much pain, so much happiness, so much raw emotion in one simple smile and two words.

Shinobu ate
I think it's all about Shinobu wearing her haori but not her butterfly haori because Kanae is survive wearing her bitterfly haori such as Flower Hashira herselves then she showed me that her sister had died then Shinobu had to wear it on her revenge for her sister & then also Giyuu & Shinobu in the snow which i remember where my sister showed me from the Story of Water & Fires about Giyuu & Rengoku & then the cutie emoji of Tanjiro's kinda are my favorite panesl too.

My favorite manga panel of all time
I dislike that this canonically isn't his grandpa. Demon Slayer seems like the king of unnecessary details that detract from its story. Making them unrelated just makes no sense. It's the same deal as the breathing style abilities being "metaphors." Dog, it's a fantasy series. Just make it magic. I frankly find it harder to believe that humans manage to kill demons without magic than humans having magic. The shit they pull through sheer "swordsmanship" makes no sense.

Let me just put this here
… what the heck that’s deep
This made me laugh lol
no plis now i Remember that he Is died too
This one always makes me tear up because everyone was doing everything they could to beat Muzan even if it meant being a meat shield to buy the ones who could actually hurt him even a little bit more time. I love it.
I’m not ready for this to be animated I fear.
Damn it someone's cutting onions in here
Obanai carried
This one was so heart wrenching. They all knew how they could help, and so they did.
The regular demon slayers taking the blows intended for the Hashira is simultaneously gut wrenching and epic. They laid down their lives for their superiors and were not afraid to take on Muzan to save them is one of the corps finest hours.
I forgot, what happened here
Is these parts animated yet? The last I watched was with the Fire headed demon slayer >!when he died!< maybe like Mugan Train Arc or something? 

Not a huge manga person. Animation was amazing. Was wondering about how long until the anime catches up / ends or this a long-standing one like Naruto or something?

Edit: never mind. I see a few comments below stating it.
I need an actual poster of that panel
Ima crying form this it’s so sad
Also so sad she can't hug him and he can't see her anymore here (spoilers?? This whole thread is all spoilers though)
The fact that they are still kids always gets me… oh the tears
Must bring tissues & eye drops when watching infinity castle on cinema 🥲
I loved the fact that, that’s what actually ended up happening
That hits hard every time i read it, i can't imagine how much i'm going to cry when it gets animated
this page hurt me so much, it will live with me forever ❤️‍🩹
Headcanon, that's the moment they both died, he died holding her and she died looking at him
Depression is back🩷💚

Coldest panel 🔥🔥
“You’ve done enough.” 

That one absolutely destroyed me. I’ve never cried at a manga until Akaza’s backstory, because that hit so close to home.

It’s probably not that deep to most people, just a touching emotional moment. But I can actually relate to Akaza a bit. I often wish to be a better person, and constantly try to make it up to everyone for all my bad behaviour while dealing with severe mental illness. It absolutely broke my heart to read that. To see someone willing to destroy themselves as many times as necessary because they know they’ll never be able to apologize for what you’ve done.
Jesus Christ this

I was crying so much reading his back story and climax of it
Hakuji-san ... the purest lover !!
And muzan screaming at Akaza to stop remembering and keep fighting, that whole sequence and his back story made me crying on floor like never before
This is a manga discussion anyways
I NEED this exact line in the anime
Zenitsu needs to call Kaigaku a Lower Moon explicitly lmao
kinda crazy to think that when we're introduced to Yoriichi through visions and stuff we think he's this stoic, stone-coldn emotionless badass killer but then it turns out he was just depressed as hell from how his life turned out, as a kid he was always smiling 😭
W
This one always breaks me
He just wanted to live in a hut with his wife but ofc Muzan gotta fuck that angle up for him too 😭
Was this panel animated or we Will see it later cause it's been too long since i read the manga
His entire life was tragic, its easy to see wat he is thinking, he could have held his own child like this, could have had a happy family and lived peacefully but all that was taken from him.
This one, this one panel, just shatters me every single time i see it
Came here to say this
Also, the fact that she was one of four people who chose to >!go to hell to be with their loved one!< was really sweet.
Their fucking faces tho lol

Omg when Nezuko's smiley face reminded him of his brother Genya. My heart crumpled
THIS IS WHY SANEMI IS BEST HASHIRA THE ANIME-ONLYS WILL UNDERSTAND SOON ENOUGH 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
omfg, I forgot everything in the manga but this 😭 😭 😭 it's so sad
That boy tanjiro face just screaming “IMA MURDER THIS MF”
That's going to fucking destroy me when it gets animated.
This and the look he gives Nezuko when she reminds him of Genya at the very end of the story 😭
Jesus I was crying when I read this the first time too
You gave me shivers. It's just one panel but I already feel devastated
That there broke my heart. They both got to say to and hear from the other how much they both loved each other, but seeing a hardass like Sanemi drop his guard completely like that and cry and beg for God to save his little brother, it was heartwrenching.
This is my favorite as well. I sobbed like a baby reading this, and I'm a big dude. I can't wait for everyone's reactions to this, but I'm terrified at the same time.
Me too
The wombo combo with Muichiro right before I can't not get teary eyed on rereads.
Oh boy, same T-T
Read this last week, gonna fucking lose it when this gets animated (as Burningshadow said, lol)🥲
![gif](giphy|rvxMJNyHAgwlW4YWpJ|downsized)

This is the one🥲
I'm not ready for this to be animated
The fact he wears jigoro's haori ;A;
W-wait a minute
Kenjaku:

Mouth Breathing: First form-brain saliva
People are going to be so shocked when this gets animated 🤣
Is this real?
Really wish we got to see more of her 😭, she could've easily been in the red list district arc bc tengen was looking for women to go undercover in the first place
Absolutely one of the coldest panels I laughed so hard I love her 😂😭😭
I was like man Ueshama gonna be voicing her. So yeah, a sadistic voice is something I am looking forward to.

PS. Whatever happens before this fight absolutely has destroyed me from my inner core.
downloaded :)
The impact from Gyomei is unmatched, he was the key in defeated Kokushibo:

1. Broke his sword and cut his hair so that Genya can devour it and get a broken bda.

2. Protect Sanemi like 90% of the time so that the latter doesn't lose his hands.

3. Constantly irritating Kokushibo, both mentally and physically(good luck adapting to that kind of weapon).

I know that all four of them played their part and if you take any of them out - they would lose, but HIMejima was the core part of their teamwork that held it all together.
I can't unsee the nose as a mouth.
This is probably the only time he spelled his name right
Love his relationship with Tandingo
This is one of my fav too
Also love how it shows the reader how on the mark Gyomei was with Koku just gunning for the kill right after.

You’ll never be him Kokushibo
this panel gives off todo vibes. especially his entrance into shibuya
Had Kokushibo tweaking in one sentence 
He was about to turn his life around! But then ugh...
Muzan's grip seems rough and demanding, trying to push him down, but the hashiras' seem reassuring and warm, trying to get him up. I forgot just how much i loved this story
The dead ones pushing Tanjiro up as the alive ones pull him up..both are trying her hardest to help him out..I love it
I cried so hard during this panel
Loved the one a bit before it with the Pillars pushing on Tanjiro’s back.
I love this one so much
PEAK
This is going to go so unbelievably hard when it's animated I'm going to cry bro
Objectively the correct answer
I refuse to die before I see this animated
I almost forgot this one. Definitely my top 3
![gif](giphy|mqiq8aY84dnqAtVlnd)
Kaigaku received a huge power boost as an upper rank and still got blitzed by his very much mortal human junior without manifesting the mark. Zenitsu need no red blade or ST or TW.
i remember this as clear as day somehow
I'm gonna cry so damn much when this is animated 🍡
Honestly, every drawing of Chachamaru is amazing

Can’t forget Akaza’s reaction lmao
Yeah, totally agree with you and also do you remember when specifically in the hashira training arc, mostly in the opening when Kanao was shown to be training and etc. Bro, not only did Kanao not only get just one scene with Shinobu in that arc but she didn't even get a single anime-original content during the time Hashira Training arc was airing. 
Ufotable did Kanao so dirty and just clowned on us for that. 
The fact that Kanao was just shafted until the final arc, just gets to fight against Douma (Her parallels with him were cool but felt a bit shallow for me) and save Tanjiro and that's all it for her.  I'm so convinced that I feel Kanao was never part of the story and she was a wasted character. 

What I mean was that I wished Kanao had a bit of more satisfying character arc about her healing from her trauma and start on how to feel emotions so that way she could have started to understand herself properly.  

But instead we got the opposite her entire development is dependent on Tanjiro and was based on one sentence of what he said just sucks entirely.  😕

It feels like Kanao was just written to be the love interest and that's all.
the amount of times he "died" in that arc is crazy
Flair checks out
Shinobu is so beautiful 😭
I agree with your flair and your panel pick
I’d fold
Every single Shinobu panel in gaiden is 10/10
And then he proceeds to scream before slashing him iirc hahaha
But going from the anime to the manga, my favorite things was all the arts the author did as chapter starts or just sides for the main story. This one in particular is a favorite cause demon slayer Nezuko, but I enjoyed a lot of them.
That was Gato 💓
shit made me laugh so hard
Dog tax?! We need to see Nezuko!!
he's so sweet, isn't he?
the follow up had be rollin

Actual linguist here: Because the online ones are done by translators who don’t work for the publishing company, and a lot of the time language is fluid and doesn’t have an exact word-to-word equivalent when you’re trying to move the meaning of concepts from one language to the next. So the more emotional and poetic concepts become, the less likely it is that you’ll get two different people to translate a sentence in the same way.
Colour scans tend to be unofficial.
What does he say?
the jjk spoilers in a kny sub is crazy
Ah. Gojo 2.5.

(So apparently in Chinese one character in his name was 五(five), so someone came up with the term Gojo 2.5 because 5 in half is 2.5 and Gojo was halved.)
Wrong manga but thanks for making laugh 🤣
wrong sub bro

Wrong manga
The bravery of the regular demon slayers was insane! Even knowing that they stood zero chance of doing anything to Muzan, they all courageously chose to literally stand and die between him and the hashira, all for the few precious seconds of protection that bought them. Those dudes got dawgs in em.
>!I love that The hashira training arc in the anime built up on their sacrifice!<
You have at least 3 years to prepare
no cuz seriously he did so well. him and mitsuri just make me so damn emotional tho
Fax🥲🩷💚
Coloured version coming soon (in a few years)😭
I thought all the Hashira were significantly older except for Muichiro
I can’t wait for this panel to be animated (in the chaos of Infinity Castle).
Yeah it is, definitely also one of my favorite panels in the manga too, Tanjiro was definitely a menace during his fight against Muzan. ☠👍
Don’t, when that gets animated I’m gonna die 😭 reading it in the manga felt so painful
Yeah but you’ll always get those one or two anime only who’ll still stray into a manga discussion so the warning is there just in case
Iknr! This and Kanao insulting Upper moons😂
They better not change the dialogues any further
Can't wait to hear that in anime.
I mean he didn't smile or speak until he was seven, but I get what you mean. The small glimpses we see of him make him out to be this terrifying and serious figure. The memory of him with Sumiyoshi helps put into perspective who he actually was. Then of course his story with Kokushibo and the memory Tanjiro has just displays everything about him 😔. He may not show emotions on his face often, but he feels deeply.
He doesn't let anyone live in peace 😔 At the very least, Uta and him were reincarnated and got a happy family.
It's in volume twenty-one, which hasn't been animated yet. It'll be animated after the three movies (most likely).
Who were the other 3 people? Rui's parents?
Yeah I'll say from watching the anime to finishing up in the manga I genuinely enjoy ufotable's facial renditions better. Some moments in the manga kinda throw me off a bit with the derby faces during serious moments 😅
Sanemi is a softie inside ... he just acts harsh and hides his true emotions, to act Strong. In a way he is almost like Giyu in terms of hiding emotions and act cold. Both lost a part of them in the past.
Frfr. My boy gets so much hate, he's literally my favourite.
It was indeed ... such a wholesome moment. A long time till we see this one getting animated !
Oh i know it will, after that battle my view on sanemi just did a 180
Totally, same as >!Akaza's death and backstory!< I can't wait for it but at the same time i'm sure i'll be destroyed when watching it
I forgot about it! I almost cry when i read it cuz the shinazugawa brothers are my favorite characters
that head pat is going to kill me
They both make me cry
Kimetsu No Kaisen
Yes
I think we were told why she wasn't picked to go because Tengen didn't dare ask Shinobu for her Tsuguko
True, I totally agree with you, I really wished we got to see more of Kanao, she was shown in the beginning of the story and had some small  moments of her development about her breaking out of her shell and only to get shafted so hard until the end.   

This is going to sound very controversial but I think Kanao had some potential as a character but it feels like she was just written to be Tanjiro's love interest, and no I don't hate Kanao either. 😕

I think she is a good character but I just wished she was used more properly in the story and I was upset that most of her character development was offscreen after conversation with Tanjiro.  She's a cool character but I will still be disappointed that I find her to be wasted potential to this day. 

Anyways though can't wait for Douma vs Kanao to be animated soon and I got admit Kanao roasting Douma had to be one of my favorite moments in Infinity Castle Arc! 😆
same
Nicely elaborated.
Hehe Gyomei Impact
>defeated Kokushibo:

kokushibo killed himself
I stared too long at that tbh. I was like how silly for such a moment, then i saw the nose
Who’s that? Do you mean Tendango?
It's Monjiro!
I've been waiting for locked in Zenitsu since the beginning of this series..it's gonna be so good
very smally
That boy was scared 😂
Absolutely. I know most characters besides Tanjiro are underdeveloped, but holy shit... why would you give zero backstory and character development to the person who takes down Upper Moon 2? 

When I read the infinity castle arc I couldn't even remember who Kanao was, given how non-existent she was throughout the story. I was more familiar with Murtara than her!

Requested pup tax!
I noticed that the most when I read the ending. I read two they basically meant the same thing but the way one was worded, I was like "umm...what." then the other translation just seemed more modern and smooth abd i was like"okay i get now"
Ah I see, appreciate the explanation
Even funnier is the Go in his name means 5 so it’s not Gojo 2.5 but rather 2.5jo (ye I don’t really know what I’m saying)
I didn't notice it the demon slayer page till after I posted the comment, lol
Oops my bad I thought it was any manga panel not just demon slayer
Reminds me of Attack On Titan when the scouts rush beast Titan head on.
But it was a boring useless arc!!! /S
read the manga and this is my initial thought. ufotable put that fillers just to hurt the viewers on the sunrise countdown arc. i won't be surprised if they put some flashback from hashira training arc while muzan slices them all.
There's characters that stood out among the same-faced generic slayers. I totally can't wait to watch them either die when muzan wakes, or die defending the hashira ;A;
Obanai was already partially blind but at this point he had zero sight and still was fighting. impressive
There should be one
Most of them are 18-21… arguably just kids. Muichiro and the quartet are 14-16 I think. Goes to show how op they are versus demons who are decades or centuries old. Also makes sense why Muzan is so disappointed in his moons lol
Hm true I guess 



But that's on them tho
I mean Kanao doing anything… such a gentle face and then she destroys people with her words
O really? I must’ve missed that in the extra chapter
Oh nice thank you this is one the most beautiful moments in the manga and i want to see it get animated so bad
Rui’s parents and Sanemi when he was on death’s door, he was willing to carry his mom to hell, but he ended up coming back.
Rui's parents and Akaza's girlfriend.
nemi and obanai got a bad rep for going against the Mcs since lots of fans don't like it. yes they were mean but what do you expect, they slay demons and weren't taking any chances. yes its unfair to tanjiro and nezuko but lives were at risk
They had him dead to rights and certainly would have gotten him with a few more moves. He seemed to be at the end of his rope.
How did he kill himself as he was fading remember he is trying to get himself to use a blood demon art but he can't and starts to cry to his brother of why he was born and how much he hates him
I think he's talking about Konpachiro. Could be wrong tho
Fr, Tanjiro was just built different 😂😂☠ Akaza being scared imao
So true and tbh I really want your honest thoughts abou some character that were wasted potential. 

I think Tanjiro was handled pretty well and I have no problem with him besides the fact that he's one of favorite characters in the series but tbh the fact he has Kanao as his love interest when they've barely interact and to make things worse their relationship is so underdeveloped. 

And I also think that Tanjiro falling in love with Kanao felt so out of character for him and it just didn't sit right with me, to me it feels like Tanjiro really would have been better off without a love interest or ended up with Aoi. 

Funny how Aoi has more anime-original content than Kanao. And also if you don't know who Aoi is, she is the girl who is a nurse in the Butterfly Mansion.
Omg what an adorable Nezuko. Please give her extra kisses and treats for me! Thank you ❤️
I guessed so but no worries, what is your actual favourite panel?
It’s okay I won’t downvote you
Shinzou Wo Sasageyo
Na. That was pure manipulation by the best manipulator in the series in my opinion.

He'll lie to you, and stand in front of you to convince you.

If the person who told me not to fear a threat is telling me to advance and dedicate myself at the point of his arm being munched on by said threat, I'd want to throw my life away too.

These demon slayer corps all just remembered what Tanjiro and everyone said. To me, they were even more encouraging than the Hashira themselves in the last minutes.
yup, everyone who thinks that r such clowns
exactly, man took it like a champ
I hear the “arguably” part! They are insanely OP. I’m only 27 still so only the youngest of the Hashira feel like children to me. Maybe why Gyomei is my personal favorite too
In the list of reincarnations/descendants one of them is just labeled "Happy family." The man's face isn't showing, but his hair is clearly Yoriichi's and the woman looks just like Uta. I guess it's not confirmed if they're reincarnations, but considering the tsugikuni bloodline died out, I think they'd have to be.
Of course! I love this moment so much and have been waiting expectantly. I know it'll hit like a truck all over again whenever it does get animated.
yeah i never really got the instant the. i was def annoyed that sanemi was going straight to stabbing nezuko so quickly but it ended up helping her case anyways lol. i couldn’t be too mad cuz like even then i figured nobody got involved in the demon slayer corps without a sad ass backstory and understandable hatred for demons.
The dude was starting to recover and was about to become immune to decapitation. What ended it is seeing how awful he became and that made him lose the will to live and thus started crumbling.
You just answered yourself. He's trying to use his bda and regenerate but starts crying due to the memories and gives up, stops regenerating on purpose and dies.
To be honest, love interests don't really make sense since we know so little of the female characters except Nezuko, Kanroji, and Shinobu. Of the characters that have some depth, I felt that Inozuke, Tanjiro, Giyuu, Tengen, Shinobu, Nezuko, are pretty good. Zenitsu and Kanroji are so-so. Gyomei, Obanai, Muichiro, Rengoku, Zenitsu, and Kanao are trash.

  
It doesn't even have to do with screen time - some of the trash ones simply don't see action until the end (e.g. Kanao) while others do have some screen time but are just stupid caricatures with cardboard personalities (Gyomei cries, Muichiro is airheaded, Zenitsu is scared and a pervert, etc.). They just don't have personalities and real interactions with the rest of the cast. A sad backstory and that's it.
Thx and heres My favorite demon slayer panel

https://preview.redd.it/17kwjn5kolcd1.jpeg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23cec60b15d8371b826996da50291952b4eeaecf
Erwin literally led the charge....but go off I guess...
It was a boring arc. But not useless.
Haha fair enough! Just turned 30 so I even look at Gyomei like a kid brother haha. But it also makes me feel they all missed out on living their lives like normal teens. Like Mitsuri and Iguro should have been highschool sweethearts and yet …. 😭
There is so much emotion in this panel with 0 words in it just the laugh of a cute and innocent soul, yoriichis face and the tears running down showing us how much emotion and sadness this stoic and serious person hides behind his cold face. People say demon slayer has a mid story but i believe there is a lot of emotion in certain moments
I was never mad at them in the first place. being mc doesn't grant yoy special treatment, esp when you break corps rules. nezuko was a proven danger in til season 2, and tanjiro willingly carried a demon
I gotcha I always interpreted it as he was realizing it was over not like akaza that kills himself but kinda like he was putting it all together that everything he ever did was always going to be for nothing cause he was selfish
Do you know you said this 8 times?
I totally agree with you and about your take Nezuko having "good writing" is just wrong I feel like as of now she used as a plot device for Tanjiro's character. I'm really somewhat starting to be convinced that ds is kinda mysgonistic. How come Shinobu and Tamayo can only be the only well-written female characters but the rest are treated poorly and used for fanservice. 🤨
You can't say bad things about an anime on said anime sub, because at that point your opinion is automatically wrong and it doesn't matter. I swear most people just downvote whenever they see someone already getting some.

The season was boring as fuck, as he said it wasn't useless because you know why slayer corp npcs sacrifice themselves but that doesn't take away the fact that 7 out of 8 episodes were absolute nothingness
Exactly. The characters are where it really shines. It's the first show where I don't dislike any characters. In such a short time, their stories can really leave a lasting impact and resonate with you. Demon Slayer wears its heart on its sleeve and I love it for that.
yeah, i wasn’t trying to say i was mad. more like frustrated that Sanemi specifically wasnt willing to even listen
Oh damn 😭 I was pressing post and it just kept saying empty response from endpoint so I clicked a few times and just gave up. Now it somehow just sent the messages so many times lmao. My bad bro, I'll delete these shi
More like a calm before the storm.
Thats YOUR opinion dawg. You cant expect everyone to feel the same way. And there's no way 7 out of 8 eps were absolute nothingness lmaoo u can find it boring if u want but shit was definitely happening.
For real i liked rengoku so much and he had a screen time of one hour hid death made me cry like a baby and to this day it makes me sad. There are so many stories from many characters and each one has depth and emotion to it for people to connect with, damn i loved akazas backstory and it was so sad and beautiful. And the anime just has so beautiful and strong massages it helped me go through a really hard period of my life and i will never forget this anime
Why should he? His own mother attacked him and ate her kids. there was literally no reason to other than plot if we're being logical. those with your opinion are completely missing the point, way too focused on mcs wants instead of looking at the situation clearly. They know family members turned demon will attack you- hence the strict rules. Theyre trying to prevent more tragedies from happening. idc for shinobu that much but ahe was right to carry her mission out and tomioka I like him, he was wrong to not go through with it
Doesn't take away the fact that it was boring as fuck
Like what?
Couldn't agree more. The music adds a whole other level to the emotions in my opinion. Obviously the animation is gorgeous, but those songs man. Even upon re-watch/read the moments, big and small, still hit me. I'm grateful something as heartfelt as this show can exist and reach so many people.
Not your cup of tea then. Can't expect constant action all the time.
giyu and gyomei backstories, mui character development, shinazugawa brothers and obamitsu relationships establishment, nakime um4 reveal and her eyes infiltrating the corps, nugu slayers getting screentime and motivated, tanjiro learning repetitive motions in order to activate and maintain his mark permanently, zenitsu getting serious, shinobu and tamayo plan setup and then the entirety of ep 8.
Truly the soundtracks just give me chills they are so calm and beautiful they fit every situation perfectly they can tell the story without much talking. It's kinda sad that the end of it is near bur every journey has its end
What happened to these two?
The first time I watched this scene, I felt sad for them. But the second time, I laughed 😂

Arche was setup, yes. Still, it seems her guild chose these types of jobs, so she deserved her fate. 
Sold as slaves and worked to death.
In the anime? Can’t say. In other version: either sold into sex slavery or given a peaceful life.
Sold as slaves to the same industry as Tsuare and both end up dead from overwork 

Confirmed by the author
Either, bad, real bad, or implied bad, real bad.

No happy ending for them in any variants of the story.
Got turned into sex slaves i believe
Man, I'm not a soft guy or anything like that but the whole Arche and her family plotline affected me. I wasn't sad but the grim ending to their story left a very sour taste in my mouth had to stop watching the show for a few days.
They got sold off and turned into sex slaves, they died hating Arche thinking she abandoned them.
Sold as sex slaves by their parents and were “overworked” to death
Turned into sex slaves.
Lamp
![gif](giphy|657SBisGVmBXPdiIma|downsized)
Arche is pretty stupid by not running away with her sisters and just letting her shit parents deal with their personal debt themselves. It's her fault they were sold as slave that died from overwork (knowing how nobles are...) she deserves the death she got, and I wish it was worse, though.
This episode made me quit the show for a month or so. I had the same question as the op, so I went to the comments. There was one random comment with about 20 likes, and it was three paragraphs long. It told a super unsettling and detailed story, supposedly by the author, about how they were sold, abused, and died. After reading that, I felt the show was too dark for no reason and decided to drop it. Later, I realized the comment was probably fake and made by an edge-lord. I finished Overlord a while back; it was 7/10. I would still recommend it.
I ate them, sorry
**According to the author**: Their father sold them into slavery to pay off his debt, but they died shortly later due to exhaustion.
&nbsp;

What type of work young pretty noble girls were doing? I will leave that upto you to decide, but clearly they weren't building house or plowing fields.
>Anime, Manga, Light Novel: >!Sold as slaves and worked to death.!<

>Web Novel: >!Arche was kept alive as Shaltear's sex slave and her sisters were sold to a cult where they were used as sacrifice for Ainz and are now living with her in Nazarick.!<

This part saddened me tbh
Here we goooo
I've seen thr comments but where does it say they became sex slaves? I have all the LN but I can't remember that happening
Nuked by great tomb defenses
Straight to the sweat shop
I had conveniently forgotten about these 2. Thanks for that.
They were sold as slaves...
![gif](giphy|OY9XK7PbFqkNO)

And not with our favorite elder lich either...
The creator said in an interview that the two were sold as sex slaves, and then they eventually died from exhaustion.
If they were lucky, they died.
If it is of any consolation, they likely reunited with their sister in the afterlife.
chapter 6 : SlaVeRy
The author decided to grant them the same fate as her sister but using the Tsuare route
![gif](giphy|jIsgja3R661b2)

Slave “work”
we don't talk about this.
https://preview.redd.it/68cxjpeqmu7d1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=863a8523b8e0c0d20c3577e07172c3cb5a097258
They were sold of as slaves and sent to the mines where they were worked to death. I really hoped that he would have spared them like in the web novel, to live on a floor with their older sister.
at least they're dead, death is a mercy in that world
The Light Novel has a bad ending for them where they are put to "work" in a brothel because the parents now can't make meets end with Arche being gone.

In the web novel, Ainz decides to try and reward Arche for her services as he found her request for "reward"(for Shalltear to take her virginity) and decided for an alternative. So Ainz gave her the choice for her reward and Arche chose to be with her sisters. They were given a safe dwelling on the 6th floor.
Sold, died sometime later. That's about the information we actually have about them since that's what Maruyama said.

All tha about what kind of work is misinformation that I don't remember where it really came from. In the novel they aren't named, in the web novel they go under Shalltear as servants, there is nothing else aside maruyama tweet
They obviously lived happily ever after….in some pretty osha approved safe mines ✨
Sold into slavery and worked to death.

So, a happy ending by Overlord standards.
The Happy Farm.
Oh cool thats just fucking common knowledge I guess

One can hope they were sent to a Mithrill mine but knowing Tuare's original fate...

Sold by their father into sex slavery no joke made me wish that girl managed to escape nazarick tbh
I feel like this question has been asked before
I be honest 


This is the moment when I said


Wow aniz is a asshole
sold as slaves and were overworked till they died, all so their dad could buy another fancy lamp
They didn't get the bad news yet.
They were left sisterless and parent less. Ainz fucked up. The one time I would grill his dumbass for being a pice of trash.
They’re part of the reason I’ve stopped watching overlord completely. Personally just couldn’t take how dark it got at some points and the weird ass morals. And I’ve seen some pretty fucked media
Been answered already, but, here's the more in-depth explanation.

Considering the parents they're living with, their father, who as you probably know was obsessed with maintaining a lifestyle he couldn't afford for the sake of optics, sold them off as sex slaves for money. They were eventually raped and tortured to death.
I choose to be in denial and believe that somehow Arche survived, took her sisters away from the evil parents, and lived together happily. Dont bother telling me I'm wrong. i won't read your answers. PS: Glorry to Ainz!
They named themselves stuff, and people start doing stuff.
Idk
I love how the tag is not a Question but a Meme
OG web novel they are taken in by Ainz and put in a cabin with their sister. Their sister was the one suffering before hand as Shalteir's plaything. The torment included sexual and physical abuse until at one point she is "released" to live with her sisters in nazariek (don't know the spelling) for the remainder of her life.. many details are missing but that's a general synopsis.
For what I understood from the light novel and the anime is based of it, the girls died and their sister got killed painlessly by Shalltear after shown despair (Ainz ordered her to kill her in order to show mercy) their parents wanted to keep the expensive life style so got sold for slavery sadly, was hint in the light novel that they got overworked in some mines. haven't read the light novel in a while so don't know the specifics.
Bro why would you ask a question that in hindsight I didn’t want answered
They totally lived happily ever after like the family of invaders of Nazarick should
Light Novel: 😇👭🧛‍♀️
Anime/Manga: 😨☠️🤢
Hello darkness my old friend.....really you had to remind me what happened to this two poor souls.
NOTHING BAD. NOTHING BAD HAPPENED TO THESE TWO LITTLE CHILDREN.
The father on the brink wised up, became hard working and thoughtful, sold the Lamp, got to work as an advisor, payd off debts, and now the sisters are living in a small abode but are happy with their family.
You fr?- there parents are greedy goblins that like shiny things- what do you think is there fate 💀
This specific part of Overlord really screwed with me a lot. I finished the show but I don't think I'd come back if anything else gets animated. Still a good anime though
You made me consume knowledge i wasn't supposed to. 🖕 nothing personal just have to express my sadness somehow
But ainz and his friends did the same no? I wouldn't say it was deserved
Never seen again.
The best ending for them was in “Mass of death game” or that what I read on the Wiki
Died horribly working in the mines (coal, presumably)
Bro XD
They are exchanged for lamps😂
Abuse Till death. Probably
Bro XD
# Whaddya think?!?

>!I bought them 😈 !<
Sold off as slaves, overworked and eventually died. All because Archie refused to take them until she had *just a little more money*. Kinda like her parents, huh?
I got them
Best case? Death.

Worst case? You don't want to even think about it. Here, have some puppies instead:

Oh dear.
They played Minecraft without crafting.
Look, the lamp had to be paid for somehow, and really it was a pretty reasonable price in hindsight.
She's just die
They just died

They got vanilla iced out of existence
They both taking back shots
they are in my basement
For those arguing if they were working in mines or sex work, lets be realistic here, young female slaves... what do you think young female slaves usually do? They warm beds.
They became slaves as their parents sold them
Stuff, I’m almost sure of it.
What episode is this?
carbon monoxide leak
Their parents went bankrupt, so to settle the debt they sold their twin daughters to slavery. The twin works till death. They die as slave waiting for their sister whose fate is unknown to them. 

On alternate story, they were taken by Nazarick to live with Arche on 6th floor, who now works as Shalltear's sex toy.
Slavery
Still better than the “happy” farm
In WN there was ultimately more mercy and compassion afaik
Oh yeah 

They playing minecraft but real life
Mating press right there then sold
raped and killed
Reminds me of this scene in HOTD, where two best friends are running down the hall until one trips 🥴🗡️🗡️
Both likely ended up like this

I remember in the web novel that girl never dies and lives on like 9th floor with her sisters and teaches ainz about high society and stuff, in th ln and anime he went in a different direction so idk about then
In the Web Novel, Kuuderika and her sister, Ureirika were sold into slavery after Arche vanished. She and her sister were given to Ainz Ooal Gown as sacrifices to a cult of nobles that worshiped him.[5] Ainz later returned them to Arche, allowing them to live peacefully on the 6th Floor.[6]

what ep was this i dont remember?
If I may play devils advocate, Papa skeleton didn’t know the circumstances of the people who in his mind came to rob his home. He even gave them multiple chances to leave even giving them what they wanted at one point, but they just kept on coming. I’m not really condoning what he did but at the very least it’s worth remembering.

Stayed with bad parents
“On todays subject: slavery”
They got what they deserved for being related to a filthy maggot who desecrated the Great tomb of Nazarick with her filthy feet
Headcanon, they were given up to an orphanage where they were adopted by a stern, but loving older couple who loved them completely, until their passing after the girls reached adulthood and became heiresses to a small fortune and they lived happily ever after, helping other kids like them and they never forgot their loving older sister.
God what a miserable author.
Raped to death as sex slaves... yeah it's about as edgy as it can possibly get... overlord has its moments but sometimes it feels like it was written by a depressed 14 year old who's just trynna write the most shocking and vile shit they can think of lmao
got raped to death
Isekai'd into our world and became the Olsen Twins.
As someone who watched the first couple of episodes years ago and got recommended this sub just now... what the actual fuck is this series? Seems like every other day I hear some fucked up thing that happens in this series, and it's just, "Well, that's Overlord!" from the fans. Like, seriously, it must get boring, right? Murder this week, genocide next week, sex slavery the week after that? Is it just cathartic to watch terrible people do terrible shit, or is there something I'm missing?
lived happily in nazarith with her sister which led a VERY HAPPY LIFE WITHOUT ANY WORRIES with shalltear.
![gif](giphy|OPU6wzx8JrHna)
Yeah, "work"
Its worse when you think about the kind of "work" they were used for..
I know that’s the case in the original web novel, but I’m unsure if it’s still their fate in the LN/anime.
It was their parents that sold them so they could appear to still be wealthy and living lavishly if I remember correctly. Haven’t read the LN in a few years so I could be wrong. Can anyone confirm so I don’t have to reread? Lol
https://i.redd.it/nm8o03gtzt7d1.gif
I’m sorry what the fuck
I swear to God I'm going to kill that vampire again for making those two go to slavery and die!!!

![gif](giphy|bVjLUMAFD5LZr1iRMc)
So they became like Ainz was irl
Depending on version,

Bought by Nazarak and put into the colony with their sister.
Or solved into slavery and worked to death in some mine.
In LN in manga I think they reunited withe their vampire sister who became shaltears sex slave and lived happily ever after on that floor, forgot floor number.
[deleted]
Perfect,I like it when the world's laws don't bend over sympathy
Not the worst destiny, honestly.
It’s was either sex work or being sent to the mines
Damn...
False, he said they were sold to work as slaves for sex, that is just theory
Sheesh No happy ending for ppl that isn't the main cast huh
Didn't they end up living with Arche in Nazarick in the web novel?

That's probably the best ending they ever got.
I never thought The author would be this Dark. Like some guy dying eating by cockroaches and one by torture getting his body penetrated in places not ment to be. That was funny , this is just beyond Sad still on theme tho. But fr is there anyone that got a happy ending in overlord other than the main cast and the princes getting her toys and corn village ?
**glances at lizard decimation and re-estize kingdom straight up erasure**
Ive read a good chunk of the books, never finished— i had hoped insect maid was going to impersonate the sister and get used in a future arc since her voice was taken… now im just sad

Dude spent 2.5 books on the stupid lizardmen but passes getting another undercover agent into nobility…
It's just some over the top edgy shit that a 14 year old would write. Don't let cheap shock value get to you
This post popped on my feed on reddit. What I know about Overlord is that, protag gets away with anything he does, tragedy for everyone else that is not the main cast. 
Why watch in the first place?
everytime i scroll down it gets worst , how is this posible
Do the parents die at least ? ( i just now got the overwork part now that u put it in " " and now i feel even worst
i wish you where the first comment.
I mean you're looking at this from modern lenses. 

Family, honor and that crap was very very important in fedual ages. So her not just picking up and running is very understandable.
While I don’t disagree that going to Nazarick was stupid, hindsight is 20/20. We know how strong Nazarick is while the workers knew absolutely nothing about it. All they knew about it was that it was unexplored and had unusual architecture. They assumed it was relatively safe and likely stronger than the previously explored dungeons. Arche was in need of money to leave her parents behind so they could survive on their own so it makes sense that she would go to an unexplored dungeon with many other strong Worker groups. No one expected that dungeon to be unfathomably more powerful than anything else they had encountered and no one knew that Momon, the strongest adventurer with them, was secretly the Tomb’s leader.

Personally, if I was in their position, I would go with the second group of explorers and hope to go down an unexplored passage even if I do find less treasure.
Honestly, i agree. The gold they found at the start was like ainz saying "take this and fuck off" but everybody got greedy.
Didn't she caught the attention of Fluder ? He could totally have taken her as an apprentice
Arche was greedy too. That turned out to be her undoing.

Ainz purposefully left a vast wealth in the outside mausoleums of Nazarick specifically so that anyone who was on the raid just because they needed money could take it and leave. It was how he confirmed that all the invaders truly were just selfish and greedy. If Arche (and the rest of foresight) took the loot from there, and left with that they would've been fine, and Arche would've had more than enough to leave her parents with her sisters.

So yeah, you shouldn't feel too bad for her.
Wasn’t she near level 30

That is definitely enough strength to run away
She was planning to leave with them after the job to the Tomb, she wanted to make sure they would have enough money to survive without her having to be a Worker anymore and pay off the current debt so her parents wouldn't be able to give her any problems. Blaming a victim for the shitty life they were dealt is horrible dude. That's like saying the people of Re-Estize deserved to be massacred because of Philips stupidity.
what epsidoe was this?
Wait so is it fake or did u needed to believe it was fake? ( i need to be saved rn )
Being plowed alright
Author revealed their fate in an interview or something.
The "sex slaves" were overblown speculation. The interview just said it was due to overwork as slaves did the two died from. But due to the nature of two young nobilities being sold to slavery, the people speculate that it could've been similar to Tsuare's situation. But I think being overworked in mines or other manual labour is more likely because they are in the empire. Slavery in the empire is not illegal but I don't think Jircniv would allow the increase of Brothels for "special kinks" in his country. Arche is also known by the syndicate to be a magic caster so the twins might have shared some degree of ability to cast magic and the slavers might have tried to test whether the twins have the aptitude for magic.
Yeah after that episode 

I stop rooting for aniz
bruh u didn't even suger couth it like the rest
Glory to Ainz. Because Shadow Demon is always watching 😂
The time before entering ainz care is slavery and cult involvement as sacrifices. Most likely in this rendition they are sold and die as slaves
"Mass for the Dead" is basically happy ending for everyone since everyone has a common foe that conveniently curbs Nazaric from getting up to the same level of mischief by giving them an enemy they can't just curbstomp and have to work with the inhabitants of the new world to stop.
Also, they were sold into sex trafficking just needed to point that out there this world that they are in is not kind or fair
It's not edgy it is ridiculous the family sold dead weight to continue their lifestyle as long as possible while the sisters probably cursed the world,parents and probably sister most of all because of expectations.they died because they were,they died because they lacked will,they died because they lacked wisdom.
Well, Overlord is a dark humour series which pride itself in worldbuilding. Sometime you have funny moment like people misunderstand Ainz and he scream in his head, sometime you have heart warming moment like Nfirea and Enri, then you have a poor son of a barker who scream and run away form a demon but the demon aura caught him and burn him form inside


Its kinda realistic in a sense that how normal people would deal with an unstoppble force suddenly appear outside of their bedroom 
And here we remember that overlord is a villain perspective anime.
Weren't they sent to the mines?
Maruyama never said what kind of work, that was misinformation
[deleted]
In the web novel they went to live with Archie in Nazarick after she was turned into a vampire servant by Shalltear
In the Web Novel they are solve into slavery but they're acquired by a cult that worships Ainz and they give the two to Ainz as a "sacrifice". Since in the Web Novel Shalltear spares Arche and keeps her as a sex slave Ainz sends the twins to Arche.

In the LN/anime their fate isn't revealed in the story itself, but the author has confirmed that they are still sold into slavery but this time they are just overworked until they die.
Pretty sure it’s the same in LN, don’t think it’s mentioned in anime
In the LN it's stated that they died, in the Anime they were just mentioned that their sister was working to provide for them, they didn't mention what became of them after she died
Honestly I really hate these moments in Overlord. It doesn't hit me that bad when the entire kingdom gets eliminated but when the author closes in on cases like this, I despise reading it. Even more so because it's the MC committing these atrocities.
Its also for punish Arche, who the father thinked she ran away(he doesnt know she died in the tomb).
Don't blame shalltear, blame their money hungry overspending parents
Why you Blaming shaltear as if the main culprits of Archie’s demise and the kids demise wasn’t the parents who couldn’t accept being broke and continued to live a life they couldn’t uphold?
nah, gotta give it to the parents. Even Arche wouldn’t have to be an adventurer and die if it wasn’t for their idiotic parents
That is the WN, non canon. The anime and manga follows the LN.
The family is from the Empire.
You don't think two little kids getting sold into sex slavery isn't THE worst fate?
PEAK REDDITOR RESPONSE 
"idks bros i think young small girls being sex s-slaves isn't so bad! Honestly!"

The children yearn for the mines
Thats an oxymoron, how can what he said be false if what you said was just a theory
bruh u made it even worst
Well they were children of parents that clearly displayed a complete lack of foresight and had only avoided being sold off by the folks they owed money to so far because of their older daughter's desperate attempts to make money. It wasn't just the kids the parents were definitely sold off too eventually. Whether they sold off their kids first to buy a little more time or if they were all sold off at once when the deptors came calling is irrelevant.
Ah, I see the WN as the non-canon draft, I sometime forget about it.
How is a guy getting eaten alive by cockroaches funny? 💀
Enri and Nfirea, I guess?
Felt for the Lizzard guys as well but at least some of them escaped with their lives as for Re-estize kingdom genocide the anime didn't give an insight into the lives of those who were killed so for me it didn't have the same effect.
One death is a tragedy one million deaths is a statistic.
Above a point it's just numbers it's the personal deaths that people feel the most. The anime/novel gave us just enough of an understanding of these characters to feel their loss more than the countless unknown citizens that died
Exactly, this is meant to be painful because it's little children being sold as slaves, there are bigger matters to worry about, like, I don't know, GENOCIDE??
I have the feeling the further you go the more it goes into theories. The only thing I believe to know as confirmed is that they were sold into slavery (specifically sex work, I believe).
It’s simple math. 

Lamp > 👯‍♀️
Nope they’re alive
Except Arche didn't care about her family's lineage nor their former position as nobles (reminder, they're not nobles anymore, they are just commoners living in a mansion), and she hated her parents. We also know she didn't give a shit about cultural reasons to keep her with her family since she was fully planning on taking her sisters and abandoning her parents once the debt was cleared up. So it really is just pure stupidity that she didn't just cut and run sooner considering she was well aware her parents would never stop taking on more debt and the odds of her making money faster than her parents increased the debt was slim to none.
Her family doesn't have honor, so it wouldn't mean shit if she left. And if she really cared and loved her sisters, she wouldn't care.
The second group was the old man team, the adventures (the group stay with Momon) were hired through legal mean (the adventure guild) so their job were protect the camp and step into the tomb. None of the worker survive, both the advance and stay back group either killer or caputred by Nazarick
Not so sure on that - that one guy pulled his team back to 'find another way in' and they were mopped up by the pleiades...

If they had just peaced out with the starting gold, I suspect Ainz would have had them hunted down and killed because they essentially skipped out on the job. He wanted examples to show that Nazarick is not someone to fuck with, and also to deprive the empire of the resources of reasonable level adventurer teams.

The reason we get to see the other side of the story is deliberate by the author - very few of the people that Ainz has killed have been 'evil' but have been people locked into a bad situation by circumstance. 

Arche didn't have the ability to turn this job down - she needed this money to get herself and her sisters out of that life. If she had the ability to do so earlier I imagine she would have done so.
Yes if she had gone to Fluder all of this could be avoided. For Fluder solving such problems is small price to keeping a promising student. Also she was already on his radar und joined his magic tower. He mentioned her since she could cast tier 3 so young. But Arche had her own pride and fluder probaly would have gotten rid of her parents completly and she still cares somewhat about them.
No the money was likely left outside as a way to lure people in. Also why the first skeletons were so weak. 

Aka how the group that remained outside was exterminated as well.
They are theories made by fans and based extremely loosely by the author (they were worked to death). Show  does not go into depth on their fate, to my memory.
Could’ve worded it better but yeah 
Idk why but the candle jack meme comes to mind.

It's cheap shock value plain and simple, and overlord is full of it. I do enjoy the show and it's lore but sometimes it can be a bit silly. Stuff like lil kids being sold into sex slavery where they are raped and tortured to death as a shoe horned plot point for a side character dying isn't deep or meaningful, it's just kind of... meh? Like if that's your thing, hey I don't judge, but it doesn't do anything for me. Lots of shows and stories do that it's just kinda desensitized me a bit, and once the shock value has worn off you just think to yourself. "Well that was a bit much eh?" 

Warhammer 40k is a good example of this with its "Grimderp" moments. Where it's just so absurdly over the top edgy that the pure absurdity of how vile the situation is makes it more funny and less shocking and sickening. 

TLDR: it's shit writing
So it's supposed to be funny then?
Tbf, none of the main cast were involved in this specific case of human trafficking. It was their psychotic delusional parents. Not really defending the cast cuz abelion sheep. Enough said lol

It just goes to say that despite Ainz being the villain, at least his side isn’t rotten inside like all the kingdoms/empires in the new world.
But is ainz really evil.....well yes. But at least he is a better dad than the twins dad.
The children yearn for the mines!!
They were definitely minors being put to work, sure.
They call it a mine. A mine!
Most likly brothel
God I hope so, because it would be awful if it was the other place for two young girls.
Some people deserve the happy farm but even that's too good for you
I can live with this ending 🙃
It's not. Arche is killed in the LN, their fate is left in the air. The author later elaborated in an interview that the parents, in order to continue to maintain their lavish lifestyle >! sold the two of them into slavery where they were forced into being ladies of the night and were "worked" to death. !<
The one thing about reading the light novels that really irritated me was he kept repeating that he’s doing it for the slight chance one of his friends is trapped there with him. Then after a point it’s just who he is but he never stopped to consider that his friends might not even want to be affiliated with him given the current path he and the NPCs have chosen. He also never really puts his foot down with the NPCs because he’s afraid that at some point they’ll figure out he’s not as smart as they view him to be.
To be fair, in this particular instance, it wasn't him doing it.
But the MC didn’t do it
They are not atrocities,you really are naive.what makes human life worth more then anything else,simply it is not worth more in this world and the worth of a human life is inflated to an extreme level to the point the world suffers for it.the big sister come in to his home,he already has intel and could be a future threat,never mind her thoughts process is completely on the other side of ainz plus she simply is not worth it.if you need something ainz could always extract the memories from her or torture it out her.the little sisters well the is no point caring about them, their life and death frankly don't matter to ainz so why should he care about them.
THEY were NOBLES!! And they LIVED like nobles, and bought LAMPS!! They were IMPORTANT!!  

And how DARE a commoner like you insinuate otherwise. PEASANT!! 

(On some real shit death to her her parents, arche and the bebes deserved better.)
What happened to their parents then?
Oh there fucking next
Idk, it’s bad but Imina’s and Hekkeran’s fate seems way worse to me. 
There are way worse fate in Overlord

Sold into work slaves or sex slaves? I thought it was the first.

Anyways, I think being 'cattle' for nazarick is, possibly, a worst fate. Isn't Arche turn into a bugs seedbed? Fuck that.

Despite anything, poor girls, Arche should have killed the 'parents' before.
Why do so many people think that they were sold for sex work? It is never stated.
What I meant was that Maruyama just said that they were sold as slaves and worked to death. The sex part was never mencionated
My bad, I just noticed that I wrote it wrong 🤣🤣🤣
He deserved it for invading
you know sometime it's Good to spread misinformation on the intent.( u took away the only confort i could had have in this )
[in just gonna link my other comment disregard the last part. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/overlord/s/8vcLZriH5X)
Yes they didn't. But arch was still trapped in that mindset from that age. She still supported the failing family and needed enough to gtfo with her sisters after this. She realized her family was garbage and this was the one job to make enough and gtfo. 

But her mindset before was the mindset of "family, honour the house name." She did smarten up but picked the wrong job to do it with.

So no your original comment is that of a 12 year old lol.
I meant second group as in second group sent to explore the new tomb. If the first group of Workers came back alive with the amount of gold/relics they found, there would be a ton of groups sent there to explore more of the tomb. I would rather be apart of that group rather than the first group sent into a completely unexplored dungeon that just so happened to be found suddenly.
Imo Ainz left the gold there as a “Hey, this is an incredibly rich dungeon, you might want to explore deeper”. That’s also the reason the first patrol the Workers ran into are weak skeletons that can be killed by a simple spell. It was to lure them farther in. As for Arche, another commenter explained it pretty well: Arche was stuck in the medieval mindset of “Family honor before anything.” She was working on getting her family out of debt, but the straw that broke the camel’s back was her father borrowing money that don’t have while already being in debt to buy a simple lamp. She didn’t have enough money to leave with her sisters so she want it Nazarick.
Yeah I really hate when people point out "oh Ainz left gold out so they could just take it and run, if they kept going it's their fault." Like no, screw off with that non-sensical logic, Ainz deliberately set things up to trick people into attacking to test Nazarick's defenses, and the Workers didn't even have any reason to suspect that there was anything more to Nazarick than just the usual ruins. That's like walking into a shop only for a firing squad to come out of no where and gun you down claiming that just cause the door was unlocked and the sign said open, doesn't mean you're actually allowed to enter.
The skeletons were weak to lure them in yes, but the money was because Ainz wanted to give the people who didn’t have a choice a chance to leave. He said as much in the novel.
The author in 2018 said some rules to survive and number 4 was "don't touch any coins".  
My idea is that that gold was simply a decoration, like the flags present there.  
It wouldn't make sense for Ainz to make them go away, also because then he would have to justify the presence of gold there with demiruge and albedo.

The contradictions make it funny, dark moment like this exist so the light moment later hit better, a build up in some way
He’s clueless and the system making him desensitized to negative emotions amplifies this. I wish he grew more as a character and becomes more human as the series goes on. Because the subplot is him holding onto his friends memories (& their npcs) is him holding onto his humanity.
It was more the writers, he chose the death route when the people voted for salvation in the original online draft
The minor miners mined in mines?
And the Mines yearn for the children
LoTRs moment
No definitely not I believe Jircniv outlawed such degeneracy
What did he say? It's deleted
And Maruyama hated it!
trust me bro, you really fucking cant, LN ending is much kinder
Well shit.
I thought they were sent to the mines
Perfect,so much respect for the author at the moment making it relestic
I mean, Ainz actually have no problem put his foot down with stuff he deem serious, other than that, every other trivia shit he just value the NPC happiness more than shatter their belief, like a spoiling father doesnt want to tell his kids that Santa isnt real


Beside, a good portion of Guil mate would have no problem with Ainz action, Momonga was considered mid in every sense compare to other guild mates, not as evil as Ulbert but not as heroic as TouchMe. Combine that with the fact that the monster body of guildmate would affect their mind (all of them roleplaying as evil monster), Ainz have a solid chance they would approve his actions
What? Didn't he lure a bunch of adventurers to his dungeon and murder them because "they invaded"? Yes he did.
👆 Resident psychopath right here. Just because human life worth next to nothing to Ainz it doesn't mean that what he does are not considered atrocities. Also that world has a lower population than Earth so a life is supposed to worth more not less. Also no matter what you think in your unhinged mind, even you have to see that destroying an entire kingdom with everyone in it is something so inhumane that only a special kind of monster would do it.
not sure, i only know that because of a random video
Ladies of the night is sex slave dude.
The author confirmed it himself
Welllll he never said what _kind_ of slave....
You're reputation is now forever tarnished and you will bare your shame till death
Weren't they set up and somewhat lured into invading Nazaric in the first place by someone under Ainz command?
Then they deserved it because their elder sister invaded as well. Simple maths.
I’m sorry ☹️
Why should she not just run away and enjoy life on her own
If you went to that shop to kill the owner, dont suprise when they outgun you


They expect the tomb to be occupied and willing to kill anything inside, fuck it, they even said they expect a powerful lich. And yes, there are a few powerful monsters inside that tomb


Let put it this way, if they were stronger or Nazarick denizen were weaker, they wouldnt thnk twice before murder them all. Its only fair for Nazarick to fight back
Hrm... I suppose I'll trust you. He seemed to just start being a bastard as soon as the series started, and the whole thing don't seem worth it. But again, haven't gone very far.
His entire character development is literally the opposite of what you’ve stated. He is becoming LESS human that’s his growth
You do know that it’s gonna be ending soon right? I think 2 more volumes for the light novel and it’s done.
He's not clueless(aside from Demiurge's own farming operation) about the world, he just can't and won't be bothered by it. They have a goal in mind and he can"t stop for every collateral they get to roll over and step on. Ainz is still not fully engaged with the world conquest ordeal but increasing their security and conquering foreign countries are not mutually exclusive and he ought to gain more by achieving both. Ainz is just too pragmatic and efficient.

If the minors mined in the mines how minor was the mining by the minors of said mines
Wait if there's a minor killer would you call him a Miner?
Yes because we all know once it's outlawed no one will do it.
He said he wishes they "worked" for him
From.what i.understand he didnt hate it he put a special poll for it and fans voted for her and her sisters to die
What? The fans are the ones who hated it, maruyama is the one who originally intended for Archie to live after shaltear pleaded with ainz to let her live and be her “new toy” and shaltear would permit her to search for her sisters after a year or so. However the fans thought that wasn’t a good ending for her.
In the Light Novel they were sold as slaves and "overworked" to death, how is this kinder?
Well they were still minors at work.
At most I think they wouldn't care what he is doing but only the most evil part of the guild would approve. And the thing is since everybody was a different kind of monster they would probably be differently affected by turning into it. Ainz didn't neccessarily turned evil. It's more like he lost almost all emotions. He literally turned into a psychopath. 

It's not that he really wants to kill people (other than those who hurt his "friends") but when he thinks somebody needs to die so that he can further his plan (actually mostly Demiurges plan) he has no moral dilemma about anything. Killing someone has turned into a chore for him.
I mean the selling the kids into slavery comment, their parents did that. But in general I don't remember him luring the adventurers in so much as allowing them to choose to enter but it has been a while since I've read this part.

Didn't he also verify their reasons for invading the Tomb was purely greed by questioning them as the warrior?

Sure he is far from a 'good guy' which is mostly the point of the series, but it isn't like he scooped innocent people from their beds and dumped them into torture chambers.
And so what if it inhumane that's human concept it does not represent world,the weak die and strong survive that generally the law of the world.they were threat and ainz needed to set an example,a person that has power but is restricted by what over people think when it does not matter shows how weak of leader they are
As far as I am aware they were sold into slavery and overworked to death, nothing more was elaborated by Maruyama.
Thats my point.
I can dig that
Are you accusing the supreme one of staging his home invation so that he would habe an excuse to attack a kingdom ?
She was trying too after realizing honor to the house as a failed noble is worthless. 


She was literally going to use this job to get her sisters out and start anew.
They didn't, they went to investigate what they thought was just a regular ruins, they had no reason to believe people were actively living there. They were expecting non-sapient/barely sapient monsters, not actual people.

You cant say "it's only fair for Nazarick to fight back" when Nazarick literally baited the attack. It's not self defense when you plant someone among the other side and have that plant start the attack to justify slaughtering everyone as self defense. The *only* reason Nazarick was found and a raid attempted was because Ainz deliberately revealed Nazarick and paid people to raid it.
In all fairness, the undead body did get into his mind and remove last bit of humanity (not like Suzuki has much humanity to begin with)


But at least not evil for evil sake, there are meaning and planing behind his actions
Yeah as he’s losing it from the system.
I think the story suffers from him losing his humanity. I became less and less interested in him as a character the more he disregards morality.
![gif](giphy|OPU6wzx8JrHna)
For anywhere but the empire yes. Jircniv isn't called the bloody emperor for his eye color. The Empire is as well off because he's a good ruler and executing nobles who would indulge in this was his go to.
Just like murder, rape and drugs
He should be buried under the jail.
To be honest it’s super sad, I’d prefer to think they got sent to the mines.
I heard he was very disappointed. Which obviously means he hated if he went the complete opposite in the LN.
Edit: I may have misread your point. Thought your were indicating the author put the poll out for her fate in the LN not the WN

My understanding is he put a poll out initially on whether she lived or died in the WN and was surprised (and according to some discussions I saw before on the subject) seemingly upset when fans chose for her to live. So he was very rough on her in Nazarick but ultimately she did survive. My understanding is killing her in the LN was returning to the original plan for her unfortunately. 

I suspect that is why he emphasized so much about her “being the limit of her potential” etc and not actually a genius because the WN seemed to indicate she was closer to an actual genius. Even inventing her own type of magic. So acting like her potential was already used up seems to be a way to try and justify the decision to kill her off instead.
I thought it was the other way around, he wanted them to die but the fans voted that they should live
They voted to let her live, he decided they die.
I'm surprised ppl voted for the kids to die or did he say they would become vampires?
Exactly 
Because in that world, death is a luxury/kindness compared to endless torture/resurrection and death.
was more referring to arches fate
But he was the one who intentionally revealed his dungeon as a new found ancient ruin, supposedly uninhabited apart from monsters. Then he lured in adventurers with the promise of a big payday since it contains many expensive items.

Thats like intentionally leaving a bunch of money on the side of the road and then executing anyone who dares try to pick it up.
Yes it was I don't know the exact interview but he explicitly said their fate you can find it if you look for it but you can believe what you want
Isn't that what happened? (Haven't seen Overlord)
She should have abandoned her sisters and she would most likely not go for that bait since it's high risk.
So you telling me, if they found a lich lair inside, they would just "understandable, have good day" ? No, they tried to find a way to slain it


> Under that arrangement, those people who discovered ruins which had been previously unknown to the nation or the Adventurer’s Guild had unspoken permission to kill any illegal squatters occupying the ruins. In that respect, they had adopted a policy of “kill them on suspicion.”






> “Ah, under normal circumstances, it’d probably be the undead. If the undead really have taken over these ruins, then we’ll need to clear them out and consecrate the place to disperse the negative energy, else it’ll be bad, right?”


Dont get me wrong, Nazarick are evil, extremely evil. But the workers aint innocent little babies, they have basic knowledge about the tomb and willing to kill each and every monster and undead they found to take their treasure. Form the worker pov, they walk into unknow tomb, expect there may some powerful undead inside and willing to kill it to take their gold. A powerful undead did live inside the tomb and the worker lose the fight against it. Live by the sword, die by the sword, fair and square. You cant complain when you raid someone home the owner outgun you
How is he spots to know about the sisters and why should he care.they explored foolishly filled with throughout of greed rather then thinking it's suspicious.they died because they were weak,they died because lack wisdom and knowledge,they died because of weak ego.if they were selfish they would not go they would let another group go first then rob them when they come out exsorsted,that reduces risk,and increases profitblity.
Does that include the web novel sex slavery?
That’s the system making him slowly lose his original humanity. Wish he could break out of it and become a truly loved king 😭
Straight through the neuro and cockroach cycle over and over
They were
Disappointment doesn't automatically equate to hatred and like I said he put out a weird poll to decide her and her sisters fates.
- In the web novel (ballroom and academy arc) there are many references to Arche, perhaps because the author wanted to reintroduce her, also considering that he gave her back her sisters.  
-I don't remember if in her web novel they talk about her as a genius but I think he uses it as a motivation for the reader to believe that she will save herself, and then kill her. Then in the sheet, when the character is no longer needed, he reveals everything.  
-In any case, she remains, together with her companions, one of the worst characters ever written. Really, they add nothing to the narrative and nothing important to the lore. Even in the game they were killed without a specific reason. This also makes you realize how rubbish they are.
So I misremembered apparently they didn't really vote for them to die he put out this weird quiz/puzzle the fans had to.solve and they didn't solve it in time so her so her sisters died
They didn't get tortured in the WN, and their end in the LN is heavily implied to be the same of Tsuare, but without a Sebas saving them.




Also, "death is kindness" is a meme.
I'd closer equate it to leaving a bunch of cash and expensive stuff sitting exposed in a car. Definitely tempting but also clearly not yours to take.
I have indeed searched for said post with no avail, the wiki just states that they were sold off as slaves and died from overwork, nothing more nothing less. Sadly there was no referral to the source. What I did noticed is the older reddit discussions never mentioned the sex slave part and most of the people saying that either just said that the author said it in an interview (despite the wiki stating it was on his website) or go on a rant on how noble kid slaves wouldn't be good for anything else.
It's not exactly what happened, but Aizen was well aware of the situation in his adventure guise.

Iirc, and it's been a while since the various mercenaries involved were in it for the pay, Aizen decided they deserved what they get.

But we did learn several of them were trying to pay the medical bills of kid, but Aizen didn't check more that learning they were working for pay.

The implication is that Aizen might have spared them, but he didn't put any effort into checking, so he really was going through the motions of pretending to verify.

The whole thing underlines that, at this point, Aizen still cares enough to act like he is the good guy, buy only enough to fool himself.
You can't read can you.
Geez glad I'm not your sibling, guess you don't respect people that put their family above their own well-being.
No obviously not, but my point wasn't about that, my main point was that you cant really use "oh the workers broke into the tomb" to try to defend Ainz. If the workers found Nazarick and raided it entirely on their own I wouldn't be saying a thing about it, the issue is the fact that Ainz deliberately revealed Nazarick and then hired the Workers to attack it.

Using your "raid someone's house and got outgunned" example, what happened was if the owner of a home paid someone to rob their home, and then when that person robbed the home they killed the robber. Sure they can try to claim that was "self defense" but like... the only reason the person even broke into their house is because they paid them to do so. Sure that doesn't make the robber innocent, they're still a robber after all, but that home owner sure as fuck is a lot more messed up for deliberately engineering a situation to allow them to kill someone who otherwise wouldn't have been a danger.
I mean yeah, in wn, after sometime being Shaltear toy, Arche released allowed to live peacefully with her sisters. Not the same in ln tho
Damn he don't even get to be a hive mind
If I had to guess he was probably more disappointed in the edgy "Arche is Shalltear's sex slave" angle and less her and her sister's surviving.
He honestly should have knows what people would have chosen. Still remember all the bitching the casuals did when Arche died. They’re not used to they loli chicks not having plot armor.
I could have sworn there was an interview that said it  but it doesn't matter common Sense should tell you their fate if you think they weren't sold as sex slaves and not overworked to death because of it that just copium what are two little girls going to be overworked for in the slave industry what do you think would make the most money 🤔 that's what most if not all girls fate in the slave industry that's their best use especially two weak little girls
Indeed. Enough to fool himself and most of the fandom.
No, it is more a statement of sympathy always produces shackles that eventually drag people down
True I think they are failures of evolution.
>but that home owner sure as fuck is a lot more messed up for deliberately engineering a situation to allow them to kill someone who otherwise wouldn't have been a danger.

thank you for having some common sense in your comments
The thing is, while no one argue that Nazarick are beacon of goodness, this is one of the way lesser evil compare to their other evil act, sure they bait them in but it was a fair and square, they put up a job, with normal job descriptions, those workers have some level of expectation before going there, they fully aware they may not go out in pieces, that's their whole job, they should have nothing to complain. This time, Nazarick kill someone willing to massacre  without a second thought if they were stronger. This time, Nazarick defend itself against a hostile force that actively raid it, the fact that Nazarick bait them in doesnt change the fact that none of those workers would have any problem with genocide them all if they could

That's why this is one of the time where Nazarick not fully in the wrong
Just had to live as a sex slave until she accepted her lot in life is all
I mean he was the one to choose that route for her survival vs a less cruel survival
Arche is definitely not a loli.
People *definitely* try to argue Nazarick are not evil. Though I think it's honestly a bit ridiculous that you're treating "killing mindless swarms of undead" as genocide, if you consider that as evil behavior then you should consider all adventurers in general evil since they also kill mindless/barely sentient monsters all the time, this is no different.
The world doesn't deserve Gyomei:
He's such a sigma example of a hashira.

I love how most of the other hashira treats Tanjiro as an adult, while Gyomei treats him as who he really is; a 14 yr old child,

Tanjiro needed that headpat more than anyone, although he went through alot he's still a kid at heart.

God I love Gyomei.
Bro has HIM in his name, HIMejime Gyomei agenda fr fr
The gentle giant.
Real. I love Gyomei 🫶🏽
Pure definition of a gentle giant who you do not want to mess with 
Never really thought about how big Gyomei is until this scene.
Damn look at that meat on his forearms. How come he's only 130 Kg at 7+ feet height and so much muscle mass.

He is as tall as All Might from BNHA, and all might weighs 250ish Kgs.

Real life humans who hold dangerously low levels of fat and are much smaller than Gyomie, also weigh equal or more than 130 many times.
Gyomei deserves the world.

He’s adorable
Gyomei is basically my tall friend who gives me headpats lol
God that scene got me all riled up. Was it in the manga though? For some reason I cant remember it
I love how he’s the only one that doesn’t project his past issues onto demon slayer corps members like Sanemi or Obanai. Gyomei is the only actual adult among these mf’s.
It was so sweet to see pat tanjiro's head but it was sad seeing him not get appreciated for protecting that little girl rather getting blamed
He’s gonna be a lot of people’s favorite when the series ends
I can’t get over how weird Tanjiro looks with his shirt off like his body is huge and his head looks small in comparison sometimes
He is peak after all :3
HIMejima. I cannt wait for that awaited battle
« Namu amida butsu » HIMejima Gyomei
His forearm is tanjiros size💀
Also he literally is the 🙏🏼😭 embodied
We are lucky to have Himejima-san, much better than we deserve.
Damn, look how massive Gyomei grew

look at the difference in the size of his hand when he held the girl and tanjiro's head
Jesus Christ that man is huge
Gyomei is such a Gentle Giant, he’s a Combination of Tanjiro and the Hulk
Tanjiro is 5 feet and 5 inches tall, Gyomei is 7 feet and 2 inches tall. The animators either sized up Gyomei a lot or shrunk Tanjiro.
I was never sure of Gyomei until the latest episode 

Man is blind and manages to become the highest rank demon slayer
People blaming Sayo need to realise >!that when she said 'he's a monster' she meant the actual demon, not Gyomei. Officers misunderstood here because the body of demon was nowhere to be found and Gyomei was their with blood all over him with dead bodies of children lying around. !<
The best archetype of a gentle gaint

I felt so bad for giyomei when he got betrayed by Sayo 😭
I like Gyōmei 🌌
Shut up, it deserves! We can’t defeat Muzan without him.
Namu namu abidsu 🙏
Who doesn’t love Gyomei?
My coin approves of Gyomei 🌸
aw. he’s too adorable man
oh lol tanjiro looks so small
Gyomeis backstory made me cry.
HE IS A LEGEND
Gyomei story sad as fuck holy
fr
Those forearms are insane
Where are you watching the newest episodes? I need sources, people!! 🥲
I nearly cried. Let him adopt tanjiro
Would never allow a dude with those forearms to casually touch my head like that. Killer for real.
This just proves that gyomei is absolutely fucking massive
The difference in his bulk between these shots is insane. Dude got some serious muscle going on
I like to imagine he is like the dad of the group and when he gets visibly mad everyone shuts up but when he gets verbally mad everyone runs and hides and prays
Look at the size difference in his forearms!
Dam he’s huge
I want to have a tea party with Gyomei
But still I don’t like the girl cause she snitched on whom saved her life..
I just hate that he got his trust shattered by the kids he did so much for :(
His story made me shed a tear. And he's blind that's it I've no comments further.
Gyomei is so underrated as a character and writing wise.
The world needs him
Definition of a gentle giant
Gyomei really a chad for treating younger and lower classed slayers with respect instead of like trash
So is hashira training arc over will infinite castle arc continue from now or there will be a break ?
Correction. They didn't. He's dead. And no, that's not a spoiler, he was alive in the Taishō era in Japan back in 1920's... A hundred years ago. So he might be alive but it's highly unlikely that a blind 26 year old would've survived the rapid modernization that happened shortly after the end of the manga. Saj, I know.

Edit: further correction. The Taishō era ended in the 1920's he was 26 in the 1910's dude would've been 136 today. Even more Saj. I know.
I never even realized this… isn’t Gyomei older than the age where you know what happens?
You ruined the post when you said sigma
One of the few unhateable characters in all of anime
I bet he dies
Gyomei is gigantic sheesh
Look at the size of gyomei's forearm it near whole body size of tanjiro l.💀💀💀💀
📿🙏

That he almost has that slight smile again
Just wait
Jesus Gyomei is fucking *giant*.
Reminder that Gyomei was willing to kill Tanjiro and Nezuko.
[removed]
He is 16 I think
I think Tanjiro is either 15 or 16. It's Tokito that's 14, which might explain why they get along together so well :D
Pretty sure he's 16 at the moment
That’s so true 🥹 this scene was so precious!! I think we had all forgotten that they’re still just kids. And they didn’t get to be kids. They had their childhoods taken away from them

I think that Gyomei headpat allowed Tanjiro to feel safe and protected, like a lil kid again
He is the oldest Hashira, all the other ones are in their early 20s except for Muichiro who is even younger than Tanjiro. People behaving older than their age is a common trope in the show. Best example being Kagaya.
Tbf most of the Hashira aren't much older than Tanjiro, Gyomei is the oldest
poor tanjiro hes so young 🥲
It’s definitely a little different for Gyomei from the other Hashira because of the large age gap, considering most of the regular demon slayer ranks are around 16 or so like Tanjiro with the rest of the hashira being from 18-21 (besides Tengen at 23 who is kinda just in his own little world). Dude has been doing this for 8 years, likely at least twice as long as any other current slayer. Not to mention he’s probably the most physically daunting individual in all of Japan and he spent a long time literally raising children.
He was 14 at the start of the anime but after the 2 year timeskip where he trains under urokodaki he turns 16
I think because he is a lot older than other hashiras too. He's 27.
Aren't most of them teens
Beautifully said
Wait HES 14?!?. I COMPLETELY FORGOT

well, he *is* 7ft tall
130 kg is 285 lbs... he's the size of Brock Lesnar.   I deadlift 375 and squat 360, and I'm big and like 15-20% bf, I'm not shredded but I'm bulky and strong.   And I come in at around 110 kg.  He's over a foot taller than me and he's like 40 lbs heavier, and he's probably almost pure muscle.   Don't misunderstand, he is still huge lmao
Now that's just wholesome
it was. chapter 135
Yeah the rest act like children when there're supposed to be responsible.
\[MANGA SPOILERS\] >!It was revealed that the girl was actually grateful and trying to tell the officers about the demon, but they misunderstood her because of her hysterics (and since the demon's corpse vanished). Also it turns out that the kids who disobeyed his orders and ran were actually trying to run to the village to get help.!<
I ended up reading the Manga after seeing some of the anime and he very quickly became both my favorite hashira and favorite character in the series. Cant wait to see his fights animated.
The whole look is very exaggerated. While demon slayers would undoubtedly build some muscle mass, they aren't bodybuilders, cardio is just way too important in their job. Realistically their bodies would fall into the ,,athletic'' category. Endurance plays a much bigger role than raw strenght for them (the latter is still important), and most of them would look very shredded but not super big.
Yeah, you are seeing the Tanjiro side now. Next season you get to see the Hulk side.
Not just the highest rank, but literally the strongest. There's gonna be some cool reveals later I won't spoil, but suffice it to say his blindness is a benefit, not a hindrance.
Oh he is blind than! Cause at some point I wasn’t sure if he was or not.

Him and wind hashira are my favs
I don't really blame Sayo, because everything just happened so fast. If anything, the terrible police work was to blame, because they didn't even conduct any autopsy on the children's bodies to notice that their throat got slashed, not punched to death. There were no murder weapons in the scene of the crime, and there was no way Gyomei could've made those claw marks with his bare fists.
I think it's something they do playing with perspective because in some scenes tundra literally comes up to people's like knee. But in other scenes he's about the same size. Well either that or he's a midget
Go to crunchyroll fam! I also have a friend who uses a free site to watch them. I’ll see if I can get that for you 😊
Things didn't work out exactly the way he thought they did.
-12 yr olds when they found someone other than Christian Bale characters can be a sigma.
I'm pretty sure most of the hashira were willing to do it, even my best boy Rengoku
Everyone was lol
Should have aimed for his vitals first.
bro you're supposed to put a spoiler warning before the spoiler
Oh yeah, there was a time-skip, right? When he still had his family, was he 14 then?
Tanjiro mentions Tokito is a little older than him. I think he became a hashira at 14 but he's not now
Having foresight and knowing you’ll die at the age of 20 or so will make you grow up quick fr

https://preview.redd.it/ilnbut73jq8d1.png?width=230&format=png&auto=webp&s=8356d771601ff2619f24ae925b97d12298839736
True, the ninja hashira is like 6"5 or something.
7'2" 

And it's not like he's skinny either. Bro is literally peak. That's not hyperbole. He literally has pinnacle human physique, as noted by Kokushibo, even beyond that of other Hashira. Factor in his size, and it's no wonder he's the strongest.
285 is not Huge for a 7'2" guy. That's less than Ronnie Coleman weighed DURING show time, which means as less fat as one can have, and at his least weight.

And you know how small Ronnie was in height compared to Gyomie. Same goes for other high muscle pros. 

No idea why you needed to share your lifts, because guys that are much stronger than you and have lesser body weight still prove my argument.

Olivier Richters, who's exactly as tall as Gyomie, weights 353 pounds (160kg) while being so so much skinnier than him.

Guys that are that tall, weight hell a lot.
15-20% body fat aint bulky. If you are actually bulky you would be surprised at your actual bf percentage. Don't know how you got your numbers but it clearly was not a DEXA scan. 

Unless you actually had a DEXA scan and in which case you have body dysmorphia. 15% bf is goals for most people.
I think of him more like a strongman build. Like robert oberst, or brian shaw. They say he is 7ft 2. He must be more like 450lbs plus.. I am 220lbs 5ft 8. Deadlift 600lbs, squat 550+/-... I dont look anywhere near as strong or jacked as this dude (at a smaller scale of course) so him being 7ft2 and only 285 sounds pretty puney.
Thank god I forgot it, I got surprised with such wholesomeness during the episode. I needed that.

Edit: spelling
Oh did they / will they eventually reveal this
Also they probably don’t get much food to eat. They must be quite lean.
Yeah
Watched the Netflix daredevil so I know he is going to be  sick
Tanjiro's like 5'4 - 5'5, Gyomei's just huge at 7'2
Yeah, as someone who exclusively watches the anime, this comment feels like a bullet
I don't know how to put an actual spoiler tag in on mobile
He was 13 at the start. After training he was 15 and 16 at the end of the Manga.
13 going on 14 with his family, two years pass for final selection where he turns fifteen , and I’m assuming either during the four months after Rengoku’s death, or his two month coma after the swordsmith arc he turned sixteen.
No. Tanjiro mentioned Tokito must be YOUNGER than himself to highlight how crazy it was that Tokito was a Hashira.

Tokito didn't become a Hashira at 14. He's 14 years old in the current timeline. His brother died when he was 11 or 12. He then joined the Demon Slayer Corps and became a Hashira in 2 months.
amida
All I'm saying is that I do a pretty heavy workout, and I'm not enormous. 20% bf is pretty big around for a lifter.  Frankly,  I think 250 kg at 7 foot is really unrealistic.  Andre the giant was 7'4" and only clocks in at  520 lbs.  That's still 30 lbs short of 250 kg.  How big of a person are you imagining, that he outsizes Andre?

While yes, individual people break trends, that sort of size and height weight in anime is always an absurd metric.   In the same shows, you will have somebody who's 5 ft 4 and 60 kg.  Being overly particular of H/w in anime is silly.  He's around 7 foot and strong af. No other real comparison needed
Ronnie was also roided up
OK so this is really late after the fact, but also to summarize everything I said, "I'm somewhere in that range, I am not shredded and I am not huge.  I'm a big guy in decent shape who isn't a washboard and I'm light as fuck compared to anyone who is a hulking mass of muscle like Brock Lesnar,  ronnie Coleman, Andre the giant".  I was specifically describing myself as not-the-extreme to illustrate just how extreme they are, and by extension the slight ridiculousness of gyomeis weight being 250kg.  

Hence the bits about not taking anime h/w seriously.

E: I didn't get dexa xrays, it's this handheld controller thing I do at my doctors that calculated bf% based on a tiny electrical current, dunno what its called but it seemed to be a big deal to let me use it.
Yes. Gotoge does a good job of tying up the loose ends.
I mean he's like that in comparison to other characters In certain scenes. It's strange overall though. It makes sense here
still, you could write SPOILER WARNING and then space it out
I forgot he trains with retired masked Hashira and ghosts and ghouls for quite a while.
Oh, okay.
Huh. I always thought his recovery periods after big fighters were longer.
Oh okay, well idk why everyone upvoted me then 💀 but thanks for clearing that up!
butsu
Your own comment holds the answer. 

Andre the Giant was to no extent as mascular as Gyomie specially not in muscle to fat ratio.

Also, I gave you example of a guy who's as tall as Gyomie, much less mascular while being kind of shredded, who weighs 30kg more than the weight you tell me is "Huge" i.e 130kg.

A guy who's that tall, and has that thick general muscles, has zero business being 130kg. Contrary to your claim.
And this is why comparing anime to irl is silly.   Anime characters don't have actual biological bodies to manage their weight.  They look how the artists want to draw them, they weigh what the artist says, they're all tall as the artist says even when drawn the same height as 'taller characters'.  

In season, ronnie was 330 lbs at peak.   Once again, he's well short of 250 kg (550 lbs)  Ronnie has to be almost 2x *bigger* than he was to hit 250.   Andre was 530 lbs and that's still only 220kg. There is either no way gyomei is 250 kg, or there's no way he would be as small as he is drawn.  Idk what else to tell you lol, other than maybe he also had high density like mitsuri. 

Brock Lesnar is a big man, Ronnie was a big man, and they are both smaller than gyomei in both height and weight. Andre was slightly taller, but nowhere near as muscular, and is still too small.
Well you were the one who said 130 is still Huge for someone of Gyomies height, and I'm replying to that till now.

I merely pointed out the fact that Gyomie weights quite low, never said he should be 250. Pointed out another equally mascular character who's as tall as him, and mentioned that All might is 250kg.

If you just want to say that it's silly to compare anime and Irl, then sure. Stick to that and I'll agree it is. 
I was doing regardless for the fun of it, because why not.

But you made a point that even if we are comparing, then 130kg is still Huge for someone mascular and tall equal to Gyomie, which is plain wrong. Your irl observation of 130 being huge for someone that tall and mascular is simply not valid.
I never spoke in an ultimatum, that people can't get there or be bigger than that, especially with an extra foot of height. But at 130 kg you're already beyond "fit for my bodyweight" shape and well into lifting and bodybuilding weight.  A quick look on Google for "7ft 300 lbs" shows body builders at like 8% bf full body flexing.  A search for "7 foot 250 kg" brings me wheelbarrows. Thor bjornsson, a competing world strongman, is 430 lbs at 6'9".  What real people can you direct me to with bigger numbers? You just keep discounting all the biggest people I can think specifically of like "yeah there are bigger people out there", but that crowd is already extremely small, no pun intended. 

I just do not see the realism in the 250 kg number. I think that if a 7 ft dude clocked in at 130 kg, he probably looks pretty fit and strong. I think that if you're going above that, you are probably bodybuilding.  Gyomei is probably around 200 kg with his build. I could believe "he looks like a strongman".  The recommended weight for a 7 ft guy is around 100 kg, so I would expect 130 kg to be bigger than "lean and healthy".  Maybe you're looking too much into the definition of the word huge in the way that I used it, it's a very subjective definition, but I think 130 kg is huge on pretty much anyone
Guys, it's an artistic representation, we don't have to discuss this as if it were some sports anime with nutrition and such, this ain't Dungeon Meshi.
Result of the training 
I was wondering if Tanjiro was of Hashira-caliber, because what he witnessed now is different during the fight between Kyojuro and Akaza, and he is unable to follow their movements.

He’s almost there. Very likely stronger than any other non-Hashira slayer at this point
He’s probably on the level or stronger than some past Hashira. Remember Daki killed like 7 by herself.
Actually a great idea from ufotable for this🐍
Bro doing eye workouts
He is easily way above the "Hashira grade" as even Daki killed 7. It's just that the current line up is the strongest line up. 

Even then by Current Hashira standards he is still a beast.
well of course he can see them now someone finnaly turned on the lights
Tanjiro is finally hashira level in the anime.
He's basically Hashira level at this point, then >! after the Akaza fight when he gets see-through world, he's properly Hashira level and perhaps even better than some of them!<
I find it so interesting that to this point in both the manga & the anime that most the current & living former Hashira we know of, including Sanemi, Iguro & even the Ubayashki family at this point do not call Tanjiro close to being a Hashira. He killed Hatengu himself with Yorichii’s sword (I am not denying, negating or ignoring the help all the others participating did - let me complete my point below). 

Its just an unprecedented time of the Corps as Tanjiro becomes Marked and simultaneously elevates both his own training/skills AT THE SAME TIME HE ENGAGES IN UNPRECENDENTED UPPER RANK BATTLES WITH EVERYONE ELSE (Hashira & Corps, plus leveling up the Swordsmiths). 

I read through the Fandom Wiki too and started taking notes a month ago as I re-Watch the series as my comfort TV: I have asked myself pointed questions as to why Kagaya made the mission decisions he did for both Tanjiro and the Corps from Akaskusa (Muzan & Tamayo/Yuchiro + Susamara/Temari Demon + Arrow Demon) & the Mt Natagumo/Rui & the Spider Family to now (where we are in the anime right now). 

E8 (this Sunday) Kagaya will say something very important about what his doctor told him six months ago. That means a lot as to the decisions he made - including what to tell the Hashira and what NOT to tell them. 

The point is that it’s amazing given what little the Hashira actually knew in total (that we the audience are fully aware of and Gyomei knows the most about - and Amane knew the absolute most) by this point and by the beginning of the Final Battle Arc. 

So yeah, it’s fun to nerd out on how this learning applies to Tanjiro’s battle skills in each moment, and to understand better what that has done to influence everyone around him. 

Nezuko’s evolution is fun to nerd out on in relationship to this & the Final Battle. 

Muzan was so blind.

Sorry for my poor spelling. I don’t feel like correcting all of it.
Yeah he is hashira level right now. You'll see. And he'll get even stronger than that
Hes gettin there. Hes close but not there yet.
He level up! :3
Almost. He wouldn’t be able to to physically keep pace with them yet, but he’s close enough to be able to observe them. 🦋
Tanjiro has been Hashira caliber for a while now, remember as long as you kill one of the 12 you can become one, so unless you think Rui could beat current Tanjiro I’d say it’s pretty clear he’s Hashira level. However there’s no shot he amounts to much against the current ones, even Ubuyashiki said this is the strongest group since the one that had Yoriichi in it
He is of hashira level at this point in the series, you'll see soon enough.
He is strong enough to become a hashira, but not stronger than any current ones
Tanjiro is finally at the Hashira level
Hashira backstories are so peak and Tanjiro's story fits perfectly between them. Hashira material fr fr og
He’s definitely Bashkirs calibre, this generation of hashira is generally the strongest generation if you ignore yoriichi. If he is born in a different generation, tanjiro would have already become a hashira now.

Tanjiro's powerlevel:
End of Hashira Training / Beginning of The Akaza Fight - Relatively Hashira Level 
We can see him run as fast as Giyuu during the recent episode, was able to fight alongside all the hashiras united, fought Sanemi for literally hours, and was stated to be hashira level by Giyuu before he awakened his stw.

STW Tanjiro -
Peak Hashira Level
He went from operating hashira levels of strength to speedblitzing Akaza, for anyone to argue that Akaza didn't see it coming, Tanjiro called his name and stated what he was going to do prior to it happening.
No hashira other than arguably Gyomei can ever behead Akaza let alone speedblitz.

Sun Breathing All 13th Forms + Stw Tanjiro -
Beyond Hashira Level 
The Muzan he fought at the start of their battle was relatively the same Muzan that the hashiras were all destroyed, and he outright stated that the reason why all Hashiras were defeated was because they couldn't caught up to the speed of Muzan's attacks which then proceeds to another panel of Tanjiro dodging those same attacks and landing hits on Muzan simultaneously which is a bigger feat than all Hashiras combined has done so far.

Tanjiro is amazing
Why I started tearing up at that scene. Our boy is GROWN 😭😭😭
Tanjiro is the definition of hard work and dedication. What a king!
By eos he's definitely a full hashira
Dragonball level gains
And a permanent Curse Mark now

I would argue that tanjiro (kanao, inoskue, and big man Z too) would lose against any hashira but put up a good fight, tanjiro def the best tho
\>literally beheads 2 upper moons, which has never been done in 113 years

"Is he hashira level?"
So they all got stronger in that short amount of time, why didn't they do this before?
Are they that fast or is it just exaggerating 

I am severely confused on how they look like fighting
YOU CAN SEE IT MAHORAGA!!! YOU CAN SEE MY CURSED TECHNIQUEE!!!!!
Again.
Gyomei>Sanemi>Obanai≈Giyuu>>Muichiro>Mitsuri>Rengoku>Tengen>Shinobu, at least this Eos.

The only comparisons we got of a Marked Hashira vs Unmarked is unmarked Sanemi and Gyomei being MUCH stronger than Marked Muichiro (who is already stronger than practically any other Hashira (beated UM5 alone)

So its hard to scale them Unmarked, but the list would be the same but pumping Rengoku and prob Tengen to the first half, both above Obanai and Muichiro but Below giyuu
growth!
I think it was kinda canon that he was nearing hashira or was hashira potential in Swordsmith Village, if he wasn't the Hashira Training Arc defintely made him around Hashira level, the mark defintley helps considering he has it activated and not dormant like before
Imo he is at level where he can react and successfully deflect attacks. But he would be pushed back and losing. But like not lose right away.
Yes, Tanjiro is currently on par with basically every Hashira except Gyomei.

His next fight is against >!Akaza, and he's stated by Giyu to be Hashira-level, and is able to easily keep up with Giyu and even contend with Akaza himself.!<
Despite the lack of action in this stretched out arc, moments from the manga like this one feel better in the anime since they've taken the time to show him grow through the training!
it’s because his slayer mark is permanent
Yea hes stronger but also rengoku coulda solod wind and snake man easily but maybe not muchiro
He is on the level of the old hashira but not the new hashira, however he is close to the power of the new hashira however.
He’s literally there lmao. The next time we see him fight which is canonically literally a few hours from now, he’s stated to be hashira level
Unfortunate Kanao never got any real screentime beyond S1.
[deleted]
for real
[deleted]
Actually stronger than most Hashiras except for maybe 3 😂
Tanjiro has been at Hashira level since he got the Demon Slayer Mark at the end of the Entertainmnmt District arc.
I'd actually put him above Tengen and Shinobu. But the rest? Nah.
Modern day Hashira Training would just force a slayer to watch/play hours of high level Geometry Dash to train the eyes (or fucking kill them)
From what I saw from him beheading Hentengu, when he was in multiple forms, I belive he could take out Daki and Gyotaru alone.
In the current episode 7 he is close to hashira level. Its only a after unlocks you know what that he is considered hashira by giyu
>!With the STW he's second only to Gyomei, dude. He blitzes and beheads Akaza with a single strike, lmao. He's properly Hashira level right now, and only grows throughout the final arc.!<
Tanjiro had potential to be a hashira but he didn't physically match the qualifications until he finished hashira training. All the other times he killed upper moons he did it with the help of other hashiras holding off the most powerful attacks
He’s literally on their level lmao. The next time he fights he’s stated to be hashira level
Stronger than all hashira except for maybe 3
For all my fellow dragon Ball fans, remember Krillin was able to watch Goku fight cell.  Doesn't mean he's on their level.
He’s literally hashira level. He would definitely be able to keep up with them. As giyu states in their next fight that he is hashira level.
He’s literally on par with the current hashira as stated by giyu 2 hours from this point in the anime. Before he gets any buffs.
Actually stronger than everyone except for maybe 3
Hashira* stupid autocorrect
This exactly the most accurate scaling of tanjiro
By eos he’s the strongest slayer in his generation lmao here he is base line hashira level
13th form tanjiro is above gyomei easily. He was able to be relative to chapter 192 muzan the same muzan who blitzed gyomei who had help from 6 other slayers.
Muichiro and Mitsuri above Rengoku? lmao 🤣
On what planet is Mitsuri above Rengoku? lmao
No by hashira training arc he IS hashira level. Stated by giyu canonically 2 hours from this point in the anime.
Preach bro. Respect our boy Rengoku. All the Akaza fanboys wrongfully downvoting you.
He’s literally as strong as the new hashira 💀 in his next fight he’s stated to be hashira level in base.
Tanjiro has opportunities to show his strength more than anyone, but I think there's an argument to be made for a few of the other non-Hashira slayers being just as strong. In fact, one of them is >!outright stated to be stronger than one of their masters (Kanao)!<. But this is an anime thread, right?
Tanjiro has the shounen MC buff where he gets stronger every second.

Hours by shounen standards is like years worth of effort.

All jokes aside I do believe that he does improve between now and then, even if slightly.
[deleted]
What chapter was this stated in? It’s been a year since I’ve read the manga so I forget
[deleted]
Just wait till next season (⁠｡⁠•̀⁠ᴗ⁠-⁠)⁠✧
Very possible
https://preview.redd.it/i8zf9b541c9d1.jpeg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3da5f7d610170c1f404a044e4aacdd1223da41aa
rn? no but EOS yes
He's stronger than Obanai, Muichiro and Mitsuri?

Edit: Why am I getting downvoted lol?
Nah, Tanjiro would have died multiple times without Tengen. Tengen was literally hampered by Tanjiro because he kept trying to save him and the others. I think the training arc is when Tanjiro actually reaches a Hashira level but he isn’t stronger than any of the current Hashira because they are the best generation since Yoriichi.
Gyutaro was the cause of uzui’s injuries. Daki was hella useless
If Tengen stayed in business long enough to be marked, he’d be one of the top Hashira. Tanjiro is still under prime Tengen.
is he really stronger than them
Bro got downvoted for saying Infinity castle tanjiro is above tengen and Shinobu?


Thats... not even a hot take.
part of the training for them would be to beat ton 618 daily
Not a chance did you forget about Gyotaru's poison?
No he’s hashira level now lmao. In his next fight he is stated to be hashira level in base before he unlocks any buffs 💀
What this guy said. Tanjiro was literally stated to be hashira level in base by giyu. He’s already hashira level now
>!to be fair, he didn't speedblitz akaza. Akaza was just caught off guard by the fact Tanjiro didn't have a fighting spirit.!<

I agree on the rest of what you said tho.
Tanjiro can only follow their movements while marked, when Giyuu and Sanemi were sparring unmarked. They're not on the same level.
When is this directly stated. Hes on their level when he unlocks 2 power ups.
Nah. He loses to all of them atm. in anime.
Yeah, later. But not at this moment. 🦋
He isn't
This is just based on what i remember. Its been a few years since i've read the manga and i've been sticking to the anime more recently. Thank you though.
Yes. Though Mitsuri is interchangable with Rengoku. He put up a good fight but didn't have enough screentime or manga panels to put him any higher. Both Mitsuri and Muichiro put up with and defeated upper moons, while the strongest Rengoku has defeated was previous lower moon 2. No disrespect to him but I can't rank him any higher.
On the KnY universe the Mark is a huge buff, anyone without it gets overpowered
So you are telling me he could beat any of the hashira in a fight as he is currently.
All of the squad is hashira level by now, zenitsu and inosuke barely reaching the level and tanjiro about mid hashira level
The >!Kanao!< thing might be in terms of physical strength, with Shinobu being notably weak in that regard but still more skilled and fast. Still, it’s a good point.
it's mainly cause the current hashira are the best since the original but he's normal hashira level at this point
Which is irrelevant as his mark is now permanent.
Chapter 147
No?🤦🏽 tanjiro was stated to be hashira level while he is in base before any buffs he gets in his next fight lmao. Literally at the start of the fight.
[deleted]
Also Right now. The finale of the show literally takes place over the course of 1 night.
Yep. Stronger than everyone expect gyomei ,Sanemi and maybe gyu.
Are you arguing Tengen is better than Rengoku, Gyomei, Muichiro, Giyuu, and Sanemi? Three of those being ones he even admitted inferiority to? Is he also superior to Yoriichi?
I mean, Mitsuri lasted longer against Upper 4 solo than Tengen lasted against Gyutaro solo (I'll get back to being marked). Muichiro lacked the cutting power but could reach Gyokko unmarked. Tengen himself admits to being inferior to Rengoku, Muichiro and Gyomei. If all breathing styles are inferior derivatives of sun breathing then derivatives of the 5 styles are themselves further degradations as they are even further removed from sun breathing. 

Marked Tanjiro in Season 2 is able to behead Gyutaro. He further succeeds in beheading Hantengu in season 3. Again, marked. Muichiro, as we have established with him reaching Gyokko, is unable to react to the fan attack. But Hinokami Kagura is fast enough to outpace the reactions of 3 emotions. And this is Season 3, not Season 4. Now, Mitsuri with the mark fails against Zohakuten. But Muichiro succeeds against Gyokko. Assuming that the mark is an even powerup scale for all demon slayers and factoring in inate talent based on the fact of how fast Muichiro achieved hashira status, we can reasonably assume Muichiro is stronger than Mitsuri. Yes, Gyokko is a weaker upper moon, but Muichiro was also nerfed by poison. 

Now, Shinobu is the weakest hashira, as she cannot behead a demon. So we can reasonably assume that Muichiro > Mitsuri > Shinobu. Now, it's been stated that Gyomei is the top of the top. So now it's Gyomei > Muichiro > Mitsuri > Shinobu. 

Tengen admits he is inferior to Muichiro, Rengoku and Gyomei. So Gyomei > Muichiro > Tengen. Now, where does Rengoku, Sanemi, Obanai, and Giyuu fit? Sanemi and Giyuu are able to match pace with each other and break each other's swords simultaneously. This suggests a rough parity. So Sanemi ≈ Giyuu. Now, Muichiro is able to maintain pace with Obanai and Sanemi. We ultimately don't know the outcome of this fight though. But Muichiro doesn't have a mark in the fight, so this at least suggests that if Muichiro is keeping pace with both, then marked Muichiro is greater than unmarked Obanai and Sanemi. 

Now, back to Tengen. With his musical score technique, he is able to keep pace with Gyutaro, but as stated by Tanjiro, he will lose out before Gyutaro does. This means Gyutaro > Tengen. Especially if you factor in Daki which would probably be able to compensate for having both hands. Now, Gyutaro is weaker than Gyokko and Hantengu. So obviously Tengen would lose against those. 

Now, we know Rengoku and Giyuu are stronger than Shinobu. Because she is the weakest. If Sanemi is roughly equal to Giyuu, then Sanemi is roughly equal to Rengoku. So Sanemi ≈ Giyu ≈ Rengoku > Tengen. Therefore Tengen is undeniably weaker than Gyomei, Rengoku, Muichiro, Sanemi, and Giyuu. He is stronger than Shinobu. In that gap we have Mitsuri, Obanai, and Tengen. This seems to further verify that the closer to sun breathing the stronger you are. 

Now we have to finally get a little more speculative. Mitsuri before her mark appears is able to cut the dragons to pieces. Tanjiro fails this with the mark. So we can assume the dragons are stronger than Gyutaro's neck. (Tanjiro cut a boulder in season one, thickness isn't an issue) 

So unmarked Mitsuri is stronger than S3 marked Tanjiro. Therefore, all Hashira above that are definitely above S3 marked Tanjiro. Tengen loses solo to Gyutaro. Mitsuri loses solo to Zohakuten even with mark. So Hantengu is def stronger than Gyutaro. Muichiro is stronger than Tengen and Mitsuri, as established. Muichiro could not beat Gyokko unmarked. So unmarked Tengen cannot defeat Gyokko and therefore Tengen could not beat Hantengu. Mitsuri unmarked cannot defeat Gyokko because the stronger Muichiro can't. 

Flame and Water have always produced hashira, so derivatives should also be superior over derivatives of the others. To boot, Mitsuri without any training is above sumo wrestler tier. Tengen's strength is from training. Based on this, there's enough evidence to suggest Mitsuri edges out over Tengen. Not enough to certify, but it's safe to make the assumption. So now, as things stand he can only be stronger than Shinobu and Obanai. Obanai has far too little to go on, but unmarked pre-Gyomei and Sanemi sessions, Tanjiro could cut his haori. So it's safe to assume he can at least put steel on target with Obanai, even if not lethally. Which means he definitely can beat Shinobu. This puts Tanjiro above at least two hashira. At that point, I am willing to bet on Tanjiro beating Tengen cuz he can keep pace with one hand Tengen without a mark. So with a mark he def can probably beat one hand Tengen but now he he can follow the movements of superior Hashira. Therefore, why I claim as I do.
Tengen got a le ebic and badass final fight so he's totally Yoriichi reincarnated guys. 

Seriously. Tengen's my favorite character. But I ain't gonna bet money on the losing horse in a race.
Bruh have you read the manga. He is stated to be hashira after the buff
>!Actually, he *did* blitz Akaza. Akaza did notice that Tanjiro didn't have any fighting spirit, but he immediately admits that not only should he have been able to fight without his Compass active, but Tanjiro greatly surpassed his speed anyway. Don't forget that Tanjiro called out to Akaza before he struck. Akaza wasn't offguard; he had time to react. He was just too slow to keep up with Tanjiro there.!<
Okay? That’s them specifically marked lmao. It still don’t take away from the fact that he is now hashira level as his mark is permanent.
No💀 he’s literally stated to be hashira level by giyu in chapter 147 in base before he gets any buffs 💀
Nope. His next fight is gonna prove that. I don’t want to spoil so I won’t say anymore
Yes at this moment as “later” is literally two hours from this point in the anime where giyu states that tanjiro is hashira level as he is now.
Gyokko was embarrassingly weak for an upper moon. A marked Mitsuri was literally almost killed by one of upper 4's clones. Her best feat is a literal 3v1 battle against a newly promoted upper 4. You're severely downplaying Rengoku who should be roughly on par with Giyu, but I respect your opinion.

I just realized this, but you placed Giyu several spots above end of Infinity Castle Tanjiro? 🤔 From what I've read, Tanjiro faired a lot better in that fight compared to Giyu. Might have to switch them around there.
Beating any of the current hashiras have nothing to do if he’s on their level lmao. and he can certainly beat Tengen and rengoku at this point.
I think in any other generation the squad would be Hashira level, but this generation's hashira just keep training and getting stronger.

Like Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke are insane, but you wouldn't confidently put them up against more than one or two of the Hashira, just because they keep getting stronger too.
[deleted]
Thank you!
Relax dude. You’ve been in this thread for 2 hours leaving a comment every 5 minutes bc people happen to disagree with you. Give it a break.
[deleted]
Can we stop fucking spoiling shit like this without a tag please?
did u forget when he got selfless state, something not even gyomei did in the manga or transparent world? he’s definitely not as strong as the current hashiras as of now
[removed]
He likely was above all those, barring Gyomei and Sanemj back when he was active. He's the second longest serving pillar in the generation. He's arguably less talented than them all, by his own (unreliable) admission but nothing in the story suggests he's below the others besides his own self doubt, something Giyuu struggled with as well.
“One of the top” doesn’t mean top Hashira, did your eyes deceive you? 

Fact is, experience-wise he’s superior to Giyuu, Sanemi and Rengoku as he was a Hashira before them. During his entire life, not a single demon survived more than a hit from him, until Gyutaro. Not to mention that he’s trained beyond conventional swordsmanship. At their base, before everyone started to get their marks and went through Hashira training, Tengen is probably one of the toughest Hashira. But obviously he got power crepped in the next arcs because of the marks. 

Gyomei is obviously stronger than anyone, Muichiro is a top prodigy and Rengoku has a brightness that he cannot replicate in the face of death. Acknowledging someone because of their talents doesn’t have to necessarily bring stupid “power levels” shenanigans to it. My statement does not imply any of the things you said don’t be dense.
I don't think tengen said he is weaker than muichiro, what he said was there are some who picks up sword and become hashira in two months. Means muichiro has more talent then tenger, not that he is stronger compared to himself
Did YOU read it?💀 he’s literally stated to be hashira level literally before akaza even activated his compass at the start of the fight 💀 you cannot be serious lmfao reading the manga correctly is not hard 💀
>!It seems more like akaza was too shocked to react. He even had a whole inner monolog about how it was impossible for someone to not have a fighting spirit.!<

>!Plus: The whole problem with scaling Akaza is that his combat speed and reaction speed increase when using compass needle. EVEN IF tanjiro did blitz Akaza this way, it wouldn't be close to blitzing Akaza at full power. It just seems pretty misleading to say that Akaza got blitzed here.!<
Sanemi and Giyuu weren't marked though. Their marks manifest on their faces and they didn't have them.

Tanjiro can only match an unmarked hashira when he himself is marked, and that's a significant boost. Once the hashira get their marks Tanjiro will be left in the dust again. So no, Tanjiro is not hashira level.
Hashira level could mean rengoku.
A fight with a demon of that caliber is going to rapidly raise his ability level during combat. He’s not at that level at this moment. He improves at multiple points during the actual battle. 🦋
I know Tanjiro fared better, but Giyu was putting in work we haven't really seen from him, not to mention he was far enough in to earn his mark. I thank you for respecting my opinion and I will continue to work on my scaling.
That is because one is dead and the other is retired, has only one arm and only one eye. As they were before they died/injured then I'd say tanjiro would be able to give them a decent fight but lose.

Tanjiro is old hashira level, he is close to being current hashira level at least in my opinion.
You wouldn’t put more than one or two hashira up against another hashira either lmao. Tanjiro is hashira level stated by giyu. The others well you can say whatever you want based off their next fights.
A lot of them are still young too. As they age they’d become stronger naturally. That’s why I feel it was such a shame to lost the flame one so early. He’d have been such a badass.
My guy after the boulder training he made his mark permanent 💀 show me a time where his mark deactivates again lmao. He is literally having a casual conversation with gyomei with it activated or is your attention span that horrendous?🤷🏽‍♂️ was literally the entire point of tanjiros training 💀 you thought you ate huh
ayo??
So that to yourself. You didn’t even watch the episode properly to make dumb claims like that lol.


Now get trolled.
Not my fault people want to reply to me saying stuff that’s incorrect 🤷🏽‍♂️
Which is irrelevant again because his mark is permanent now 💀
Eben gyu says so
I know right? Tanjiro has grown substantially, but people are really trying to compare an actual death match vs a sparring match between friends/allies. lmao
>During his entire life, not a single demon survived more than a hit from him, until Gyutaro

Where was this stated?
And Miyamoto Musashi isn't very much effective against an M1A2 SEP v3. Sure, he is definitely more experienced than some good ol boys from Oklahoma and Kansas who are too young to even get a beer. The fact is, without marks, almost any hashira is going to get their ass railed 7 ways to sunday by an upper moon. Toughest hashira? Did he nearly behead Upper 3 while getting a deep fisting through the solar plexus? Listen, Tengen is my favorite character in Demon Slayer. I love his personality, his arc, the fact he gets a happy ending, his appearance is great, his fights are exquisite.

But I am not going to pretend that he is in the realm of the ultra greats. It's fine if he isn't the greatest thing since Yoriichi. It's fine if he can blitz Kokushibo no diff. 

The Tengen hyperwank is perhaps the worst side effect of the Entertainment District arc because now people think Tengen and Gyutaro miles eclipse Muichiro, Mitsuri, Gyokko and Hantengu all because Gyutaro and Tengen got better serviced in their story and action. The 5 main forms are inferior to sun breathing. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the derivatives of THOSE forms are further inferior. 

Inosuke never compares to Tanjiro or Zenitsu. Does that mean he is a bad character? No. But it is a testament to the fact that the further removed from sun breathing you go, the inferior the breathing gets. 

Again, experience doesn't mean shit if you don't have the oomph to back it up. Look at Muichiro. He got beat by Gyokko. Did he learn sun breathing in his flashback? A new skill? No. He came back and killed Gyokko because he was stronger. Experience matters, but it's not the end all be all. 

Mike Tyson can't stop a bullet train.
spoiler bro
Bruh I just searched it up. It was during/after the fight giyu mentions that tanjiro is hashira level. I am not going to sit here and arguee with you when I know am right. He is as of now not hashira level. But soon will be
>!Again, Akaza directly states that he should've been able to react even without his Compass Needle active, and he also admits that Tanjiro surpassed his speed. Akaza had a heads-up warning from Tanjiro. He was just too slow to react.!<

  
>!I'm also not sure Akaza's Compass Needle buffs his actual stats in any way. All it does, AFAIK, is let him track an opponent's bloodlust. This gives him several benefits, like being able to predict/sense where an opponent is going to strike, being able to easily perceive an opponent's presence (even if they're trying to sneak up on you), and - according to Tanjiro - it allows Akaza's attacks to accurately track and seemingly cling to his opponent's vitals. Unless I'm forgetting something, nothing about Akaza's BDA is stated or implied to actually amplify his physical stats depending on his opponent's battle spirit.!<
It would be tho lmao tanjiro blitzed him plain and simple, he stated himself that tanjiro surpassed his speed. His bda only allows him to keep up with people in his realm of speed otherwise he would just be faster than anyone including people like yorrichi lmao. Tanjiro blitzed him, he was not off guard at all tanjiro literally called out to him and let him attack lmao.
And that’s relevant how? And no he won’t tf 💀 tanjiro is not getting left in the dust as he literally surpasses all of them with another buff 💀
Yeah..rengoku is hashira level. Your point?
lmao what?
He’s literally stated to be hashira level at the start of the fight before he gets any power ups lmao. In chapter 147 before akaza even activates his compass. Giyu is talking about his base power which would be the same here as that fight and that moment is literally like 2 hours away 💀 getting the two major power ups that he gets in that fight is not what makes him hashira level. He was hashira level before that.
He is not 💀 he is literally stated by giyu to be hashira level in base lmfao. He’s not losing to a Tengen who’s missing an arm or a prime tengen. His performance vs akaza before he gets his buff shows that 🤦🏽
That's true, just saying he's on the lower end of Hashira because the others keep getting proportionally stronger too. Like I'm pretty sure Tanjiro can beat Shinobu, but every other active Hashira had a lot to teach Tanjiro still.
Rengoku? Yeah we can see the level his dad reached, the strongest Hashira of his time and I would say Rengoku had the ability to surpass him due to his dedication and desire to be stronger. If he hadn’t been tired from Lower moon one he would have survived Akaza long enough for the sun to come out.
[deleted]
1. giyuu said he has the skill of a pillar, yet once akaza showed respect (using full power) he didn’t do much until he unlocked selfless state (the perfect counter to compass) 2. shinobu said it takes 2-3 hashira to take down a UM so everything they say is not 100%
https://preview.redd.it/i2k285d2cc9d1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc5d3c4b9b0d1dfb7ed46691ce44291684330aae

Chapter 147, literally the next panel after Tanjiro dodges and counters the first 2 attacks from Akaza.
But here since you apparently can’t read. The fight begins in chapter 147 and after tanjiro dodges and counters akazas attacks. Oh? What’s this!?😱 giyu says “it would not be an underestimate to say that your power is equal to that of a hashira, you’re able to fight with upper moon3” like 💀 you can’t be serious lmao
Akaza's abilities are pretty weird in all honesty. I don't think the author even thought it through. 

>!the ability to predict attacks and sense where someone is, by definition, an increase to reaction speed and overall combat speed since Akaza can sense it faster. We see this clearly when Akaza gets blitzed by Giyu and then immediately uses compass needle and magically becomes able to keep up.!<

>!It's also not exactly "bloodlust that Akaza senses. Since he claims that he can sense fighting spirit from newborn babies. It seems to be described more as the will to survive/fight rather than the will to harm Akaza!< 

>!the author added a stupid part of lore: Akaza somehow fought against Kokushibo and put up a decent enough fight that Kokushibo kept him alive after the blood battle. The only way this makes sense is if you consider that Akaza's reaction speed would increase to prevent him from getting blitzed.!<
You kinda ignored the whole point of why Akaza was caught off guard. 

He was surprised by the lack of fighting spirit from tanjiro. Tanjiro calling out wouldn't matter because Akaza was still comprehending how someone could have no fighting spirit. 

The anime seems to do a better job at interpreting things like this. We will have to see it animated to be certain, I guess. 

He probably can't activate compass needle fast enough to react to Yoriichi, but the author implies that Akaza used compass needle to react somewhat to Kokushibo during their blood battle.
Yes, another buff. If Tanjiro can only match the hashira with more buffs than they have, then he's not on the same level as them.
Hashira level means nothing. It does not mean hes comparable to giyu or sanemi. Let alone the big man himself. Not at this point. Hes on gyomeis level during the final fight. A tad higher maybe due to selfless but transparent world makes selfless kind of null and void.
rengoku was a hashira. tengen is a former hashira. shinobu is a hashira. gyomei is a hashira but so is mitsuri. being hashira level is like comparing daki to kokushibo. well both are upperranks right?
Last time I checked, that hasn't been animated yet so your point is mute. Based on what has been shown in the anime he isn't hashira level yet, close but not there yet.

You should not be using a version of tanjiro that hasn't been animated yet. We are talking about the anime, specifically the hashira training arc, not the infinity castle arc. Using feats from the next arc doesn't count.
Since each Hashira has a completely different style of fighting, of course they had a lot to teach Tanjiro.

I would have loved if they had flipped the entire script nad we got an arc of Tanjiro teaching them Solar Breathing technics
Being tired or not is not changing what happened to rengoku lmao. The only way rengoku is surviving against akaza is if akaza wants him to.
It’s not an opinion when it’s directly stated in the manga by a hashira themselves. He’s hashira level point blank. If someone wants to respond to me with their reasoning as to why not which the reasonings they use are also incorrect then I’m just gonna correct them🤷🏽‍♂️ and most of the time it’s manga readers I’m having to correct which is sad.
Yeah you just debunked yourself lmao. Tanjiro is literally hashira level at this point in time. Before he made his mark permanent he was able to keep up with Tengen and more importantly a serious fist fight between sanemi. after he made his mark permanent he is stated to be hashira level by giyu. How well he does against akaza is literally irrelevant as the same would happen to giyu as we see lmao. Otherwise how tf you gonna explain tanjiro going from (in your own words) <hashira to >akaza over the course of one fight 💀
Love this guy, common sense is a rarity in this fandom it seems, that and reading skills
spoiler
Be humble sit down![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
My guy you are trying to slob on akazas meat way to hard rn, akaza himself stated tanjiro surpassed his speed fair and square. And the manga made sure to go out of its way to show you that tanjiro beat akaza head on without using a surprise attack. Tanjiro is faster bruh plain and simple. Just because akaza is surprised he don’t have a battle spirit don’t mean he didn’t literally still get the chance to react, ready himself and still attack. Akaza was literally focused and waiting for tanjiro to come and was still blitzed.
No I didn’t say match them 💀 he surpasses most of them lmao. Marked tanjiro is mid hashira level. Stw is high hashira and 13th form is the strongest slayer in the current generation
My guy that’s irrelevant 💀 not what we are talking about lmao
Brother, then why are you arguing Tanjiro is not hashira level? You just proved it yourself.
Um last time I check that point in the manga is literally like 2 hours away canonically from this point in the anime and tanjiro didn’t get any buffs since then so he’s at the same power level he’s at now as he was in that point in the manga so my point stands 💀
Bros justification for his argument is bc of a statement from the future. No self awareness.
Hashira have no reason to learn Sun breathing though. They're min-maxed into their own respective styles. Meanwhile Tanjiro can't really learn Sun Breathing, so he's practicing to raise his overall profile.
Rengoku needed another few minutes of survival. He was absolutely tired from saving the people inside the train, and Enmu was still pretty tough, rank 7 of the demons of his time and his use of hostages was clever. Of course had Akaza gone full beast mode Rengoku was dead for sure, but Akaza wanted to give him a chance, and I think Rengoku would have survived if he had been fresh, survived just long enough for the sun to come up and Akaza to run away.
[deleted]
except we saw the difference between tanjiro and tengen. one struggled with daki and one curb stomp her. massive difference. and how? shinobu already said it. battles are worth so much more than training. after his mark (roughly rn), he’s old hashira level. akaza fight, he is low current hashira level aka shinobu (lacks strength) tengen (lacks skill/versatile) and mitsuri (lack speed) level. muzan fight, he became top 4 with obanai.
You are the one who needs to sit down:

Chapter 147 -> https://imgur.com/a/3tfFZDW

Akaza literally arrives chapter 146. Stop lying to yourself, and take the L.
Lmao you got nothing to say so you say that?💀 it’s okay to admit your wrong even tho idk how it’s that hard to miss that blatant statement at the start of the fight but whatever 🤷🏽‍♂️
Dont know where does dumbs like you come from.


He is already hashira level. And after that buff he surpassed every other hashiras. As none of the hashiras could master that skill apart from tanjiro.
Marked Tanjiro can only match an unmarked hashira. Then Tanjiro gets selfless state and masters the most op breathing technique and gets on the level of a marked hashira. And no, he doesn't surpass the hashira, he was doing better than them against Muzan when Muzan was starting to get significantly weaker from the aging drug.

If Tanjiro needs op techniques and op boosts to do as well as the hashira did without those, then he is not on their level.
I wonder what's how well Tanjiro can fight against Giyu now with water style? He's Tanjiro will lose if he only uses water style, but I'm curious how long can he keep up before getting overwhelmed since Giyu mastered it to a higher degree
https://preview.redd.it/htabogcafc9d1.jpeg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6589e88c387b596a66de3fe28c7fab5dfbbf2c7d
My guy tanjiro literally stomped her aswell when he was mad and that’s irrelevant as that’s literally season 2 tanjiro? 💀 and it’s funny how you say what I’ve been saying this whole time is that tanjiro is hashira level in the akaza fight in base. Which would mean he’s hashira level now as he literally fights akaza 2 hours from this point canonically lmao.
Um no the only marked hashiras stronger than marked tanjiro is sanemi and gyomei. And he never mastered sun breathing lmfao he just began the first step in mastering it. Also he very easily surpasses them lmfao. He 1v1 the same muzan who blitzed a massively amped gyomei and 6 others and tanjiro arrived to fight him seconds after so he was hardly any weaker before you say “muzan was so weak blah blah” no lmao they explicitly state he gets weaker slowly. That it chips off bit by bit. And proven by the crows who give the time tanjiro was relative to that same muzan. Infact it would be a muzan who’s even faster due to tanjiro being alone AND tanjiro being way more debuffed by the hashira lmao poisoned longer. Can’t use stw due to stamina and he already had low stamina.  A healthy tanjiro would be massively stronger. He definitely slams we can break this fight down bit by bit if you want.
Gundam Wing on a CRT
One of the best OPs ever
Now this is some nostalgia and a half
lol The lyrics of this opening are so aggressively sexual for a show in which the most erotic thing we see is two people facing away from each other tapping their sword scabbards together in an empty nightclub.

Though, to be fair, that was pretty erotic
Ah the start of my love for Gundam. Epyon my beloved.
YO CHECK ME OUT!!
Hey look it's the 90s when I was happy!

If you can do the same post twice I can do the same comment.

Also Renoa might be insane but shes def into some hardcore dom/sub shit.
Just as god intended. Amen!
I half expect Heero to pop up and stare at the TV set, VERY seriously, before cracking up madly. 

Just Wild Beat!!
This series goes so hard.
I didn’t pick it up on your first video with 0083 but here yeah, the way CRTs emit way, way, way more light than even HDR screens do. Wing looks more vivid than I remember, and you can see from the first opening “hangar” shots of Wing Gundam vs the shots at the end of the opener when it’s fighting Talgeese the animators really understood this, wing is washed in brilliant sunlight etc.
JUST WILD BEAT COMMUNICATION!
Still gets me every time I hear the intro and the art style. Man what a time

It’s amazing we all share this connection for Wing!
we are getting old
Watching old ass shows on old ass tech is honestly a great vibe
I just re-watched all the episodes. Gundam Wing was the first anime I watched on Toonami back in the day.
It was a crime when Toonami skipped the openings. I only learned about the songs until very late in the series when they happened within the show.
> Gundam Wing on a CRT

You mean, Gundam Wing (as it was originally shown to us millennials 🥲)
That warm fuzzy glow.
This is the first time I noticed costume design was by Yutaka Izubuchi. What can't that man do.
Woah… suddenly I’m feeling some serious *Rhythm Emotion*
I love Wing, it's literally my favorite Gundam anime.
Still my favorite mech anime🔥💪🏼💚
For the true hi end Japanese experience you need laser discs on a CRT XD
Now THAT'S A TELEVISION SET!!!!
So fire
Fucking hell. 
Video can be remastered and the audio enhanced, but you just can't top the original version.


I need to get a CRT just to view my library.
We can't go back. :(
That looks amazing, just how I remember it in middle school. This and DBZ was why I never cared about after school dances.
*deep memories*
As it was meant to be.
The nostalgia is too much, where my love of Gundam officially started as a kid 🔥
This feels right modern tvs just isn't the same
The Red White and Yellow is a nice touch.
JUST WILD BEAT COMMUNICATION
Oh wow. Flood of nostalgia, happiness and expectation. I’m gonna have to call my dad and ask if he’d like to watch this with me like old times. :)
at my grandpa's place i think still has a big crt there(weirdly i played the ps2 mostly on that clunker
Great fucking time so I tried getting a real copy sold everywhere.  So got myself a guide recorded of toonami Endless Waltz .r.i.p. to Tom since I haven't heard from him
Just Communication is indeed a classic!
modern squeal frame rich simplistic books test squeeze bike shocking

Thank you for this, brought back so many memories :)
The CRT screech is so bad.
Ah.. the good ole days.
man that nostalgia hits real good
I can even be the tube whine or whatever
iconic intro
I grew up watching Wing this brought back memories for sure
MY NOSTALGIA
This hit real good as a kid. Good times.
Anime on a CRT is just fantastic
Dopamine with a side of radiation 👌
Peak nostalgia.
Two Mix on CRT just feels right
OMG this is my kindergarten stuff + Sailormoon 😍😆
Undoubtedly. Especially when it starts playing once Quatre realizes what he has to do when 1st meeting Trowa & mobile suit recognizing somewhere their mission aligns due to having similar machines: Just communicate.

Please keep doing these definitely lots of nostalgia. I re-watched the entire thing with a fellow fan of mine not long ago. It was enjoyable.
Exactly how I remember watching it.
![gif](giphy|it6W8D4FfvaPC)
Best Gundam series of all time!
Thank you my friend. This reminded me of memories I forgot I had. Gundam Wing might not be the best show but I'll never forget the fun I had with it
One of main things which got me into Gundam wing was the op and seeing it on a old CRT tv growing up
The SMILE on my face throughout that video. Thankyou, OP.
This really takes me back. Thank you for sharing this 💚
That's kinda cool I noticed a lot of people are fans of Gundam Wing on here.
    these are not tears, these are just rain
    these are not tears, these are just rain
Wow, that looks great
Why are the lyrics so horny lmao…
What _are_ those shivering fingertips wandering after………….?
OP1 slaps but OP2 has grown on me so much this year. I love them both.
This image has a nostalgia feeling behind it. Looks like what I watched in on in the early 2000s
The best thing I've seen for this day. Even though I'm a gen-z, Gundam wing was iconic during my childhood
*5 year old me doing the hand pose*
Ayo man use component svideo or rgb pls
Awesome! Now do a recording of Rhythm Emotion on a CRT!
Do y’all hear that?
Wow, that takes me back. Such nostalgia
New Mobile Report Gundam Wing
Just like Gogg intended.
As the good lord intended!
Ah… as god intended
The blending of hi-res graphics on a CRT's display creates a level of blending and focus that still looks so good.
JUST WILD BEAT COMMUNICATION
Nostalgic at best
Using simple media player I presume?
Looks awesome! Proof that newer isn't always better 

What's your set up.
My childhood has returned

None of that openly expressing emotions type stuff. Gotta look cool and secretly show you're a romantic at the same time. Subtly > obvious.
There is a lot of sword play in this anime. (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)
Milliardo's nickname itself is erotic.
I was really into transformers beast war as a 6-7 year old 1999-2000. One day I rented one of the transformers tape and the shop accidentally labeled their gundam wing ep 1 and 2 as transformers beast war. This very thing was my very first intro into anime if you don’t count astroboy. The best accident ever happened to me.
*War criminal you just met threatens to kill you when you invite him to your birthday party.*

*instantly fall in love.*
boo.
It's honestly fuckin terrible but the melodrama and over the top everything is amazing. It's an absurdist's dream.
Yeah, that why I prefer watching old anime on a CRT. Colors look a lot more vibrant, almost like seeing the cel paintings in person

This is my setup. Sylvania 24” CRT and a bunch of retro consoles. The PS2 is where I watch anime DVDs
I played the pants off of these games.
I don't think Noin could have expressed her emotions much more openly lol 

I feel like her cowboy outfit was purchased after Zechs mentioned offhand he likes Clint Eastwood movies and ol' Lucrezia hopped on down to Dandy Randy's Boot and Tassel Emporium that day
*TEARS INVITATION*

"KOROSU"
That’s pretty damn cool man lol.
When I was a teenager I wanted to be Heero Yui.
It fucking drags sometimes but the scene at the start of the series where Heero wiped away Relena’s tears and say “I’m going to kill you” is a top ten moment in anime history for me
As a kid it was fucking awesome lol
It becomes a lot better when You understand it that it's a Mexican telenovela.
Yeah, the nostalgia is what really hits. I regret doing a rewatch. But the manga is actually pretty good.
I tried rewatching it a few years ago and had to stop because of how often they reused animation while only changing the background to show they were in space/desert/snow etc. But goddamn are the memories I have of watching this as a kid god tier.
The Baki of Gundam
Woops sorry, assumed you were using that composite input lol. Looks good man.
One of the best fighters SNES/Super Famicon had to offer, alongside Killer Instinct, DBZ Hyper Dimension, Street Fighter II Turbo, MKII/UMK3 and [Godzilla’s Greatest Battles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBrz10qcdxo&t=1m14s) imo
You talking about when she was touching his sword at the bar?
Even as a kid I liked Duo more lol.
That's the shit I'm talking about. Irs so absurdly over the top. The entire show is an amazing example of "it's so bad its good". 
What's more covert? Quietly killing the girl who saw you and establishing a safehouse nobody knows about?
Enrolling in high school, being a big shot at everything and announcing to her that you're going to kill her? And they use their real names everywhere they go and always enroll in shit everywhere they go. 

And honestly the better seen is when relenza is like "I'd look better bathed in the blood of my enemies!" And tries to shoot a bitch like 5 minutes after becoming interested in political. That whole show is terrible paced in your face ideas turned to 11.
homicidal heero
When I was 13 it was the coolest shit ever.
I ever love edgylords lmfao
…but the Gundam designs were peak. 👌
Honestly, with the whole aesthetic of European 18th century nobility yeeted into the future, one would be forgiven if the entire plot of the show was the After Colony Century's version of War of The Worlds.

A plot so absurd it was sold out as a fantastic romantisation of war.
I rewatched it a couple years ago as an adult and my two biggest takeaways were “why tf are they making a little girl queen of earth? Are they on drugs” and OMG YESSSSS USE THE TRANSFORMATION SHOT AGAIN 😩
I was so shocked when I watched this scene. I don’t know why I thought mare was innocent😭.
I initially thought it was someone else that was controlling mare similar  to what happened with shalltear. But I was surprised to find out that, that wasn’t the case. 
I suppose it’s surprising because we see Mare’s POV so rarely. Maruyama mentioned he doesn’t like trying to do Mare’s POV because the kid’s a sociopath who is incapable of caring about anyone outside of Nazarick.
"I'm thinking, y'know, eight-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto, bunch of monsters, this time of night with quantum physics books? She about to start some shit."
This is Overlord. Nobody is innocent.
The cheering in s4 while he pumps himself for genocide, makes it even more clear.

"Burn, Smash, Kill!"
There's a reason Mare and Demiurge are such good friends.
I think Aura has a slight positive karma, while Mare is the evil twin
Mare is sort of a genius character from a Supreme Being’s standpoint when you think about it: He’s a timid, cross dressing elf boy that’s *perpetually* afraid of screwing up.

He puts his opponent into a false sense of security, that he’s going to be a pushover. And if he goes in for a physical attack (like the scene in question) it would be borderline laughable that an obvious magic user is trying to smack someone with a wooden stick instead of using magic.

Then…Well, in this case a harsh lesson was learned but for the other 99% of his opponents they don’t live long enough to realize their error in judgment.

I always liked characters that have that effect on their opponents.
Really? 'Innocent looking monster' is a stereotype older then most countries, and the whole guild was introduced as a group that decided that if they were going to be hunted and treated as monsters, then they will be the big evil final bosses.

Cute trap druid among a group like that? No shit they're going to be a monster that ends cities with a smile, that was blatantly obvious and damn near spelled out, the question is what 'flavor' of monster they were. The only surprise was they're the lazy uncaring kind, that just gets upset about the extra work survivors give him considering the usual 'evil druid' character tends to be all 'Muh nature! I'm gonna turn you humans to fertillizer! Rawr!'. Sort of a 'To whomever it may concern' kind of evil instead of direct cruelty like Demiurge or Shalltear.
What does he do?
Lol, you will see how innocent mare is in volume 14.
Having Hilma struck and dragged definitely caused some problems for me but thankfully it didn't last for more than 4 hours.
if you check their character sheet both he and aura are -100 on the karma scale, both being classed as neutral evil
Even the super lawful goodboi that is Sebas was perfectly willing to kill an innocent girl if his master orders it.

The only morals in Nazerick is Ainz

The only justice in Nazerick is Ainz

The only religion in Nazerick is Ainz
Mare is innocent in his own eyes. Human life is worthless to him in the fave of serving his master.

He doesn't get any pleasure from it, to him it's the same as asking a fly to politely leave the room, and when it doesn't, you have to force it to do as it's told. Though he doesn't resent humans, he just can't see them ever being close to equals as they were not made by a supreme being.
In a way he actually is quite innocent. Compared to characters like Demiurge who are absolute sadists, or Albedo whose actions are defined by their obsession, Mare is just doing what he's told, obeying the only people he values. Everyone outside of his field of vision are just strangers, outsiders.
Innocence can be cruel, think how kids can tear apart an ant, for Mare anyone outside of Nazarik is less than an ant, they are just stones if his beloved supreme being who stayed until the end with the tomb asks him to bring a stone he brings the stone, if the stone resist he brakes the stone´s legs and gets the stone on time to Nazarik
This scene was BRUTAL lmao OMG lol
Innocence and evil aren't mutually exclusive.

Haven't you ever heard that children are the most cruel?
Look he’s touching something gross ofcourse he’s innocent
Mare is quite unique in that he doesn't really view people outside Nazarick as people, and more like inanimate objects. He is quite asocial and this just reinforces that.

Let's say that Ainz tells you to hand him a rock on the ground, so he does so. And if said rock starts crying and yelling don't hurt me, well... It's still just a rock, right?
another day of Overlord fans still not realizing that ainz is the villain and the people who follow him would do *anything* for him
Yeah, in the LNs its a little more obvious. Aura and Mare arent just traps in their appearance but their personality aswell. When Aura is asked to do something excesively cruel or disgusting  she always tries to pawn it off onto mare who doesnt really mind watching someone get eaten alive by an army of maggots. The anime skips several scenes that are in the LN early on and only hints at or references a few that are in more detail later. I assume because of time constraints.
i think he's one of the most sadistic in all of Nazarick, he just covers it with innocence
Imagine my *utter surprise* in season three when I found out we were the baddies. It was like a truck hit me, and for the life of me, I couldn't fathom how I missed that part. 😂😂😂
She deserved it tbh.
I keep forgetting how shy he is in comparison to their sis
Mare is from the alignment of neutral chaotic, he may be seeing as cowardly and weak but still is a level 100 npc
Because she does look innocent. Thats the point
MARE IS INNOCENT AND DESERVES TO KILL A LITTLE! *justice for mare*
You should read the latest volume! It shows an even more brutal side of Mare!
99% of nazarick denizens see humans as we see insects, think how many times you've killed an ant it a fly? Does that make you crazy? I don't think so,

mare just went into a parasitic beehive to find the queen and broke off one of its wings so it couldn't put up a decent resistance to it's capture.

It doesn't sound as bad when you contextualise it
It’s overlord everyone is a bad person
Genocide innocently
Well, he very innocently broke her leg and dragged her by the hair I would say.
Mare seems so innocent. I feel like the anime doesn’t do a great job at showing mare’s point of view. Mare isn’t scared about preforming tasks but more on the hassle or potentially disappointing ainz. At least from what I’ve read in the lite novels. Mare is kind of a sociopath in the sense that he does t really care about how his actions affect others. Well at least affect anyone outside of the tomb.
The knee breaking is what really got me i dont do well with body horror so that hit hard. Not as hard as goblin slayer episode one but still.🤣😅
I don't know what you're talking about. He's the most innocent person in the great tomb of Nazaric.lol
I remember someone describes it as Mare can be kind but he doesn't see people outside of Nazarick as people or really even creatures, more like objects they have a really good quote "yeah it might scream but it's just a rock. Why does it matter that a rock screams?"
Nobody is innocent, and those who are somehow, are quickly "dealt with"
now i gotta continue the show
What about that time? He bludgeoned someone to death with his staff
Maruyama himself was afraid to write his POV.
Like all other guardians, Mare's actually nonchalant about killing to carry out Ainz's orders. I mean I was shocked at first but then remember they're all extremely dedicated to Ainz that it trumps having a conscience
To be fair he is still innocent, depending on your point of view. It's not that he's evil, he just doesn't give enough of a fuck about humans. To him doing that is no different than grabbing a doll by the hair, this doll just happens to be screaming but it's still just a doll.
Mare should've just caved in the humans skull why even keep her around honestly
mare is a demon lmao
Mare is definitely innocent look at those droopy ears you can’t get more innocent than that
OP wait until you find out what he did to her to make her so compliant
Did you miss the part where Mare participated in wiping out that one party of innocent adventurers so that they wouldn't witness Ainz confronting brainwashed Shalltear?
I would dare to say innocent, but we have to remember his (& all Nazarick) loyalty without questioning their orders from the Supreme!
Umm yeah, same.
Umm yeah, same.
Anything that is not created by the guild specially ainz is insignificant except for nigredo and pestonya when it comes to baby or kids.
She was innocent, looking at her face, she's frowning while hurting the poor lady.
Mare is diabolical 😈
Btw what’s the context for what’s happening in this scene?
Between the things the others do, yes he is innocent
overlord earth was a cyberpunk word, but even more corrupt, now imagine how much more twisted the npc would be…
Aninews put it best, As far as he and anyone in Nazarick cares. Ainz essentially told him to go pick up a bug or a pet rock, Who cares of that pet rock starts screaming in agony
What's that thing called when you see something for the first time then you start noticing it everywhere?? I just got book 5 and 6 today. Saw this image of mare in there. And here it is on the same day. We live in a simulation
Mare don't love these thots.
Mare is leaning towards evil on the alignment scale. And the inhabitants of Nazarick consider themselves as basically angels descending down to a lower plane of existence whenever they leave. The new world are lesser peons more akin to ants to them.
I mean... In season 1 he had Mare bash that adventurer's head in when he followed Momon to fight Shaltear
can i get the source of the img above?
can i get the source of the img above?
This is kinda difficult to explain. He simply lacks empathy which is common for neg 100 affinity NPC. Basically he is doing cruel stuff but to him, it's like a job. He's not scheming anything. He thinks of humans like ants not because he has some inflated ego but simply because that's just how one feels when seeing an insect. (like how we just kill insects we find annoying or harmful).

  
so basically a sociopath
Not everyone is fortunate enough to get dragged by Mare like this 😞.
He's a floor guardian. Do you expect him to ask the plunders to leave?
Do.....do I even WANT....to ask?!
I knew how Mare is when Aura commented that she has Mare take people to the prince of fear because that place is too much for her and Mare doesn't mind.
Аs far as i remember, Мare's settings are written in such a way that he looks like an emotionless monster trying to look human (but in fact he is very human, well at least in relation to the inhabitants of the tomb)
What anime is that?
You mean after him clubbing some adventurer to mosh this made you wonder?
Nobody associated with lord Ainz is innocent
Didn’t Mare straight up beat a man to death on Ainz’s command in season one? It’s fairly well established that he DNGAF about humans.

He won’t go out of his way to hurt people, but if Ainz gives him a job, he’ll do it no matter how many bodies he has to stack.
Rome wasn't built in a day, but neither his sociopath personality.
From where is this scene?
I love the illustration here cause it reminds me of that family guy scene where Stewie is scared of an album cover and his like “god why does he look sad, his already destroyed mankind”. Mare is literally giving that look here 😂
Mare is just shy

He will do what is asked of him, and he doesn't consider humans as too different than the rest of Nazarick
Mare is one of my favorite characters because what he does seems so out of place, but he's just trying to serve Ainz the best he can. He's never upset by what he's doing from a moral stand point, but more so from an efficiency stand point.
Why should you think so? It's clear since the start that they're all aligned to be evil, as their evil statistics range from -150 to -500 in YGGDRASIL. Have you not heard of Demiurge's little "farm"?
Mare is shy and decates y/o (76)... No one is pure and innocent at 76 y/o especially someone who grew up in the guild 

He's way older than me, he's childish appearance is just because elf's age way slowly...
Not a chance, you are talking about floor guardian in nazarick, and mare is like innocent or shy villain
I think the character makes sense and I don’t see them as a sociopath, they just never had the chance to interact and care for anyone outside Nazarick so it doesn’t even register as killing sentient beings. I don’t feel bad when I kill hundreds of background videogame npcs either.
There're a few parts if you read the webnovel, when Mare kills somebody, the unfortunate NPC sees Mare for who he is; someone merely pretending to be innocent. Their inner monologue describing Mare's face, as the last thing they see, as someone who holds disgust and hatred for them; the complete opposite of when they first behold Mare as this little sweet child (of course further compounded on with overwhelmingly devastating magic and physical strength). 

It happens right before he delivers a finishing blow- his façade breaks. He really can't stand these lower lifeforms.
They are all mass murderers.
A matter of perspective. Stuttering and nervous, but with no love for anyone outside nazarick. While not outright sadistic, he has no qualms about killing.
They're all evil bro. We root for the bad guys in the show/novel
It reminds me of a book I read, Mynoghra. They don't define evil as enjoying the suffering of others. It was a complete lack of care you had for another. If you got them something to eat or cut their head off, it was all the same emotion. 

We humans relate to his nervousness and because of that we emphasize with him. It reminds us of our own social anxieties or whatever else, but as an evil character his thoughts are just fundamental different from ours.
Same
I was laughing a bit too much when he was only in distress because he was running late.
Mare treats humans like humans treat animals. Because he sees them as animals.
Lmao, even Maru is afraid of Mare, wait till you read volume 16.
The character is a child...doesn't mean his programming/settings are. By rights, he should not be as powerful as he is ( Level 100, Disciple of Disaster). He just appears as a child.
People like to forget that Bukubukuchagama - his creator - was into gap moe.

https://the-dere-types.fandom.com/wiki/Other:Moe
he has neutral karma same with his sister aura. so both good and evil is the same to him
This is honestly one of my favorite scenes
She is the best.
They are innocent but human lives don’t matter to dark elves
She looks so disgusted 😂
He IS Truly innocent. But being innocent do Not mean good!! It depend on pov. In fact, this is why child soldier is a thing: they are not aware of the fact that what they do is bad!!!
I think what we most forgot is that this still a game. They're NPCs that's just doing their job. Also they're all serving under an undead overlord. The whole show seemed too compassionate towards humans until this recent season.  Especially since ainz himself said he felt none towards them.
If you like this you will like vol. 16.
I believe mare is the biggest psychopath in nazarick.
mare is best boy
Mare is a sweet cinnamon roll.

Just... you know... don't be a human around her.
Is this manga or show, cause spoiler
It was so hot
The name of the game is Gap-moe, to over simplify means that there is appeal to personality gaps, this covers everything from tomboys and crossdressers to slutty angels, mare is also an elven druid who typically are peace loving in fiction, yet...

It's not limited to personality but design as well, take Jinx from League and Arcane, tiny frame and giant guns
That's the same with pretty much everyone inside Nazarick besides those with extremely high positive karma.
He can care about people outside of Nazarick, long as they hail Ainz and Nazarick.    
    
Like Mare looks at the Lizardmen positively because they hold Ainz as a god like being and mentally approved of the efforts they went through with their somewhat primitive offerings to Ainz’s statue.    
    
Like he is a psychopath, but he does stop and think about things.
Now this is the real surprise for me cause I considered Mare evil but also caring about not killing people without good reason since he warned Climb to get away when he was about to cast earthquake but I guess that was only for Climb and anyone else not important for Ainz's plan would get squashed and he wouldn't even care.
The elf kingdom mare POV where we see his true color
That's fair
Those books are way to advanced for her
One of my favorite fan theories is that J only passed that portion of the test because he actually considered the different possibilities on what was happening.
What book is this from?
Would be more believable if that girl was Asian. Still not likely for an 8 years old but hey, I said more.
Hey! Climb is innocent and also I wish I was him.
Except my angel Victim. The goodest of boi
Oh there's plenty of innocents around; they just tend to not survive very long.
True isn’t Enri innocent or does she do fucked up shit later I’ve only watched the anime.
Oh come on he is so cute and innocent it's just so 🥰 🥰 essentially how the Hanzō do they're beat to cheer him on
Hmm, he would probably get along with Kharn.
Reminded me of Rick and Morty: “Oh boy, here I go killing again…”
God... Now I remember that god awful fanfic of them! Thanks!
nope. both -100 on the karma scale
They are both closer to neutral
Yeah though he most likely learned from Ainz when he was fighting with the Elf king, especially when he wanted to feed false information with his opponent whilst hiding his real strength on his magic, Ainz stacked them up with high tier scrolls, these scrolls  curtesy of Demiurge qnd the librarian was how he was able to bring the Elf king's MP to zero whilst saving on his own mana and magic spells and after he was defenceless with magic he showed him just how unmatched he was from the start (sweet dimensional slash etc), whilst in Mare's case helped weaken Zeshi without revealing his spells and specialty untill it was to late for her to evade a powerful attack, he even tried the "if you surrender I promised I won't kill you" method which was used by Ainz earlier 
He is also a  druid his strength might even surpass shaltea due to how heavy his stick actually is, it's one object ainz failed to physical pick up, granted he is a mage but he can pick up most of the gaurdians weapons and amor easily so I imagine someone who uses a weapon that heavy to almost the same efficiency as other gaurdians to have crazy strength, he was also supposed to be a tank in the team comprising of Ainz and mare so the stick might be used as a knock back item or to beat down any opponent wanting to intercept the distance between them since his specialty in magic is calamity magic so a significant amount of space is required
A stick to bonk with....
Does nobody remember that scene from Men in black where Will Smith only shots the white girl in the dark alley? Bro knew this stuff
A lot of Nazarick is what I’d considered Neutral Evil. They aren’t sadists who get off on every flayed nerve or schemers mentally torturing their enemies, but people without a proper moral compass willing to absolutely commit evil out of boredom or to accomplish a task. Because to them it’s just the normal thing to do, like taking out the trash or squishing a bug.
Yea but they are still innocent. To them it's just like insects or farm animals. They don't see the actions as wrong and more just following their parents. Caring for family
The kid was also trying to prove his worth. He’s essentially gotten first real big job on his own. He was really stressed out because he didn’t know if he could do everything “expected” of him. Meaning doing everything Aniz asked of him, doing everything Albino/Deirge order of him and doing everything only directly or indirectly implied by all of them. Then deal with everything even slightly involved in all of that. 

He was terrified of the disappointment and was a bit overwhelmed. Any kid of that age would be the same if they suddenly found themselves the personal (and wholesome) errand boy of Amazons board of directors.
Iirc he breaks her leg with his staff and drags to be "interrogated". The ladys part some criminal organisation
What the rest of Nazarick usually does
In the novels the woman describes it as “the feeling of her hair being torn from her scalp” after her straight break her leg at the knee. She then is tortured by our little cockroach friends of you remember them and what they do
He does what he's asked, swiftly and efficiently.

This usually involves maiming and murdering.
Can you explain?

I gave up reading Overlord at volume 10.
That karma scale had something to do with what kind of power they get? For example the princes is given the thing that make her some kind of powerful demon because of what she did. I’m watch the anime but not the novels
Where can you see their character sheets?
I'm loving this ant/stone analogy, ya nailed the explanation
And he’s in touch with his inner child
Makes it easier for them considering they take joy in everything they do😇 what a sweet bunch of people
Hes not a sadist, just completely numb and uncaring to anyone or anything outside of nazarick. Killing off entire kingdoms to him is like taking out the trash for us. Just another boring chore to do
Fair, I mean, in his shoes I’d have trouble not killing her and not because of the lvl difference 😂
For real, that in an interview or something? Was it he wasn’t sure how or was afraid of getting into the head space?
Because she was needed for Albedo's & Demiurge's plan.
Looks to be a direct picture from the light novel itself
No you want to read the chapters 😉 or watch the show
Didn’t that come later?
I think Sebastian is supposed to be good.
Well isn’t he like 70 yo too?
Nah, that'd be Demiurge.
At this point it’s like 5 years old for the show;  more for the books
Funnily enough, that's not quite true. Even Albedo and Demiurge can care about ppl outside of Nazarick, provided they believe they are worthy. Granted, only Princess Renner met that qualification but I was surprised when it was revealed they legitimately respected and liked her due to her god tier intellect and similar outlook.
I think the implication is that they are even worse than the others.
Well the main difference is demiurge finds them more like toys to be played with and broken babe is more along the lines of eradicating them like incests the rest think like one of the two or just kinda betrayal made now he just don’t care it’s like seeing a ant you won’t care if you step on it if you do you do you won’t go out your way to do so though
His task was: Level the city without leaving anyone but Renner and Climb alive. In the LN he was thinking about earthquakes and fires, wagering what'd happen. Conclusion: Some people might survive and hide. Those he'd just kill with the next spell. The most annoying thing were the people running around unpredictably in a panic. Dude has no remorse whatsoever.
He was specifically ordered not injure Climb. Remember the meeting where Demiurge assigned them their tasks,  and Shalltear got pissed because Demi left her out? "Ha, ha, pick on the Vampire why don't ya" because of her Blood Frenzy.
How is that a fan theory? It was exactly the kind of thinking they were looking for. He absolutely aced the tests.

It's like the fan theory that K actually did give J his strongest gun, it just was tiny. That thing was powerful as hell and kicked like a mule.
Is not a theory. It is confirmed in the official novelization of the movie that it is the reason why he passed the test.
That guy is t snarling he’s crying and that guy hang from the street pole? He’s just working out out I mean how would I feel if I’m in the gym minding my own business and someone just came in bust a car in my ass you know?
None, I just referenced Men in Black movie because some comments above said something about "Little girl in dark alley" horror trope
You can be him you just need a ladder
Until he satisfies the conditions for changing races...
Be honest. You wish you were him because you'd wanna be used by Renner.
😂
Haha farewell 👌 >!you would like to turn to reneers dog for eternity not to forget  a demon!<
He has exactly +1 karma, best boi
She is the reason Nphirea had to invent Viagra in that world with how feral she gets when they finally do it. 

So... She does fuck up... A lot
Iirc, Nferia had to make the Viagra because Beta was debuffing him while simultaneously buffing Enri.  Enri wants a lot to begin with, but the need for the special potions wasn't natural.
Puts a new meaning on "spirit squad"
If Ainz asked for blood we would hear the chanting "Blood for the blood god! Skulls for the skull throne!"
Is it haha funny awful.

Or awful awful
-100
Ah, my bad. Good catch.
Bro only did that because the little girl was holding a textbook way more advanced than a kid should have.
By that logic though, you can justify anyone as being innocent from their own point of view, regardless of how awful their actions objectively are from our point of view. Not trying to argue just kind of raises some interesting philosophy about whether “true” evil or “true” good are concepts that can ever be objective, since they are based on the point of view and morals of the person and society that decide those things, with no action being able to ever be wholly good or wholly bad.
Bro why butcher the names like that😭
Fair enough
Try to take over the world, Pinkie.
its been animated in the most recent season if you would rather watch instead. also i would advise you pick up the novels again. 12 and 13 are the peak of the series
it dose. there are some powers that can only be accessed by good or evil character. doesn't really affect mare though because his druidic magic isn't karma dependant
The light novels
The official drive folder
Google
The adventurer? Nope this was the leader of the party which wanted to go with Momon in the fight against the vampire.
The only one yeah
He's a sadist but Mare is genocidal
Game recognizes game, what else can we say?
You're forgetting that Lupis considers Enri an actual friend, and the whole Sebas arc in early season 1.
Don't forget >!CZ2128 Delta and Neia!<
Not really, Renner says they see her as a pawn at best.
Honestly they don't care at all the care they give to useful people outside of Nazarick is the same as you would give to a tool. even Sebas was going to kill Tuare without hesitation because Ainz ordered it.
Though after that stunt she definitely pulled and it totally wasn't just Ainz being a goof, I doubt Albedo is too fond of her, anymore.
She's a sadistic narcasist what are you talking about she literally was gonna let the whole village get destroyed by the giant of the East and the demon of the west,simply cause she wanted to see their terrified expressions and that she thought there weren't worth nazarrick attention and they would have been exterminated if Ainz didn't pick up on what she was thinking, at the end of season 3 episode 2, when Yuri Alpha came to pick her up to meet Ainz on that matter she said

I couldn't get other screen shorts because there is a limit to the amount I can post but she went on a sadistic rant about the villagers being killed right after everyone was celebrating Enri as the new leader till Yuri herself "complimented" her that she is an extreme sadist, Just because a denizen of nazarick finds you likable and seems like she wants to be your friend doesn't mean they consider you as such, it mostly mean they found you amusing enought to be fitting as their toy

Given that the only one who's genuinely innocent will be the Dog faced made, in the novel she and albedo's sister are the only ones who went behind Ainz back and rescued a child in the extermination of the Reisteize kingdom, after they were caught and put under watch in one of the cells on the fourth floor (decision was mostly made and enforced by Albedo) they still asked Sebas to call up on the master to try and negotiate a deal with him that will late some of the citizens of Re-estize kingdom to escape with mercy from nazarrick's forces, Ainz agreed to this knowing that her actions was because of her creator
It's a fan theory because it was never actually explained in the movies, and last I checked, it was never confirmed by anybody who worked on the movies themselves either.
I'll get ropes and those spiked toed climbing boots. (Pun absolutely intended)
You’ve just reminded me of the ladder guy from Dark Souls 2. His entire thing was that he would sell you a ladder so you could access hidden areas. It was so goofy and somehow normal in such a strange game.
I read this and nearly spit my drink everywhere 🙃 bitterly did 🙃 the pfft sound effect...
I feel like he's still getting used in the same way and then some. Standing by my initial statement.
Yes.
Well, duh?
Ah at least he got a happy ending I’m assuming same with climb
Interestingly I think that the other guardian that would fit khorne would be cocytus. Because khorne is also the god of courage and fair combat.  
Albedo and Shalltear are definitely slaaneshi. 
Demiurge may actually just be Tzeench. 
Sebas would be chaos undivided I feel like.
Awful "You wish you could pluck your eyes out" awful.

For clarity, it was a Demiurge x Mare fic where they had sex in the hot springs.
-100 is considered close to neutral
It was 3am and I was Fuuuuucked up
He brings her to Kumoko’s room to be eaten from the inside out repeatedly by cockroaches
they don't "try", they successfully do it
And where can I get these/it
Mare has no desires of his own but to be helpful to his friends and master. He gets no pleasure out of killing people beyond that of knowing he is doing a good job. Demiurge is the one who planned the genocide, Ainz is the one who OK'd it. It's not Mare's responsibility.
I didn't count Sebas bc he has high positive karma

I did forget about Lupus.
A friend that Lupis would joyfully torture and even kill if Lupis was ordered to, and possibly even if she was just bored one afternoon if Enri wasn’t important to Ainz.
Lupus is a sadistic psychopath. She likes befriending people because the closer they are to her and the more they trust her, the more she gets off of their suffering. She's among the worst of Nazarick while playing the role of one of the nicest.
She's a sadistic narcasist what are you talking about she literally was gonna let the whole village get destroyed by the giant of the East and the demon of the west,simply cause she wanted to see their terrified expressions and that she thought there weren't worth nazarrick attention and they would have been exterminated if Ainz didn't pick up on what she was thinking, at the end of season 3 episode 2, when Yuri Alpha came to pick her up to meet Ainz on that matter she said

As far as Lupis can consider anyone a friend
Does she?  Wasn’t it more like file curiosity and enjoyment.  Like she didn’t even handle the circumstances correctly until she was admonished by Ainz and given more direct orders to be more helpful.  And even then she kinda played around.
Lupis is also a psychopath who wants to kill all the ppl in the villiage 

The fact they trust her makes her more excited to hurt them
For Lupis, they more likely toys.
Tha dog wanted to kill a torture the whole village, i doubt she really care anymore than a dog to a plush toy.
Best Gal Pals. 

I am ashamed I didn't mentioned them.
For them, a pawn is equivalent to liking and respecting someone imo.
Albedo wants her sure she knows her place. Demiurge was quite intrigued with her, though.
Yea but Sebas even says to her later I’m not going to apologize because if I had went about this any other way you would have died. Yes he was willing to make that move on her in a gamble to make sure she lived and even if he killed her it would be a mercy kill instead of being handed over to demiurge or someone else.
I don't think that's fair to Sebas. They had just started being actual people, going from being NPCs in a game. Ainz was still feeling them out, to see how they would act in certain situations, wondering if their programming still applied in certain situations, etc. And they were just starting to form their own memories, opinions, etc outside of what was written for them. Tsuare was a completely off the rails thing for Sebas and the way it was written, it seemed like he was being suspected of having gone rogue, all over a secret he tried to keep. 

I definitely think he may have grown negatively from that experience had he been forced to kill her. His karma might have even changed, and at the extreme end of things, he might have even grown to harbor resentment towards Nazarick, maybe even Ainz.
Did you reply to my comment on accident? The comment you replied to doesn't mention Lupus
The movie didn’t just out right say it, but heavily implied it. The scene right after when Zed neuralyzed the other applicants, he states “Gentlemen, congratulations. You’re everything we’ve come to expect from years of government training.” which is actually an insult because they are just doing what they’re told and not thinking outside the box like J.
>It's a fan theory because it was never actually explained in the movies, and last I checked, it was never confirmed by anybody who worked on the movies themselves either.

That's what you call "Trusting the audience is smart enough to connect the dots and don't need the information shoved into throats like some movies do nowadays" technique.
Haha made my day 😂
Climb will be conflicted about things.   Nfria will be just be exhausted.  They are not the same.
Sebas actually might follow a bastardized version of the emperor.  He is very much a lawful force.  Isn't one of the four about perfection?   My 40k is rusty but last perfection seeker primarch I thought fell to slanessh?  Please correct me.

Aura may be a fan of the tyrannid hive mind, along with entoma.   

The real question, who follows gork and Mork?
Ewwwwwwwww

This is why I not talk to alot of isekai fans

Mostly not talk to youjo senki fans tho

Like I love youjo senki but man I hate the community 

Like my goat rerugen is not a pedo and never be one(the community ship tanya x rerugen and I hate it, it not canon btw thank god)(tanya is acesexual I hc idc)

So yeah 

Thinking about making a subreddit for youjo senki for people who are not weirdos 

But yeah demiurge is also one of my goat and he would never do that
-100 is don't care if you are in the blast radius unless told otherwise
Close to neutral isn't neutral. It's neutral~evil. Just look at how CZ Delta behaves. It's like night and day between her and Mare
Kind of fucked up, but somehow kinky.  
Shalltear's creator was probably involved in that idea somehow...
Rather they are flexing by doing it in the most roundabout way possible
You can find the link in the sub's faq page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/overlord/wiki/faq/). You can find the fan translations for the novels, the side stories, the drama CDs, and so on. Look for a folder called "character data" or something like that.
Mare has no sympathy for anyone outside of Nazarick and sees them as lesser beings, he doesn't care if he kills them, hurts them or makes them suffer. He could capture the lady without breaking her leg and drag them by the hair so yeah he's not an innocent kid
What's up with this "karma"? I thought you were memeing but now I think I'm missing information.
Best girl Yuri has a positive 150 karma.
If I remember rightly isn't he the only character that does?
True. The alternative would be livestock on "the farm", or fuel for the fire (re estize).
kharma doesn't change like that.
I don't think he would resent it either.
everyone in Nazarick would rather die than disobey Ainz.
Yeah sorry
Not necessarily perfection so much as perfection of beauty. Like one slaaneshi champion in lore was renowned for his perfectly beautiful face and held a horrible grudge against someone that cut his face with a blessed weapon that left a scar that couldn’t be healed. All of the chaos gods could be seen as perfection in one way or another. 
Slaanesh is the god of excess, but also of artistic expression, freedom, and passion. 
Nurgle is the god of disease and plague, but also of renewal and rebirth, the cycle of life
Khorne is the god of blood and slaughter, but also god of revolution from tyranny and honourable combat
Tzeench is the god of schemes and deceit, but also of knowledge, magic, and ingenuity
They have become the corrupt and evil entities that they are because of all of the horrors and atrocities in the universe outweighing the aspects of their nature that are good. 
I would see Sebas as less like the emperor, who was all powerful but merciless, and more like the Primarch Sanguinius, the most noble and loyal of the Primarchs, who had his own ideals of justice but would never disobey the emperor even if he found his orders to go somewhat against his own wishes. 
I don’t think there is anyone that really fits being a follower of gork and mork, because they are all about brutality and love of fighting in all forms. 
Now, Kyouhukou may be more like a follower of the Great Horned Rat.
-100 is expanding the blast radius slightly despite the destruction to make sure you get the guy who was talking shit earlier.
and neutral doesn't mean neutral as well. You mentioned CZ, who is a prime example. She's supposing neutral-good yet she doesn't really feel anything if she has to massacre anyway.
That ain't kinky dude, just fantasy torture. This is obviously an idea of Ulbert.
He's innocent like a child burning ants with a magnifying glass because his father told him it would help the family.
There is a karma system in the game where they all came from ranging from Extreme Evil(-500) to Extreme Good(500). Everyone has assigned karma values (like Ainz -500, Sebas 300). Karma has a degree of influence over the game's mechanics such as the strength of different items, races, classes, abilities, and spells.
Him and cocyutus (probably spelt that wrong) he might only have neutral tho not entirely sure
Troll arena champion is a follower of gork and mork.  Along with ainz prolly.  

The sanguinius is apt, he was best Boi.
Its probably somebodys fetish
You know that Scafism is a way of execution really similar to this but it is more disgusting because it involves worms and shit
Having no sympathy for ants and burning them because your father told you is still cruel...
Wait sebas has positive karma? I thought it was -100 or something.

So how does he feel about things they do then? I'm fine being spoiled a bit.
Victim has 1 positive karma, but that’s more a cheating of the system for a *pure* sacrifice.
Oh the troll arena one is def one. I hadn’t thought of that. Ainz I see as more a tzeench follower that just get lucky instead of being skilled lol
Yoshitora. **THE GOATEST** 😎
Why? They're just ants.
Also, he is an angel IIRC and angels in karma system are always positive no matter what, so yeah, it's just for the sake of cheating the system
I've found that unreasonably hilarious for whatever reason.
He is very secretive of his incompetence so that tracks.  Though the massacre in the plains means he would be favorable for khorne as well.
Because they're living beings that didn't do anything to you? Buddy, I won't keep this forever, please find another guy to play
Remember that Khorne despises magic though. Any that pray to him and use magic are killed.
Our Boy Kugane Maruyama's actions are becoming harder and harder to justify 
At this stage, I really don't know how to feel about him anymore 
The only author I love and hate with every fiber of my being at the same time.
Did something happen? I feel like I'm missing context
Maruyama obviously isn’t a full time writer, and never has been. But for me, as somebody who writes fantasy as a hobby, it would be strange to actively dislike foreign fans of my work. 

I don’t even know if I’ll publish anything in the future, but if I do and end up gaining a fan base, I would be delighted if people were interested enough to translate my work into their language to read it. Even if I wrote something to distribute in a small scale event only in America, I would understand foreign fans’ desires to read it.

I can easily see why he dislikes fan translations of the main books. That eats into potential sales of the official translation by a significant margin. But for works that he never has and never plans to sell? It’s just strange.
after reading the fan translation, i bought some of the official english volumes and they were dogshit. So the thing that killed his profit was not the fan translation it was the sub par official one
Ainz likeable but also a villain.

Kuganes work is likeable but he's also a villain.
I mean, I'm much like Maruyama in that I write (for now) as a hobby mostly because I love it. But what I don't understand is why hate fans not from Japan? Like okay, don't translate it yourself, I'm English and given who I am, I don't think I could make official translations for other countries. 
 
So if I had fans in say Japan and they translated my story for fans in Japan. I would be over the moon with happjness because that means people care about my story and have enough passion to help others read it. 
 
I don't get why Maruyama seems to hate it.
Someone can be an amazing creator and also a dickhead.  Maruyama is an incredible author but every interaction I've seen about him and his fans outside his Japanese audience he's been an antagonistic dick.

But hey.  I could be wrong.  Maybe I'm missing some positive interactions from the past.  Dunno, just enjoy the guy's work but I cannot fathom why he hates his fans outside Japan so much.  His work wouldn't be even a tenth as popular over here if it wasn't for the fan translations and plenty of us buy his work anyhow to demonstrate our appreciation.
Glad to see as the years roll by less and less fans justify his refusual of selling the side story. Like if you never plan to sell a thing then fans translating it ain't stealing
What did I miss? Did something happen recently? Any context
translating your work means people like it.
Maybe he should tell them to fix their translations. I have to grind my teeth every time I read "Kingdom of Darkness" instead of "Sorcerous Kingdom"
> **Author**: "It's amazing Overlord is popular world wide."

> **Author**: "I'm going to release a new side story only in japan."

> **Author**: "Why are non-japanese fans pirating my story?"
Maruyama isn't some rare exception, Japaneese are just super xenophobic. Why else dou you think it's an ethnostate? Living there as a foreigner is a fucking misery
I don't care if he likes us. Just write that fucking next book Maruyama and if you don't want fan translations stop writing then they won't happen.
They are just super nationalistic over there, the writer for Baki has done similar shit, same with the guy who made the first DMC game. If you think racism is bad in the west you'd be amazed at what it's like over in the east lol.
Honestly the only understandable part is the fact that he doesn’t get money from it. Other then that I have no idea why he hates translations so much.
The general anime public is going to be way more pissed at him and the series after the film comes out.
I'm just saying: so glad I jumped ship to Mushoku Tensei. The author *actually seems to care* about his fans and every single volume has been fire (on 25 of 26).
George R.R Martin also doing this kind of shit but with different way like delaying or sidetracked by another project, this kind of attitude is not unique for author of book apparently.
bBuT PiRaCy Is BaDdd duHhh
The guy is just allergic to success and profit. 

I’m sorry but he could reach a far greater audience and customer base if he wasn’t frothing at the mouth over foreigners
What actions? What's going on?
What happened
Context?
I'm way out of the overlord news loop atp


What's this about?
Marketing? His views makes a buzz and makes us even more hellbent on getting our hands on his stuff?!? Or he’s just tired of everything and trolls us
que lastima, nos salio racista y xenofobico el ponja. Nada que hacer, no es el unico ponja enfermo, esta este y los que desean cojer con la hermana o sobrina. Asquerosos, y se mufan de su "perfecta sociedad" y son lo mas putrido que hay.
Well, hating on fans is not that uncommon.
What is with sudden Maruyama hate? Dude is just upset that he is loosing profits because of fan translations. Its totally understandable
He seems like someone who is just tired of the IP, I feel like he just wants to coast to the end and move on already. All the extra effort to translate is just too much work for him for something he isn't all that interested in anymore.
What is he doing?
What happened?
Waiting for novel updates: 🙃

Waiting for manga updates: 🤯

Waiting for anime updates: ☠️

Waiting for novel updates after Maruyama decides to do a funny:

https://preview.redd.it/1vmhq8uaujjd1.jpeg?width=497&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ada99746668d91f07c322cf3a464027f851417
What did he do now?
Can someone provide me a quick overview of what he's doing or has done?
What is the context here? What did the author do?
What is happening to overlord, and should I be worried.
Ok what did Maruyama do now 💀
What happen now?
Loved the anime. Sad to see it dying. I feel like it was crazy popular to just...end short.
Fan translations got me into overlord LNs, mad house got me into the anime S1, official LNs by yen press (I have all that are released) got me back into fan translations...
I might get flamed for this but I'm at the point that I want Maru to just drop the overlord series. If he really want to go back and focus on his desk job or that he don't want to write this type of genre anymore then just ducking drop it instead of blaming fans about how he lost motivation because the larger international market somehow able to get their hands on the "exclusive" side story of the series. 

Instead of just dragging out this series only to end it with lackluster open ending I prefer he just straight up cancel it if he really dont want to write anymore. Even if anyone say that the publishers won't make him end it that easy, he still have the final say to it since he the author. Looks to me that even tho he "really" wants to end it, he still plans to wring out the last penny he could get from it and he just lowkey racist hating on international fans and community of the series.
Anyone can update me? Why? What happened?
I’m glad I’ve learned to separate most artists from their works.
Ayo did I miss something? What's going on?
Context people, please. The emotive but contextless post are getting the up voted to come up in feeds (at least mine) and I’m left trying to. Infer from the largely agree or disagree comments. Maybe a link could get some ups?
What's his problem? Is it Bad his work is known to everyone in the world, legally or not? I mean, sure, is not ok If people read your work without buying the volumes, but at least they Buy it when available in their country for collection, and comparing translations. That's what i think.
Don’t know why anyone is surprised, it takes an asshole to write a story about glorifying evil and asshole characters.
Considering this is the first post I'm seeing from this subreddit, can someone please explain what the problem is? Is the Author just doing stupid stuff and saying it's the community's fault for pressuring him or something?
What have I missed?
What did he do now?
I always thought the author was a massive weirdo tbh. Same goes for the Made in Abyss and Jobless Reincarnation authors as well.
Not rlly in this and dunno what actually happend but rlly overlord seemed to get weird after the point he makes his own kingdom to me at leasz
What do you mean it’s the fans that did it he said it himself that’s messed up the the fans framed him
Wait, what did he do?
Kinda like Harry Potter

Good books and adaptations

Not so great author
Why are people hating on Overlord author?
A few years back Solar from mamamoo had a fan meeting. She made goodie bags which contain exclusive pouch only obtainable for attendees. Some people decided to resell at high price. Solar get sad/angry and decides to never do it again.


Ain't no way you guys think you are the good guys. No shit the author is mad that the "fans" don't respect his wishes. 
What kind of reatrded comments people are making. Like nowhere he said he hates foreigners, he just doesn't like how people pirates his stuff. It's his own work and he can release wherever or however he wants, bruh fr nowadays people are just hypocritical brain-dead fcks.
Funny now that the author has openly told his fans and mostly his western ones to fk off. People forget that it was those fans that drove him like this 😂
I wonder if his attitude has anything to do with the lack of respect for copyright in a lot of other countries. I've been to places where they openly sell homemade copies of an American movie DVD. They steal or buy one and then make several hundred copies they sell for $5 instead of the $20+ we pay for a brand new release.
Sorry I haven't replied to anyone, I posted this before my beddie-bys and have woken up to this! 

Suppose the point I was trying to make was his seemingly obvious dislike for any fan outside Nihon! 

I probably should of made a meme to better resemble that, but for whatever the reason this one popped into my head and I went for it! Sorry for any confusion my fellow brethren
Can we pay someone to slap Maruyama upside the head every time he has a dogshit take on foreigners and fan translators?

Actually could we found an organisation whose whole purpose is to just go around slapping people upside the head when they say moronic shit but should know better?
Overlord is over rated af anyways.
Treat him like H.P. Lovecraft
Why would he need to justify anything? It's his work and property and whether we like it or not, he's free to do whatever he wants with it.
Seeing how the West is dying from embracing 'Diversity' = maybe he has a point in being xenophobic!
Oh, we're back to this again. He, quite reasonably, dislikes fan translations of his work since he views it as theft, ESPECIALLY since 'fans' are choosing not to buy the official releases. 

So yes, he's not happy with 'fans' here.
LOL if you are feeling attacked by this, he probably means the type of foreigners he doesnt like



i mean from all these comments and the meme i can see why he hates foreigners. Idk what you guys expect? Lol it be hilarious if the translation got interpreted as hating foreigners. hahahahah
Redditors are pulling the race card on the creator. He doesn’t like fan translations because he probably doesn’t like losing money. All of a sudden this is has become a Japan bad thread.
Also Gege, fuck that guy, love him
Maruyama is in Patrick Rothfuss club.
Take this with a grain of salt since this is just what I've read on the forums, but apparently is widely accepted:

Maruyama is *not* a fan of unofficial translations... even if he explicitly stated those works (side stories for the most part) would *never be officially* translated. And apparently he's been pretty outspoken about how upset he's become with *foreigners, specifically*, about it, which has led some to believe that he not only does not care about certain foreign markets, but that he actually holds some contempt/ disdain for them.
**Limited Edition**

A few years back the author released a limited edition side story.
&nbsp;

You had to buy the Japanese Special Edition season 2 and 3 blu-ray and you would get a voucher. You could then send this in and assuming you had a japanese adress you would recieve the side story. 
&nbsp;

However, a few months after it was released someone linked them the post of the English Translation. Rightfully he was a bit upset that it was pirated and ranted about it on twitter.
&nbsp;

**The Problem**

This created a big problem with the fans... Overlord is a huge series globally. The Overlord Anime Team (director & etc) and even sometimes the author travel around the world to anime conventions... it is that big.
&nbsp;

Yet, we never even got a chance to buy it. It was never translated or released in other languages and even if you could read japanese you still needed a japanese address. I literally have the voucher that states that. 
&nbsp;

**Repeat**

Now again... the author is releasing a limited edition side story that you can only get in japan. Although this time all you have to do is goto the movie during the first week and you can get it.
&nbsp;

It just sort of feels like a slap in the face.
&nbsp;

The author will probably see it again and complain about it. It just... it is hard to explain. They know Overlord is popular outside of Japan, and the movie is even being shown outside of Japan. The Anime director did a preview in germany. It is just sort of mind boggling they didn't even attempt to do a secondary release for the global market.
Yeah it's just odd. Like bruh you never even considered or wanted the side novels to be obtained by anyone outside the country so why do you care it's being fan translated? Like I'd understand if he was planning on selling those novels in foreign markets but he's got no right to complain about potentially losing money on novel sales in countries he has no plans to sell said novels in.
Piracy has, and always will be, a service issue.

Of course, you will have people who simply refuse to pay for a product, but that is the incredibly small minority. The majority of people like to pay for and support creators that they enjoy.

If a product is unavailable to obtain with a reasonable level of convenience, why would someone want to pay for it when it's easily available for "free?" Services like Amazon and Steam provide open access to products that would normally be nearly impossible to obtain and people happily pay.

It's just dumb to get upset that people do fan translations. It's obviously a service issue. People happily purchase the officially translated volumes.
Not really. I'd say that people who do enjoy your work would buy the official translation once it became available. The biggest instigator of piracy is availability and while some people may not have the income to spend on a digital book here or there, the majority who did pirate would buy a physical copy or other official merchandise to show care for work.
I dont even think that FTLs actually eat that heavily into potential profit. They can basically work as a demo for the story.
He is Japanese. Japanese authors realy like to show their "_Japanese superiority_" by making stuff Japan exclusive.

But he is kinda one of the view that actually got angry when western fans "illegaly" got it. So, its probely an excuse to stop writting. Maybe due to Japans work cultures view about giving up?
To some extent I feel like I understand it pretty well. I am not a published artist, but I can understand very well not wanting my work viewed outside its original context.
I think it is two things:

1) I'll try to phrase this the best I can but if it comes across as offensive I apologize, it's not my intent:  japanese people (at least when talking in public) are highly influenced by their corporations' take on the subject of copyright and such. Few companies are as annoying and anal regarding copyright and piracy as the japanese ones (maybe Disney?) and this is clearly something cultural as well. Whereas you or I will think "as long as no working person (like an author) loses money I don't give a shit, corporations can go fuck themselves " the *average* person in Japan will probably go with the "default" morality on the matter. Or at least that's my experience when talking with them on the internet. If it's the law then it is **GOOD**. Hence the default anti-piracy stuff.

2) Maruyama apparently values all those "limited edition" bullcrap ideas. So he is honestly annoyed that his fantasy of "only X number of people get this" will be denied. Strangely analogic of him but in a world where books existed only on paper his desire would be *mostly* accomplished. Sadly he has forgotten such "analogic" world doesn't exist anymore.
Yeah, I have most of the LNs too, and the official translations aren't that good.
Classic example of a the difference between a labour of love and labour for profit.
And the fact that yen press was releasing a whopping one volume every 2 years ofc fans are gonna want fan translations
Darkness kingdom!
Maruyama is like Ainz; we're witnessing him slowly losing touch with his humanity side after each passing day... 😢
[removed]
He wasn't racist or anything in the rant, he was just upset that people pirated the side story which was meant to be a limited special edition release.
&nbsp;

That is great and all, but they know Overlord is well loved globally. The anime director and even the author has traveled outside of japan for conventions, so it is just sort of baffling they wouldn't even give the global audiance a chance.
You remind me of the author of Legendary Moonlight Sculptor (a korean LitRPG novel from before it was cool). Guy got in contact with the fan translators (or they got in contact with him? Can't remember) and the guy basically said "oh you liked it enough to translate it? Nice, keep going. Just remember to take it down if I ever get my work officially published in English" and that was it.
Well Japan is a deeply xenophobic country. With lots of Racism and discrimation towards foreigners. 

So yeah if someone’s more radical in their believes of course they would dislike international unofficial translations. (Especially when the rights holder doesent get a dime through it)
As a creator myself, i would say his anger is completely justified. Ppl in the west just value ourselves too much we forgot how to respect others. If my works were ever translated and spread DIRECTLY AGAINST MY WILL and without payment. Of fking course I would be mad. Not to mention those "fans" keep telling me that I should be greatful and they're doing me a favor.
And ppl also forgot that we do not act purely as ourselves, our actions and way of thinking are largely shaped by our culture and environment. We all represent as part of ”foreign society”. When one of us committed something out of our cultural ideas, it's only right that other ppl would condemn us as a whole. There's nothing racist about this. Rather we are being racist by taking from others and judging them by our cultural standards.
As the saying goes, pray you never meet your heroes. They often don't live to standard.
Ingrained cultural xenophobia mostly
I don't think this is true at all.
&nbsp;

I would be curious is someone has an example, but even when he ranted about his side story being pirated he wasn't racist or against non-japanese people. He was just upset that his special edition limited release was pirated. Japan sort of has this love for collector items and that is what is was supposed to be.
&nbsp;

I don't have a problem with limited releases, but we didn't even get a chance to get it. I have the voucher from the $200 japanese special edition season 2 and 3 blu-ray, but you needed a japanese address :/
Tbh, his works aren't THAT impressive, or else it would've been more popular. But now that I know he's a racist, I no longer won't be reading it either, it seems. I don't usually  like to relate people's personal opinions with the art they make, but this guy sounds like a complete idiot with his reasoning on why he doesn't want fan translations. Hating a group of people for no real reason, but for the sake of it, is the epitome of racism.
new side story thats only going to be released in japan
People here doom post over nothing every now and then. The correct thing to do it ignore it.
*surprised pikachu face*
And it's a good thing, japan must stay japan. It must not become a cultural melting pot like in the West, where the country no longer has any identity.
So many people seem so disappointed, I loved his work, but I don't care if he hates his fans, he hates unofficial translation or if people kidnapped him and forced him to write Overlord in the basement somewhere barely feeding him, as long as he keeps writing them.
I LIVE in Japan and have been trying to tell people this for YEARS!
For real? What did the Baki author do?
If you can stomach Rudeus then MT is an awesome story. Literally has one of my top 5 endings in fiction, period.
You can read full, real, context on my post about it.

People here is ranting over misinformation
Do you know it's not the author who translate a book lol ?
People ranting about misinformation over maruyama releasing a new extra novel about overlord that will be given on the movie release theaters
Due to be a side story released for cinema goers in Japan for the movie release

Japan only... you know what that means .... (-_-;)
Due to release another Japan only exclusive 

Will most likely get fan translated 

Will most likely get threats about about wanting to continue/finish Overlord due to terrible foreign fans/community
It's getting more content. You don't need to worry
I get you lad! I'm not sure if you are the same, maybe there are a few who would agree with me but I'll put up with the Yen Press translations if they didn't generally take a year to be released after the official volume release
I don't think it's hate per se, I would say it is more the feeling of being left out ...again, that's defo the case for me!

This scenario has played out before, were there is extra content being supplied by the author but only for Japan. 

It's what happened last time and what will surely happen again that I suppose some fans maybe have a bit of animosity towards him.
The opposite, his attitude was towards people who were reselling it at double+price in bad quality (not even a week after it was officially released, yes the books were already in bad shape for those "fans")
Sure, you'll get nothing of it since he never gave an opinion out of either
Great idea. Now just need to execute it.
I think the issue is he openly states to never plan to officially translate something and then complains the fans translate it.
Maruyama is that you?
Yeah if he takes a giant dump on the entire Overlord franchise right now it’s not like he would be the first to ruin a great series as it ends
He does have every right to complain, it doesn't mean he's right. People want to read his work. He either commissions an official translation and makes money off of it, or he doesn't, and people translate it for free and he doesn't get anything in return, nor does he lose anything.

The fact that he's complaining about it only shows his lack of understanding of the world he lives in
There are countries which still have a unique culture that is not going to be gone even for a thousand years. There's no point in being a xenophobic.
make good product for a reasonable price and people will come to you themselves. if you're a dickhead selling shit your content will be pirated. steam is a prime example of it, Gaben knew extremely well his main competitor is piracy.
The official translation is crap sadly, Nation of Darkness? Really? Where did that even come from? I still bought the physical copies but the translation is atrocious, to this point it still has basic grammatical errors
I mean when it comes to the EE side story or this one he doesn't lose money as those were never/will neve be translated. 

He *can* complain, that's his right. But he doesn't have much of a moral argument. It's like a musician who doesn't record his music crying because people are listening to recordings of his concerts. Like, yeah that's all they had. What did you expect?



Having said that, the thread is full of people having a masturbatory weeping session. If Maru doesn't like the fan translations then who gives a shit?
Tbh Gege is getting harder to love. That guy actively hates like 99% of his characters. He'd be better off just writing a JJK databook, because he only seems to care about fights and explaining extremely convoluted powers.
funny how a guy is racist when he wrote an entire anthology of books about how bad racism was and how even the overlord of death wants a kingdom where all races are treated equally.
Which I find kind of hypocritally funny because Overlord has a metric crapton of DnD influences in there.
It is strange, especially in this era if something gets really popular in one country it will leak outside. There's no avoiding that
Kind of a racist this guy is, apparently
I mean if he was ever actaully going to allow an official translation to be distributed and sold sure I understand him being upset since that hurts his potential income.

But if you are intentionally holding back and not intending official translations? What do you think was going to happen lol.
I really want the movie to be super successful so Kadokawa can force an adaptation movie of the side story without giving a crap about Maru's views
So eventually even the adaptation of his *exclusive* story can get to the foreigners and then we will enjoy more peak Overlord.
Phew, I thought he was another sex offender or something like that
Wait, Maruyama is the author, right? If that's the case I don't understand the logic. Overlord is heavily influenced and based on D&D, which is something that was created outside of Japan, so why would he hate "foreign" markets when his work is based on foreign stuff?
Shouldn’t he be happy about fans properly translating his works? So many big translation companies have been caught changing the original meaning of certain scenes by adding their own writing. Need I mention the Kobayashi scene?
Not really surprising honestly, Japan is actually very racist.
any possible reason why he would feel that particular way?
Thank you!
The Japanese are xenophobic. We know that. It would just be nice if they didn't say the quiet part out loud. Being racist to the point you shoot yourself in the foot is not a good look
Lowkey enjoying unreasonable people being upset for unreasonable things
That's rough but honestly can't blame him. Westerners are fucking pathetic when it comes to Asian cultures. "omg anime so weird, omg this story so creepy, omg this character age" No idea what his problem is but if it's something along these lines, don't blame him one bit
Pleaso, go read the post I made.

The only thing lacking here is the context he was in. People on japan started reselling it not even 3 days after the convention started. They were being sold at double the price, and they were selling scanned bad quality copies (broken pages and drawings), which is impressive since the novel was new and shows how little they cared.

When he was told about the reddit one, he was told basically the same way people told him about the ones in japan. In other comment, he says how the money you spend on the illegal will not help the work. (Because you are only giving money to a random without a link to maruyama or kadokawa)
I know it might be a controversial statement but let’s not forget that Japan has a long history of xenophobia that was deeply ingrained in there culture for hundreds of years and is still has lingering effects to this day being the primary cause for Japanese companies to refuse releasing their works abroad
Makes me think of a teen girl who baked a special cake for her favourite friend. Thw whole class saw that and wanted cake too. So the next day the kind teacher baked similar cake for the rest of the class. And now the girls cake isnt special anymore in her eyes, regardless of her best friend still appreciating it.
To be fair around 25-28% of japanese can speak English. So a Fantranslation could hurt potential buyer quotes. Although I am not so sure (and I assume we are talking about the Evileye Sidestory if I did not miss something lately) how much it would really go down seeing as it was an exclusive deal with a bookchain and only there available.

  
But to be true. I always believed Maruyama only wanted a cause to say that he will write less books as previously mentioned.
When I was growing up I lived in poverty and pirated so many games, as an adult I legally own all those games and their sequels,  it's the same for the overlord book, I read them online when they are available from fan translations and as soon as they get officially released in English I buy the hard cover book and read it again.
I have purchased all the existing volumes (minus the side story), but I’d rather read the fan translations on this subreddit because they’re just… better
I'd love to see some actual numbers/research on this and wonder if you have leads or hints on that regard.
Licensing and exclusive rights for publishing are true cancer. Translations should be considered fair use tu prevent censorship imposed by the „owners” of „rights” to see something that exists.
It's kind of like what happened with weed in Canada. Once weed became legal and easy to get, everyone stopped buying from the dealers and went to the shops. If could pick up an official translation of overlord at my local bookstore, I would 100% have the full collection in my house the next day.
Why would a business do labor of love??? The entire point of them hiring translators is to make money. Not run a charity
I hear he was upset that it was fan translated, which is the problem. If the was just too lazy to translate it, it got fan translated, and he didn’t care, there would be no issue.
That actually makes sense.

If this were work he collaborated with a few other people, I can see him being a bit more loose in terms of opinions, but seeing as how there legalities in place, he probably has to keep his mouth shut less he lose ownership of his own work.
Amazing, the only balanced opinion I’ve seen regarding this “issue” in a long time and in this post. It amazes me how people just makeup opinions of their own and go along with it without actually checking out the full picture, or at least try to look for it because it’s just… what? “Convenient” to call him xenophobic and in a xenophobic culture when he didn’t say he hates foreigners or his foreign fanbase per se, just because? It really amazes me, honestly. 

He has the right to choose if something he worked on to be exclusive, and nothing is wrong with that. And nothing is wrong with us wanting to read it as well. But to disregard what could be potential real reasons for why he got upset that his work is being used in an unintended way, and blame it all on “xenophobia” is the most immature and selfish thing I’ve seen in a while. 

Many people seem to have no care for why he actually acted that way, astonishingly. It’s easy to put the blame on xenophobia with anything related to foreign cultures, but that shouldn’t be and it isn’t the right outlook.

I’d honestly like to believe that not all Overlord fans are like these guys in this sub, that’s what I hope as not all fans are particularly using this sub after all.

Edit: added a bit more of my opinion.
Wait if you say this as an argument. He literally has a Charakter that is supposed to look like a Nazi. In your logic it would counter yours.
This is just a repeat of the EE side story. The sub is just drama queen'ing.

Having said that I believe he's honestly against piracy and I don't mean stuff that'll make him lose money. Remember that many japanese people have that stiff view of "legal=good, illegal= BAD". I wouldn't be surprised if he was like that as well, what with being a ~~corpo drone~~ salaryman and all that.
His works are pretty impressive tho. Not necessarily the world or lore, but just how interesting he makes mundane scenarios (an entire book on minor stuff like lizards, a little village and goblins) and the actual exciting scenarios, well, exciting. At least in the LN world, Maruyama has some of the most engrossing writing in that medium
ass
Another new side story exclusive? Sweet. Hope this one will at least be published normally in Japanese  so we can get a copy of it. The other one cost several hundreds last I checked.
Side story as in like the Vampire one which is like a "what if" or side story like between the events of volumes like the Demon Tree?
both are bad in their own way. keeping your identity is good, but not at the cost of openly despising everyone not from your country. I'd also argue their identity is super-westernised today compared to what it was, yet they still hate outsiders
Something that fills me with joy is that people like you can't do anything about your racist thinking more than foam at the mouth and type rants on internet lol, nothing is meant to stay the same forever kid
Brother, shut the fuck up.
Gtfo with your racist ass thinking.
I mean, the whole point of Rudeus is the redemption of a complete trash individual and his evolution into a reasonably upstanding citizen and loving father despite his own self-loathing and impossibly high criteria to meet. Rudeus is only \*bad\* until he's a teen or so.
I'm actually so glad my man's writing orc eroica, because his writing is really good, mostly, but holy shit rudeus makes MT unenjoyable. People can yap all about it being a "redemption story" or whatever, the fact still is that he's a piece of subhuman waste that gets to try and try again in unbelievably lucky circumstances, despite supposedly being hated by god.
I'd bet any Overlord fan can stomach him, Rudeus is a saint compared to most of the Nazarick characters lol
Are fans translating it and he's all butthurt because I'll just assume he's being a whiney bitch about having his content exposed to a larger audience again?
Oh lovely 🫠
Thank God
And It's his right to complain. That's still his work and property and he clearly sets his boundaries with it and if you cross them, it's only natural he will complain.

I find it silly and dislike it too and I can understand why others would too but I don't see why fans are making it into such a big deal.
No, just his most loyal meat rider. Funny thing is Maruyama probably dislikes him as much as the rest no matter how much you drink his lactose product.
Xenophobic is one thing...but welcoming in 100s of millions of people who hate your culture is cultural suicide!
Hmmm, look at South Korea...in the next 100 years, they are projected to have a population loss of 96%!

100% mass illegal migration into South Korea will occur (nice empty place all set with advanced infrastructure)!

Culture can't survive if the indigenous population doesn't survive!
If it's 'shit content' you wouldn't be pirating it.
"Boo hoo the translation is different than my fanwank, so I'm not gonna buy it!"
It feels like he didn't expect JJK to become so popular, or rather that people would get so attached to the characters he created.

I get the sense he wanted to end the series at an earlier point than it has reached, but had to continue due to popularity and it made him dislike the characters (other than Sukuna)
Well yes, but actually no. My read is that all non-Nazarick races would be treated equally, while the denizens of Nazarick are naturally and obviously superior. Ainz's goal is a utopia for the lesser races in part to make it obvious how superior the denizens of Nazarick are. Swap Japanese in for Nazarick, you get the apparent attitude of the author, bro is one step away from naming his cat a horrendous racial slur.
We all tend to overlook our own bias and bigotry. That's why racism is so hard to get rid of
His rant wasn't racist. He was just upset that people pirated it and then some japanese people come to the sub reddit to complain that we pirated it. 
&nbsp;
A fantasy about an *overlord* who tells everyone (except a precious few *objectively superior* individuals) how to act and think and enforces his own worldviews with literal insurmountable violence? That's the utopia of equality? Not a deeply fascist amoral debauchery of a state?
It's funny you go straight to calling him racist because he's sick of weebs. A lot of Japanese authors dislike their western weeb fans but don't say it out loud because they love their money. At least he is honest that he doesn't particularly care for foreign fans. And I can't blame him. I like the show but a lot of anime super fans (the ones he's likely aware of are super fans) are actually really annoying and off-putting. 

I just don't like him because he seems to hate Overlord and not care for finishing it. He put in a lot of work in the beginning and now acts like writing a 200 page book once a year is too strenuous as if the rest of the world doesn't have full-time jobs that are actual work that we don't get to ignore because we don't feel like it. If he doesn't want to finish the series he should just pay someone else to finish it and use him as a consultant when they have questions. It would be better than the rushed and unsatisfactory ending I have no doubt he is going to give us one day. Those are the qualities I dislike him for, but his indifference to western fans I could not care less about to be honest.
First time?
Ironic, isn’t his content based off foreigners source materials. E.g. dnd

Still his story to deal with. I imagine fan bases can get frustrating as well but idk 🤷
Its not a story about racism. 

Demihumans are literally man eaters with an inhuman psycology.

Everyone reads it as an analogy for racism because if a westerner wrote it, it would be.
The poster says take it with a grain of salt and everyone wants to act like there’s damning evidence he’s in the a Japanese KKK. Reddit and calling people racist name a better duo.
Personally, I think that he wanted "exclusives" like vampire princess to stay "exclusive to Japan"

Sorry that we really enjoy and want to read **all** of your content, Maruyama. Truly, it is *our* folly /s
Xenophobia is a persistent problem in Japan overall. A good percentage of creators that are internationally popular, can have distain to their foreign fans. 

If memory serves, a music composer for Dragon Quest, refuses to release the orchestral renditions of the soundtracks for international concerts, just for that reason alone. It’s something that can’t be fixed, it’s just going to be a problem for a long time. 
Damn, a Japanese being racist? No way! /s
People picking and choosing what foreign stuff they like, while hating foreigners isnt too surprising. The human mind is really good at ignoring its own hypocrisy.
I can't remember 100%, but I'm pretty sure a lot of Japanese fantasy is based off of some games from the 80-90s which were also based off of DND. I think it was wizardry? which eventually was made by Japanese companies after a while. so sure, it's originally based on DND, but it's not been western fantasy for a while.
*Cough* yenpress translating almost every instance of "-sama" to "sir" in Higurashi *cough*

The biggest issue he assumably has with it is that, since they aren't official translations, they are distributed in a way which doesn't allow him to gain revenue; apparently his ***biggest*** issue from his perspective was some of the fan translations hitting the market and the ones who translated them **charged money for them**, which he received none of, even though it is his source material. That's understandably frustrating imo
They were pretty patient with people like johnny somali so I don't think that's true.
https://www.reddit.com/r/overlord/comments/1evp26o/about_maruyama_and_the_misinformation_of_piratery/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

This is a comprehensive explanation from someone here in the sub; this is why I said to take my original comment with grain of salt
The culture that influences their xenophobia is quite complicated so I won't go into it here too deeply, but to put it simply, they generally hold contempt for quite a few groups because of the way they spun their involvement in the war, and because of the way they were ***allowed and even encouraged to spin the story*** by the U.S.

There are plenty of people and researchers who are way more knowledgeable than I am who have explained it ad nauseum.
To be completely fair, a lot of the times, the criticism is fair. It is not even Asian cultures; it’s really Japanese content mostly. Anime specifically has a lot of creepy and even pedophilic stories that people should be creeped out by. For example, all those characters in that “totally 5000 years old but looks like a child” type of trope is fairly assumed to be some sort of pedophilic insert since there’s no reason why a child character can’t just be a child or why a millions year old character has to look like a child. This is especially concerning when these types of characters are given outrageous secondary sexual characteristics or given romantic subplots with the adult/older teenage characters however one sided. Raphtalia in Shield Hero is one example although they tried to get around the pedophilia by “evolving” her even though she is still a child age wise. I don’t see how not liking things like this is being pathetic towards Asian cultures unless pedophilia is an integral part of Japanese culture.
Jesus, they down voted you into Oblivion
🤓
But this whole thing is basically stupid. Don't complain if a parallel market appears to a product you made artificially scarce. Worse yet, the thing getting pirated is just the story. The people that went through all the hoops the author wanted got rewarded with a physical copy.

He is angry because people are *reading* the story. It is delusional and childish. And a bit of assholery.
As a Korean- same for Korea. All of the smaller eastern asian countries tend to have this culturally ingrained Xenophobia, and it's horrendous. Not to mention the toxic work culture that was adopted to get out of economic hell during post-war eras. Now the countries tend to be HELL to grow up in. Declining birth rates all around as well due to all of the toxic societal norms, and the xenophobia doesn't help bump up the population either.
Unfortunately this might be the case here. It's all complete speculation based on limited information, so ofc I might be way off too.

Though if I'm to be honest I kind of get why some of the older generation might feel that way given Japan's history. I'm not suggesting it's right in any way but I can't really say that I wouldn't feel the same. Not having walked in their shoes it's kinda difficult to excuse Maruyama's actions in this regard.

That being said, if Overlord has taught me anything it's that there is no absolute right or wrong in this world, it's all just shades of grey. What we think of as completely illogical/misguided can very easily be a simple fact of life/common sense/core belief of someone else. We say they're wrong, they say we're wrong. 

In such a world, it's kind of difficult to judge Maruyama's decision to try to restrict the side novels to Japan. That being said, I sure as hell am not gonna bow down to his whims. 

Btw, does he get royalties from Overlord merch? If he does then imo he should instead be grateful to fan translators, right? Just look at how many posts there are on this sub alone about people sharing pics of their new figurines and such. How many of those people became fans because of fan translations?
But are weirdly still obsessed with Germany after WWII.  All those white/platinum/blonde haired blue eyed foreign "exchange" students. Or obsession with German WWII military outfits. (Cough... Pandora's Actor, cough) Weirdly being straight up obsessed with the German language to the point of naming characters, vehicles, weapons, or abilities in German rather than Japanese.

It's LITERALLY everywhere in anime/manga.  Once I learned about it I couldn't help but notice how prevalent it is.

But then again Germany was pretty xenophobic back in the day too.  It's just so weird that like the two weird kids at school that hit it off all these decades later some Japanese  writers still has this weird social hard-on for WWII era German culture.
I offered a Japanese Dev a free fan TL for them to sell as a token of respect and was ignored. Others don't want their works translated to any other language.
Doesn't really matter if some Japanese citizens can speak English. Sure piracy in general cuts into his profits but he's not losing money with fans translating the side novels in a language demographic he doesn't intend to sell to and not losing money in countries he doesn't plan on selling the novels. When it comes to the side novels he only loses money if a Japanese citizen reads a pirated copy or fan translation.
Same here. Once I got some free cash, I happily spent on things I liked. I often got a "free" copy of something to check it out and if I liked it, I would definitely buy the official copy. On my trip to Japan, I made sure to pick some of my favorite titles to make sure the creators got their share for my enjoyment.
A labour of love isn’t necessarily a business…

IE: Fan translators aren’t getting paid, they do it because they like the books and, presumably, want to share it with a wider audience.

Labours of love do sometimes become businesses though and, anecdotally, they tend to be fairly successful. 

IE: RuneScape, Overlord, CSGO, WOW ETC
[removed]
So how come to none ever before lost his/her own work from the 10000 of free stories.
The problem is choosing it to be exclusive to Japan comes off as xenophobic. Imagine if a writer wrote a book and said they wanted it to be exclusive to white people so it felt more exclusive. Would you say that’s acceptable because they are the author?
I do believe the bar is too low when it comes to LNs in terms of writing. But it's also kind of subjective, so you're not wrong either. But as someone who's not as involved as a fan would be in this particular light novel, I can say for sure I won't miss reading his work.
User name checks out. No surprises there.
more like demon tree probably? If I’m remembering it right? 

It’s very much in universe— the details are in another recent post here but its an adventure with cocytus, demiurge and Anzi taking over the ghost ship of the Katze plains 

something mentioned in the twelfth novel but happened kind off camera. I’ll be real, I’m just excited to get my cocytus stuff.
From what it seems, it seems more closely related to the evil tree type of sidestory -- that is to say, a sidestory that is actually completely canon to the story from beginning to end.
The problem is that there's no in-between, just look at what's happened in western countries. People became completely anti-racist and from that moment: Why not accept everyone in your country? Why not, because they're like you, no ? And as time goes by, you let in a bunch of people who bring their own culture and destroy yours little by little, until they no longer accept your culture and impose their own.
Just look at the disaster that Western countries have become, where they are gradually being replaced by a foreign culture. If being racist prevents them from losing their culture, then it will always be better than ending like Europe. The western man has been walked over because he was too kind and not racist.
It's just that unlike you, I understand that it's normal for a country to remain in the hands of its native population, that a country's culture is extremely important and that “racism” is necessary today to preserve it and to not turn the world into a big pile of cultural mud.   
It's funny how everyone like japan because It's a country with a culture still very powerful, and without it Overlord would never have existed.
I mean yeah, the point of the story is his growth as a person. That doesn't change the fact that he hurts to read a lot of the time.
It's not about what he does, it's about reading his inner monologue and not dying of cringe until he matures and stops being disgusting. He is a great character but reading the crap he thinks or does is hard sometimes.

Overlord's characters on the other hand are all relatively charismatic regardless of how comically evil they can be.
Yeah pretty much hit the nail on the head my guy
Pretty much no. He only said stuff related to people reselling the title at high prices and in bad quality
You don't get to release something in a globalized world, refuse to make it available in other countries and then cry about people using other methods to get it. You refused to let other people give you money, so you don't lose money from them pirating it. It's your own fucking fault
Even though what he does is legal that doesn't mean he's doing right. Well, as long as he can't interrupt with the fan works it's fine but that thing still annoys me a little tbf
Its his right but hes likely using it as an excuse if im right, remember the side story book and how he said hes shortening the series due to the translating? While likely it was burnout.
Yes he has all rights to do it but hes basicly baiting people into it too.
Imagine you cook a pie people love and put it infront of them and tell them they can never have it. They wont all stay off it.
Not saying its good or bad but its expected behavior that he should know.
If you have no plan on translating something, you also have no right to complain when fans do it themselves. It's entitled to think your works should be restricted to one language only
Who tf told you those people hate his culture? In fact almost all people in the world except most Chinese love Japanese culture. Cultural suicide ain't gonna happen, no one's changing their culture, in fact foreign people want to preserve it.
literal gazillions of examples. video games filled with bloatware, bad translations (like in our case) and so on
You're not gonna become Maruyama's successor even if you try hard in defending a racist.
Wasn't he going to do a romcom before SJ was like "f**k that, this one-shot you made was super popular. Do more!"
Pandora's Actor in his little german officer's outfit.
Bruh he's one step away from becoming the Gates author now hearing about this.

And this kinda put a sour taste in my mouth reading this
The difference tho is Ainz has every reason to place Nazaricke above the new world. It's a monument to his friends and their time together. He can't risk losing those memories and besmirching the memories of his friends. As far as the new world it's just a new area of ygdrassil for all intents and purpose
“All will be treated as equal(y beneath me).”
Hmmm, sounds lovecraftian
Look up “nihonjinron” it’s all this and more.
Huh, i wonder if the constant nazi references are related lol
its funny how this is the most liked post I ever made on reddit. :D
Twitter and calling people racist
The only music composer for Dragon Quest was Koichi Sugiyama. He didn’t do what you claim from what I remember, but he was a giant pile of shit of a human being regardless. Incredible composer, probably one of the best who ever lived. Still was human garbage though.

And as far as I know there is no new Composer for the DQ series as of yet since Sugiyama died a few years back (or no public info at least, just rumors).
So it’s the usual greed thing. Yeah, that makes sense.
From firsthand experience, racism is pretty prevalent in Japan. They still have segregation, many establishments won’t serve you or even allow you in if you are not Japanese, if you are in a vehicle accident as a foreigner you will be blamed and liable no matter the situation, and the police do not care if you are being racially mistreated and will tell you to just move along. 

Japan does a very good job of hiding their darker parts and distracting the world with anime and their politeness, but they have many faults just like every other country. They have a decent amount of racism and quite a dark history.
Thank you.
Thank yuu
Thats a good point. I mean 2-3 Storys about an 1000 year old Looking like a kid are ok (can make for awesome Storys especially BECAUSE they are adult minded) But not in every 4 Story without any reasoning whatsoever.
Well yeah I'm not saying that trope shouldn't be viewed as weird, it is. But if you were to ask me to name 10 stories that do the "5000 year old but kid" AND do something creepy with it I'd have no clue cause I'm not actively looking for it nor have I found it unwillingly. I am familiar with shield hero but I wouldn't count that since like you said, they age the girl up (or give her an adult body which is ultimately what bothers these people)

My point is these people are basically telling on themselves cause if in my years of consuming Japanese media I haven't found these things, what the hell are these people watching? lol.  Not only that but when Western media does weird shit, think The Boys with "herogasm" (or any episode for that matter) or Rick and Morty where they have a literal giant incest baby, nobody bats an eye. That's my point

For the record tough, I enjoyed both of those last shows and continued watching out of morbid curiosity, yet you're never gonna see me going online posting "ugh Western media" and generalizing all Americans
And outside of an alright exchange, wasn't given an argument against.

If redditors disagreeing with you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong though? Reply with your nerd and skull emojis all you want but where's my refutal
First, he wasn't  angry.

Second, he didn't complain.

All he said was, "For those who are getting it with good money, thanks. Those who aren't, know that it's not contributing to the work behind it"
Well, karma will eventually strike back when they're forced to either open up to foreign population to recover from demographic decline or just fade into oblivion and let those lands be occupied by foreigners anyway, just a bit later.
Same goes for China, really. It's not limited to the smaller Eastern Asian countries.
I’m happy that SK’s people have started to open up a little more to foreign people. There’s so much good media there, the country is incredibly beautiful, and your food is not only very good but a solid 80% of it is completely palatable to westerners. (Yall can keep the stinky fish thing to yourselves tho)

Manhwa or rather that format of ”designed to be viewed on a phone screen” was an SK invention and it inspired work from writers and artists everywhere to take up the format and I love it.

But yea even china lowkey is more welcoming to foreigners than JP from what I understand.
Same for iran
It's because countries like Japan, Korea, China, India are predominantly single race countries that haven't been forced to assimilate. In my opinion white people are more racist than asian but because they went out colonizing they have to assimilate to other cultures for their society to work in harmony. They become a xenophilic society simply because of proximity to other races and cultures. This is harder for a single race country but the internet is hopefully bridging that gap slowly but surely. I'll give another 18 generations or an alien invasion to get rid of all xenophobic thinking in society.
IIRC Trash Taste already discussed this, authors get nothing from the merchandise of the project, they only get royalties from the sales of the novel or the anime blue ray
Absolute right and wrong exists, and shades of grays exist in between them. They are not mutually exclusive as you’re implying. And it can be argued that Overlord does actually teach this exact same thing.
Regarding the world of Overlord:

Demiurg's Happy Farm - Wrong.

Wiping out an entire Kingdom and its people for the unsanctioned actions of a handful of lower ranking individuals - Wrong.

Genocide - Wrong.

Using sapient beings as materials (This happened in Death Camps in WW2, where people were turned into soaps, for example) - Wrong.

Torturing prisoners to break their will and indoctrinate them - Wrong.

Saving innocent villagers from raiders - Right.

Sometimes it's futile to speak of shades of gray, when some issues are back and white. Momonga is the ultimate evil, after all, regardless of how bad other characters are.
Mind telling me what gray about the Holocaust
Not surprising Japan and Germany were allies after all  not just political but ideological allies
Oh ok. I understand what you mean now, I misunderstood at first
Hm, and what was his exact response?
I understand that part, but maybe there are reasons other than xenophobia. Maybe having exclusive collectables is a big deal in Japan, which seems to be the case from how Japan is usually portrayed in anime. Or maybe his hands are tied with his publishers and so on.

All I’m saying is that we should try to see the big picture so we can know what’s actually happening, instead of jumping to conclusions. I would like to give a different perspective, what do you think he feels when he sees the foreign audience calls him xenophobic, make memes mocking him and Japan when we don’t know their culture in regards to exclusive collections, or his work environment with his publishers, or other laws in place and so on? Do you think he will go “I see, they have a point. I do look like a xenophobe.”? Is that what you think he’ll think?

Let’s not sugar coat things, a lot that happened from this community is what led us to this situation. Not Maruyama only. He has expressed his tiredness with writing as it’s just a hobby to him. So instead of showing support for him so he can at least finish the story with good quality, we call him xenophobic when he makes a decision to release an exclusive item without actually caring to try and understand him. That however doesn’t excuse his attitude as well, as it just fueled the reaction of the community as well. It’s like an abusive relationship in a way.

And regarding your last question, I believe I already answered it previously. I have no problem with him making something exclusive to Japan, that’s his prerogative. I’ll be sad, of course, but I’ll respect his decision. I understand this doesn’t directly answer the example you gave, but I’d rather just talk about Maruyama directly and this instance, as it’s more relevant since Japanese is just a single nationality/country, while whites are not a single nationality/country. The category is different, but I get your point nonetheless.
Well, yeah, the bar isn’t set too high either. It is an opinion fr at the end of the day. It’s just, compared to a bunch of LNs I’ve read, overlord is definitely one of the more engrossing ones. Maybe not better, but overlord must’ve been pretty popular to have three seasons and 2 movies. The racism parallel isn’t good tho, and You’re fine if you don’t want to read his works anymore. It also helps if you’re not that into them to begin with too
marry a woman of your race and culture, seal the bond between you in a temple of your chosen deity and raise 3+ children with care, it's all I wish to say in this case for obvious reasons
Is the culture of the west so fragile that it crumbles upon the mere acceptance of others?
Yo fuck your French country. Give back Africa all there materials and resources.
I think you would greately benefit from touching grass my friend, you seem too obsessed with "the west has fallen, billions must die" and took it too close to heart >!although I can't say there is no grounding to what you say!<
That is a moronic way of thinking. You are merely putting focus on cases that further your agenda when there are cases which show the opposite.  
  
Let's look at countries like Brazil for example. The country is mixed as all hell immigrants from all over moved in over centuries of history and the result? The cultures merged and gave birth to new ones. Beliefs centuries old are still practiced today.   
  
Immigrants will gravitate towards communities that are closer to what they are used to yes. There are many communities of people from similar places here. However they do not simply "destroy" pre-existing cultures in place. The only way a culture trully die is if the descendants lose interest in their native culture and gravitate towards others.  
  
But all that aside here's the real kicker. Even without taking into account immigrants your culture and everybody else's has already changed and been affected because we live in a globalized world. Work culture, transportation, food, entertainment and many other things have changed and been absorbed by many places. So like it or not your culture will not remain pure. It already is not pure because unless your country is completely isolated and had no outside contact whatsoever with other places your culture has already suffered outside influence and changed as a result.   
  
All that is to say it's not immigrants that will change your culture it has already changed in this interconnected world. Making this "fear of outsiders" just plain moronic and pointless. Might as well close all borders and cut all outside contact. But that is not feasible now is it?
What people like you lack is basic history. Japan should stay isolated you say? Do you know that their written characters are chinese? So should we cancel everything after they stole China's characters because it wasn't really japan from this point? Do we stop when western religion was 'introduced' to japan?

Or is it when Overlord took 90% of its cultural origins in concepts that are not even from Japan?

What is your stopping point?
If it's important then your people should take care it doesn't get lost, what? How is a foreigner going to stop anyone from preserve your culture? You're just looking for excuses to try to disguise your racism and xenophobia, guess what? Keep crying on social media, it's the only thing you and people like you can do wah wah wah lol

Without the west Overlord would have never existed or you think internet, DnD and, hell, the word Overlord itself come from Japan? Lmao, most characters are blondes and almost every kingdom is inspired by a country from the west 💀
Fuck em. I'm sure at some point we'll get a decent quality fan translation.
Or he could just translate it and release it at a huge profit and avoid that situation entirely.
Pretty much this exactly.
>You don't get to release something in a globalized world, refuse to make it available in other countries and then cry about people using other methods to get it.

Yes you can. Just because the author doesn't cater to a certain fanbase doesn't suddenly make piracy okay.

It's to be expected that people will pirate his work but he can still express how he feels about it.

>You refused to let other people give you money, so you don't lose money from them pirating it. It's your own fucking fault

So if someone goes to their local grocery store and they don't want to sell them an item. Does that make it okay for that person to rob the store? Does that somehow make it the owners fault? I don't see how that makes sense.
>Its his right but hes likely using it as an excuse if im right, remember the side story book and how he said hes shortening the series due to the translating? While likely it was burnout. Yes he has all rights to do it but hes basicly baiting people into it too.

I am not gonna debate the author's intentions of why he does something. What you stated could very well be the case but I don't know for certain.

> Not saying its good or bad but its expected behavior that he should know.

Yes, I know it's to be expected and I assume he probably knows that too but I doubt that would change how he feels about the whole thing.

It doesn't make his complaints any less valid or make him out to be the bad guy as so many people I've seen try to make him.
>If you have no plan on translating something, you also have no right to complain when fans do it themselves. 

No. If he doesn't wish for his own work and property to be pirated, and then someone goes against that wish, he has every right to complain.

I think anyone can expect that their work will be pirated but that doesn't necessarily change their feelings towards the whole thing.

>It's entitled to think your works should be restricted to one language only

He's not entitled to anything because It's literally his work and property. He gets to decide what happens to it.

I understand the frustration you're feeling, I don't like it as much as the next person but let's not act all entitled.
? what are you talking about?  I think you are mistaken here.  Let me try to clarify.

Topic Poster was suggesting the Overlord author was possibly racist.

In response, I pointed out that the real world example of what is going on in Europe (mass illegal migration of people who many/most hate western values) is being witnessed by Asia (including Japan).  And maybe the author is xenophobic because he is watching what is going on in the West.

I hope that helps clear things up!
.... are you seriously calling him racist because he's fed up with North American fans? \*LOL\*
I didn't know about that, but it would explain a good deal.

Toudou would 100% be the protagonist of the romcom
My boy maruyama probably got inspiration for nazarick From WW2-era japan and wanted an excuse to make a perfect master race that is obviously superior to everyone by mere fact of existence.

"we will create a perfect utopia, but first we must kill every single person that disagrees or inconveniences us no matter how small because we are and always will be right. There is simply no room for discussion." 

I love overlord, but i think our buddy Maruyama over there might just be someone who secretly likes old japan and thinks the Japanese are fundementally superior to everyone else.

I'm pretty sure he's self-aware about how evil nazarick is but if he's a fan of old Japan then he will always look for ways to justify nazaricks actions. The other morally bankrupt nations in the New world are just there for him to say "see, nazaricks genocide and skin harvesting farms don't make them all that evil in this new world".
That's the in-story justification, but the parallel remains. And given the real life influence, and the disdain shown for foreigners, it's no surprise.
Replace friends with countrymen and ancestors.
Tipical socialist leader...
I didn't realize it was that bad .  I thought it was  all joke with how Ainz isn't actually playing 5d chess, and its his  subordinates that both carry him and blow everything out of proportion as  a running gag .
The difference between the weird creepy shit in anime and the ones you mentioned in western shows is the acts in the western shows are specifically called out for being disgusting. Herogasm is specifically a disgusting depraved event that morally bankrupt supes participate in and the whole event shows them in a bad light. The giant incest baby is specifically a joke in an entire episode about Morty being disgusting. I think when done that way, it is generally not seen as creepy as when these things happen in some anime where these acts are not being shown as creepy. A prime example is stuff like Overlord or Goblin Slayer. These shows do have many shitty things happening but most of the time they are done by legitimate monsters and inhuman criminals. I can see why some wouldn’t like to see such dark shit, but they are not inherently problematic like other anime content. I’m not going to sit here and act like creepy shit doesn’t get created in the West or in another Asian media. They are and they are rightfully criticized. See the new Blake Lively movie about an abusive relationship that seemingly glorifies it for the most recent reference. I’m just tired of Anime fans acting like just because they like anime in general that anime cannot be weird and creepy OR that criticizing creepy shit in anime is some sort of offense against Japanese culture. Rising of the shield hero is a pedophile’s dream. I can say that and still like One Piece. Redo of a Healer is a rape fantasy only about raping those who did you wrong. I can say that and still like Howl’s Moving Castle. 

Also, just as an aside, just because you haven’t encountered many of these tropes doesn’t mean that it isn’t a legitimate problem. You don’t even have to consciously look for it like you are assuming. If you watch isekai genre a lot, you will find many manga and anime glorifying slavery, rape, pedophilia. If you watch/read romance dramas enough, and you’ll run into numerous NTR stories which is essentially just rape stories.
You were given an argument. You just didn't like it.

Regardless, people shit on western cartoons endlessly as well. Sorry that people outside of Japan don't absolutely revere every single anime that's released and point out the truly garbage or nonsense anime like those Loli fetish anime as one example.

But hey, let's just say everyone else is pathetic because they criticise my anime that revolves around a harem of little girls (10 year Olds). There are many great anime and many trash anime just like there are many great cartoons and many trash cartoons.

There will always be criticism for entertainment. Calling everyone else pathetic is the genuinely pathetic thing to do. 

The foreign market for anime is absolutely massive right now so there's no excuse to hate on foreign fans of your work then complain that you're not making as much money as you wanted to be making. If you specifically shit talk foreigners regularly and refuse to release content for us, why must we buy your work or care for your opinions?
You’re a weirdo for defending loli tropes. Pdfiles should neck themselves

If you think that’s normal, we should probably investigate your hard drive
Thanks for buying this game from our site and not getting it off a pirate site when ya couldn't access it due to our own rules we put in place 


👍👍 kinda similar to what the triple A comps be doin.
I do believe he said it made him lose motivation and he was going to cut the series down. I do agree with the primary issue he had was with recalling of the novel immediately after it came out, but when it has specific requirements and is limited edition I am not sure what he expected.
If he was not angry. Why cut story short?
I always get excited when I see a new SK title for sale at my local bookshop
Most (If not all) single race countries are generally racist. Heck even multicultural countries are not safe.
That sounds pretty crazy to me if that’s true. Not saying you’re wrong just that it sounds crazy.
Everyting you said is from our perspective. All we've ever known is a modern, inclusive, peaceful, equal, sheltered (all relatively ofc) world. Even our wars have rules. Both Ainz's original earth and the NW is faaaaaar from anything we've ever experienced and likely ever will experience.


>Demiurg's Happy Farm - Wrong.

They're in a completely new world with different (compared to both the game and earth) natural laws that are still mostly unknown to Nazarick. To figure out what they don't know they need a way to easily and efficiently obtain data. Thousands of lab rats they can manipulate however they wish is a good start. And so they do experiments to obtain that required data to find ways to improve Nazarick without considering anything else. Yes he's evil, but in his eyes he's not. 

Also, we kill tens of millions (some estimates put it at 200mil) of lab rats and other animals (dogs, rabbits, cats, monkeys etc) EVERY YEAR for the sake of gathering data. To some that's evil, to others it's for the greater good. 

>Wiping out an entire Kingdom and its people for the unsanctioned actions of a handful of lower ranking individuals - Wrong.

Ainz didn't wipe out the kingdom because of the caravan. He would have wiped them out regardless, it was just a scheme to give him a reason to use as a casus belli. To show all other external forces "If you act against us, even a little, you're done". With this example, it should reduce casualties on all sides in the long run.

>Genocide - Wrong.

Yes, to us in 2024. There are plenty examples of genocides throughout history. That would not be the case if there weren't individuals for whom the massacre was justified/morally right. Heck some saw it as a "sacred duty" to wipe out certain populations.

>Using sapient beings as materials (This happened in Death Camps in WW2, where people were turned into soaps, for example) - Wrong.

Again, to us yes.

>Torturing prisoners to break their will and indoctrinate them - Wrong.

Yea, to us at this point in time.... well most of us. Torture is still very much utilised for a wide variety of applications. Just not publicly.

>Saving innocent villagers from raiders - Right.

From our and the villagers's pov yea. The "raiders" were executing a false flag operation to lure out and ambush Gazef to get rid of the Kingdom's strongest force. So to the Theocracy, Ainz's actions of saving the villagers and Gazef and killing that Sunlight scripture squad was wrong. Like objectively so(to them).

>Sometimes it's futile to speak of shades of gray, when some issues are back and white. Momonga is the ultimate evil, after all, regardless of how bad other characters are.

God damn you're stubborn. Try putting yourself in others' shoes. See through their eyes. Then you just might understand them. Understanding them still doesn't mean you have to agree with them on anything.

Edit- Apparently I was off on the estimates, it's quite a bit higher than I thought
Apparently brutal fascist genocidal regimes aren't absolutely wrong because their societies don't think it's wrong🤷🏾‍♂️
Did hitler think it's wrong? His generals? Those unhinged scientists? His most ardent supporters? The indoctrinated SS? A not insignificant portion of the population at that time?

To us it's unimaginable to believe what they did and do what they did, but to them it's a matter of course. Through our eyes they were evil incarnate. Through their eyes they were doing the righteous thing. We believe it's objectively wrong. They believe it's objectively right.
I have ok with making some things exclusive to Japan, like let’s say a special Overlod action figure, or even the physical copy of the book itself with cool cover, but to try to stop people from reading all together is messed up no matter how you look at it. Even if the author doesn’t think it comes from a racist reason, that doesn’t mean it’s not from a deeply enraged racist reason. Many people have racist biases without even realizing it because it was instilled into their upbringing, ect. He probably isn’t a straight up racist, but if he really doesn’t want foreigners to read his exclusives then there is definitely some racism deep down in there, but it’s as you say probably more of a culture issue than a him issue.
You can actually say that, theres no need pretend this nonsense has any value lol.
There is no grounding to what I'm saying, lol ? There is plenty, you just need to look at the the statistics for the population's origin and you'll see that the endogenous population is being replaced very fast. This is not a theory lol, it's something that everyone agree
How this is not feasible? Japan and asian coutnries are doing it for decades

I do not think Brazil is a good example lol, The country was born from ashes after the majority of the local population was killed, so naturally there were only immigrants at the start and no local culture and almost no history.  
The true question is : Why do you want to force immigration on a country that doesn't want it?
You're completely off the mark;, Irony upon irony, you're the one lacking basic history because kanji have nothing to do with Chinese people immigrating to Japan.  
Japan didn't adopt kanji because it was colonized by China, they simply learned it by reading Chinese documents and by commercial relationship. It has absolutely nothing to do with immigration.  
I'm not saying Japan should live in autarky, just that it shouldn't allow mass immigration like western societies does.
What are you talking about lol? That's ironic I'm not the one crying, it's you and the others complaining that maruyama do not like you.
Maruyama isn't in charge of translation ._.
In what fucking world would a grocery store refuse to sell you something, unless you're underage and trying to buy booze and cigarettes?

The fact that you have to reach like that just goes to show that you got fuck all, bub. Piracy in a case like this is a moral obligation.
grocery store analogy is a bit off. it's more like if the grocery store refused to sell an item and you went elsewhere to get it. maruyama, the grocery store, literally isn't affected.
> Yes you can. Just because the author doesn’t cater to a certain fanbase doesn’t suddenly make piracy okay.

Yes it does.
Why do you think it's wrong to steal from your local grocery store? Can you give a reason that also applies to digital piracy? Is it just stealing bad?
Leaving aside that equating intellectual property to physical goods is a *debatable* position, that example is crap. It would be more like:

You ask a chef to prepare you one of his famous meals, he refuses so you copy his original recipe and do it yourself.


A physical good is something tangible that exists. Intelectual property does not. The point of copyright is to make it so intellectual property isn't easily copied (something you can't do with a physical good) but this is only intended so the creator won't lose on profit. If there is no profit to be had then there is no argument to defend such intellectual property.
He wouldn't be complaining about it if he just released official translations of his work though.

I respect the guy and have been a huge fan of his work ever since I watched the anime, but I don't know what he was expecting when he decided he was not going to release it outside of Japan.
Honestly, I don't even consider it piracy if there is no legal alternative. It does not harm him in any way, shape or form. He loses nothing and is still unhappy about it.

Also, I disagree. He's essentially saying "If you don't speak Japanese, I do not want you to read it." How is that fair to any fan outside of Japan? If he will not care for his other fans, why should we care to respect his wishes on who can read his work?
Its stupid your being up voted because people don't understand the dissonance they are feeling between someone complaining about not wanting them to have access to something they made. 

It's tough, I do think he's being a huge dick about it all, but ultimately, he does have a right to have his opinions and wishes. It's his product, it's his IP it's his thoughts and words and images on paper. 

Ultimately we are the consumer, but he doesn't /have/ to sell it to us. 

It's like the case of that Ultra Black Pigment / pink or whatever and the whole "This must not be sold to that Dick Head" guy. 

Except in this case, the dick head is us. And it's not a nice feeling to see that someone doesn't want /us/ for no reason other than his own bias.
Yes I'm serious. What's the reason for him being fed up of north american fans for no reason? And you think he only hates north Americans ? when in fact he hates all non-Japanese people in general. Yeah a racist and people stop being a saint, stop protecting a racist.

If I had a nickel for every author of a largely successful manga/anime actively trying to piss of their fanbase in the past 2 months I would have 3 nickels...

Which isn't a lot, but it's weird it happened thrice.

(Gege tweaking after not killing a fan favourite character for half a page, Koheis Midoriya and his ability All for fucking nothing and Maruyama hating me for not speaking the hentai language)
A subtle lesson that can be learned is that just because everyone does it, doesn't mean we should stoop to their level. Evil is evil no matter the intention.

You don't stick around when the lowlands flood, you take to high ground and wait it out.

Also, if I were a New Worlder, I'd probably start running and hiding. Chances are big that if the History of the New World is anything to go by, Ainz may meet his match generations down the line. If it happened to the last undead player, it can definitely happen again.
I mean valid but he also paints the denizens of Nazarick as monstrosities and villainous
"he will always look for ways to justify nazarick's actions"

Just like a certain fandom
It's honestly why I stopped reading overlord around volume 14 or so things just became too much. I had always hoped that Ainz would develop a little tiny bit beyond the thinly disguised nationalistic naive narcissism but after 14 volumes I gave up.
Oh no the problem exists for sure, even if I'm not looking for it, and I'm not trying to be that example of "I like anime, don't criticize" you mention. From the begining I'm just saying if the reason this guy doesn't want his stuff brought over here is due to how annoying we are, then I fully understand him. Hell that might not even be the reason at all, I just listed some examples of how absolutely tiring some people get, parroting their moral high ground and I got jumped and called a pedophile so... Point in case at it's finest lmao.

Best of all is how in most of the times people acting like internet vigilantes are later found guilty of shit. Just gotta look for the "reset the countdown" meme
I was given an argument yes, for something different. People misunderstood what I said and the conversation derailed into lolis much like you're doing yet again, seriously, we've already addressed this so I have no idea why you're reviving the whole thing.

I said IF, "IF" the reason the guy doesn't want his shit brought over is due to how a loud minority yucks at anime and Japanese media then I get him, some people are hypocrites for only dissing Japan and not just overall media with disgusting topics. (Almost like they go out of their way to dig up the worst in anime, almost like they consume it)

And that may not be the reason at all. It most definitely isn't, the guy might just be racist for all I care, I just threw an idea. 

It was proven right here I wasn't lying though, I said people on this side of the globe freak out about anime and are annoying, and what happened? A guy immediately freaked out, jumped the gun calling me a pedo, AND was annoying lol what more proof do you need, it's right here
Alright point me towards the part where I defended loli tropes. If you're not actually illiterate though, read my other reply. Loli tropes are weird but if you consume too many to complain about them, you might be the problem, not japan

Edit: and this Maruyama fella is right about you lol
Basically, yes. In fact, the ones who took care of taking down translations were kadokawa and Yen Press
All he was told is that his work was being translated illegally. There wasn't really a mention about it being the extra volume, and based on what he said later, it's likely he thought they were selling it illegally. In my post, I go to talk too about the number of volumes, and since the earliest mentions, he knew it would end on volume 18. He most likely was joking since he was asked ¿shouldn't you do something?

In other comment he said about volume 16 and it sounds like he is tired and wants to end it when you translate it to english. However it says that, he was tired so he will finish volume 16 at his own pace
He didn't. In the post I made, I link past statements he made, and even before the incident, where he already stated it was going to end around volume 18 to 20. Even if he knows enough to make up to 50, he never planned on writing that much.

Also, even after saying he would, we know since 2022 that it's still going to be 18 volumes even after what he said
I want you to make the same arguments, you made here to justify the conquest of Middle and South America by Spain and Portugal in the 15th and 16th century. What the Conquistadors did is far easier to rationalize. Or how about the actions of the Japanese Unit 731 in WW2?

Nothing you said is any justification, showing a degree of grayness. All you do is say that the people who commit these immoral, evil actions have their reasons, which is obvious.
Objective is something that is what it is irrespective of what you think of it or what others think of it. Think “universal truths”. Everyone knows killing for no proper reason, like self defense, is absolutely wrong. So something like what the Nazis did in the past and what the Zionists are doing in the present *is* objectively wrong irrespective of what you and I think about it.

What you’re describing is subjective right and wrong which is based on the perspective of the person doing it and the perspective of others that are witnessing it.

And shades of grey exist with absolutes, they are not mutually exclusive like what someone was implying. Kinda weird when you think about it, why do people still think only shades of gray exist only and no absolutes to this very day and age?
I get it English is not your first language. dunno about French, but in modern English and (some) other languages double negative means positive.
Yet their culture still remains and it influenced the countrie's own culture of today is what i'm trying to say. Even on a bloody unjust case indigenous culture, legends and other ways still influence and are present against overwhelming odds.  
  
And like i stated your culture has already been "taken over" as has everybody else's. They are not the same as they were. That is a fact. Our eating habits, entertainment, ways of transport, ways of work, media and so on were and are influenced by other cultures like it or not. It is impossible for a culture and way of life to not be influenced in some shape or form in this day and age unless the country completely isolates itself. And that i'm sorry is not feasible unless you want to cut out all trade to the outside world. That means cutting off internet access, trade, communication, technological and medicine advancements in other places, the works.  
  
I'm not saying we should stuff Japan full of people with no control or reason since the place wouldn't even have enough living space or internal structure to accomodate a lot of people anyway. What i'm saying is this fear of outsiders entering the country and changing the whole culture is moronic because it already happened and no immigrant presence was needed. Controlled immigration can be a boon. It's completely uncontrolled mess ones such as in some countries in Europe that make it an issue for all parties involved. Wanting to disguise your xenophobia and fully close off the country while being hostile to all and any outsiders under the guise of maintaining your culture as it always was is silly because it has already changed and will continue to change.   
   
And let's not pretend outsiders only bring to the table the destruction of your culture lest we forget you and i are right now using outside technology and media to even have this discussion about a work heavily influenced and based around western authors, themes and history. Not wanting uncontrolled full open border immigrant presence is fine because that only causes issues. But having problems with people from other countries by itself or controlled immigration just shows one's hypocritical intolerance and xenophobia even though they still enjoy boons heavily inspired or outright made outside their country.
I never said it was because of immigration, I said it didn't originate from Japan. And as it is, without immigration, Japan's population is going down anyway. So we will see how things turn out for them in the end I guess.
The grocery store example 💀 smartest redditor
>In what fucking world would a grocery store refuse to sell you something, unless you're underage and trying to buy booze and cigarettes?

That's not the point but it's interesting how you choose to distract from it.

The point is not whether that scenario is realistic or not. The point is that whether it's okay to rob the store after refusal of service and whether or not that's the owners fault.

If your attitude towards the author's choice regarding what to do with his own property is anything to go by and assuming you're consistent, the answer would be yes which is fucked up.

>The fact that you have to reach like that just goes to show that you got fuck all, bub. 

It's not a reach. It's a hypothetical that's meant to demonstrate how nonsensical you sound.

>Piracy in a case like this is a moral obligation.

I think you're just entitled.
>Honestly, I don't even consider it piracy if there is no legal alternative. 

The definition of piracy is clear. It's the unauthorized use or reproduction of another's work.

It's piracy.

>It does not harm him in any way, shape or form. He loses nothing and is still unhappy about it.

Financial harm is not the only type of harm. If he's unhappy about, it's clearly affected/harmed him on some level.

If you think that's silly and that he should grow thicker skin, that's perfectly fine. I too find it silly but that doesn't change how he feels.

>Also, I disagree. He's essentially saying "If you don't speak Japanese, I do not want you to read it." How is that fair to any fan outside of Japan? 

It's not about fairness and it never was.

Do I feel it's unfair? I absolutely do. But that's feelings, not truth or fact.

And it also doesn't change that it's still his property and he is free to sell or distribute however he feels like.

>If he will not care for his other fans, 

He's not obligated to. Our relationship doesn't extend beyond buying a product and receiving it. 

If he doesn't want to make a particular product available, then that's that.

We can pirate it but if he expresses negative feelings towards us doing that, let's not act like he's doing something wrong here.

>why should we care to respect his wishes on who can read his work?

The same way you don't steal or damage the property of other people even if they don't let you use it.
I share those feelings too. It frustrates, saddens and angers me a lot.

If I lived in a world where maruyama had his way, I probably wouldn't have got to experience the amazing world and story of overlord and all the excellent discussions and debates that people in this subreddit have or all of the fanart and fanfiction other fans create.

That thought absolutely terrifies me. Overlord is like in the top 3 of my list of favorite works of fiction. 

My intention was never to invalidate anyone's feelings and if I did, I apologize. All I was trying to do is remind people that we're consumers at the end of the day.
TLDR - Horikoshi forgot being a teacher outside Japan or the Scandinavian regions tends to be suck, he didn't establish Midoriya working at any agency to still follow his dream, and he unknowingly sacrificed the main ship for the sake of not getting sent death threats

To be fair to Horikoshi, in my opinion, Midoriya's situation looking bad is due to 1) Cultural differences towards teachers, 2) the clash with Midoriya's childhood dream, and 3) him being sick of the shipping fanbase standing on his neck

1) See, in Japan, not only are teachers not treated like c--p, they are actually highly respected individuals in the community, and they get paid well - Now, adding Midoriya's alumni and hero status, he is sure to be getting paid well.

It's ironic because Horikoshi had not considered how Western people's perception of teaching careers would affect things - to them, it looked like U.A out of pity, let him become their first quirkless teacher.

2) This clashed with the narrative given to us in the first few episodes, that he would become Japan's NO. 1 hero and effectively become the next "Symbol of Peace". While there are heroes who decided to focus on teaching the next generation, the writing in the last chapter gives off the negative impression that Midoriya let Bakugo have all the credit for stopping Shigaraki, which feels impossible - the world already knows "Deku" the hero, so they would recognize who was boxing Shigaraki on the live feeds, and Bakugo would be livid if he tried.

It's made worse by the contrast in the success of his peers. Rather than speaking to how Midoriya checked in on them all from time to time, Horikoshi focused on how adults  drift apart - an understandable aspect, but in this context it made Midoriya's classmates look like asshats due to cases of villainy dropping significantly. I feel like Horikpshi got rushed into ending things because the epilogue deserved at least five chapters, in my opinion.

3) I feel like the irritating vagueness of Uraraka and Deku's relationship was Horikoshi attempting to compromise with the rabid side of the MHA shipping fanbase

They can't be pissed that Midoriya ended up with Uraraka over their preferred ship if it's never explicitly shown, but at the same time, this backfired for him, as the lack of a clear payoff despite the two being built up as a couple over 6 seasons infuriated anyone that supported the main ship, which was only worsened by the idea that she of all people didn't see Midoriya regularly
Potentially he’s the last player from Yggdrasil to be summoned though right? Since the servers shut down?
Man after hearing that. I'm putting the author next to Gates Author. But only for him hiding better then the other guy
>I said IF, "IF" the reason the guy doesn't want his shit brought over is due to how a loud minority yucks at anime and Japanese media then I get him, some people are hypocrites for only dissing Japan and not just overall media with disgusting topics

There were a lot of people that shat on and still do shit on cartoons relentlessly to an extent. There will always be people who hate on some form of entertainment almost exclusively.

The problem is that you're using those people who are declining in number to justify the unwarranted hatred from a dude who comes from a country that is notorious for hating on foreigners and spiting them just because they can.

Maruyama complains about money but he makes no effort to make overlord more accessible to foreigners or atleast he's not talking about his attempts. He'd rather just spite us with Japan only exclusives and tell us how much he dislikes us.

You can't talk about being "annoyed" at foreigners hating on your product when you have a massive loyal foreign fan base. There is no sense to it.

You're doing what maruyama is doing. You're casting a wide net over all non-Japanese. A lot of US love overlord and liked maruyama but he'd rather find a shallow excuse to dunk on us.

>It was proven right here I wasn't lying though, I said people on this side of the globe freak out about anime and are annoying, and what happened? A guy immediately freaked out, jumped the gun calling me a pedo, AND was annoying lol what more proof do you need, it's right here

So you're telling me the gargantuan foreign anime market that outnumbers the Japanese market (or atleast will soon) is irrelevant because of the few that dislike anime? 

>And that may not be the reason at all. It most definitely isn't, the guy might just be racist for all I care, I just threw an idea.

You began your argument with insults by calling non-Japanese "pathetic" and "annoying" then now you're upset that you're getting heavy pushback? You begin with insults then you're upset that we downvote you for your unfathomably cringe take?
I mean that's clearly not the case because the rest of his fucking story is published in other languages and so is the anime adaption (and the manga as well IIRC). So why are you throwing around hypotheticals if not because you want to go on a stupid ass rant?

Maruyama is salty because he is an old timer who believes shi is still analogic and thus can have a book with a limited publication stay as such when in truth it'll be disseminated all over the world in PDF/EPUB/MOBI format in 5 minutes after the first guy with a printer and a modicum of interest geta a copy (and at least*one* such guy will) and because he, like a ton of japanese corpos, forgets that the japanese market isn't the titan it used to and that making stuff *only* for such market isn't the winning idea it used to be.
Bro, you can’t actually be that dimwitted

“If there’s enough loli shit for it to be a problem with you, you’re obviously the problem and not the source of the problem!!!”

And you kinda defended loli tropes by ridiculing detractors with “omg this character age” and “this is obviously the fault of people being exposed to those tropes” as if Shield Hero and other media have loli disclaimers lmao, you pinecone

It’s such a problem that I have to try to actively avoid it, same thing with the harem shit. Those are gross and an indicator of warped psychosexual development. No normal adult with a healthy sex life is into those things, those are deviant paraphilias. If you don’t notice them, then maybe you just aren’t that observant
Ngl i dunno who kadokawa is but he sounds like a right ass.
This is exactly what I'm talking about. We don't think we're subjectively right, your comment proving exactly that. We think that what we believe is the objective truth, but it's not. We don't see the whole picture, nobody does, no human can. We're looking at the world through a keyhole, unable to open the door.

Much (not everything ofc) of what we think of as "universal truths" are still subjective views. We think we're being objective, they think they're being objective. We think the "truth" of a matter is one thing, they think it's another. We say they're wrong, they say we're wrong.

>Everyone knows killing for no proper reason, like self defense, is absolutely wrong.

And that "proper reason" would differ from person to person, culture to culture, religion to religion, country to country etc. It's a "universal truth" (murder = bad, except for x, y, z reasons) but those reasons are still subject to the beliefs of people. In that case, is it still a universal truth?

>And shades of grey exist with absolutes,

What about where shades of grey and absolutes intersect? Think "the trolley dilemma".

>why do people still think only shades of gray exist only and no absolutes to this very day and age?

Because if those shades of grey can influence the absolutes, they are not absolutes.
My bad, I misread your message, I apologize for that.
Yes and it is still completely off topic, obviously every country in the world have been influenced by others countries in the history. It's not the subject, we are talking about immigration here
No, your hypothetical is completely irrelevant. The refusal to translate one's intellectual property is not comparable at all to a store refusing to sell a physical good.

First of all, fan translations of otherwise untranslated works don't "steal" anything from the owner. They have lost nothing. Furthermore, if a grocery store did ban me for some reason I could simply go to another grocery store. There's only one overlord and its author is a racist asshole.
If a legal alternative is not available, piracy should be legal. But then, it becomes a moral discussion so that's another topic.

He's not doing anything morally wrong sure. But can you honestly say it's wrong to read words on a screen, just because the author doesn't want you to read them? Is it also wrong to mod a game, if the creators don't want you to? Both can be illegal, neither are, in my opinion, immoral.  
  
Nothing is being stolen or destroyed (Piracy was ruled not to be theft by several courts). He could have ignored it and not even a single thing in his life would have changed. But he chose to get angry at his own fans for the crime of enjoying his work not in the exact specific way he wants them to.   
  
So I don't feel sorry for him, and I don't feel bad for pirating the works he wants to keep me from reading.
I find it ridiculous as to how you're not even agreeing with Maruyama's way of doing things, but merely stating facts from a legal, IP, and ownership as a creator standpoint, and people downvoting you to oblivion.
I understood you. In a way, this essentially can be seen bi-optically: either a) he values and respects his culture and wants you to have to learn Japanese and engage with the media as it was written or b) he doesn't like foreign cultures and hates it being translated for "others" 

Given his seeming disdain, I'd wager it's B. 

He's allowed to have his feelings, but damn it sucks to see a tactic acceptance of bias/racism/dislike for us just because we're not Japanese.
Very true. We can't forget the japanese culture of... I don't know how to actually explain it. The extreme politeness you have to have makes some fans believe they can dictate what you should do with your own artistic expression. I am a photographer and if someone came to me angry with possible death threats because they didn't like my photos, that I owe them or something, I wouldn't be saving up my "fuck off"s. But the Japanese culture is a little bit different. If you are a successful artist YOU OWE to your fanbase, just a different culture I guess.
It's implied that all the players summoned were on during the server shutdown, and they were simply scattered throughout time and have been arriving about every 200 years. Yggdrassil didn't last 200 years so it's not like it was a 1:1 ratio.
Happy cake day! What happened to the Gates author? I never played that anime/light novel much attention.
I'm sure you're right about the guy and know more about him, (I'm just here cause of the anime) like I said, just threw an idea

Also yeah I used "fucking pathetic" lightly without realizing lmao force of habit, you all are on your right if you got offended, still not comparable to being called a pedo thought, even if gen Z made it their force of habit for anything they don't like. Also don't worry I didn't get upset, this was mildly amusing
"So why are you throwing around hypotheticals if not because you want to go on a stupid ass rant?"

I don't know man maybe you're projecting and you're the one who wanted to go on a stupid ass rant, again I just threw an idea. Inb4 "oh but then you made 20 comments" yeah cause I got 20 replies
Well you might just have out-dimwitted me cause I only brought up how paranoid people are with character ages. It was every other reply including you blindly calling me a pedophile who immediately thought of loli. Not making shit up, loli didn't cross my mind at that moment, just the people who freak out when they see a picture of goddamn Kobayashi and ask how old she is lmao.

THEN I picked up the term to defend myself. But good on you good samaritan for avoiding those tropes, I just wanted to talk about how annoying we are on this side of the border and you proved a prime example
Kadokawa is a company
Not really, my friend. Objectivity exists, and what you’re describing is subjectivity. You seem to not know what “universal truths” are, I’d recommend you look them up. Most of the human race, if not all would agree on those “universal truths”, hence the name. They are truths ingrained within us from birth, like how we all know that we “exist” in reality. There are exceptions, of course, but those are infinitely minuscule in number that they don’t represent anyone else.

Another example is how trees exist irrespective of us, that’s a universal truth, that the world exists around us. A specific person could have mental issues and hallucinate, but that doesn’t affect the reality around him, only his subjective experience with said objective reality. You are confusing what is subjective with what is objective.

And with all due respect, what you said about the killing makes zero sense and doesn’t reflect reality. Almost no one would say that if you’re in a situation where someone is trying to kill you and you ended up killing him in self defense, that it is a “bad thing” to do. Your life was in danger and you had to preserve it, it just happened that the guy died in the process.

Do you know where the shades of gray come into play in the previous example? It’s not the killing in self defense, but in whether there was no other option but to kill him, or if there were but you decided to just kill him anyway. That’s when “shades of gray” comes into play. That is why they can coexist, they are not mutually exclusive. But they can also exist without the other, like genocide and rape. They are absolute wrongs, and in no way shape or form can they become “shades of gray”.

And the part about religion is a long discussion, as objectively there can only ever be one true religion, not many, or 3, or 2, just 1. There can never be more than 1 giving different and opposing perspectives as absolute truths. So to know if the one true religion is aligning with objective reality you’d have to search for it and scrutinize other religions. So let us not go there now, it needs a separate discussion.
I even received a reddit care message like 2 hours after making my first comment. 

But it's to be expected. People who feel strongly about something will consequently have a strong reaction towards said thing being mishandled.
Is it implied? I missed that. I assumed it wasn’t a direct 1:1 yes of course just that it seemed like ainz is the last one.
> "no, u are" 

Truly the pinnacle of argumentation you are using here.


You went on a stupid ass rant mate, own up to it.
Reading your exchanges with the very bright r*dditors here has been funny😹😹
Just so you know your efforts aren't a complete waste.

Bald guy: "I have armor lock, you cannot possibly hurt me."

Skeleton: "I count six seconds, fuckface."
The manwa is Skeleton Soldier 


A story about a skeleton figuring out what's the purpose of he's existence, blue screen and some guy that keep appearing in books, 297 chapters with mostly regular publications.

Momonga before he decided he wanted to be a mage
Commenting so I can look this shit up later
Honestly this comic is excellent even with the like 20 chapter fever dream.
This got me cackling wtf, but tbf it's something along the line with this 

Also gives off "he's behind me isn't he" vibes lol
As frightening as it may be too see a spellcaster cast a powerful spell, nothing compares to the terror one must feel when the spellcaster just grabs a big rock and begins smashing with that.
“I have armor lock, you can’t possibly hurt me”

“I count six seconds fuckface.”

Felt like drawing this
2nd image ainz: I cast heavy fucking boulder
I would love to see this as an anime.
That's no momonga, its the skeleton soldier who couldn't protect the dungeon!
He definitely looks like a my type playable character. I love necromancers and skeletons
All great tyrants, kings, deities and devils need to start somewhere, y'know?
![gif](giphy|tnYri4n2Frnig)
This is a manhwa called Skeleton Soldier and its fucking amazing, please read it.
"I count six seconds fuckface" always gets me
Where do you read this? I've been using manganato but it's a rather poorly done, especially so in the 200th chapter mark and I'd really like to re-read it with quality

Also pretty funny, subaru's skeleton
Momonga if he went Skeleton Warrior instead of Skeleton Mage as his basic class.
I been meaning to get back into that
Good comic
He really went bump in the night
Got tired of this manhwa. Don't get me wrong it's good, but damn the repeats is crazy, and then it turned into harem going forward
I’m just imagining bad to the bone playing after every kill
Apparently Yggrasil is a Rust clone.
I have armor lock, you can’t possibly hurt me
Yo ho ho
Mh...
The mahnwa is good at the beginning and that's it ..
Would love a spin-off of momonga leveling up, unlocking skills, and building nazarick from the ground up
That manga was very nice... Before it went off the deep end that is
"Goddamn PK's camping at respawn sites!! I hate campers!!"

<Campers> "It's a valid strategy, I have no regrets"
Skeleton soldier i clearly start to get bored after 150th chapter last i remember he met demon lord and is in their realm
Yo ho ho
skeleton soldier is so peak
The oldest TPK Strategy.
It's really deep lore about when momonga struggled to protect nazarick
That’s probably what happened.
Yo, did Ainz try to kill Saitama cosplayer?
This is one of my favorite Manwha’s. Manhwa? I keep forgetting.
*bonkers*
I LOVE this manga!!! It's INCREDIBLE! I would love an anime!
Back when he was a spooky scary skeleton
I remember this. Manwa, it was interesting I'll say
By the power of calcium!

**Y O I N K** this is mine now
Based Gianni Matragrano reference
I really should pick it up again. It's very good for anyone that wants to give it a try
Really good read, it goes around time travels but without it being the same thing always, every time the mc goes back the story follows a completely different pattern and I love it
It is really good... until it isn't. There are a couple of manwha that suffer from trying to do too much or maybe they feel 'forced' to continue publication so they make the scope bigger and bigger until the story is a mess and the progression goes at a snail's pace.

This one does the job very well for more than 100 chapters, which are great. And then it starts to derail too much. The other manwha that does the same thing and it felt super disappointing is Survival Story of a Sword King.
I dislike manwha because even compared to japanese stories and even western comics they always drag on way too much. I remember following"The Gamer" only for nearly every few dozen chapters to create a new plot point with nearly next to no relation to the overall story; i also dropped "Tales of Gods and Demons" because they diverged so much from the "going to the past" trope and into a literal checklist of sidequests; the skeleton is no exception, if anything, it loses its focus so much it prefers infodumping about literally nothing and do "sidequests" instead of, y'know, protecting the dungeon.
The website I was using to pirate it stopped existing around when I got to the chapter where he >!gets underneath the castle and absorbs a fuckton of the magic metal!<

Does anyone have any recommendations on where I can find it elsewhere?
TT xx mm. In=7807=70
In response to all of you who think the manwa is slow.


I actually like that it builds up so fucking slow, with that said, following the ancient rules of internet we shall have a battle to dead, the one reaming will be more right than the others. Any objections?
It’s pretty boring, most action is presented as black screens with blue flashes to indicate big schwings

But ladies with huge honkabonga so it’s pretty ight
Also time loop everytime he dies. >!And godlike creatures that are likely players!<
Lemme search and read this
Last time I read it was when some guy came and took some of his powers or something inside the room with geniuses or heroes or something like that, how far has it progressed since then?

I don't remember the chapter anymore :(

(Sorry I don't know how to put spoiler tags :( )

It's been 7 hours have you looked it up yet?
I feel like it could takeover re:zero as thee "regression" anime
It's a joke about them both being skeletons.
Hah, my favorite part was when >! They put a car bomb on that one knight's horse before riding away. Then he learns this by rising from a pool of bloody water and mounting the horse. !< Its so much more tragic and funny as you learn more about those two later on.
I use Manganelo, I think it’s 1 - 2 chapters behind the current releases for translation, but it’s nearly at 300 chapters so it’ll take a bit to get there

r/suddenlypressure
The full name is like Skeleton Knight couldn't protect the dungeon.

Also, the Skeleton gets Save Point powers, just so you don't get confused about what happens sometimes, like I did.
I just finished catching up.
Last time I stopped was at the end of season 1.


tbh it starts falling off after s2.
Time travel you say... It seems you haven't read enough
That was my problem as well. It starts as a pretty good drama and the whole trying to find one's purpose. I liked that he gradually gets more powerful but not to the point where he has godlike powers, so things were still exciting. But then I think the author wanted to do some big twists which completely derailed the whole story. Because of that, I completely lost interest and don't think I'll ever pick it up again. Shame, because it had a great start.
I disagree, I think the themes of the story are the same until the end
Both of those manwha are my favorite 2 lol. Sure they do get unnecessarily complicated (more skeleton then sword king) but I feel like it adds so much depth to the worlds in them that you just don't find in other series. Also idk if you are up to date with sword king but is absolutely worth catching up right now because it is on fucking fire
From the chapter 100 it starts to get railed to the guy in the books, but very very very slowly
You would like solo leveling, basically the antithesis of what you said you dislike
Skeleton soldier is better planed I think, every little thing that is forshadow is revealed at some point, is a main plot point with a ton fuck of unknown things that are resolved by mini plot points. The only thing that got abandoned (until the writer seems convenient to get it back) is the bottomless pouch side quests
You’re talking about manhua not manwha. Also, the story is not related at all to dungeons, that’s a bad title.

Battle does not determine who is right, only who is left!

Coincidentally, i am in the toilet while reading this comment.
I disagree, it just starts explaining things more
I know it's not exactly a time travel, but it's easier to explain
Geez just reading the first chapter and already better than any chinese and korean manga I've read
Bro, that immediately redirected me through 7 websites :(.
Dayum ok so I guess I'll start at around 80 again 


But good to hear, I have many many tabs open with different ones and sometimes I forget them after a while
Coincidentally, I am also in the toilet reading this comment
idk it kinda start contradicting itself.
Like when he gets his major buff into s3 vs normal people.

But, the entirety of his early work, he is fighting normal people and gaining XP from them. But he just now gains the ability to do so? Huh?

It just feels like the author starts retconning himself out of no where to build up more hype and power, without making skeleboy strong enough to solo the verse. And repeat every season.


I still love it and await every release, I believe the author has also gotten better with colors overtime and his art is doing real good.
what is it exactly? been a while so I just forgot
if you hate the standard for class raking in manwas your going to like this one, it goes away very fast and they don't pretend that it matters
Use addblock

Get good, you either let them fuck you or you use an addblock
Not sure I understand what you’re saying. We know he’s recovering the abilities he lost from THEM while also unlocking new ones. Also everytime the assimilation decreases he unlocks something new
Timeloop
any more like this, possible in LN or other written formats?
I primarily read Manwha on my phone, so unfortunately that isn't really an option for me

I primarily read Manwha on my phone, so unfortunately that isn't really an option for me
I believe it was the start of season 3 he got the buff that made him "Anti-World".
Which at least in the translation I read, said he now got XP from killing ordinary humans. 

But he's always been able to do that, so it didn't really make sense to me. Re unlocking lost abilities like his sword skills or divine blade makes sense to me. But gaining levels from combat isn't something he ever had to unlock. Sure it was made better through absorb, but never just not there.
I think I'm dumb, I can't see the difference, both end up the same no?
Nope, just this one Xd sorry for the bad news

Timeloops is something you can’t control, IG.
Time travel is (typically) you going back I to the past at a point of your choosing.

A timeloop is a phenomenon that causes the target to restart their life at a random point in time and is triggered by something outside their control

It's like being Future Trunks from DBZ vs. Subaru from Re:Zero
That worked great!  Immediately blocked 7 ads!  Thank you!  Can't wait to get back into it, might restart at chapter 150ish, because I know I left off somewhere in the early 200s

What anime
Arc, the protagonist of Skeleton Knight From Another World. To summarize, like Ainz, he was playing a videogame as a skeleton race character, but instead of a Sorcerer with super OP guild resources who wants to conquer the world like Ainz, he's a good natured Warrior class guy who does the same OP stuff alone (or with his 2, sometimes more, party of friends)

I'm pretty sure they're talking about "Skeleton Knight in Another World"
It's Skeleton Knight in Another World. Only has one season right now but it has some good action scenes and has some fun humor. It's similar to Ainz in that he's a player from a game, is super overpowered compared to most things he's come across, is a skeletal guy that has to hide his face to not scare people. It differs in that he's a super nice dude that's allowed to actually be nice and doesn't have some emotional suppression system, he doesn't have a whole guild of NPC allies, and he does need to sleep and eat.

I'm not praising it, nor do I particularly like it, but as moderator of this subreddit, I have to make sure that everything remains civil and proper conduct is followed.
Additionally, as an artist myself, I don't see AI art as a threat, I see it as a tool capable of lowering the skill floor required to create a piece, making art more accessable, and as tool that gives an experienced artist an easier way to do "grunt work" like backgrounds.


Calling a moderator of the sub the r word isn't one of your finer moments, I'm sure, but I'm willing to let you off with a warning provided you promise to be more relaxed in the future; there's no need to get so worked up.

It's honestly a bit funny, getting so worked up over the injustice that is AI plagiarism (Though, to a much lesser extent I do agree) and then calling me a literal non-human, and effectively wishing for my death?


I suppose it's just a bit ironic, but either way, I suppose I'll follow your suggestions - both of them.

It's incredible how many people this skeleton has let die just to save face.
Like we all know Ainz isn't the good guy, but he's kinda worse than Clementine.
Nah look at that innocent face he would never
He's doing a great job..
It's interesting that he's not a bloodthirsty type of evil. He's just indifferent to immorality and that's terrifying.
He's like: damn a genocide, oops that's crazy, anyways I kinda want to take a vacation, seeing all these living beings die because of my goofy comments is tiring.
Honestly, one of the great things about Overlord is how it acknowledges that being as powerful as Ainz just *makes* you a shit person basically by default. I hate how so many stories revolve around petty-boy protagonists who constantly make these incredibly sociopathic choices, and yet the story and everyone in it treats them as if they’re not unhinged monsters. With Ainz, he is a monster. He knows he’s a monster. We know he’s a monster. It’s all pretty fucked up. And we’re all on the same page about it.
Is a normal salary man who became an emperor that's part of the course

Edit: I meant "par for the course"
I never understood why Lord Ainz never told his underlings he sympathizes with humans because he was one before becoming an undead. It's not like he was born as a skeletal undead.
That would imply he actually gives a fuck about human in general (not just a selected few). He doesn't.

Ainz-sama just doesn't care and doesn't have a better alternative, so he thought "why not". That's not what saving face means.

Saving face is a term associated with the most selfish kind of people. Ainz-sama considers the welfare of Nazarick as his top priority. Archie's parents and some other corrupted nobles are better examples of saving face.
He's saving face because of his circumstances. He still doesn't know (at least not in anime) if the faith of the Guardians can falter at will, hence he plays safe. You could see a "normal Ainz" in Vampire Princess of the Lost Country
Dudes aiming for a new killstreak record.
I mean, would you hesitate to stomp on some ants in order to keep your subordinate's respect?
As silly as it is in the context of fiction, this is actually a commentary on rulers. Wars are devastating to individuals, but the ruler's perspective is more based in the objectives and treats real lives ruined as a mere statistic in their risk-reward analysis.

Putin is trying to save face and meet his objectives, but the cost to human suffering is immense. Rulers too often are dissociated with the human cost of their decisions, and Momonga experiences this.
Truly a politician
Foolishness u/Bion61, foolishness. Might controlls everything. And without it, you cannot hope to protect anything. Let alone yourself.

It was the people's fault for not being strong enough to protect themselves. It was the father's fault that his child was killed by a fireball.  /s
if you think its to save face then your making excuses for them

he didnt "let people die to save face" he "ordered them killed to gain a benefit or prevent a loss"
Protect your honor with your life
Clearly you missed the part where it's all a plan to create an utopia, and all the victims are necessary sacrifices.

Or parchment material.
Overlord readers discover reading comprehension.
Isnt that what politicians usually do?
I mean why would he care?
just because they are human?

in his home world he walk through dead bodies on regular.For him human life is worthless without special skill or talent.
Anyone else thought this was The Predator for a second?
I love the discussion this beautiful work of art of a show encourages. It's just so good. :)
The difference between him and Clem is the difference between a dictator and serial killer. They legit just are not on the same scale. What she does in a year he does in like an hour.
All part of his 10k year plan.
It's a face worth dying for
MFW when I hit cancel instead of comment after writing a whole thing out...
nah bro hes chill
Does he even have One to save?
Bloop
Did anyone else notice that if you look at Einz's neck pretending that the shadow of where his neck would be are his eyes it looks exactly the same as the predator from Alien vs Predator
I feel like Trazyn would make a face like this
I am a little bit ashamed I enjoy the story so much.
Incredible?  It's only natural a supreme being like Lord Ainz would be thinking 1000 years in advance!  We can't possibly understand his scheming!  We must devote our meager capabilities to his cause regardless of our shortcomings.
Your Honor he was just doing a little bit of trolling, a bit of tomfoolery you could say
Doing it for the greater good of his people😩
Ainz is no worse than Clementine, he wouldn't be classified as a good guy, but he doesn't kill people for pleasure. Basically, this question is answered as "Would you choose your family or strangers?" Are you bad when you choose your family?

Editing for better understanding of what I'm saying:Well, maybe a little bit, but it has absolutely nothing to do with Clementine.
Save what?
https://preview.redd.it/2hrsk1yfis6d1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e00bf766c73bfe57222f9974475b057274b2e96
Its like as if you would kill another person for touching your sword with his sword, beccause you dont want to loose your honor as an person with a mythical status.

Oh wait, that happend actually.
He's doing the best he can... 🥺🥺🥺
My boy didn't do anything wrong
Nagash would be proud, and encourage him to do far, far worse
Mr. Skelly bones
Makes me wonder.

What if he didn’t have the emotional suppressions and racial mentality of his new body. What if he was just who he was before without nazarick and his old mind. It’s possible he would have joined gazef
Well, maybe if they weren’t so sinful (weak), they’d be worth keeping around.
This whole comment section and discussion is pointless. Why are we judging an undead's actions according to human ethics?
It should also be noted that his loss of empathy was part of the introductory chapters so.... Yeah
Um... no... he let some toys get broken.
I got to say, this bag of bones is a bit of a pushover.

I still love every bit of calcium he’s got.
I probably killed more ants with modern poison than he did with his acts.
I think that's what just further cements the tragedy of the story - ainz could have gone for a more passive route and his followers wouldn't have batted an eyelid, and most likely they probably would have been happy to have an ainz who could interact with them normally instead of role playing being the top lord and putting on this show. Now he's the head of a runaway train that has no means of stopping and ainz left feeling he can't stop it now.
Love the story but my justice boner hopes for the destruction of Nazarick in the end. It’s like reading a story about king Leopold the II or general Mao. While the story is about them, you know damn well they aren’t the hero of it, protagonist or not.
bro has the hardest job.. he literally has to make everything seem the way it is while limiting it, has to entertain the guardians aswell at the same time. give him a break
If you are that but buthurt just don't read it , ainz is an evil being , I like it because he is an evil being, stop crying
Literally the most suspicious face ever.
He is, but it's unironically very difficult for him to *not* do a great job in his position.
Not his fault by the way, that undead nature really ties his hands once he was out of the game and it started effecting him
It’s by far my favorite type of villain
Mamonga/Ainz is Neutral Evil incarnate. He’s not actively over seeing the brutality and blood shed, just overseeing it from a logistical level.
And then he ends up killing the elf king and finding a reason to genocide the theocracy.
I feel like just saying "all powerful people become evil" deprives Ainz of a critical level of agency as a character. He could choose to be a better person, but it's just easier for him not to be.
I mean society of that world is way shit so i think if they get genghis khan type ruler they would respect the differences of other species well don't you see how human treat all demi human in that world only people that are good are dragon kin kingdom people as they are stronger than humans otherwise they would be bad to them too
I think you meant "par for the course", it's a golf thing.
Undead's can be born from raw negative energy

They most likely assume ainz is one of those's or something Else altogether,after all '''how could you compare the supreme being to an average Undead much less a filty human'''
How would it imply that? Ainz is literally doing the whole "take over the world" thing because he mentioned it off-hand, Demiurge thought he was dead-serious, and Ainz went with it to not look stupid.

Everything that's resulted from that has been saving face. 

Nazarick doesn't really need to conquer the world to survive.
Nah. Even in the anime at this point, he knows the Guardians will do whatever he wants.

During the eradication of the kingdom, he had a hard time coming up with a good reason for it and settled on "making an example" as a reason after a minute of thinking about it.
Taking literally, I actually would **not** step on the ants. Why the hell should i step on ants to gain respect? That's very meaningless. If my subordinates are stupid enough to not respect me because i know it is meaningless to step on ants, so be it. I don't need such people. They know i am stronger than ants. And they know i am willing to kill the ants if they get in my house. That is why it is stupid.
Strength doesn’t determine the value of a creature
Not the same. Those "ants" can talk to Ainz and form bonds with him.

And Ainz doesn't even need to be sapient to have his subordinates respect. He could literally sniff his own non-existent farts and they'd still worship him.
I mean yeah, and it's usually viewed negatively.
His genocide isn't exclusive to humans.

Several different villages, species and kingdom have been clean out due to Ainz.
You shouldn't be ashamed. When a story is good it's just worth it.
blasphemy! all know that his machination stretch 10 000 years.
This. Right here.

What sets Overlord apart from from nearly every other isekai, isn't the villain protagonist, it's the ongoing responsibility that our protag arrives with. 

Nearly every other series is about cutting away those old responsibilities to engage in the freedom they prevent to explore our desires. Even when they do take on responsibilities, it's largely by choice, or not wanting to be *the bad guy* (which humorously, Ainz shares, except he is always appealing to Nazarick).
Ainz is not choosing his family over strangers. He is choosing to let strangers be slaughtered by the thousands to not look goofy in front of his family.
Who said I didn't like it?

Are you that butthurt over me calling Ainz evil?
He's looking at 2 buttons, one on his left says "Admit", the one on the right says "Kill everyone"
Yeah, see the number of "kind" mc these days. If one of them had been teleported, it would be like, 
Demiurge: "So even the last Supreme Being has left us, and in his place an imposter presents himself. We have nobody left. Nazarick's purpose has ended, and so it shall be demolished, along with this insolence of a fool who dare tarnish the name of our creators"
His initial reaction and response isn't his fault.

The atrocities he lets happen after *knowing* it's objectively wrong is on his hands though.
He wasn't such a good person before, he was the type of person that would walk beside the corpse of an orphan and not care.
Tbh much prefer the :

- "Ma'am I'm just doing my job." 

- "Hahaha, i love killing pathetic mortals."

Compare to :

-  "The author invented 100 reasons why I'm just allowed to be evil." 

But that's just me.
He accidentally finished a war and ended a pervert in his vacation time
That’s a fair criticism. But that’s kind of exactly what I mean. ‘Powerful’ people are just as trapped by circumstance as the powerless. He *could* have chosen differently, but he didn’t think he could so he never would. The idea of Ainz being this all powerful schemer, with plans within plans, always thinking 10 steps ahead, is a ridiculous delusion that’s rightly played for laughs.
That's made him human, look at all those powerful and rich men in the world and tell me "absolute power corrupts absplute" isnt true
Yes I did, english isn't my first language so I hear it as part of
I like part of the course. Never heard that one, but I think it is more fun than the standard phrase part for the course that I've heard my whole life b/c golf is lame tbh.
Yeah if anything it creates danger for Nazarick to make the entire world your enemy.  
Like PDL didnt even care about the first few genocides but now he is enough is enough.
Also the destruction of the kingdom because Demiurge misinterpreted his question as an alternative course of action. Ainz went along just so he wouldn't look bad to everyone, totally saving face.
Conquering the world is also finding his friends exercise.
It would **if** the series was still 20+ volumes. But there's not enough time left for the next batch of players to show up. Considering it's like \~250 years in New World time in between each isekai

I wish all the dang historical lore was going somewhere. Felt like the info dumps on the heroes and the Greed Kings was a Chekhov to a future invasion of the world. Like the taking over the world bit winds up unifying the world just in time to present a United front against the threat of a whole player guild, justifying Ainz going along with Demiurge's plan. Perhaps \~20 years after unification the "next generation" led by Climb following his tutor's footsteps and supported by Sebas have whipped a motley band of Godkins and ex-scriptures into shape.

Both of you are right, Ainz did it to save his face but at the same time, he did it because its trivia in his pov, its more "dang it, i  shouldnt agree to cover Josh shift, i miss my bed *sad face* "


When thing he deem really important, he have no issue put the NPCs in their place "stay here, daddy got this"


He is a dotting father who love to spoil his "kids" but also have enough backbone to ground them if needed
Maybe, but Ainz cant beat all of the NPCs alone and isnt actually a mastermind, so its less saving face and more saving his butt from a revolt.
That's because they were ready to destroy humans. Recall the scene where Ainz was facing so much difficulty while trying to explain why he was leaving some children and women alive while conquering the bordering villages of the kingdom (under the request of Pestonya). They barely agreed to him
I don't know. Maybe the floor is wet so anyone step on it would instantly trip and do a 360° before face plant and break their jaw bone? Maybe the only part where the floor is dry have bunch of ants crawling everywhere doing their morning exercise? Have you thought about that?

Ok. Jokes aside, the ants here are humans and your subordinates are the denizen of Nazarick. That's simply a comparison.
You are right, value is subjective. That and who said anything about strength? There are plenty of weak NPCs in Nazarick. The only common they have is that they are all creations of his precious friends.
It's less about strength but more about how Ainz view everything outside of Nazarick, PDL could murder the weaker half of Nazarick NPCs, yet for Ainz, he would kill PDl even if the dragonlord decide to surrender
And he still killed them without batting an eye, just like ants.

They would, but he's trying to carry himself in a way that's worthy of their respect.
The point still remains why should he care. Ainz is always shown as this type of protag and at least in the anime he doesn’t really show like he cares. He can save these people or whatever other race they are but why should he if there’s no reason to?
yes what is the reason for this? Why is he trying to protect his reputation?

He is trying not to scratch the image of Ainz Oal Gown that everyone admires. You cannot understand the pressure on him without reading the novels.

Basically, he doesn't want to be hated or disappoint.

He did very bad things because of this. This does not make Ainzi good, but he is not a very bad person. Maruyama says in one of his articles that it could have ended better for everyone if Ainz had not pretended to know everything; and consulted Demiurge and Albedo before taking action. (We can understand his personality from here.)

read this. (from the author)

Would you take it away from them after you see them being happy by behaving this way?
On one hand, I don't really want those millions of civilians to just die... On the other I don't want to admit I have no idea what the hell I'm doing 99% of the time... I think I know what to chose
Incorrect.

The guardians can all instinctively sense their creators and comrades.

Ainz could do a 180° and start preaching about how all human life is sacred and the Guardians would be confused but they would immediately jump on board with that.

Demiurge would turn Jesus-like if Ainz wanted him too.
Nah. It’s like, loyalty to Supreme Beings is coded into their souls. If the Supreme One was being good, Nazarick would become a religious paradise, and if they were being evil, Nazarick would become the worst hell beyond any of our imaginations.
I think he has to, he just limits it where it makes sense. The guardians need to be kept happy and they can possibly rebel if he shows them that he's not who they think he is. Imagine them doing as they pleased.
Yeah, its very clear since Vol 1 that Ainz no longer feel anything toward human, hell, as Suzuki, he already nearly a sociopath who only have enough humanity to care for his guild mates and literally nothing else. His now undead body enhance it, so now, he barely distinguish between human and bugs, he kill human the same way you step on bugs on your walk
For the sake of argument, the argument of powerful men becoming evil depends on how you qualify evil and to what extent.


Is someone evil because they encourage evil actively, or because it is committed on their behalf? Is someone evil because they do evil deeds, or because they fail to do good?


There are plenty of real world examples of powerful men who knowingly allow evil to persist, whether due to their own actions or inaction. Is someone who is rich, but does not support the poor and dying, evil through their inaction? Or is the metric of being too wealthy one of moral failing?


It all comes down to how you choose to quantify evil, and the level of responsibility you attribute for those evil actions.
Just because you have power doesn't mean that you automatically become a bad person. That saying is just something that ppl use to justify having bad leaders and not doing anything about it, basically saying well if we did anything then someone else who is evil will take their place. Power just tends to attract bad people cuz it then allows them to do all the bad things they wanna do without opposition.
Just wanted to help :3
Help when english isn't the first language and you mix some words
5 more genocide and PDL would still didnt care if Ainz was native, PDL simply have a hate boner for purr-layer
Ainz knows they aren't here. At this point he's just hit the "why not" stage.
https://preview.redd.it/u52l49m4it6d1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a37198098780aaade17339dbe42a9c8e9a17d70d
Ainz could be as stupid as Philip, and the Guardians would follow his every word, he absolutely isn't saving himself from a revolt.

Ainz absolutely doesn't think the NPCs will rebel against him if he doesn't conquer the world.
No they barely understood. They'd agree to whatever he says.

The Guardians would literally become pacifists if Ainz ordered them to.
I mean I wouldn't call his reaction to killing Gazef "without batting an eye".

He is, but he's still fine with letting them commit genocide to save him image over a misunderstanding.
Ainz doesn't have a reason to care. However, he does know how evil he is.
He is a very bad person.

Ainz existing makes the NPCs happy. Even if they thought he was an utter dumbass, they'd be fine with it as long as Ainz is just there.

Ainz has no problem taking away the lives of innocent people to maintain his cool image so it's kinda wild that you're making it seem like wanting them to be in check is "wrong".
Why only humans? What makes people so special? It's strange even for Ainz that Nazarick favors people so much when almost all of them are heteromorphs.
Sorry for coming back to this reply, since it struck me now. Recall the scene where Sebas had returned and was tried for his "betrayal" for keeping Tsuare a secret. It was Pandora's Actor posing as Ainz, yet Sebas failed to recognize him. (although Albedo had recognized earlier that it wasn't peroronchino)
The only reason they are trusting his actions because they have received "their" satisfactory ruler. The existence of him can be ruled out by the fact that in the New World that they just arrived in it was possible to easily mind control a lvl 100 supreme being
You can't just say "Human life his precious". Demiurge is smart to an extend, but he is more of a "what if" guy. He could easily come up with a conclusion that Momonga was under mind control
Ainz could unironically tell the Guardians to skin themselves and they'd be happy to be more like him than rebel.
Can they even rebel? They are programmed with undying love and loyalty to the supreme beings and while they are not as bound as when they were NPCs we see with the changes to Albedo that they are very much still creatures of programing
Power begets responsibility. If you have the money to change people’s lives for the better but choose not to that is evil, like cultists in a fantasy setting being convinced to help demons do their evil. You might not be ‚prime evil‘ level evil, but you’re definitely on the same team. 
Personally I believe a lot of evil comes to be only because of inaction and people just letting it happen because it would be work for them to change it or at least talk about it if someone thinks something might have very negative consequences for another.
Thank you very much for your help
Par for the course is proper, but I enjoy your version:) thats all
First part maybe. We dont really know his exact policies on when to move but the dragons where  at fault for bringing players over so he probably thinks its his duty to stop them when one is affecting the world too much.

Second part not really, PDL fought together with players against other players he knows some are good and some bad. When PA disguised as Ainz pleaded for mercy in their fight PDL seemed to feel guilty and explained that it was the fault of his parents but he has to stop Ainz anyways cause he went too far.
He regularly explicitly states his concern that they would eventually betray or tire of him. As long as he plays the role of their evil leader, they follow. He has no idea what would happen if he just told them the truth, which is one of the regular conflicts of every story.
He respects Gazef. Unfortunately, not all humans are Gazef.

Yes, because that's all they are worth.
He’s evil but he’s not killing people to save face he’s doing it to get closer to nazariks goals
Don't look at everything through the reader's eyes.
Might be because he was human before they entered this new world.
Ainz could be a dog shit ruler and they'd support him 100%.
He would not assume that. Demiurge isn't this character that hates humans so much that Ainz doing anything kind will make him think he's being mind controlled.

Demiurge would assume he himself is being mind controlled for even suspecting Ainz is being controlledm
Demiurge can be "what if" all he wants but momonga could justify his actions in a ton of satisfactory ways. For example, Touch Me was a moral person. All momonga would need to do is say that touch me would have wanted moral things to be done and that would be a perfectly satisfactory explanation. 

Also momonga doesn't act at all like he did in yggdrasil. Everyone saw him interacting with the other creators and chilling. Honestly the 180 in being this super cool overlord ruler is probably equally surprising. He could've acted casually and everything would've been fine but momonga panicked at the beginning
And Demuirge would think up the most bullshit excuse imaginable that everyone (him included) would believe without question.

"Sasuga Ainz-sama! Collecting all of our skin to combine all our strengths for a perfect skin for yourself to wear as the ultimate, perfect lord!"

"...sure, let's go with that."
They seem to have a free will in the new world. Pestonya and Nigredo directly rebeled against Ainz while trying to save some humans. And Albedo was actually preparing squad that could assasinate other supreme beings (even her creator) if they would appear and pose a threat to the Momonga.
I'm.more in line with your view on evil and inaction based evil not being prime evil, but I'd also argue that most evil comes from the inaction based variety.
Thank you 😂
That was early on in the story.

At this point he knows very well they would all jump into hell if he ordered them to. He's just doing the genocides because he's empty inside and doesn't want to come out and say he misspoke.
And? Gazef is still an ant by your logic. Respect doesn't change that.

If you feel that way that's fine, but you get my point.
It became a goal because he wanted to save face.
What eyes am I supposed to look at it from?

They are objectively evil.
In volume 1, let Ainz take 2 steps in e rantel without hiding his identity. While doing this, he should not harm anyone and should not take any threatening action. If a party trying to kill him is not formed after 2 minutes, I will agree with you. Is such a race that tries to kill supreme beings really to be considered sacred? Just because he is not human! nonsense! They considered heteromorphs to be their enemies. Nazarickin members cannot take even 2 steps outside without hiding their identities. I could agree if the outside world was more peaceful, but in the end, stop accepting them as sacred, it was absolutely inevitable that a war would break out.  It doesn't matter that Ainz used to be human, they didn't deserve this.
He acted more like the GuildMaster and less like the Supreme Being. Also, it was a few years since he had last visited the throne room, he even almost forgot the name of most of the guardians before being teleported
No problem 😊
Part of the plot of book 13 and possibly the upcoming movie is him pretending to die to see how his subjects react.
I mean, that's why some people have pet ducks and some eats their livers.

Correction, that's how Ainz feels.
Does it matter the original reason, people aren’t dying because he wants to save face, that’s one of the main early plot developments is him losing his humanity fully. Maybe some did die in early season one for that reason but attributing anything more than that to him saving face is wrong. He’s killing people because he does truly only care about nazarick and unless there’s an ln thing saying he doesn’t want these people to die he’s not doing it to stay in character, he’s doing it because he became this character.
From a deontologist view you mean...
If you want to understand Ainz, it is from Ainz's perspective. Do Ainz guards see the same as we do? Maybe for you he's just a novel character. You can watch them even in their most private moments and hear their thoughts, but Ainz cannot do this.

You mentioned them, not your ainz. Nazarick is evil and Ainz only suits them.

And even whether Nazarick is bad or not depends on the point of view. If it is for the outside world, it is bad for the majority, but they are very good within themselves.
The point is if Ainz just decided he wanted to be Jesus one day, Demiurge would immediately be cool with whatever Ainz wants to do. 

He would not try to kill Ainz just because he loves being evil so much.
No, that was to see how his "allies" in the Holy Kingdom would react.

If they actually thought he was dead, everything in Nazarick would go dead and they would laser focus on figuring out what happened.
I mean that doesn't work here because Ainz is the singular "person" in your logic.

Incorrect, Ainz knows how fucked up this all is and he knows it's wrong to do this to people, he just doesn't care. 

You're describing Naberal, not Ainz.
People are absolutely dying because he wants to save face. The upcoming arcs are a perfect example.
"Kufufufufu, you want us to be kind to humans so that we can betray them and mercilessly torture all of them at the same time after a year, then? That is evil even for me, sasuga ainz sama"

One year later

"Still kind? Isn't it time for... wait... OH MY GOD ainz sama we will do it gerenationally? Raise kids that never knew pain just to bring the greatest to them? Truly the supreme being, this fool cannot even come close to you"

1 generation later

"But of course, the parents told their children of the terrors of the previous generation. We must wait until the memory has faded completely"

1000 years later

"I hadn't even considered that the enemy would be prepared for a betrayal now. Truly ainz-sama wisdom knows no bounds, that is why we cannot destroy them now. Hit them when they least expect, right?"
It does though? I can have a pet chicken while still enjoy delicious nuggets.

That's wrong. Ainz is an extreme rationalist if you ever pay attention to his character. Morals and such has never been a concern to him.
Nah
That does seems like what would happens somehow
Well done! 

"Nobody expects the Nazarick Inquisition"

They expected us, they expected ALL of us!!
Now you're equating it to chickens instead of ants.

Ainz isn't an extreme rationalist. A good chunk of his worse acts come from extreme emotion or extreme apathy.
The mental fortitude of this is moment is astounding 
To dive more into detail, he completed it while lying on the floor, dying of poison, and forcefully stopping his heart from pumping blood to halt circulation.

From a biological perspective, the brain requires a continuous supply of oxygen to function properly. When the heart stops, it also halts the circulation of oxygen to the brain. Within seconds, brain cells begin to die. Within minutes, brain damage occurs, leading to impaired functions, loss of consciousness, and potentially death.

So, while dying of poison, dying of blood loss, his brain becoming impaired as brain cells rapidly die, he was still able to maintain his focus. Even more so, he analyzed Gyutaro's fighting habits and attacks, converted them into sound, and read it like sheet music that essentially became cheat sheet to Gyutaro's entire fighting style and moves.

It even works with the line he screams at Tanjiro when he gets slashed in the eye: “Don’t STOP!!!”

Like he knows times up for him, but if he can just create an opening for Tanjiro, it’ll be worth it. Dude put absolutely everything on the line, and was 100% willing to die just for the slightest chance of victory. 

What an absolute Chad.
And they say... They say he is the weakest base hashira... 💜
Uzi vert said “your moves are a trash ass beat”
You guys, read this before you put him at the weakest out of all the hashiras especially in base


Only reason Tengen didn't die near immediately like any other slayer who gets cut by Gyutaro would (beside inosuke who's also resistant to poison) is due to his resistance to poison, now let me break it to you like this

Tengen is the 2nd most experienced, fastest in running, 2nd physically strongest, with the best senses alongside Gyomei out of all the hashira.
     My guy literally has echolocation as one of his breathing forms. All in base. Rengoku has complimented his swordsmanship in the databooks 

And he was still cut by Gyutaro, although keep in mind Gyutaro did not pull out his sickles until the last moment when Tengen leapt at him, so it was a surprise. 
              Gyutaro went for the head, but Tengen deflected it a bit so it scratched him, and that was enough to weaken him the entire fight and bring him near death if he didn't stop his own heartbeat 
 
(which I don't see any other hashira doing either to be honest beside gyomei possibly, sanemi might be pushing it as holding in your guts for a bit, and completely stopping your heart for a decent amount of time with your muscles, then resuscitating yourself are 2 different  levels of muscle strength)

 Anyone else who's even scratched by Upper 6 like that by any of his attacks, especially the surprise attack that caught even the 2nd most experienced hashira Tengen ( which will be pretty much everyone beside Gyomei ) 
they will die 100% in due time, within minutes or less, and quickly their fighting ability will be rendered useless and they won't even be able to breathe. Remember how quick it worked on Tanjiro someone who is not resistant to poisons as Tengen or Inosuke.

 (Also, Tengen at moments fights off Daki and Gyutaro by himself keep in mind, alongside keeping the boys and civilians safe. The fight was won with 0 CASUALTIES. ZERO. Not even any of the 3 wives kicked the bucket). 

Put some respect on his name.

Also literally every hashira level slayer who fought an uppermoon had help beside zenitsu and rengoku. And Rengoku died protecting the gang, so having help against an uppermoon is very common

( and no Kaigaku is not stronger than Gyutaro either, he was not even experienced with his BDA and was a brand new uppermoon. Though it's still impressive Zenitsu beat him without too much trouble.)
Absolutely. I won’t stand for the Tengen disrespect.
Tengen with two arms, the demon slayer mark and musical score would’ve been insane.
This man was a hype machine
[removed]
How funny/cool would it have been if during battles he kept lamenting that he can’t get the right “score” of the battle to go all out, and then this scene happened where he’s just overjoyed “it’s ready.”
Tengens will power is unbelievable. Comparing him to Muichiro, who was ready to die in upper moon 5’s water bubble thing and ultimately saved by plot armor, I believe tengen is top three if he had a better sword style/ sword skills. I could be wrong and it’s my opinion, but Tengen is severely underrated. Not to mention Entertainment Disctrict arc is the turning point in the story and Tengen did it without a slayer mark. Thoughts?
Just let's go!!! :3
“WERE GOING FOR THE WIN”
He can’t be weaker than Shinobu who can’t even behead a demon.
MY MUSICAL SCORE TECHNIQUE, WILL TAKE US TO VICTORYYYY!!!!!!!!!
i saw this video on yt short and it explained that gyutaro fixes his mistakes. when gyutaro first attack tanjiro for the chin, tengen saved him from the left so gyutaro cut his arm so he can't save tanjiro again. then again gyutaro attacked tanjiro but then he came from the left again so gyutaro cut his left eye so he couldn't see from the left. then when he attacked tanjiros chin again, he successfully hit him.
![gif](giphy|V69LhUggYIg6qmKUoD|downsized)
I would also point out that my guy was wielding 2 two swords, each one probably weighing 5lbs each plus the chain connecting them like they were nothing… while missing a hand. The mental and physical fortitude of the flashiest slayer is amazing. By far my favorite arc
It’s crazy to think no hashira was able to defeat an upper moon yet every upper moon up until now was defeated by a hashira with tanjiro lol
Very off topic, but it’s hilarious that the people who dislike powerscaling started the powerscaling comments lmao
https://i.redd.it/hwiu6sn5dkdd1.gif

It’s crazy how peak this arc was, I hope the final showdown lives up to it when it drops in like four years 😭
That entire fight sequence is masterful from start to finish. 

AND THE MUSIC DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED
The amount of adrenaline I could feel through the screen was kinda scary. I have a vivid imagination and sometimes it will start making the situation on screen feel more real then it ever should.
The resilience and determination of the Hashira and Tanjiro really kick the emotion of the fights to ridiculous levels, and despite the simplicity of the story it makes it feel extremely gripping. There's still several big moments just like this yet to come in the anime, very excited to see them
Mhm
He's an absolute chad
Tengen is easily one of the most badass characters I've ever seen. 😎
its anime real life logic doesnt apply here and probably author didnt put much thought on that thing so i think its pretty pointless

Peak!
Best fight scene. The music puts it over the top for me.
One of my favorite moments in the entire anime
That’s strange
Quite literally rewatching this season rn💀
Wait is the newest season out???
>From a biological perspective

I don't think this anime follows a lot of biological logic lol.
look all I’m saying is that if he was good to go for the infinity castle arc, shit would’ve been a lot different
bros out here playing beatsaber
Strongest unmarked hashira easily
By far the best arc in series
Favorite Hashira and everyone ranks him too low
Sekiro players
He was playing beat saber on INSANE difficulty with ONE hand
I would chalk it up to adrenaline
Was poisoned
Had his arm chopped off 
And still was holding his own against an upper moon demon 

Hes not the weakest
He is the standard for all hashira to follow
where os everyone wathing this?
WE'RE GOING FOR THE WIN!
Not to downplay his fortitude but adrenaline is one hell of a drug
I'll be honest - I don't think the Hashira recently have topped Tengen and Rengoku. Those dudes just had so much heart and drive.
Tanjiro really said: I think he’s losing it
Lmao another bs KNY author pulls out of his half knowledge of biology
ngl bar shinobu i dont really know which hashira is weaker than tengen. every other hashira literally fought against other upper moons and actually held their own
>! muichiro solod upper 5 and was important in the fight against upper 1
mitsuri held her own against upper 4 and pulled off muzan arms with her own brute strength
gyomei is obv the strongest
obanai cld be the weakest maybe? but he can spar against both muichiro and sanemi, and was impactful in the fight against muzan
giyu was impactful in upper 3 fight and survived against muzan with his limbs
sanemi was impt in upper 1 fight, and survived muzan 
maybe rengoku cld be weaker? since he lost to upper 3 and we cldnt really see any of his feats
and shinobu, p much didnt do much and had to rely on poisoning herself to stand a chance against upper 2. 

overall tengen is probably bottom 3 or worse, perhaps only shinobu and rengoku being weaker, and perhaps sanemi being weaker !<
I mean… it’s kinda just extreme shonen nonsense, though. Like don’t get me wrong, it’s awesome, but the fantasy of it kinda limits how inspiring it can be. Like forcefully stopping your own heart would just kill you. Or leave your muscles so weak you wouldn’t be able to get back up. So he can have all the mental fortitude he wants if the author is just going to pretend even the most basic biological realities don’t matter.
So you honestly think the writer took all that into account when he was writing this part? Some of you fans, anime fans in general, will grasp at anything for whatever agenda you have with these characters. You’re taking realistic standards for humans and applying them to fictional characters when all the writer was trying to do was make a cool moment or push the story a certain way.
Wow man who would’ve guessed a fictional character could do something so crazy
JUMP!!!
I have discovered I absolutely slept on Demon Slayer. I watched the first season and liked it, but didn’t jump back in till recently. Very solid Shonen(?) anime.
Truly an egoist mindset
who said that???
People get so caught up they ignore what he had against him. 

First of all him being top 3 in the arm wrestling and 1st in racing gives us an idea where he's at physically. 

He also had to fight Gyutaro with a lot of factors against him.

Tanjiro was very injured, Tengen takes notices and uses techniques he wouldn't normally use to keep Gyutaros attention on him. 

Gyutaro can also see what Daki sees and control her which allows him to attack Tengen from any spot. We see Tengen get his blindspots attacked (Luckily, Tanjiro was there) 

Also the poison was sapping his strength and with only one hand, when he perfected his musical score technique, the narrator stated that Tengen was capable of finishing Gyutaro off but the poison was taking its toll. 

Tengen is in my opinion top 3 base Hashira. But they're all capable of beating the other. 

We see both Mitsuri and Muichiro need their marks to beat/contend with their upper moon demons. 

I for sure think Tengens gets downplayed
Lmao bro they knew they couldn’t give this man a DSM 😂 blud would really be him
While having 1 arm, being half dead, having enough poison in his system to kill anyone else, he went toe to toe with an Upper Moon going 100%. Compare that to unmarked Muichiro and Mitsuri, who both lost immediately to their respective Moon. Everyone knows Shinobu is the weakest one anyways 
I get so cheesed about that, my boi would’ve gone insane with his mark 💔

At least he gets the trade off of having easily the best life of all the hashira’s 😂
I believe,  I can't remember how to spoiler tag but out of the other slayers only Sanemi could control his muscles enough to stop the poison from spreading like Tengen did. I think gyomei could stale mate them with tanjiro trio or do sacrifice himself to give them the chance
Is this. . . An Overwatch reference?!

And they say, and they say, and they say!
That’s because he is the weakest Hashira..? Why exactly is he strong to you? I don’t seem to understand
Yaboyroshi??
"Why are you sweating?"
I haven't read the manga but I sure as hell would have loved to see Tengen in the Infinity Castle. Would have made some epic flashes alongside Gyomei.
Im pretty sure ppl got hurt or died in the district but it was a major attack it wasn't really a him thing. 
It's pretty much a rock paper scissor situation 
I've literally been saying the same thing. (well not the exact same words but you feel me) People REALLY underestimate Tengen because of this fight. When they should be doing the opposite. Just because it's upper moon 6, who by Muzan's words "was held back by Daki" (This is just a head canon, but I think Gyutaro should probably have been upper 4)
In base maybe not. But if you account for all the buffs and upgrades other hashiras got later he is definitely the weakest and it's not even close. 

Remember the ranking of the moon are strictly based on their strength, there's no room to argue about it.
Finally,someone who understand Tengen. I really hate how he's put last just bcs of the enemies he fought. He's easily one of the strongest hashiras ever,and like you said(EXPERIENCED).
Thank you for showing him the respect he deserves my friend😭😭😁

It seems you dropped this W king 👑
Yeah, however for me he is still the 2 weakest (beating only Shinobu) but that is not his fault. The only reason he can be considered one of the weakest is because he is one of only 3 Hashiras who never unlocked the Demon Slayer Mark (others being Shinobu and Rengoku). The rest got a major power boost while he (and Rengoku and Shinobu) never got that same power boost. Infact, he (and Rengoku) never got a chance to unlock it since Tanjiro only got his during the Upper Moon 6 battle, and he had to get it in order for others to get it. If we were to rank the Harshira without the marks, I'm sure Tengen would at least be top 5 (others being Gyomei, Muichiro, Rengoku, and Sanemi)

Also yes, I am putting Rengoku over Tengen but that is mostly just on word because a good portion of the Hashiras couldn't believe that Rengoku lost to Upper Rank 3, including Tengen (and most likely weren't thinking of the idea that Akaza was holding back) while Tengen didn't even believe that he could even beat Daki and Gyutaro alone.
Tengen is the weakest, he would've been killed in minutes without Tanjiro and others, barely keeping up with Gyutaro
Yeah. People really be saying that "He's the weakest hashira" Just because he was fighting upper 6. Who was literally said to be held back
That's why they got rid of him .. he would be more popular that tanjiro and his sun breathing power
>! Retired hashiras were tasked to guard Nezuko !<
Lost an eye and hand and retired
He’s retired and not part of the Corp anymore. He isn’t going to take part in their war against demons anymore. At least not on the front lines.
10/10, best hashira, extra flashy
How was it plot armor? If anything Kotetsu had the plot armor.

Mui saved Kotetsu bc of what Tanjiro/his father said. That paid off as they said it would.

Kotetsu is the one with the ass pull here.
It just makes sense narrative wise?
Yeah. But if you apply this logic to anime, in general, especially shonen then there aren’t any badass moments in any show. They’re all unrealistic
Where in my post did I say the author took into account the neurological effects topping one’s heart has on the brain? It was just a cool thing I noticed involving oxygen in a show where breathing is key for humans in that world. Some of you guys gotta lighten up, jeez
*sickle slash*

“HE PAVED THE WAY FOR YOU AND YOU STILL MISSED YOUR CHANCE!”
I'm so happy you revisited the show, dude. Glad to have you here.
Have you gotten to hashira training arc yet?
It brings back the classic 90s fight structure.
a LOT of people... Their argument is: "He got clapped by the weakest uppermoon 🤓☝️"
You wouldn't even believe how many people
many do. yet not a single hashira could solo him either lol.
Circumstances don't matter to powerscalers. Some people downplay him to such a degree they claim he lost the fight, even though he literally fought until the very end. I don't get shounen fandoms lol.
There’s also the fact he’s the *only* Hashira to have killed an Upper Moon **without** the Demon Slayer mark. Literally no one other Hashira can make the same claim.
To counter, everyone almost died. His reckless investigation skills got people dead.
YESSIR
People did die, when Daki ripped up the houses when one guy walks out yelling at em.

Was also before Tengen got there.

I don't think anyone died while Tengen was around.
https://preview.redd.it/or1c15vn2udd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9578be38fd09721570925f92f078b7cb0f387ca

Muzan only said Gyutaro would have won against Tengen's group had he fought alone, he never said Gyutaro is stronger than Gyokko let alone Hantengu
Shinobu would be the weakest as she never got a mark either, Rengoku also would be above Shinobu but below Tengen he never got his mark either.

I don't know how you can watch season 2, read all that and still claim he's the weakest .
Why do you have Rengoku above Tengen for?

Tengen has him beat in strength, experience, senses, swordsmanship, destructive capability, abilities due to the musical score, stealth, and running speed?
People are trash. The weakest upper moon is still a fucking upper moon.
marked incorrectly sir
Not to mention what can he even do in the Castle. Any Upper would dog walk him since he doesn’t have a mark
You didn’t have to say it you’re still operating on the assumption that whatever you’re headcannon is exist with some level of consideration within the story. If you thought otherwise then this wouldn’t be a post
“WWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH”

That VA must’ve took that numbing stuff for your throat when you’re sick, you can hear his vocal chords burning
I just started it actually! I have a hard time reading subtitles in my 30s, as my mind is all over the place after work. I keep missing bits of info lol. Crunchyroll had a few dubbed episodes though. I’d like to pick up the manga when things slow down though. Reading is easier in book form for some reason
How would you describe that fight structure? Not disagreeing just genuinely curious what the difference is
yeah but the weakest upper moon (personally) doesn't seem like the weakes to me. They did more damage than four and five...
And they forget he defeated UM6 without the mark
The weakest upper moon, who uses poison which was slowing him down, and if anyone but Tengen fought Gyutaro the poison would have killed them.
Gyutaro is the weakest upppermoon since the other moons are stronger, but that’s because his poison would essentially be useless in a fight to move up. Against humans he’s easily way more of a hard fight than 4 and 5. Any pillar but Gyomei would’ve died against gyutaro in like 3 minutes
Can you send me any examples of people saying this?  Modt people who call him the weakest Hashira are including Marked Hashira, not just everyone in Base
Morons.
he is also not the second strongest in base probably 5-6
He was my second favorite hashira.
The powerscalers on this sub only look at ranks, so they keep shitting on Tengen because Gyutaro was UM6.

If you so much as make a post that Gyutaro is weaker than Gyomei as a demon, but stronger against humans due to his poison, people go apeshit and refuse to acknowledge it. 

They don’t understand how abilities work nor do they understand counters. Other Hashira would’ve died against Gyutaro.
Powerscaling can be fun in just that it's for fun discussions.

But it's like people aren't going back to reread or rewatch in case it was overlooked.
I may be misremembering, but I don't THINK that's true. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure >!Zenitsu, Kanao and Inosuke never get their Marks? I know Douma was severely weakened by Shinobu and Kanao and Inosuke are at least unmarked Hashira level, but still!<
I wouldn't say reckless. 

Having his 3 skilled wives go under cover in 3 of the biggest houses on the district to get information made sense. Unfortunately they were captured and Hina had to get sick to get out. He still managed to gather massive Intel that confirms that a demon was about and the plan worked with Tanjiro and the gang. Hashiras don't have any real authority to do much. 

And there was no way they'd expect a demon like gyutaro and daki would be there as nothing like them has ever existed. 

Tengen was overconfident for sure.
U sure there are no casualties when gyutaro carpet bombed the whole place?
Good point. maybe Gyrutao wasn't strong then Gyoko. There's no denying that he was close to his power. That means Tengen was poised, missing a hand, had no demon slayer mark, was saving other people lives, and still beat Gyrutao who was ether basically as strong if not stronger then Gyoko.
Yep. You can almost do the same shit with a syringe gun infused with demon poison
I literally explained why. While in feats and stats, Tengen should be higher, but on word alone (especially Tengen's), Rengoku seem to be more respected for his strength as a Hashira
The thing is he isn't the weakest Moon. He's just labeled 6 because of Daki
And he was also missing an arm.
Nothing stopping him from getting a mark honestly. If Tanjiro had his earlier, Rengoku and Tengen woulda had theirs too.
If he fought with the others he would have awakened his mark during the fight like all the other hashiras

But that would mean tengen would die soon even if he survives the final battle >!(mark people die at a certain age)!<

Tengen already fulfilled the goal of his character, retire and be with his wives. Tengen has reached peace. He is quite honestly the person with the happiest ending in the manga because he gets to live his life (one arm and eye down is not an issue to the God of Festivals)
I’m not operating under that assumption. You are simply misinterpreting my post (as well as a few others) as some agenda when in reality it’s just to make a cool moment look cooler out of enjoyment of the show. Idk what to tell you if you still think otherwise, man, but to each their own as they say
the more you scream the stronger you get
Multi episode. Telling a story through the fight instead of stopping the fight to tell a backstory. They waited until it was over basically to give us their back story so we are never really taken out of the fight as opposed to Naruto where they will stop mid fight to show the backstory and it breaks the immersion. Characters don’t just over one love or technique they acutely have to fight and work toward a moment where they can use those moves. Fights in something like Dragon Ball would often watch like a professional wrestling match with ebbs and flows. Each person gaining an advantage and positioning themselves to use their speciality over their opponent. Fights after the popularity of Naruto were more focused on characters just using those moves with nothing in between. Or you have something like a Shikamaru fight where he just stares and thinks for a whole episode. Many series were more inspired by the Naruto formula but KnY and JJK have gone back to the multi episode pro wrestling style of fighting which is what I prefer.
Well keep in mind that they were largely capped because of Daki. Evil Micheal Jackson even said that Gyutaro could have been much higher if he cut ties with her.
He is the weakest. Gyutaro would still probably kill most of the other hashira aside from possibly Gyomei. 4 and 5 just seem a lot less strong simply because the slayer mark is a huge power boost.
 
Mitsuri and Muichiro would not have survived nearly as long as they did without their marks.
Facts!
well, when two weak people fights, or two weak team of same caliber fights its always going to be look more entertaining than when a strong fights to a weak
Did he? Alone?
I would say he's 4/5 but that's just my opinion 💜
In an arm wrestling competition, he is. Gyomei is the strongest with tengen coming second.
I mean. The same powerscalers play Mitsuri down cuz she couldn’t kill an immortal Zohakuten and were crying shes gonna die while fighting the whole night til sunrise. Those powerscalers need a new hobby
Yes, but they aren’t Hashira. Hashira-level, absolutely. Honestly the only downside in my eyes of Muzan being defeated is that since the Corps fulfilled their purpose and disbanded, they never got to officially become Hashira.

Also since you mentioned Zenitsu, I’m gonna stan him for a moment; he was the only Demon Slayer to have successfully solo’d an Upper Moon from start to finish, without having awakened the Mark, AND he wasn’t even a Hashira.
Fairly reckless. He was grabbing random girls he saw to help his investigation.
That’s why his wives were there evaccing the whole district
We don't see any civilians after Gyutaro shows up we don't see any more.

Once he showed up the explosions and fighting got louder more intense. I would assume they all left.
I don't think Gyutaro is as strong as Gyokko but I definitely agree that even without that what Tengen achieved was nothing short of a miracle when he became the first Hashira to defeat an Upper Moon after more than a century
I said the categories Tengen has him beat, but you say Rengoku is above because he is respected? I don't think I understand 

Respect does not = Strength, or people like Tanjiro, gyomei, would be like the strongest one ever lol even above muzan.

What reasons do you actually believe he's stronger, like fighting capability not respect
mark ppl dying at age is a myth isnt it, not real
The sadder the flashback the stronger the attack.
The fact that you took time to write Evil Michael Jackson instead of Muzan got me 🤣🤣🤣
Muzan doesn't have an eye for adorable little sisters.

Gyutarou knows better than to not protect Ume.

"It's not fair!  They are bullying me!!~"

Yes, yes they are, how dare they...
He also let his pride get in the way here. He had yo avenge his sister being disgraced like that, so he was more hands on than usual with this fight. He should've just poisoned everyone and dipped out. But his pride kept him there to brutalize everyone he could
He never said that outright, he only said that had gyutaro started the fight against tengen and the kamaboko squad he would have won, but I do agree that if gyutaro was independent of his sister they could both make it to upper 5 or even upper 4 since they need to both be beheaded, and what are the odds they have skilled enough demon slayers after them at the same time and they get beheaded at the same time
Also, Gyutaro weakened him with poison.
Muzan never said that
true true
what he said was gyutaro would’ve won without daki and that he should’ve just left after poisoning them all. muzan never said this dawg
No he didn't, he said Daki held him back and was always a weakness of his. He never says anything about him being a higher rank without Daki. Even without her he is still firmly UM6, UM5 and above all beat Tengen prerty easily. I love him but he just is one of the Weakest, as you said daki holds Gyutaro back and Tengen still would've lost that fight it if was just him.
also true
Really? Most of the hashira? Lol. You're underestimating uppermoon 1, 2 and 3 if that's the case.
Why you're being downvoted? I don't think people here realize that the fight(pairing) between the upper moon and hashiras are based on their skillsets. Because if not then one of them will be easily defeated or the fight will be boring.
Technically, because he was protecting Tanjiro even after he was dying from poison and missing an arm.
TBH, I might put him higher.

He's the second physically strongest, he's the fastest runner, he was raised since a child to fight and he's the second oldest Hashira, his weapons can really change up a fight, his adaptability is IMO the highest of any Hashira, and he beat an Upper Moon (who could debatably be higher in the rankings) with no Mark, one-armed, one-eye, poisoned, minutes to live, needed another demon dead at the same time, and protecting several other people. Uzui is IMO the second or third strongest Hashira in base.
then its also people opinion if they think he is weakest 

and gyomei iguro sanemi giyuu to an extent are more powerful than him its upto rengoku vs tengen for 5 for me
so? overall strength cant be judged on the basis of arm-wrestling mate
I can't disagree with that
Or died
Like I said it is more on just word alone since Tengen straight up said that he couldn't believe that Rengoku couldn't beat Upper 3, while Tengen didn't think he could beat Daki and Gyutaro on his own

Plus (and this is kinda more on my opinion), but I feel like the Akaza that fought against Rengoku could still beat Daki and Gyutaro. Like it was stated earlier, it was just mostly on match ups since Tengen was probably the best Hashira to fight Daki and Gyutaro while Rengoku was quite possible the worst Hashira to throw at Akaza due to his high fighting Spirit.
No? It's kind of an important point in one character's backstory.
The Demon King of Pop cannot be stopped 🕺
He did say Daki was holding him back, how much is kinda up to speculation. I could see Gyutaro and Gyokko swapping places tbh, I don't really see him passing Hantengu though.
Ju:lie
Not crazy to assume

Only reason Tengen didn't die immediately is due to his resistance to poison, now let me break it to you like this

Tengen is the 2nd most experienced, fastest in running, 2nd physically strongest, with the best senses alongside Gyomei out of all the hashira.
     My guy literally has echolocation as one of his breathing forms. All in base. Rengoku has complimented his swordsmanship in the databooks 

And he was still cut by Gyutaro, although keep in mind Gyutaro did not pull out his sickles until the last moment when Tengen leapt at him, so it was a surprise. 
              Gyutaro went for the head, but Tengen deflected it a bit so it scratched him, and that was enough to weaken him the entire fight and bring him near death if he didn't stop his own heartbeat 
 
(which I don't see any other hashira doing either to be honest beside gyomei possibly, sanemi might be pushing it as holding in your guts for a bit, and completely stopping your heart for a decent amount of time with your muscles, then resuscitating yourself are 2 different  levels of muscle strength)

 Anyone else who's even scratched by Upper 6 like that by any of his attacks, especially the surprise attack that caught even the 2nd most experienced hashira Tengen ( which will be pretty much everyone beside Gyomei ) 
they will die 100% in due time, within minutes or less, and quickly their fighting ability will be rendered useless and they won't even be able to breathe. Remember how quick it worked on Tanjiro someone who is not resistant to poisons as Tengen or Inosuke.

 (Also, Tengen at moments fights off Daki and Gyutaro by himself keep in mind, alongside keeping the boys and civilians safe. The fight was won with 0 CASUALTIES. ZERO. Not even any of the 3 wives kicked the bucket). 

Put some respect on his name.

Also literally every hashira level slayer who fought an uppermoon had help beside zenitsu and rengoku. And Rengoku died.

( and no Kaigaku is not stronger than Gyutaro either, he was not even experienced with his BDA and was a brand new uppermoon. Though it's still impressive Zenitsu beat him without too much trouble.)
i mean people generally doesnt like others opinion if it doesnt fit on their narrative so maybe thats why specially fan fav characters like giyuu rengoku and tengen
Tanjiro is also injured and dying from poison. Besides, the statement above implies that he killed gyutaro alone. Let's not forget that inosuke and zenitsu beheaded daki, which is needed to defeat them completely.
I'm not referring to overall strength mate, I'm literally talking about physical strength but since you want to go overall, how about you explain why tengen who is second in physicals and experience as well as first in sense and running speed is overall the 5-6th strongest hashira in base... make it make sense.
Didn't think doesn't really prove shi though, go off what we've seen 

Also remind me when Tengen said that about rengoku and said he doesn't believe he can defeat gyutaro and daki..

Also your point about Akaza, Akaza will have to try harder to defeat Gyutaro and Daki then against Rengoku, if you think otherwise then I have nothing else to say to you really.

Also Rengoku would vs Upper 6 would be a match up in Upper 6 favour as well
why does yorichi live to like 80
I'd say Gyokko is stronger but the gap between them isn't as big as the gap between gyokko and hantengu.

Also about what muzan said about daki. Muzan, after discussing why gyutaro lost, made a point about how the upper ranks are dying in order of how much humanity they had left. So him saying "daki was holding gyutaro back" was less about daki weakening gyutaro  and more about daki holding gyutaro back from being more cruel.
That's crazy to assume, since we never really saw him or the other hashiras fight the other upper moon. Why do you assume that other hashira will die immediately due to poison when the most common side effect of blood demon art is poison?. Aren't they mostly aware of how to delay the circulation of poison through breathing?
Except Muichiro vs Gyokko, all fights were team up. What’s your point?
others have feat in base which is more impressive then tengen 

running speed? giyuu sanemi iguro all three have more combat speed then him

obanai is literally most skilled hashira in swordsmanship

sanemi =obanai=giyuu - we literally saw in anime

sanemi feats in base against um1 obanai feats against muzan
That is quite literally the exact thing I was mentioning, lol. 

Yoriichi lived to be 80 because he was born with the Mark and was just intrinsically far superior. Yoriichi was just special. That's his entire thing.
He said if Gyutaro fought alone from the start he would've won, meaning the fight in the Entertainment District.
Thats a stretch and a half.
I think you're vastly underestimating how insanely OP demon powers make you, dude. That's like the entire point of the show. The upper six moons are on an entirely different level than any of the hashira aside from maybe Gyomie; and even that's a big maybe. Tengen would've died twice as quickly without the Tanjiro crew being with him. Muichiro got no-diffed by upper moon 5 before he awakened his mark. Mitsuri did not land a single solitary hit on upper moon 4. Sure, her purpose was to stall for time, but personally, I don't feel like she would've even been able to land a meaningful strike even if that was the main body.

The only upper moon that could realistically be killed by a few of the hashira is Gyutaro. And even then, the dude nearly killed a hashira, 3 of his Shinobu wives, and 3 extremely skilled demon slayers. Anyone who thinks any of the base form hashira can take an upper moon solo is absolutely delusional.
That can be answered by simply watching the show or reading the manga my dude.

Gyutaros poison specifically is very potent, and idk where you got that "all blood demon arts have poison" thing from. Hantengu's bda does not have "poison" neither does kaigaku, kokushibo, douma, akaza, drum demon, arrow demon, that black-water demon from s1, so on so forth.

Go watch the show and see how quickly it took effect in Tanjiro and what it did to him, or reread my comment to understand more

And Tanjiro tried to do exactly what you said, delay the circulation with "breathing" but after a short time period he wasn't  even able to breathe at all. So it's moot, they will die eventually
Muichiro got caught in a pot.. and was saved by the little boy making air bubbles for him to escape. Otherwise Gyokko literally would’ve one tapped him, and bro just walked away. Muichiro even KNOWS he’s dead, and he prays that the master sends more Hashira
>others have feat in base which is more impressive then tengen 

I'd love for you to actually provide a modicum of evidence mate. Saying something is so doesn't make it so sir. 

>running speed? giyuu sanemi iguro all three have more combat speed then him

Well, you're wrong in that regard. The databooks literally have tengen topping everyone in running speed. Hate to break it to you mate. But running speed is a factor of combat speed. 

>obanai is literally most skilled hashira in swordsmanship

Second actually, but that's irrelevant. Not to mention a moot point since if we bring swordsmanship into ranking factor, tengen ranks 3rd with gyomei being first. 

>sanemi =obanai=giyuu - we literally saw in anime

Ufotable has a habit of overexaggerating scenes for flashy effects, that's their entire thong. They're not sometimes named unlimited budget works for nothing. Put aside the anime, and read the manga. And in the manga, we don't see anything from those three that put them above tengen in base. We have these 5 simple facts. 1. Tengen is the second physically strongest hashira. 2. Tengen is the second most experienced hashira. 3. Tengen ranks 1st in sense. 4. Tengen ranks 1st in running speed and 5. Tengen ranks 3rd in swordsmanship. 

>sanemi feats in base against um1 obanai feats against muzan

Those feats were with the slayer mark and transparent world. Factors that tengen wouldn't have access to since he never awakened either of them. Ffs sanemei was almost knocked out by a headbutt from tanjiro...
i thought that the whole thing w the mark was that after yoriichi muzan hunted marked slayers so they always died young
Which is definitely not true so he’s bsing. Weakness in Muzan’s eyes is humanity and human emotions, which Gyutaro had for Daki. Without Daki, half the reason they’re so hard to kill for a Hashira, even marked, goes away (have to behead 2 demons at the same time).
I never underestimated them, you guys are the ones who make assumptions here .
And didn't say "all" and said "most". You should probably read first before you make an argument.
Hashiras fought muzan while being poison and I'm pretty sure muzan's poison is stronger than gyutaro. But they didn't die upon its immediate contact.
man put his own headcanon tengen doesnt rank in swordsmanship anywhere near top first of all after that running speed is totally different in manga it is literally said misturi had faster combat speed than tengen even though she ranked very low in running speed and see their feats before awakening mark 

tengen literally needed help from 4-5 different people to eliminate weakest um in contrast to sanemi giyuu iguro who fought much stronger um in base and has more amazing feats

theres literally explained that headbutt situation by obanai in anime too
While it is true that Muzan and Kokushibo hunted down Slayers, they specifically hunted down the students of Yoriichi to make sure that another Sun Breathing user didn't pop up. However, since Kokushibo helped Muzan, that means that DSM users died young since >!Kokushibo's reason to become a demon in the first place was to avoid dying at 25 from the Mark.!<
SO TRUE!!!!
I'mma be honest!!!!

Hell yeah😈
Each of Tengen's wives do share a face with one of the boys.
She's inosuke's older sister.
Nah bro Inosuke thicc enough💜
Maybe so, but Inosuke’s got nicer boobs so there!
In all honesty, they are disturbingly similar.

Inosuke as a girl would probably have a handsome and masculine face though
Yep, they spent too much on CGIs that they are just reusing models now because they are getting lazy and to save money and they hide it by being funny 🙆‍♂️
What is her diet and daily routine to get that THICC ?
you can’t tell me that Suma doesn’t look like Inosuke tbh.💯

Before I saw the season I actually thought Inosuke had a long lost sister or something
Missed opportunity to say “butt” thiccer
She has hair colour like his eyes and he has eyes colour like her hair
mmmmmmmmm
Man, I hope Uzui did not confuse Inosuke with his wife during one of those long lonely nights
I thought Inosuke was trans for like 60 episodes
This was literally my first thought when I saw her. 😂
I legit thought she was his long lost mom or something.
Inosuke is funny
hes not lieng
Real
A head cannon I have is that she’s Inosuke’s birth mother and was forced to give him up because of her line of work

Dunno about the sub but the dub is “as long as the crazy is hot enough”. Regardless, legend saying legend things is legendary
I wasn't in the fandom 2 years ago, how was it like?☀️

Yep except it's hundred of kids lol
I, Ves... 
i dont know why but i love this moment...
That moment when you’re on your 6th play through and you really don’t wanna hear the npc monologue.
The more badass and interesting a character is in Overlord, the higher the chances that they're going to die in a forgettable manner.
Bro spent decades to reach the peak of what’s possible as a human in the NW. Became on of the strongest people in the land. Only to get one shotted like a ant
pages we're limited so was Aura's patience.
The novel made it way funnier lol 😆 😂 🤣  

It wasn't even ruthless, they all died basically right away.
He didn't even have pupils. Homeboy was ready to die.
This is like Gazef's master iirc which make you think that Gazef is so lucky that he encountered Ainz early on. Since, if its the other guardians with a shoot to kill order, not even he is spared.
At least she killed HIM quickly
"I'm sorry, I'm still learning my pet's names"
Here's the real philosophical question, does this guy count as a named character?
I’m waiting for this series for so long
Aura be like oh shi i forgot at the end😭
She'll literally was like 🙄and killed dude
I can't imagine what would have happened if he actually showed her the way.

Like I can see Aura genuinely letting them go, but then they would have to walk past her "pets" and not get spotted by Amy other Guardians
Wow. What season is this and where can I watch it?
Known New Worlders : I'm.....

Nazarick Guardian : Silence [Basic Attack]
This is in which season
They gave him the better animation when he unsheated his swords, to contrast it more
Aura was nice enough to wait for him to draw his weapons,  I like that.
Damn....
Them dudes aint do NOTHING
I, Ves 👎
I, was 👍
Welcome

Ohh

Goodbye
I love aura
Typical ng+4 Tarnished in front of Sir Gideon Ofnir.
It kinda reminds me of the meme about wanda and thanos
Overlord is one anime I’ll always watch dub for. Hearing it subbed is so strange haha
 “I don’t give a sh about” ahh moment
I feel like this moment is so much better in dub (fight me, nerds🖕🏾)
Funny thing is people actually expected a fight. The anime made really poor demonstration on the power difference between Nazarick individuals and NW people.
This cane out? WHEN?
If you read the ln you will be disappointed how they animate this show. The entire kingdom turns in to rubble literally. Aura meeting gazef's master and totally disrespectedly beheading him while giving introduction is so downplayed.
Oh shit! I forgot this cutscene was skippable, score!
Me on my first playthrough
SKIP
Cries in OG RE:4, quick time events. Especially that knife fight.
Brain and Gazef both had memorable deaths. From our perspective it's unimpressive, and required no effort on Nazerick's part, but Gazef seeing Ainz wipe out an entire army with just a single spell and still choosing to face him in a duel is pretty badass. And maybe it's just me, but I'm a sucker for fights like Brain's. Between him going so far beyond his limits that blood starts pouring out of his eyes, and him walking into it knowing that he's going to die, I can't help but love that moment.
"meh, you're old, retired, and probably you had enough fun during your adamantite days. might as well leave now, before it goes to the dark side"
I believe he was also a former adamantine rank. he and the old woman who gave Gazef that ring were part of a retired 4 person team. The other two members are supposedly traveling the world together.
Tbh i want to die like that right now or anytime, definitely better than any other death i could possibly ever give myself, quick and unexpected. Cant feel the pain either if your brain is gone before your nerve receptors can even react
True bro insta died
He does. 

He's a retired adamantite adventurer that Momon and Pison talk about in The Sealed Evil Tree Arc. He's a legend in Re-Estes.
It was very popular. Whys it taking so long -_-
Pretty sure it specifies in the novel. She would let him live, not saved him. He would have died reguardless, just would have gotten to live a little longer is all. No humans were allowed to leave the city alive. That was Mares test.
Fourth Season I think
the fourth
Yeah each is a bit different. Some are better subbed and some are better dubbed, it all depends on the voice actors. I think subbed Ainz’ voice actor did a pretty bad job compared to the dubbed voice actor. Additionally, overlord dubbed has many of the more talented voice actors even for minor characters, which is what makes the dubbed so good for overlord.
HUH, OPINION?! **ON REDDIT?!!**

#UNACCEPTABLE.

Now suffer as I downvote your opinion because it doesn't agree with mine! >! /s !<
You mean it did an excellent job of showing the power difference? By virtue of there not even being a fight?
First off expecting the down rep because nobody likes a different opinion

Honestly it's this and a few other anime have become boring because of the power scaling of characters is so high that you already know how it ends. Hell I skipped like 2 episodes of tsukimichi because the protag's cockiness. I like certain characters but show it self kinda loses me.
The Witch of the Falling Kingdom arc

Season 4 episode 13 IIRC
Storyline? What storyline?
Okay Doom Slayer.
That game kinda overhyped dudes playing the storytelling masterpiece of the decade
 Ah! Hello Adventurer and welcome to the Town of Honeywood!
When Cocytus took that side street around Brain it took me a second to realize why. My first thought was "guys dead walk past him?" But when I realized it was a sign of respect. He let Brain block his path even in death. That was some A tier writing.
My main thought is that every warrior in the Re-Estize Kingdom is so stupidly suicidal it's amazing that kingdom lasted as long as it did.
That's mercy in comparison. Remember the nobles under your friendly neighborhood Neuronist.
Well that’s the suspense of it you don’t know when it will happen and hey it might be painless but I suggest not thinking about it you have a time and that time will come same with me I’m destined to die one day and that’s ok that’s just the cycle of life
That’s what I’m saying
I remember them talking about someone popular in that arc, but didn't think it was this old stick
make it good, even if it takes time. Also, we don't have content for another season at the moment
Ah exact words. “I won’t harm you. My pets, or my friends, are another matter”
Their best bet would ironically be running into Brain before he encountered Cocytus, that way they could all due as warriors rather than pet food
TY! Time to hit Crunchyroll.
Overlord dub also has some of the worst non-main character VAs lmao, but it has its charms
Redditors are at least predictable
I meant as a whole/**before** the fight. This scene did excellent demonstration and is exactly the same as in LN. What I said is that anime did not make many people understand the difference between a lvl100 NPC and NW humans. A lot of people actually expected the old man to put up some fight with Aura before the instant obliteration, because anime didn't really ever explain the power scaling properly.
Maybe i saw this i already seen season 4
What's a storyline?
SKIP
Cocytus was a warrior and understood a warrior's honor. Just like with the lizardmen, he will kill his opponent out of respect and not let them be humiliated.

That day, that part of the street was protected by Brain. 🫡
It took me a few seconds to realize that too...then I damn near cried
For me, the ultimate sign of respect was when Cocytus pulled out his creator's sword for this duel.

He saw Brain as completely worthy to not only die by his hand, but by his creator's weapon.
I love this part. In the Novel, Cocytus had initially considered capturing Brain and made him work for Nazarick, due to Brain's strength and talent. But later decided against it out of respect for Brain's resolve to die as a warrior.
Oh wow I did not catch that until now.  Need to go rewatch that now
Wait until the next season (not the movie) we get to see some nice stuff then for sure! Don't wanna spoil it, but makes this death scene look like a joke. Which I guess it kinda was actually lol.
The only one I thought did a poor job in the dub was Clementine 😬
Unbelievably predicable in how they almost never follow reddiquette.  

Upvoting and Downvoting are meant to be expressions of how well something contributes to a topic or to engaging a conversation in relation to a topic... not an expression of agreement or disagreement.
To be honest, I don’t know why anyone would’ve expected that he would put up a fight. It seemed pretty clear that nobody could do anything to the guardians.
If anything it still explains it too much. It's not that kind of show, and the less ammo it gives to shonen powerscalers to force it upon the show the better.

All that's really relevant is the juxtaposition between Nazarick being far beyond the New World, and their paranoia that there will somehow be something stronger lurking out of sight.
"You took everything from me."

"I don't even know who you are."
I have an important
Brain stood at the feet of a mountain. That was his dream and he fulfilled it in that fight. Much better than what happened to a lot of people in that kingdom.
They should have a bench named after him somewhere
I understand what you mean. But I felt like that was him acknowledging Brain. He was someone that was worthy of respect but at that point Brain could have disappointed him somehow. He showed Brain respect by pulling out that weapon. Brain showed him respect by trying honorably to block the path. Cocytus respecting Brain "blocked him" was the warriors code. But you are right. He honored him by using his creators blade.

All around. Top tier interaction.
He took a hard left. And its been a while since I read the LN of it so I honesty forget how its depicted in the LN. But in the anime he takes a hard left. And it looks like he's going elsewhere or something. But then they show you and over view of him taking a back alley deliberately around Brain so as to not disturb his honor.
I thought the movie is supposed to be the ending
The regular citizens, as well as some nobles are pretty bad. The slain theocracy knights in the first couple eps of season 1 were meh
I thought she was fine, but Hilma sucked.
I don't understand, either. I assume it's because anime did not specifically explain each NPC's level. Same as how a lot of people assumed Sebas is weaker than a Floor Guardian because his RP rank is lower.
Every video game for him 

“ I came here  to kill no to read”
“But for me, it was Tuesday.”
SKIP
While it was sad to see Brain go, he went down like a badass.
No, the movie actually covers the ark that happened before the fourth season. There are hints to it in the fourth season. The carriage that was attacked and started the whole war was relief aid meant to go to the nation that will be the focus of the movie. It was reliefe aid meant to help them recover from the events that took place in the movie, as well as to build a better relationship between that nation and Nazzarik. I'm afraid to say more because of spoilers but you'll see in the movie.   
The next season, unless they decide to do another movie, will be the elf kingdom ark. The end of the fourth season actually marked the ramp up for the series in terms of actual fighting. Conquering the kingdom and the fight at the end were just the beginning of Ainz's disrespect.
this I can agree to, Alot of Anime-only people assumed way back then that Sebas was weaker or a "lower" NPC just because he's not one of the main floor guardians.
In fairness many games that are fun to play have dialogue that you forget even after sitting through it, so might as well save time.
I-
New Quest: Interview the citizens of Honeywood (0/500)
Greg the Garlic Farmer evolved into Greg the Garlic Disaster. You may find a knife at you neck, but fret not, for anything you might do won't change the outcome.
Oh completely agree. One of my favorite interactions in the whole story thus far
(Spoilers?) Ahh ok. Is it covering the holy kingdom and Demiurge’s holy war? Where Ainz dies?
Most games also refuse to follow Valve's example, and let you play the damn game.
Bearer, seek, seek, lest.
Yeah basically. I don't remeber Ainz dieing though, but it's been a few years since I read it so that might have happened.
Same but I remember he ‘died’ to rune items to increase demand or maybe it was Demiurge
How could they think this would possibly work?
Putting aside just how infuriating their betrayal was, how could they think this would possibly work lol? The king himself offered his own head to the Sorcerer Kingdom and they rejected it, and now Zanac himself had a face to face meeting with Ainz and was able to walk away without harm to himself.


If Ainz actually wanted his head he could've taken it then and there. The fact that Zanac returned unharmed should've been the biggest red flag that betraying Zanac and giving his head to the Sorcerer King had a success rate of -1000000000000% 💀💀 

Did they not have a single working braincell in their heads? Lol this has to be the second dumbest decision in Overlord with the first being Phillip's existence. Him being born was the dumbest thing ever done.
They believed that the prince was unsuccessful because if the royal family survives, they could become a symbol for those who wish to rebel to rally around. They thought that Ainz intended to kill all of the royal family and their supporters in order to prevent rebellion. By letting Zanac return with news that Ainz would not accept surrender from the king, they believed Ainz was testing them to see who would still fight for the royal family.  Those who fought would be killed those who accepted Ainz as their new master would be spared.  By killing Zanac themselves and presenting his head to Ainz they hoped to show him that they no longer held any loyalty to the previous regime and have fully accepted his rule.
The point was that they were foolish and shortsighted. I mean, this whole death march was happening in the first place because a noble thought he knew the game better than anyone. They couldn’t comprehend the idea of “no”.

Zanac outright told them that there was no way out of this, and was nice enough to negotiate a swift death for everyone. But as we saw time and again in the series, the rich in this world can’t comprehend the idea they can’t buy their way out of something. So they killed him, thinking he was being unreasonable.
the actual answer: desperation.

Ains had already said he is going to kill them all. that a 100% chance of death.

but if bringing him the prince's head gave even a hundredth of a percent chance of surviving, it was less than 100%.

their only miscalculation was that Ains had come to like the prince during their talk. so instead of the enemy leader's head, they brought the head of the only human he really respected.
The nobles in Re-Estize were dumber than primordial amoeba. It was pretty obvious by how, with every mention of them and whenever they were shown, that they had no concept of reality. The only smart ones were the ones that kowtowed to Ainz for their own safety pre-invasion.
They are dumber than dumb but by their logic. By killing Zanac they technically eliminated the only opponent standing in Ainz's way. The commander of the army. Giving Ainz the prince's head shows they were willing to rebel to please him, pledging new loyalty. But to be fair, they'd probably try and kill Ainz if some other powerful ruler was taking over. No doubt.
Royalty suffer from a deficiency of braincells due to inbreeding to keep their bloodlines pure.
There's a reason why they weren't the group of "intelligent nobles" mentioned earlier in the season.
I think it's important to note the parallels here and the historic interactions between Julius Ceasar and Pompey, which I think I'd the clear inspiration for the tableau.

Pompey was one of the big names in military leadership that opposed Ceasar's abolishment of the Roman republic and led armies against him in the civil war that strung up. Ceasar wins his bid to become emperor and Pompey flees to Egypt to escape repercussions for his political and literal attacks against him. Guy in charge of Egypt, a young king named Ptolemy, sees the rising power and reach of Rome and wants to get ahead of the problem through diplomatic cooperation. Ceasar comes to Egypt to meet with ptolemy and discuss his search for Pompey. Ptolemy shows Ceasar the head of Ptolemy and basically goes, "I killed him for you! We're friends now, right?" Ceasar is pissed that his rival got done dirty and begins a campaign to depose Ptolemy, supported by another member of the royal family he just happened to meet completely by coincidence a little earlier: Cleopatra.

So, we have an autarch in pursuit of a rival military leader finding that their quarry had been decapitated by a third party hoping to avoid being conquered down the line. The autarch, aided by a female member of the royal family, is pissed and punishes the conspirators for cowardly killing a person he respected. It's a big 'ol allegory down to its roots.
I think the main reason is that Re-Estize lived in a bubble. It’s nobles think like most in re-estize do and things are a certain way that does not change from what they know.

The main problem is, well, Ainz does not give a shit about their bubble or how they do things. So they were unable to see the big picture because to them, what they did is the big picture. Frogs in a well basically.
As the show as seen, a lot of the Re-Estize nobles are very selfish and short sighted. They overestimate themselves constantly and constantly believe they are on some kind of standing with Ainz despite how vastly untrue that is. Plus this is very much out of desperation in a situation they were doomed to fall into because of how corrupt and dysfunctional the Kingdom has become or from Ainz guardians meddling things.
You have to be a fool to understand a fool, unless you are Ainz. The author emphasized on this Demiurge's quote so hard, I believe it is, and will, be giving answer to half of your questions to the series
To be fair you can't threaten complete  annihilation with overwhelming force and expect logical thinking . 

Especially when others were allowed to live .
They were desperate and Zanac was at the forefront of the resistance against Ainz. It was, to them, a diplomatic gesture meant to show how willing they are to appease Ainz and ally with him
Theoretically this may have worked well with a non anime protag.

Imagine you were a human king leading a human army. Powerful, but not win a battle with negative casualties powerful. A number of defectors in the enemy camp would be appreciated, more so if they can eliminate the opposing general to make the battle easier. You would appreciate not having to replace troops, train new recruits, lose manpower that could be farming, etc. 

But Ainz wasn't trying to win a war. He doesn't need to train troops. He doesn't fear losing warriors. He doesn't care about manpower. 

They were simply trying to communicate via methods a human would appreciate to a creature they don't really understand.
I think that most of you are missing totally missing their point. What where they supposed to do? Accept death? When faced with certain death even a slimmer of hope is worth pursuing and they didn't know that Ainz was planning to kill them all regardless. They did what they could.
A running theme with the kingdom is that their nobles are incompetent and self serving. Not the brightest tools in the shed.
[removed]
It's dumb because it's a power fantasy anime and the enemies need to be "guilty victims"
I don't mean any disrespect towards author but writing multiple smart characters or politics isn't his strong suit.  

Most of the nobles in the show are straight up dumb. We're introduced to multiple factions of nobles but it doesn't really go anywhere apart from being tortured/dead or surrendering to ainz.(Not like they had any choice but still).  

The emperor killing every single noble who might oppose him is also stupid. Any noble will pay attention to the king and his intentions towards other nobles. I seriously doubt that not a single noble suspected emperor's intentions to kill them. (Emperor or not assassination happen all too often in real life.)
Because it works for human? they become noble after doing lots of shit, what they don't keep the account in their tiny smoll brain is that their opponent as remote as possible from human in the first place.
put yourself in their shoes. what are your options. just sit there and die is definitely one of them- or you could take the one in a million chance of getting in His good graces. "omg literally like he could've just ended them then and there" yeah i know
It did work, though. They got to live together with their families under Nazarick's best musical conductor.
People said they were dumb but considering the time period and not knowing Ainz, the choices they made probably seemed logical to them.
their pagan ancestry valued human sacrifice enough that they felt their offering would be appreciated. However lord Ainz happened to be buddhist.
The nobles of Re-estize are extremely shallow and highly delusional, thinking that personal wealth and political influence is all that matters. They don't understand the worth of honour or basic human decency.

Because of this they lashed out at Zanac and think that offering his head would spare them, disregarding what their leader was trying to do or if Ainz would be lacking enough principles to let spineless cowards live.
phillip had a clear thought procees about why he did what he did , he was drunk , and he's phillip 

his decision was humoungously less stupid in on itself than this.
Desperation + this sort of thing usually works pretty well in history.
Its common in medieval era to prove fealty to new overlords to bring heads of your leaders.
Because it would have worked if it was essentially any other king, they simply could not read the room.
Their goal was to not die and Ainz happily offered them that with some slight damage
They're NPCs, what do you expect?
Their thought process was probably: well it Worked for the emperor
It might have work before the meeting between the two of them.
They didn't have any choice, LOL, Ainz was already going to made them an example, if memory doesn't fail me. 

Phyllip made things, uh, easier?? for them?.........Uh, well......Phyllip's thoughtless actions were the trigger they wanted to make to raze the kingdom to the ground, correct me if i'm wrong.
Hey, they wanted to live, and they got to live as long as they want to keep on living. They won more than they bargained for.
Nice name
They must have caught Phillip's stupidity.
Its more about proving their loyalty.
On top of the obvious "oh, they're stupid" answer. They were also terrified, knowing all their homes were about to be destroyed.

People do stupid things when fear takes over. Even when it takes over the smartest people. At this point, they were looking for any possible chance that they could save themselves and their families. The biggest thought going through their head was unlikely gifting the head, but more about trying to prove disloyalty to the royal family. Unfortunately, Ainz doesn't care for people who prove to be disloyal.
The men of the kingdom that were there, were nothing but spineless, idiots. 

To be honest, I would have been upset if they didn't try this tactic as it wouldn't have been true to their characters.
They knew they were dead anyways. I don’t blame them for reaching for the only sliver of hope they had left to save themselves and their families. Most would probably do the same.
Because they’re idiots? The whole point was that all of the nobility were incompetent morons who were directly responsible for the self-destruction of Re-Estize
Hijacking your post a bit: How far the anime is right now?

I watched it a couple seasons and then read a bit of the novels, but never finished them.
Check out Rise of New Olympus overlord fanfiction
Desperation
Don't over think it. They're npc. Npc mindsets are wild 😎
Look the author of overlord clearly makes characters dumber than they have any right to be.

Not realistic but hey.
Damn they give ainz hed
Damn, that shot is hella metal.
Jus watch the film Cleopatra similar to the scene of how egypt gave julius ceasar pompey head cause they thought it would appease him
They were phillip but less stupid
Midieval politics, monke brain + they truly couldn't comprehend Ainz's power 😂

While they're trying all they can and thinking the best they can to win, Ainz is already planning his victory feast 😂
With a certain horrific and painful death in your immediate future combined with knowing your family are also going to be killed soon, you tend to stop thinking rationally. Basically panic, terror, and desperation push rationality and intelligence out of your mind
Desperation makes people do stupid things in the worst of times. But when somebody is already stupid during the best of times, then how much stupider would desperation make them? Well, these nobles pretty much answer that question.
https://preview.redd.it/fackonc95b5d1.jpeg?width=320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f812787057db50d07432094c8ce9e6a81a5b61fa

They are truly a bum
It's simple. They didn't think.
They probably thought it was worth it to try. Either they stay and fight Ainz and die gruesomely or they bring their leaders head to him and they are either granted amnesty or killed on the spot.

Of course what they got was wayyy worse than death.
Shoddy writing.
Shoddy writing.
Stupid humans doing stupid things.
I think Ainz should have turned all royal members that died into an undead monument.  A royal attachment of attendants that follow him and show everyone what happens to those who oppose him.  Eternal servitude is a better deterrent than annihilation.
And I thought this was sub was gonna be about the game overlord 1 and 2 :( I wish they would make a 3rd game
They were desperate, and desperate people make stupid decisions in the spur of the moment, especially when they were stupid people to start with.
Desperate people do desperate things. Yes it's stupid but I could see it happen.
It seems stupid to us as viewers because we're aware of the whole plot. The nobles on the other hand, don't know anything really. Then Zanac did a shitty job explaining the situation to the nobles. Idk about the Manga but in the anime, he never tells them Ainz is going to genocide them all strictly to prove a point. He doesn't tell them that there's *nothing* that'll stop Ainz from going forward with this. 

As many characters expressed (even some of Ainz own), they didn't fathom why he was being so egregiously evil or why *everyone* had to die down to the infants. Generally speaking, conquerors like to takeover land and titles; not lay waste with a ~~scorched~~ frozen earth policy.

So when Zanac basically tells the nobles 'the only chance of survival is if we fight' what the nobles heard was "I refuse to surrender and I will spend the lives of everyone in this kingdom to protect my royal inheritance" so they killed him. They presented his head to Ainz because they didn't understand Ainz motivations or personality. They thought all he wanted was conquest and an expansion to his domain.
With Zanac out of the way, the kingdom could've easily been annexed by Ainz. If things worked out as they planned then they would've retained their positions as nobles but under Ainz instead, saved their families, and spared the populace from genocide.

They just never could've anticipated how dumb and psychotic Ainz actually is.
As anime only, I believe if the king presented his head and his son proposed the vassal state idea simultaneously. I think Ainz would accept and possibly even allow them to draw up the terms, as with the Empire (maybe more tax or other wise as he probably let Albedo and Demi have final say over law) but I think it’s possible they could have survived with minimal damage.
This episode is why I won’t be continuing the show
Also worth noting Zannac mentions but idk that all the nobles really thought about it but there was no need to kill every citizen as Ainz was. Like Ainz wanted to kill everyone and Zannac saw and co formed that, but that doesn't mean the nobles were competent to realise he wanted death as a message and not just to take over
Makes it even better when Ainz was trying to figure out a way to stop the war after his talk with Zanac.
They simply couldn't imagine the aims of Which this genocidal campaign meant to accomplish, had this been a war with the empire, the nobles Who did this would probably be spared at least, even if their holdings and riches could be seized, they would at least save themselves and their families. Only Chad Zanac had truly understood ainz at that time
They couldn't accept the reality that when a necromancer wants loyal servants it's easier to kill everyone and raise them as undead.
Everyone thinks they were being dumb, but imagine assuming an assaulter is truly planning to kill everyone in your realm. This was a misguided but understandable approach to the thought that someone more powerfully is gonna “take over” your kingdom
This also shows how stupid the nobles were. They still believed they 'mattered' to Ainz, or that they were 'important'.

Jircniv found out right away, he was nothing to Ainz, contacting the Theocracy was his last hope since he knew nothing in his kingdom could even touch him or invoke any emotion from him. He knew Ainz wouldn't spare him at all just because he is an 'emperor'.

Yet the kingdom believed they were important to Ainz, let it be due to their 'royal' bloodline or position. They were nothing, and their refusal to accept it caused them and their love ones to get torture for a long, long time.
They also forgot that Ainz killed Gazef Stronoff in less then a second. If he wanted the prince dead, he'd be dead already.
Applies to a lot of real life rich people, now that I think about it.
Smartly.... Headed directly to the happy farm! :D
Even then, ainz already took their families hostage lmao
Yeah. The ability to speak does not denote intelligence
Or the ones that died due to unavoidable circumstances-such as at the hands of other nobles
Tbf ainz himself realizes that and is partially the reason they wind up with neuronist
Renner kept her INT stats but the orphanage received her "humanity"
I don't think there was any real suggestion of incestuous relationship among royals in the Kingdom.

In fact the opposite makes far more sense, nobles were likely marrying to create political alliances; so they'd be marrying basically anyone *besides* their own kin; because it got them new allies. Inbreeding usually happens once a reign is stable, to ensure power remains within the family. It was actually surprisingly more common with peasant landowners. Since they had much less assets to try and retain it became incredibly important to use marriage to do so. So a lot of peasants would marry cousins or uncles/aunts to keep what little they had in the family.
Very true, it was even worse for ptolemy since Caesar was friends with pompey long before their schism. The only way it could have been more accurate in Overlord was if they gave him Gazef's head alongside Zanac's
If you don’t understand the country or culture you’re dealing with. You can’t actually understand their motives or actions. You just end up over or under estimating.

Honestly, it makes for great geopolitical drama in stories.
Re-Estize kingdom actually already in horrible politics problems even without Ainz wagging war with them.
King Ramposa intead of appointed a successor and cultivate his successor still hold the most power even take the credit when demiuge attacked capital by sending Gazzef in his name(this make his successor look more incompetent than him). 
First prince who is a muscle brain and too arrogant to even acknowledge that he need capable attendant. 
Zanac who actually more promising and thinking about country is outshined by his siblings because his appearance (he lucked out by having marquis raeven as hus attendant)
Renner is.....Renner (lol)
Don't mention noble faction who only care about their profits even go as far as killing one of their country best general. Even slane theocracy found re estize is going to meet it's end and it's better for re estize to be under empire. (Re estize can't control the black market that selling drugs, tons of corrupted noble, they even had to employ farmer to fight baharut empire what did you expect?).
And instead of getting killed, they got tortured and killed
A common issue for Nobles everywhere tbh.
Damn, I feel you bro, well said.
Effectively. It’s also the reason why Ainz’s free undead labor plan works when undead spoil and rot the fertility of his plan.

Otherwise Ainz would effectively have just made the hellhole dystopia he lived in and not give a damn about the countless people whose lives he stepped over.
In Jircnivs case they did, just werent believing 13yo would actually go with the plan. 

But even than his purge decimated all of his high quality middle managers to the point man was stucked with a mountain of paperwork everyday.
That is historically accurate for nobility at multiple points in history
This is completely believable, read actual history and you see this constantly
Correct: Zanac brings up that Philip’s transgression was, relatively speaking, light and the fact that no damage was actually done meant a politically savvy administrator could smooth things over…and Ainz agrees.

He then explains that his subordinates really just want to kill people and he doesn’t care enough about the people to offer much more than token ‘rules’ when it comes to the slaughter. Nazerick is full of monsters; even with their biological needs satisfied due to Rings of Sustenance, several of them LIKE killing and torturing humans. As long as it follows Ainz’s rules, then he’ll give them what they want.
Season 4 ended with re estize kingdom conquered by ainz and a little more stuff
To clarify in the light novel, Zanac did go into more detail as to why surrendering was useless and taking his head was pointless. He told them that he suggested submitting the kingdom as a vassal state, but it was rejected, making it clear that any attempt other than trying to put up a fight was pointless. They were all gonna die no matter what, and Zanac made that crystal clear. Especially clear in the light novel that had a few more lines that the anime left out.
As I said in that previous comment, he told them he tried submitting the kingdom as a vassal state, but Ainz rejected it, making surrendering impossible. Next, he told them that taking his head wouldn't accomplish anything and would get them nothing. 


He was fully aware from his conversation with Ainz that handing him his head wasn't going to make him happy and that he knew the nobles would get punished for what they're doing saying that he's glad that these idiots won't be around to cause his sister and father anymore trouble. 


At least he knew Ainz wasn't going to reward them.
Lol you're definitely trolling since there's only 3 episode left after this and to get this far you'd have to go through 4 seasons 😂
Wait really? I don't recall him having such thoughts, how close was he to stopping everything?
I recall this is why I got really interested into reading the novel, and started with the web novel...
false information, this never happened.
They were basically thinking in terms of Game of Thrones. They didn't realize Ains wasn't some noble playing feudal games, but was going to exterminate them.
I really don't think it was, if it was another kingdom or maybe an extremely strong human that was attacking then sure I could believe that, but this wasn't either of that it was an undead with an army of undead and demons/demi humans under their control.

Trying that stunt was akin to trying to bargain with Cthulhu when he is already in your realm, you would be better off committing suicide.
Well Jircniv wasn’t *nothing*! He was Ainz’s favorite livestreamer!
I don't think it is stupidity so much as their limited experiences. Jircniv was very clever, but he also ruthlessly purged his nobility down to the bone to secure his power. The kingdom didn't, and couldn't because of the wars with the Empire. So the noble factions were used to being important players, and the noble faction that wasn't loyal to the crown was used the the Empire who happily let them play both sides.

On top of this they distrusted the King, so they only had Zanac's word for it that Ains *wouldn't* accept his head. So it was a desperate ploy, but one they believed might work. Their biggest error is when Ains spares someone he dislikes, it is to grant a fate worse than death.
That's why even slaine theocracy label the kingdom as failed rotten nation.
Ben sell your underwater house Shapiro.
IIRC this has happened numerous times in real life kingdoms, feudal disputes and nobility infighting is a tale as old as the institutions that allow them to exist.
Hereditary wealth is the ultimate learning disability.
Resumes with ‘murdered my last boss’ don’t get serious consideration for employment.
How could they know
Skeletons don't radiates negative energy and high level conscious undead can control their negative energy. The reason undead presence spolied lands and crop is because in New World, undead only spawn in negative energy concentration spot, which is not the case with Ainz. Plus they can work in construction as well as farming. In Volume 13 we literally see them doing roadwork from Neia perspective.
..................The kingdom just drew the short end of the stick....................\*sigh\*................or well the majority of them since several were spared by that high-ranking noble turning traitor, mainly Demiurge taking his son as a hostage.
I wonder if the anime purposely made the nobles seem less informed to make their decision seem less idiotic. If they knew Ainz explicitly stated that he's coming to kill them all and nothing will stop him but they still killed Zanac then that would just makes them seem like desperate morons.
I was watching with my brother, I never really vibed with the show before, and this episode just kinda broke the camels back.
Essentially, talking with Zanac, Ainz felt unprepared and was very impressed by him. A mere human with no skills talking to a literal walking god so fearlessly? Ainz was thinking on a way to utilize Zanac and other people he could deem worth it, so he could have an excuse to save him.

He was willing to continue with the war, but not turned it into a genocide exactly.

And then, the nobles presented Zanac's head.... Ainz immediately reached the conclusion that he was wrong, and no life (aside from Zanac) was worth anything, so he decided to 'end the charade'.
That was a big mistake
Who’s gonna buy your house?! Aqua man?
Nope
They were stupid, that's all. Because maybe it would've worked with a human but they were treating with an undead, a creature with no regard for human life, also powerful enough to not care whether there was someone left to oppose him or not. Then we go back to the start: They're stupid XD
Where can I read ln
Yep. They were basically right next to Nazerick, the Princess turned traitor as well, and the kingdom was going to hell for a while.

And Marquis Raven I believe. And yeah, he loves his son dearly…and Demiurge knows that.
Zanac to the nobles after telling him to surrender:


“It is a waste of time to surrender to His Majesty the Sorcerer King. I have
received his message loud and clear, he will never accept our subservience…
Although you might not believe me, our only hope lies in His Majesty the
Sorcerer King’s defeat. I suggested vassalage, but it
was useless. I will reiterate that our only hope of survival is through battle.”

Zanac after the nobles said they'll offer his head to Ainz and pledge themselves to the Sorcerer King:


“Let me say one thing, it is useless for you to take me to him. I, as a member
of the royalty, have made up my mind to battle to the end. Those of you who
wish to die here, do try!”

ZANAC'S INTERNAL THOUGHTS:


"Good grief.
Blue-on-blue, what an absolute joke.
No, he should count himself fortunate that these fools would meet their ends
right here. Surely, they can not burden his sister or father after this. Fucking pathetic. Was his life really about to be terminated by incompetent bastards like them?"

So Zanac straight up says in his mind that these nobles were idiots
When did this happen? Do you have a quote?
The light novel points this out better then the anime but just going off how ainz was impressed with him, tried to spare people during the invasion of other cities besides the capital by sending a somewhat pathetic force so some people could escape, and his almost uncharacteristic sheer rage at Zannac's death where he tells aura to not only kill but torture the royals responsible you can still conclude most of this.
Yeah, if you want someone to take that résumé positively, you need to go to a galaxy far, far away and apprentice yourself to someone who has “Darth” as a title.
This sub [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/overlord/w/faq?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) contain link to every official Overlord content.
The anime definitely should've done more to properly convey that. It changes the "flavor" of their betrayal completely when they're so well-informed.
Sorry, no quote... it happened shortly after Zanac's side of the story ended, Ainz began monologuing to himself, believing Zanac's attitude was truly that of a royal, and thinking he could use that or at least imitate a few things from him like he has done with Jircniv.

He implied he could spare him, thinking about the war, feeling a bit guilty of just killing him, he didn't concrete any idea before he was rudely interrupted by the nobles.
In the anime he says something along the lines of "A truly dauntless man, that is what true nobility looks like" or something along those lines.

I truly feel like ainz respected the prince, hence why he ordered Aura bella fiora to give him a proper burial, as well as ordered the brutal torture and death of everyone involved with the princes murder.
Tbf, if your name is Darth anything, the implication is you either killed your boss or about to kill your boss, cause that's how the sith work
This is a common misconception I see. Ainz had no thoughts of stopping the war or sparing the Kingdom. His only thoughts were genuine respect for Zanac as a ruler.
Thanks for narrowing it down I'll look for it later
Can Ainz resurrect a head? Because that would be freaking awesome. Zanac was unironically one of the best characters in the show.
>Sorry, no quote

exactly, cause this never happened.. Ainz considering sparing Zanac is just false information
True, the war was set in stone.

Ainz thoughts seemed to imply he might have a chance to spare a few our of respect for Zanac (up to interpretation), but it was near impossible since Ainz knew he could never convince Albedo or Demieruge that Zanac was worth it.
He does say “I’m done with this charade” or something like that after he sees the head, and internally praised zanac heading back from the meeting with him. For anything deeper you might have to check out the LN or written content
He could but because of the respect he had for Zanac Ainz won't resurrect him. 

Also what purpose would it serve. Except for one border city and a selection of survivors that are totally loyal to Ainz the Kingdom of Re-Estize has been leveled into a metaphorical parking lot. The kingdom's treasury has been looted and transferred to the tomb. His sister is an imp now, and his father was killed by his sister. There is nothing for Zanac to rule and he doesn't offer anything to  the tomb that could not be done by one of the loyal nobles or the tombs npcs. 

While his death wasn't needed his resurrection would cause Zanac more problems of which  Ainz is not willing to put Zanaz through.
It needs a certain degree of personal strength I think, since it eats levels to resurrect them. Dunno if Zanac has the class levels needed for it the way the Blue Rose members or the lizards did.

Then again, he was considering bringing back the villagers in that first attack on Carne, so maybe it would work.
Good take, although I would say that Ainz could install him as a human King to rule over humans and as a good touch stone for the humanity that he knows and acknowledges he has lost. The fact that he respects him and could trust him to rule fairly is worth more than the entire Kingdom of Re-estize's treasury. Zanac is also not so blindly loyal and devoted as Ainz's tomb NPC's or as self serving as the nobles.

Bipedal mechs will never be physically viable, much less anything taller than maybe 10 feet.

Yoshi is the goat! Been following him for 8 or so years now on Twitter.
They should have taken the head and arm and then paused the disassembly for a week
It's like a giant Gunpla
I hope they keep all the pieces in the gunpla box. You never know when you'll need them!
never got the chance to see it, am still a student. did not save enough money nor did i have a travel companion , the regret is strong with this one. especially since the RX-78-2 is my favourite (i know it’s the RX-78F00)
Press F to pay respect
Good bye friend, I was happy to have got to see you right before your departure. o7
Rest easy, RX-78. Rest well
but i just arrived here in Japan madge

jk, it sucks that i missed my window to take a picture with this beast, my travel plan to japan got delayed to this month instead of early last year

but heyy, atleast i can buy stuff at Gundam Base soon
Would have been easier to dismantle if they just let a cat knock it off a shelf
The fact that I lived in Japan and still never went lmfao. Fuck man
They took my fucking arms

I bought viewing platform tickets and ran into a group of travellers from across the US who met through WoW around december.

Was fun chatting with them and gushing over the engineering behind the big guy
Wonder if they are selling any of the parts

Straight builders I see, didn't even paint the inner frame
He truly has become immobile suit gundam

Sad, I really wanted to see this big guy someday.
LOOK WHAT THEYVE DONE TO MY BEAUTIFUL BOY!!!
Its amurover 😞
Wonder if they'll auction off the pieces for charity or something?
Which Kit is this 1:1  HG?
I really hope it comes back elsewhere I wasn't able to see it at all
![gif](giphy|l4pMattUYTTM7qpIk)
Eternally grateful I got to see this before it was gone. It’s definitely a core memory for me. Kind of breaks my heart to actually see it coming down.
A dream of mine was to see this when I finally get to visit Japan. Had plans and the money to do it then the pandemic hit and they closed off tourists for a while. Then I couldn’t afford it anymore cause life happens
I hope they are just taking it apart to add magnetic coating and reassembling it somewhere else...

Sigh, I don't get to visit Japan until July and had my fingers crossed they would extend it one more time...guess it just wasn't meant to be
Looks like a Gunpla being assembled lol

While I regret not buying a kit or two from the shop, I’m honestly glad I was able to pay this guy a visit last year
 I didn’t follow, why are they taking it down?
I think I'm gonna cry a bit
I'll miss the big guy and mourn that I never got a chance to see in person, but as a robotics engineer I'm having way too much fun analyzing the inner frame and how they did the hydraulics and motion!
Do you think they kept the box
Privacy guys.

Stop looking at the Gundam strip tease!
This is very sad to me. I never had the chance to go and see it in person. Unfortunately I had to cancel my trip to Japan this year before they closed doors, and I’ll regret that I couldn’t see it in full majesty, forever.

How we all feel:
Yeah this is very quickly an argument for why machines as complicated as machine should never be primary weapons
Fun fact:
Anaheim Electronics personnels are the one doing the maintenance
They’re taking it down for custom re-paint and topcoat
This is a was crime to take this apart
Does it make anyone else angry that we have intercontinental ballistic missiles, a space force, and laser weaponry but we don't have anything even close to battle Gundams yet?

Battle Gundams, if done right, would absolutely mog tanks.

So why hasn't anyone put forth the effort?
Now would be a great opportunity for a counterattack of some sort.
But who/what will defend Earth? /s

god it devestates me that i never got to see it
Did they say what they're doing with it?
Sweeetest my sweetest
Not removing the head and one arm first is a mistake.
It is fascinating to watch it come apart though
Well,this is sad but imagine they are preparing for another anaheim electronics in japan ad another minovsky lmao
😭😭😭 I LOVE YOU, im tryna see that skeleton on god
Sad to see it go.

No one likes to disassemble a gunpla.
It kills me that this is getting disassembled, despite being a positive icon, but the giant asshole Norman that it was based on, one special guy walking a city sized special guy, is allowed to still exist. Sunrise holds significantly more value than Oklahoma, but the weapon used for domestic terrorism gets to survive? Bullshit.
Why is it being taken down?

This makes me sad. Lucky I got to see it last year
Gah, wish I could have caught it beforehand. Was supposed to go to Japan earlier this year but plans changed. Anyone know if the other Gundams are gonna stay up? Nu / Unicorn.

Glad I got to see it.
Think it would have been great if they did the final pose from the series. No head, one arm pointing up
So where is it going? What are they doing with it?
I really had the image it was just going to be put on the back of a large truck and carted off… with a large tarp over it.
Dont worry yall we will see it again once its fully built into a working gundam suit kek uwu
Looks more like it's being disarmed to me

ok now try the actual one, if it messes with the ground after that. walk to a new place. the marionette idea ruined it for me to be honest.
I’m really having mixed emotions too. I saw it 4 times. And the last time was a month before it closed. I didn’t want it to leave. But seeing the inner frame is great!
it was an early rg frame all along
It would be great to read more and the structure and what leason they learned.   I'd definitely watch a documentary or read  the book about the design and construction.




I found this one.

Just buy two pg unleashed 🤣
You will be missed, dear friend...
Same here

o7
I really wish that wasn’t $1000. I settled for the regular 1/100 Chogokin version.
That's why we should build the guntank instead
Nah you are wrong for so many reasons.

Construction mech will save the world, i just want it so badly 😿


Sigh who am i kidding endgame will always be wheel and spear =\
Could bipedal mechs not be viable in Space?
I feel like if we ever see mechs they'll be closer to knightmare frames from Code Geass
When were you here?
This is where I am. Wanted to see it; never got to.
Shhhh they aren’t really suppose to be talking about the refit…..
Agreed! I’d like to imagine if been standing next to him at some point at gundam base or Yokohama
The original Odaiba RX-78 was posed in the “last shot” stance with head and one arm removed during disassembly
*Real Real Grade*

And like many real grades it also has a dainty inner frame.
Ludicrous Grade
Actual Grade

Please enjoy your time here! I hope they have restocked the gundam base. The past few weeks it’s been empty. Due to it being spring break for kids and the end of the fiscal year
I’m guessing you’re not close to Yokohama. I haven’t been to Fukuoka yet, and Nu Gundam is my favorite Gundam.
I’m still holding out hope that it’s going to be moved to the Osaka Expo. It was the rumor all over Japan the weeks before the finale. But they never mentioned anything yet
Mid season upgrade!
Unfortunately, nah
Not a HG, it has an inner frame so it must be RG or MG. Likely early RG given how thing the inner frame is...
Same!
the movement destroyed itself and cracked the concrete.
Why? A pesky little thing called the square cube law. The laws of physics don't allow for mechas that large in real life. They would either be too heavy to move on their own or collapse under their own weight. Flying would be completely off the table. On top of that, you need to deal with the drawbacks of a bipedal design. It's inherently unstable. If even one leg takes damage, it's over. Not easy to deal with when your giant robot is also a giant target.
They did that to the odaiba gundam. I’m sure this has to be broken down in a certain order
March 31st
March 29
Nothing yet, but I hope
Send em back repair i guess
What....
Seeing all the rust on the inner-frame after only a couple of years shows why they're taking this thing down. The salty sea-air has to be hell on maintenance, and with something that big, complicated, and moving, the costs and risks will only keep going up and up.
Maybe the next one will have PGU inner frame.
Wish I got to see it before it went out of service.
I was lucky enough to see it the day before it closed! I am surprised they are just scrapping something this awesome.
Bandai be updating it to RG 2.0
If you go to the gundaminfo channel on YT they should have some vids on the building process. They were selling a book about it in the gift shop too that I was able to pick up. So someone has to be selling one online if you really want it
Wooo!
Metal… Gear???
It's a giant, slow moving and impractical mechanical thing. Why go for that instead of a cruiser or a drone?
It depends what you mean by "viable."  Could they work?  Sure.  But it will always be a worse craft than something more compact and streamlined, and it would take a hell of a lot of engineering to even get that.  So lot of extra effort for a worse result.
Why do you need legs in space?
If the AMBAC system idea was sound they could be somewhat viable in space, but then the question is immediately "why make it a humanoid, why not give it way more limbs for more movement"
I was there in December. I got to see the Unicorn Gundam, but I didn't find time to get to Yokohama. But I would have!
Same! His pictures never match the days I’ve been. lol. I remember I started following him when they were constructing the Unicorn statue in like early 2017. Some good stuff over the years.
IRLG
Real Estate Grade
will do and thanks for the heads up :D 

hope i can get my hands on RG GP01Fb and Hi-V Gundam
I live in Tanashi, Tokyo haha. Its kind of a trip. Between work and taking care of my family…and honestly just having no one to go with.

I frequent Odaiba tho
You think it’ll ever appear somewhere else?
But what if minovsky particles became real? /s
I actually think it could only viable if the giant robot was bloody fast and agile
O damn on my birthday
hm?
Yeah that's true. Also something I definitely did not take into account when I wondered why they were dismantling it.
They really should have Zinc-plated it.
That’s also canonically why the tallgesse 1 couldn’t body the OM gundams. It had been exposed to ocean breeze for to long.
It would be so heavy!
Same, my family and I are visiting japan next year, so not getting to see the life-size grandpa in action just hurts
Same 🙁
Psycho mantis???
Joints. Ideally you’d have no joints because that’s a point of weakness and fuck knows what sorta tiny objects hurtle at high enough speed to shear it off.
Easy. 

A humanoid can move as efficiently in space as any other body. Legs allow you to transfer seamlessly between gravity (O'Neill cylinder colony) and zero-G. The human body works, despite its inherent complexity. 

We may not have the materials or understanding to pull off the construction of a biped mech off today, but that doesn't mean we never will. Nothing in the laws of physics expressly forbids it, only limitations in modern fabrication.
To kick things?
You can swing them around and use the angular momentum to make small manuevers without using thrusters
I’m so sorry for you. I hope they’ll move it to a new venue in the future.
You're saying that you want them to build a Gundam that actually walks around?
Was this mentioned in the show? I don't remember that, though it does make sense.
heavy arms
A Hind D!?
Yeah, that fell under "impractical". Mobile Suits will never be an actual, viable thing
This a destroyed MS would basically be a claymore in space.
Wouldn't extra arms be better with that in mind though?
I have high doubts. They're taking this thing down because it's probably a maintenance nightmare. And a lot of that has to do with it rusting from the salty sea air. There's not a lot of major cities in Japan that aren't close to the ocean.
just like thay promoted the project
in the glory of the defeated manga Howard tells zechs after the tallgesse flugel (Tallgesse retrofited for space with what would be become Zero EW's wings) is destroyed fighting the Deathscythe.  the tallgesse would have been able to easily defeat the OM gundams if it was not stored in a ocean front hanger with the salt breeze corroding its systems. It explains while the Tallgesse 2, which is a ground up build using extra Tallgesse one parts, is able to out duel the Altron gundam. It had fresh systems
The DARPA chief?
The closest thing we might ever see, **if** we see anything approaching something like this, is smaller, low-profile non-humanoid designs along the lines of, for instance, the multiped tanks in *Ghost in the Shell*. And I suspect they'll be remotely-operated drones rather than true piloted mechs.
Counterpoint - if Gundam/mecha anime still are a relevant thing in pop culture in hundreds of years, it might be brute forced into reality with whatever crazy future tech exists if people still care enough. I’m sure people in 1979 would’ve never imagined the moving Gundam of today, what they could build in 2224 is beyond our imagination.
They could always set it up in some kind of indoor facility. Though I feel like the disassembled parts will probably just go in a museum display kind of thing.
Yeah but that's almost impossible.
BROTHER!!!!
I always thought the closest we may get far into the future is something akin to mechwarrior/battletech but probably more likely to get exo suits & other more conventional vehicles..sadly
> They could always set it up in some kind of indoor facility.

It's 20 meters tall. That's not going to fit in indoors anywhere.

You're taking stabs in the dark, but I assume the people who are paid handsomely to manage this project have spent more time than you or I trying to figure the logistics of this out and are far more qualified to do so. If they haven't found a good place to relocate it, that's probably a good sign such a place doesn't exist, and/or the logistics/cost are prohibitive.
almost
According to the Gundam Academy, one of the key tenets of the project was to have the F00 outdoors and visible from a distance.

They probably could relocate it somewhere indoors, but they might do the same sort of thing they did with the original 78 statue and exhibit parts of it on a temporary basis.
They could find an abandoned airplane hangar to put it in…
They wouldn't be able to make money of of it

Thinking back, Muzan would've ripped Gyutaro a new one if he actually made Tanjiro a demon.
Like at this point he new nothing about the Kamado bloodline being immune to sunlight, so he would've just thought Gyutaro was disobeying direct orders to kill them.

He would’ve loved it, having the sun breathing demon art would be crazy
Assuming Tanjiro’s capable of withstanding Muzan’s blood to become a demon. Muzan gets final say in what demon gets to live or die. So, we’d see Tanjiro either live his “best” life as a sun breathing UM (take THAT um1!!!!) or he’d just get popped like a tick by Muzan.
It is still Muzan cells decision at the end of day :3
You joking? Nah he would have been like HELL YEAH another demon slayer especially a strong one a demon. He wanted him dead but have him join him worst case he'd just kill tanjiro with his blood and best case, he'd have a super strong demon equal to at min lower 1.
I thought only Muzan could make people demons. Could other demons do this too?
Muzan needs to accept an upper moons proposal. (Chapter extra, written by Gotouge and completely canon. This is how >!Kaigaku became a demon. Koko gave him his blood and Muzan accepted the proposal!<.)

https://preview.redd.it/9xy34kfp7rcd1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a250159877dac755681fb28ec2332dfdd5b196a
I think he’d be glad to have another possible Sun Breathing threat under his control instead of against him 🦋
No not really. It would have taken out the single grain of salt into the machinery
Gyutaro could have killed Tanjiro right here and the demon slayers would be fked 💀
Tanjiro would had only became a demon if Muzan allowed it. Plus >!He's turned Demon Slayers before, including Kokushibo!<
It amazes me how polite and honorable the vilians are, always asking for permission to transform them.
That’s a given, but he’d have scolded him and moved on, because at the end of the day, now Tanjiro is potentially under his control and could be terminated at will. It’s only a problem if he and his sister escape and he also break the Curse of Kibutsuji. 

If not, Muzan has the last sun breather under his control, and so therefore the breathing style is now his weapon. If he realizes this, he could keep the siblings, and when one conquers the sun, it’ll be so easy to absorb them. If not, they die, and both sides take a major hit as Muzan prematurely terminates his victory, and the demon slayers lose their activation card for the mark.

They might not even become demons, Muzan, upon getting the notification, could easily veto and prevent the transformation.
Either way, Muzan might just be happy with that decision, considering tanjirou would be under his control and would probably not be able to pose a threat to him with his influence and other stuff, or Gyutarou simply just kills him and Muzan would be ECSTATIC
Tanjiro is the same blood as Nezuko.  Muzan would have been over the moon with joy once he saw what ability that conferred to Tanjiro, and subsequently to himself.
Yo creo que Muzan hubiera hecho que Tanjiro lo retara por su puesto como la 6ª luna superior y seguramente Gyutaro y Daki hubiesen muerto
I will spoil this whole thing for everybody if y’all don’t stop making these dumbass posts
Having a sun and moon breathing demon would make his day.
I don’t think so
Yeah he would have been hyped. Not only does it get rid of the threat of tanjuro, he would have another demon with a breathing style
Would he? He had standing orders to have Tanjiro killed, but turned into a demon he’d be a powerful ally.
Actually, this is a fair point
I think Muzan would’ve actually been happy. Since Tanjiro knows sun breathing there is reason to believe he’d be immune to the sun. Nezuko ends up being immune
Have you read the manga?
Tanjiro would >!resist the sun immediately as he later does!<, which means Muzan would >!consume him, become immune to the sun, and just destroy all the demons because that was their only use to him.!<

So technically, you are correct.
I mean, I think Muzan wouldn’t care too much, like, he doesn’t really have much respect or care for the upper moons, but he knows they’re not morons, so if one of them wanted to convert someone, I’m not sure Muzan would stop it
Here's a matchup I thought about a while ago. 

Flect Turn from My Hero Movie 3 vs Muzan
Ohhh, I never realised it was the Kamado bloodline that was immune to sunlight ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flushed). I thought it could have to do with Nezuko not being a typical demon. What episode reveals this?
Dumb take...

He would obviously love it because tanjiro would have conquered the sun and the MuZAn would have absorbed him and GG.

All of a sudden gyytaro delivered him his one true wish!
Noooooo not my Gyu-San! 😭🖤💚
L take from a fake fan who doesnt know the story or characters and what they would like and not like
I mean he probably wanted to tear Guytaro a new one for a while
Why? It would mean Muzan can Absorb sunnimmune Tanjiro and gain immunity to the sun.
Muzan wouldn't care much since Tanjiro wasn't a threat to him at this point, plus he could just kill him.
I think he would’ve given Gyutaro a promotion if he managed to convert A sun breathing user to a demon or at least Demon of the month
Muzan had no issue making Kokoshibo, Yoroichi's literal twin, a demon
If muzan didn’t like tanjiro as a demon he could just kill him like he did with the lower moons 🤷🏾‍♂️
Can’t he just explode the demon cells in tanjiros body?
Muzan would probably love it.

It would be like putting his greatest threat on a leash, and Muzan could kill him at any moment.

Why? Tanjiro at this point isn't especially strong.
He didnt want to transform yoriichi who's the creator of sun breathing and tanjiro gives him PTSD so i doubt he'd like it
Nah Muzan hates when his underlyings show initiative because he thinks they are trying to outshine him.
One reason I love Muzan is because he isnt just evil, he is also a terrible abusive boss.
Plus Muzan would also like that he’s making a mockery of Yoriichi by not only having Yori’s brother in his demon army, but the sun breathing successor too
Yeah, he let Douma turns Daki and Gyutaro even if he didn't ordered it
Yeah, no matter what, if Muzan orders a demon to die, that demon dies.
Not necessarily. Nezuko overcame muzans cells near instantly. 

It's entirely possible Tanjiro would also overcome muzans cells and become another free-acting demon like Nezuko and Tamayo. 

Muzan would be in a world of danger if a sun-resistant, sub breathing, rogue demon started hunting him down with the hashira.

And, Spoilers: >! DKT had only existed for a few minutes AND was ALL of muzans UNDILUTED blood. He can't really be used to say Tanjiro wouldn't break free !<
1. He doesn't like Tanjiro.

2. He doesn't like making demons.

3. Gyutaro ain't dead, so he doesn't need another Upper Moon.

4. He already disbanded the lower moons.
>! UM’s like Kokushibo,Douma and Akaza have a lot of Muzan blood inside of them. That’s why they can also make people’s demons. Kokushibo made Kaigaku a Demon. Douma Gyutaro and Daki. Akaza wanted to make Rengoku and Giyu a Demon!<
Upper one and two have been shown to convert humans into demons on screen itself(manga panel not literally screen) and akaza has claimed to have the same ability. Think of it as muzan using them like a phone line, if they think someone would make a good demon they give them blood, if muzan shares their belief then they’ll turn into one, if not it’s lights out I guess. Both gyotaru and kaigaku were demonised in this way.
Only Muzan can make demon, and the upper rank demon can only Initiate a demon making process which then goes to Muzan and if he accept it, only then the demon creation will be complete.

Lower rank demon cannot initiate the demon creation process.
Have you even watched the show dude? This topic came up plenty of times and not just as a side note.
My understanding is Muzan is the one that making the final decision. Even if your body is compatible with his body, as long as he rejects you, you will die. Only a few demons had special permission to distribute his blood.  One of the examples is lower moon 5. Some upper moon had give his blood to some else without getting the permission first ( or at least I believe so), but they made similar remarks that implied they can become demons if Muzan accepts it.
fr, considering muzan did some of the og's dirty, akaza straight got a hand through his face then got the option to die or transform💀
It isn't

The mountain that the kamado family live on is the place where the blue spider lily grows and they use it in their medicine. Hence why nezuko worked outside the normal demon rules
pretty sure the reason is manga spoiler. hasn't been addressed in the show yet
Muzan doesn't know about that at this point.
he would absolutely care wtf are you on
Gyutaro could've outright ended his greatest threat then.
Tanjiro is not Yoriichi's blood
Nothing implied he saw making *anyone* from Yorrichi's bloodline as a get back, so I doubt he'd get any personal satisfaction from it.
Nezuko being immune to sunlight was literally in the last season. Idk what to tell you.
He's removing the threat, that's invaluable to Muzan
I mean, at this point in the story, tanjiro had gone up against like two moons and survived. Plus he mostly fought rui on his own, granted without getting the kill. I can see why Gyutaro was at least interested in tanjiro
Yes he was? He 100% would have been the next Upper moon(although, given what we've seen from Nezuko, it's probable that he'd be immune to the sun and therefore would get eaten by Muzan)
[removed]
Tanjiro is a thousand times stronger than the people Muzan turned into demons…
Sir, you don’t know shit.
Because he’s taking away his biggest threat to him and making him a puppet that can use sun breathing
Tanjiro wasn't that strong here yet but remember he also reminds him of the man Muzan feared.
He is stronger than a lower moon as a human, and with Sun breathing
And yet Muzan runs for the hills whenever he sees him…
Muzan didn't know how powerful or important Yoriichi was when they first met. And after that first meeting, he was too scared to ever go near him again.
I think I’ll have to disagree with you on this. Muzan couldn’t care less about shine or credit. He just wants to be immortal. That’s it. He actually kind of cares about the UMs
Tamayo, the demon boy she made, and Nezuko being the only exceptions, right?
I don't think Muzan would care. He can just kill Tanjiro even easier once he becomes a demon
Gyutaro can't make a demon without Muzan's consent.  Tanjiro would only become a demon if Muzan's cells accepted him.

  
At this point in the story, Muzan didn't know Kamado blood was the key to his primary objective.  If he did know, he'd make Tanjiro a demon in an **instant**.  He'd do it himself.
I think Muzan still has to accept you. I remember Kokushibo saying something along those lines.
[deleted]
I forget things easily. I even rewatched season season 1 and there were so many interesting things I forgot.
Ppl forget things

Do you remember every single plot thread of every single show you watch
It doesn’t actually come up that much.
Also the same house that Yoriichi lived in with Uta.
Oh sixxxkkkk!! So Nezuko is immune to sunlight from the blue spider lily's she ate growing up? So how come Muzan hasn't found those lilies yet?
Its not even manga spoiler, its on a fanbok.
Yes he does, why do you think he killed tanjiros family, he tried to turn them into demons in order to see if they would conquer the sun.

 besides it would become immediately apparent when tanjiro doesn't die from the sun, he would absorb him and tell gyytaro.

"Wow bro you did it!, promoted ! You are now more my favorite "
I mean, not really. Tanjiro was just a low-level slayer. (At this point in time)
Muzan probably thinks he is.
Post says. Thinking back, muzan would have ripped guyitaro a new one if he actually made tanjiro a demon…. How is not a spoiler for people who are currently watching the English dub and on episode 3 of the new season. We also have not learned how she was immune…..
Killing Tanjiro would also remove the threat.
Those aren't exactly reasons for Muzan to be thrilled.
Yeah but that's not really "crazy" to Muzan at this point.
spoilers go wild
Brodie this has an anime tag id mark your spoilers
Bro, you fucked up the spoilers tag, it dont work if there is a line break. That is straight up spoilers of the very ending
Bro these are MAJOR SPOILERS you need to spoiler this
Thanks for the spoilers without using the spoiler block text that was made specifically for instances like this.
Don't leave a space between '>!' and the first 'letter'
Make sure to put a space between your spoiler markers, you've almost got it!
I hate you so much right now :( next time mark your spoilers on anime-only threads ffs man, please
Muzan doesn't know any of that at this point.
...so do you have anything constructive to say or....?
Muzan avoided Tanjiro once while they were in a public area.
He did know yoriichi was powerful since he had already transformed kokushibo and know how much he hated him because of how strong he is, he just didnt know HOW powerful he was
Its more that he thinks of himself VERY high and he dislikes when the other demons have ideas smarter than his own or contradict what he said.
The issue is that if he actually was as cunning as he thought he would already get everything he wanted. But he is petty, irrational and very impulsive which is why he murdered the doctor before even seeing the effects of the drug.
SPOILERS: >!Due to Muzan getting his teeth kicked in so badly by Yoriichi he ended up losing the connection between him and Tamayo. The boy Tamayo turned had a different ritual done to him as he doesnt require blood near as much as a typical demon and didnt die when she or Muzan died. Nezuko also lost connection to Muzan due to insanely strong emotional connection to Tanjiro overriding what happened to them.!<
Muzan would care that Gyutaro went through the effort of wasting his blood and not killing Tanjiro when he specifically wanted Tanjiro dead.

The effort it would take to kill Tanjiro from Muzan at this point was always pretty much zero.

The fact that Muzan has to do it now is the problem.
>!He said that to Muichiro. “Let me make you a demon. With your abilities you can be useful to that man. But if he doesn’t accept you then death is in your fate!<
I thought he was referring to the blood. Like how the first few times we saw Muzan giving blood to humans, there was a chance of rejection and that human will die instead of becoming a demon.
Not directly, what Kokushibo meant was that the Muzan cells in his blood could reject Kaigaku and kill him off if he wasn't worthy.
No - Rui turned other demons into something similar to him.
Don't worry, that's fair.
You also forgot that you typed another "season" word
Of course not, but this is a frequently returning theme bro. It's like forgetting that the Breathing Styles exist.
A mixture of bad luck and really bad management
>!They only bloom during the day two or three times a year. Muzan was too prideful to employ humans to investigate.!<
Why would Muzan try to kill Tanjiro with the sun? He would just explode his cells.
he literally sent people to specifically kill him because he saw he's part of the bloodline. He hates when people don't follow his orders. His level as a slayer literally does not matter.
Even Gyutaro could tell Nezuko and Tanjiro were related
This was a plot point back in season 2 my guy.
Making him a demon makes him an ally as well though
How is that going for him? 

If he turned instead, he could kill him in a snap of his finger.
Yes it is? This is BEFORE the Upper Moons start dropping like flies
Does that negate the fact that he knows he’s a demon slayer who wears hanafuda earrings like the 🐐? Muzan wouldn’t care if he’s a demon, either way the potential threat eliminated
And instead of finding him after the fact and killing him personally he sends two other demons to do the job
Where did you get the idea that Muzan already knew about him before their encounter? That's never stated anywhere that I know of. In chapter 195 Muzan said that when he first saw Yoriichi, he seemed completely weak and unthreatening. And that's the only time Muzan ever really talked about his perspective during that encounter. He never indicated that he had any clue about Yoriichi's strength, aside from knowing he could use Breathing.

I'm not completely discounting the possibility that Kokushibo warned Muzan about Yoriichi, but there's no point where we're explicitly shown or told that he did. In the manga, Muzan seemingly had no idea who or what he was dealing with when he ran into Yoriichi.
the writing is still inconsistent for Nezuko. Still doesnt make sense.
I don’t remember many instances of us being shown him giving blood, but for that one case I remember the most he purposely overdosed the girl with his blood full knowing that her human body couldn’t withstand it, he meant to kill her there.
IDK why you were downvoted. This is what I remembered.
That’s exactly what he meant, I can’t believe you got downvoted so bad
Yeah, that is also plausible
That's Muzan specifically giving him leeway cos he saw similarities in their situation I think
I would argue that remembering the specifics of how the demon transformations work, is something even the most hardcore fans might get mixed up with.

Even for me, I've watched the series at least 3x (except for the most recent season of course), and I've completed the manga, but even I needed to read the manga to remind myself how the rules about making demons work
That’s a given, but he’d have scolded him and moved on, because at the end of the day, now Tanjiro is potentially under his control and could be terminated at will. It’s only a problem if he and his sister escape and he also break the Curse of Kibutsuji. 

If not, Muzan has the last sun breather under his control, and so therefore the breathing style is now his weapon. If he realizes this, he could keep the siblings, and when one conquers the sun, it’ll be so easy to absorb them. If not, they die, and both sides take a major hit as Muzan prematurely terminates his victory, and the demon slayers lose their activation card for the mark.

They might not even become demons, Muzan, upon getting the notification, could easily veto and prevent the transformation.

(From Alolapok700)
So they explained in season 2 that the Kamado bloodline was the reason why nezuko can go in the sun? Hmmm. Must have missed that.
Considering he already has the uppermoons, I don't think he'd care so much about a demon slightly stronger than daki. And since tamayo has already proven that demons can escape his curse, he'd likely just kill him (probably absorb him) and move on.
Unless he were to become another Tamayo or Nezuko.
............ 😒 I would kill him if I find him
Muzan doesn't want more demons, he wants the Slayers dead.
Yeah, so if he has a bunch of demons that are stronger than Tanjiro and that he likes significantly more than Tanjiro, why would he be crazy about Tanjiro joining his ranks?
I mean kinda? Muzan wanted Tanjiro dead, not recruited. Muzan doesn't know anything about the Kamado sun-stuff outside of the earrings, why would that factor into his opinion?
Yeah because he thinks it's beneath him.
So far as I'm aware, Muzan didn't transform Koku until after he'd met Yoriichi.  Muzan specifically sought him out because of his relation to Yoriichi.
Im not saying kokushibo warned muzan, im saying that muzan knew kokushibo wanted to become a demon because he wanted to surpass his brother, and muzan also knew kokushibo is strong so naturally muzan knew yoriichi is stronger by a fair margin considering kokushibo needed that much of his blood just to try equaling him
Probably the more extensive version is that Tanjiro and Nezuko mother cooked for them using blue spider Lily for most of their life so they somewhat developed an immunity to demons cells/blood
There’s a theory that because she didn’t eat humans, the demonic transformation didn’t bind her to Muzan. Note that there was no intention to turn him into a demon when the doctor was treating him but once he started consuming humans that’s when his condition became diabolical
I always thought that Muzan's monologue meant that not a human should be able to withstand the mutation to become human. But then again, this was never mentioned or showed again after that episode. A limit from the author, I guess.
>Considering he already has the uppermoons, I don't think he'd care so much about a demon slightly stronger than daki. 

I mean it's not like you stay the same strength forever though. Doma used be Upper 6 yet grew to become Upper 2. And most demons don't even start off Daki level to begin with. I mean just look at Gyutaro and Daki themselves. When they became demons, they weren't even close to Slayer levels, let alone Tanjiro. Yet still they became Upper Moons so Tanjiro becoming a demon at Daki level is pretty huge. 

>And since tamayo has already proven that demons can escape his curse, he'd likely just kill him (probably absorb him) and move on.

By that logic, Muzan would never turn anyone into a demon again after Tamayo. Yet he still did for many many years. So that's a non factor.
I mean a demon who knows breathing styles is highly valuable. You’d have a kokushibo 2.0 in your ranks.
It’s not about how strong he is but his ability to conquer the sun
At that point, Nezuko hadn’t conquered the sun. He only changes from ‘I need to make more demons so I can find the Blue Spider Lily’ to ‘I don’t need to make anymore demons, I just need to absorb that girl’ after Nezuko stands in sunlight
Because he's strong, and therefore useful, after a year or so, Tanjiro would easily surpass Gyutaro and Gyokko, meaning he'd be Upper 5, and also meaning he'd be stronger, and therefore more useful than those 2
It’s Muzan only makes demons with the hopes that one will be able to conquer the sun so he could eat them and gain the ability. One extra demon is one more chance to do that.

I think he says that didn’t even want to make demons at all.

Also explains why he attacked Swordsmith village: more demons equals more chances for one to gain the bda to withstand the sun.
He also knows that Tanjiro is a sun breather remember, Since the breath has defeated several of his demons, and while it failed to defeat Rui, Muzan upon looking through his last memories would see Tanjiro unlock Sun Breathing.
Spoilers: >!it’s revealed that despite being the strongest demon Muzan is actually a massive coward who won’t fight unless he’s sure he can win after Yorichii almost killed him and afterwards hid in the Infinity castle until Yorichii died of old age. It’s somewhat implied that he waited until after Tanjiro’s father passed away before finally attacking the Kamado family as his father was extremely strong despite being sickly. Hence when he sees Tanjiro wearing the same ear rings and with a mark on his forehead we see him straight up have a panic attack in private before summoning assassins. And in the season finale his first move is to get Tanjiro as far from him as possible.!<
Koku was actually transformed before he met Yoriichi, it was only when Muzan escaped that he was told that his brother became a demon by slayers rushing to him.  
Muzan himself says that "I'm no longer interested in swordsmen who use breathing" at the beginning of their fight.  
Implying that by that point he had already turned Kokushibo.  
So yeah, he completely didn't know about Yoriichi. And knowing how spiteful and egotistical Kokushibo is in regards to him. I doubt he'd tell him as he'd feel that he was superior to him by that point
?? Muzan offers Koku to become demon because he would d!e before he turn 25 cuz Koku already have his mark, Muzan says things about dying and if Koku wants to keep his sword techniques then become a demon like him, when muzan first met Yorii he thought that Yorii was weak too and can’t sense any hatred that’s why he not prepared for the attack
i mean we can all make up theories but this is just us making excuses for plot armor at this point....
I perceived it as him just flexing how much better he is than humans and how he’s the “perfect being” since he got triggered by the drunk guy saying he looked like he was dying. He clearly doesn’t need to give much blood to make anyone a demon, just scratching that random dude made him a demon. So by pumping in loads of blood that is something the human body definitely can’t handle.
Yes, he could grow, but I don't think he'd care all that much.

The reason he kept creating demons, is probably because A. The chance for them to escape his grasp is extremely low. And B. If they did break free they wouldn't be able to defeat him. Tanjiro knows sun breathing (to some extent) and considering his last encounter with someone who knows sunbreathing, the  chance being low doesn't matter to him because it's still there. Muzan is extremely careful, so if Tanjiro was turned into a demon he'd likely just absorb him and move on.
And it’s sun breathing, not just moon breathing. Imagine sun breathing with a BDA
Right after gaining Kokushibo, he said that he was no longer interested in breathing styles. If he truly wanted more demons that could use breathing styles, it's likely he'd just make hashira with subpar morals into demons.
He already had an optimal number of demons at this point. He wasn't really back into production mode until the later arcs.
Putting aside the fact that Tanjiro's morality would make him a dogshit demon, Muzan doesn't like change and he likes Tanjiro even less.
Muzan doesn't know that sun breathers are immune to sunlight as demons.
Muzan literally engaged Tanjiro in a 1v1 for a good while instead of running so this logic doesn't work.
Muzan def also knew abt kokushibo wanting to surpass yoriichi since thats all he talks abt bru, and muzan literally said "i dont need another demon that can use breathing styles" meaning he knew yoriichi used them and he looks like kokushibo too
Tanjiro is not a nobody at this point of the story so converting him to a demon would be a blow to the corps morale as well. It's not just a numbers game.

Nope, he's still looking for the flower and still trying to conquer the sun, he's absolutely still making more demons. He's culling the weak ones that know too much, but taking away the hunter with sun breathing would be a huge win
Which is why he'd absorb him so he could become immune to the sun.
Never said he did, but they aren’t. That’s a separate thing, otherwise Nezuko wouldn’t have been immune because she isn’t a Sun Breather.
They arent
Hence why I said thinks he can win, after observing Tanjiro a little more he realizes that he isn’t Yorichii 2.0 and thus thinks that he can take him
I re-read your other comments, fair enough, when you talked about Koku want to be stronger than Yorii while Muzan found Yorii as weak, the meaning of strong for Koku and Muzan at that moment might be different cuz Muzan finds all human weak 🤷‍♀️
Muzan doesn't care about whether the morale of the corps is low or not, he wants them all dead regardless.
I didn't say he wasn't looking for the flower anymore, but Kokushibo has already been killing sun users for years.
So he thought Sasamaru and Yahaba were enough to kill Yorrichi is what you're implying?
UC writers be like “war bad” then show you some shit that makes you want to triple the military budget

The eternal dichotomy of Gundam.
What they say: "This is bad, stop having fun."

"War crimes are bad!"

The Kshatriya is such a cool suit.  I usually don't like the overly bulky space maneuver units, but this one really hits different for some reason.
WHY DID YOU CUT THE VIDEO SHORT OP! I COULDN'T FINISH
Show: war is bad

Bandai: check out these sick war machines
The pilot of the Jegan is a true ace. They were getting every ounce of that machine.

This is one of many reasons I love Unicorn. The animation itself is a character. It finally reached a point where they could show these battles at true speed with the depth they deserve.

And don't get me wrong here. I tend really gravitate towards the hand drawn series more but Unicorn is just a different beast.
Does anyone else find it interesting in the mechanics of button sequence and using the touch screen in battle very visually appealing in this scene
War is bad

But let this teenage boy have a weapon of mass destruction which will be upgraded/refitted to be even more destructive power
Fight war with more war
War is bad, but now I want a model kit of these guys
Unicorn gave these grunt suits the allstar treatment.
You can think a gun/tank/gundam/any other war machine looks cool while still understanding war is a bad, cruel, and wasteful thing.

WAR IS BAD, BUT GIANT ROBOTS ARE RAD.
Mobile Suit Gundam does not condone the cool crime of War.
after watching the end of gundam Z tv: oh shit poor guy..  
after watching the movie: WTF why they remove the ending? its not canon!
Anti-War movies always had a bit of hypocrisy and no one can convince me otherwise. Although, they’re probably self aware of this fact.

In All Quiet on the Western Front, while we see the suffering of the main characters, they also show one of the best action packed sequences including tanks.

Gundam is probably the best example, the 79 show has this Band of Brothers vibe where you lesrn to appreciate slowly the characters over time until they die…but at the same time there’s Amuro gunning down dozens of suits like an 80’s action hero.
Looking at this scene, I realised that the beam sabers have insane repeal force. The Jegan and Kshatriya were flying at each other at full speed and stopped by the beam saber clash.
There’s a reason that a famous meme came from the contrast, lol!
these are not mutually exclusive in any way
Yeah but thats cause giant robots are universally cool
That Jegan pilot had balls of steel!
We all know if the military started something with a name like “the MS-G project” that requires the help of the greatest robotics companies in the world we would all sign up just so we can pilot a mobile suit
I love how god tier the cannon fodder fights are in Unicorn,

That Stark Jegan pilot knew he was out of his depth, since odds are they were probably equipped to deal with the Garencieres with all that firepower but once they were up against Marida and the Kshatriya dude started emptying his arsenal to discard all that weight and take em on in close-combat
Amuro: You all need to stop committing senseless violence and using resources for war!

Also Amuro: **Give me a Death Star uzi and ten thousand remote-control nuke blaster drones for wings**

![gif](giphy|JPcmNWh80RM7f74dOn)

**It’s not a warcrimes-list, it’s a war-checklist.**
I mean, it's a visual storytelling medium, it's kind of got to be visually compelling, right?
Fine.... I'll go watch Unicorn again.
This is a problem with not just war movies/shows but most media that tries to say anything about a particular subject. Satire is a real good example of this as you could have an anti nazi musical and Nazi's would co-opt the song in a un ironic fashion. Some people won't get the message and some people choose not to get the message.
Best animated and choreographed fight in all of Gundam and I absolutely die on that hill.
The title is so funny because war is bad but god damnnn do I love those war machines 🫡
I too want to pilot a gundam.
(Muses in Heavyarms gatling gun)
Unknown Jegan Pilot RIP we love you man
that's because the message priorities of those writers are:

1. buy our stuff

2. war bad
Hmm.... my NCD got mixed in with my Gundam today.
Yes, "war bad", but just look at all the action we've prepped for you at Torrington base 🤤
Bruh, this Stark Jegan Pilot is better than half the main characters of UC Gundam. He was just never blessed with a Gundam.
This is one of my main criticisms of Gundam. For a show that *says* that it wants to try and overcome war, there can never really be a resolution to it. The franchise makes its money off big shooty robots, and so big shooty robots will always be center stage.

Like, look at WfM. The whole point of GUND-ARM was to try and take gund tech and use it to *help* humanity by focusing on prosthesis and stuff. What do we actually see most of the time, though? We see the work being done on Ariel, the big shooty robot. And the school is hypothetically supposed to be... a school. A place for students to safely learn and get exposure to the fundamentals of business, engineering, design, and so on that would be critical to them eventually going on to play leadership roles in the Benerit corporations. Instead, the school becomes mostly a place to train pilots and has an entire dueling system that gives the show an excuse to constantly show off big shooty robot fights.

Like, for a series that claims to want to find a way to coexist without war, they always seem to find a way to make the solution to a problem to blow it up with a giant robot.

Mind you, I think 00 is the only series that really took this flaw to its natural conclusion and actually twisted it into a positive, because in 00 the point was to embrace that contradiction. CB said "we need to stop war, and we will use force to do it." *...and then they stuck with that to the end.* We didn't get some magical reformist bullet to solve the conflict, CB continued to fight to the end of the series, and they *won.* They recognized that their war for peace might still continue in the future, but they achieved a better, more unified humanity at gunpoint. It is, by far, the most radical message of any gundam series: That peace cannot be achieved by relying on the political systems that feed off war to simply choose to end them. Those systems must be opposed by force. And in that regard, shooty robots are great!
r/NCD
Wait which series is this from?
The common problem of every Torment Nexus is that it looks cool
Gundam, and war movies in general always have the problem of having to make make a cool action piece while at the same time trying ot tell the viewers that this is terrible.   
In Gundam 0080 is probably the best at avoiding this pitfallm, mostly by not being a classical action series and also by having the protagonist start out with the "wow, cool robot" mindset before being confronted by the reality of war
I often think about that one post in this sub where a US marine gets sworn in in front of the moving Gundam in Yokohama. Cool but sorely missing the point.
With how much money the US military gets, they could already do this 1000 times

Instead, we're stuck with some boring tanks and jets
> "There is no such thing as an anti-war film."

It's a problem inherent to visual storytelling. On the one hand, war is a hellish thing that destroys lives and saps people's humanity. On the other hand, please watch this rad explosion from the complete safety of your own home.
Was kshatriya repurposed from quin mantha?
This makes me want to go on a rampage 

Genocide
That stark jegan pilot was a pro!
War might suck but you’ll look sexy doing it !
Facts. War is mid as fuck but if I can pilot a HeavyArms I will gladly do a war crime or two….
Wtf that Pilot is probably the only grunt I’ve seen that truly deserves the title of “Ace”. Wtf was that
I think it’s just an acceptance of human nature. The ideal is war bad/never. But reality forces them back. Well that’s probably how the writers justify it 😂
War is bad, buy our toys.
I’ve always interpreted it as often good and evil exists on both sides, so does honor and villainy. Perhaps in different measures at different times.

War is often a long, boring, dread punctuated journey interspersed by brief moments of extreme emotional intensity and incredible experiences, often violent. Often with incredibly mixed feelings, joy and despair, emptiness after victory, and hope after defeat.

Strangely, Gundam captures all this well, better than most.
i think war in the pocket may be the only effective piece of anti war gundam material. Can you guys think of any other one that made you think "war might be bad guys"?
Girl: War is bad. Stop killing people.

Setsuna: I AM GUNDAMN
This scene will always fuck hard man one of the reasons why I feel in love with the Jegan
itts watchign scenes like these that make me wonder what the beams of beam sabers are made of to where it can stop dead two giant mobile suites weighing multiple tons dead in their tracks
/u/savevideo
Facts bro
Wow! Cool Robot!
One of the single best battle scenes in the entire universal century timeline, if not the best.  The Kshatriya is also my favorite mobile suit.  Another great one is when she punches the Unicorn with it and Banagher throws up in his helmet from the impact.
The claim that Gundam is *only* anti-war is kind of reductive, really.

If you look at even the original Gundam series, the writers make it clear that Amuro and the WB crew have to fight. For them, war is a necessary evil, because the alternative is worse. When he runs away from the war, everything goes to shit.

And it's not even depicted as an unalloyed evil. For one thing, Tomino has gone on record to say the "Bright slap" was, in some ways, necessary for Amuro. The line "Not even my father hit me" is telling - if you look at it through the lens of 1970s Japanese values, the writers are suggesting that being part of the war gave Amuro the discipline that his father failed to. For another, there's the ending of *MSG* and the whole "found family" dynamic. It's no coincidence that their main character is a boy whom the show heavily implies, if not for the war, would have ended up as a cold, antisocial robot nerd with an empathy deficit... much like his father.

There are some Gundam shows like *0080* which push the anti-war angle to the limit and do it well. That's fantastic. But the more nuanced ones like *MSG* itself, I think, are worth closer examination because they remain anti-war whilst also acknowledging that reality is rarely as simple as "A good, B bad."
In fairness, monster hunter writers make killing of animals bad...but I still want to go out and get a HBG
"War is bad."

Me when I hear "Mobile Suit" by Sawano*

Moment of silence for the random stark jegan pilot.
Honesty though, if that Stark Jegan pilot had an ace suit he woulda given the Khsatriya a run for its money, dude was dodging beam bits and went toe to toe with it in an anti-ship loadout for a good solid few moments there

Jegan: “BRING IT ON!!!”
war is bad this, muh media literacy that. this shit is cool. war IS cool. anyone who says otherwise is is just someone trying to appear high brow

Why I became one

Don't forget the software and computerscience people to make cool ui :(
Me every other month: " Okay but if I joined the airforce and was able to become a pilot I might be considered for the gundam program WHEN (not if) it comes to be.
Can't spell Funnels without "Fun"
I think it helps a lot that it moves appropriately. It's got big engines in those four wings but it's very clear that it's not agile as a result, just makes up for it by having the funnels.

I don't think it was necessarily used very well after this intro and I'm not the biggest fan of the actual unicorn/banshee suits that ultimately get the most attention in unicorn, but the khsatriya is at that nice spot where it's clearly incredibly powerful but not inconceivable to be damaged or defeated even by grunts.
I too like the kshatriya, especially the repaired version
My favourite angry bell pepper.
I love that it clearly out powers the Jegan here, it's controlling the maneuvering during the close combat, where the Jegan is forced to follow along with the spin.
They couldn't take the pain of watching our hero and saviour Stark Jegan Pilot tragically cut down too soon 😭
well...that's media
Yes you can really see he's a veteran that fought newtypes before, immediately switches to melee when the funnels come out.
Some may say a beast of possibility even.
One thing i love in this sequence too is you notice that jegan pilot uses the spin they do to get the sun behind him and blind the other pilot to go for the killing blow, he just didnt anticipate that psycho frame.
Also shoutout to that other Jegan pilot who was about to stab Banshee in the face

POV you tried to start a war
Literally what you have to do
Execs at Sunrise: "We hooked another one!" while wringing their hands... MENACINGLY!
Achieve world peace by making people focus on building model kits over waging war.
Chicks dig giant robots.
Yeah the ending of a new translation (Zeta film remakes) is absolutely..... i dont even know. The OG ending to Zeta is bleak but SO good and fitting.
Maybe to have it blend better with ZZ which had such a stark tonal shift from Zeta?
Tomino made Zeta while in a horrible depression. He is pretty much over it, and decided on a happier ending for the films.
the hypocrisy is, they have to justify it getting made. imagine the view count of 0079 if amuro managed to get the gundam to stand before getting ravaged like your little brother after asking you to play cod. 

imagine if all is quiet on the western front was 3 hours of dudes suffering, staffing a machine gun nest, dumping out water, helping the new guy get aquatinted, seek shelter, defend a charge, etc… oh and by a hour in nobody we started with is alive. studio executives would have a heart attack at the script alone
Come and See is the best anti-war movie 
The military has it's fingers deep inside Hollywood.
All Quiet on the Western Front was absolutely garbage, both the movie and the novel. What is the point of making an anti-war story from the perspective of the solder of the losing side? Of course war is hell when it's your men who died in vain and your country being bombed to bits. Same for Vietnam war, America lost, their ally got toppled by the communists, all of that death for nothing. Of course, the US soldiers would feel bitter about it, especially if you lose a leg or two in Nam.

Try making an anti-war story from the perspective of the winners. If you can make a good story about how bad war is from the view of an US soldier (for WWII setting) for example. Try making a convincing anti-war story saying that Uncle Sam shouldnt go to war against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan and we shall see how popular that story gonna be.
Those I-fields don't fuck around.
I’m trapped between this and the unadulterated awesomeness of the Byarlant Custom—that pilot single-handedly justified every dollar spent on the Federation Forces’ pilot training budget.

If only more ex-Titans pilots could be so awesome. 🫡
One of the 🐐 Gundam scenes
 That isn't the theme for Gundam, it's about the cycle of violence that fuels wars, even with a change in whose fighting.

 It warns that a failure to keep authorities in check creates opportunities to cause conflicts that they can profit from, while everything else burns.

 00 isn't positive, it suffers from the same corruption and cycle of violence - you can't achieve peace through force, it simply creates a lull to prepare for the next war.

 You only have true peace when violence isn't in the picture, which is rather difficult to achieve in practice.

It's next in the development line but it's not the same machine;


the Quin Mantha was actually recovered, repaired, and later piloted by Annerose Rosenheim (a veteran of Zeon's Marchosias Corps.)
What exactly makes you say this? All I could actually find on the guy that would indicate this is a single New York Times book review that referred to him as the Tom Clancy of Japan...
😬
My goat Anakin "did nothing wrong" Skywalker was mentioned?
Batter to death them!
mine was Macross.....same same but different.
no they need to program all the flyby write shit it would take to move the thing
Also: "War crimes rhyme with Fun times!"
YES  i love in the first fight scene with the "high speed jegan... possibly a special forces unit". 

They animate the Kyshatria so well. You can feel it's weight in it's maneuvering.
The animators really showed the work here. We can see thruster flares, the way the suit seems to have inertia and the simple fact that none of the mobile suits look like Speedy Gonzales on caffeine. It gives that verisimilitude of physics and reality that makes all the difference.
  
And though my Heart simps for Marida, my Soul stands with Stark Jegan guy. o7
Also notice the smoothness of the Kshatriya's maneuvering compared to the Stark Jegan when they both turn around to face each other again after their first clash. 




It drives me insane that people genuinely think the guy almost beat her when SJ was fightin' for his life while Marida didn't even break a sweat.
🫡🫡🫡
Cut down too soon? 




Bro only lasted as long as he did because Marida was *bored.*




------




Downvoting me won't change the fact that Marida chose to draw her beam saber and charge back at him for a proper duel instead of simply shooting SJ down before he even got close with any of the Kshatriya's *twelve* mega particle cannons 💅
That's one of the things I liked about Unicorn. The Federation had aces. Not some loudmouthed braggat voiced charachter there to conflict with the protagonist, bvut just guys who happened to be present in a battle doing their jobs. You go through that many Federation forces and you're going to inevitably run into someone who's been around since the OYW and isn't some chosen one in a Gundam, but knows how to use a mobile suit.
Marida sees all his anti-funnel weaponry, and keeps half her funnels inside until he's done shooting those canister weapons.
It wasn't the psycho frame, Marida stopped his last charge with the sheer power of the Kshatriya's thrusters. 
So I’m a Sri Lankan. It was wild as hell to see my tiny little islands civil war get featured front and center episode one of this and the MC is just slaughtering everyone involved 😭
its a joke im making. people were shocked how dark the ending for kamille is in the tv but when the show came out they want that dark ending to happen to him again.
the point of my comment is mirror to the point of OP. people are shocked with the ending but when removed they want it back.
The old black and white version from 1930 is much closer to what you are describing than the recent German remake. Mainly because it was made by people who lived through wwi and had no intentions of glorifying it.
*The Road* exists, and it's like 2 hours of misery porn.
This is a hell of a hot take
Honestly the Zaku I sniper was the more impressive one it that battle in my opinion, especially since it was the oldest suit and had to be brought down by 3 Jestas.
Both scenes are equally impressive. Fuck man episodes like 4-7 are so fucking good. So many awesomely animated battle sequences. 

I also LOVE the first time we see Full Frontal and his Sinanju blitzing the General Revill. Absolutely killer

And the battle sequence of the grunt suits on the deck on episode 7, i think?
the ending of the 00 movie is actually one of the few gundam shows that implies that fighting has either been massively curbed or has stopped altogether, as innovators have emerged en masse and they have managed to achieve understanding with each other and with the ELS. of course, they decided to release some later material that says there were old humans who resented the innovators, and took arms against them. i don't remember if it's implied to take place before or during/after the 00 movie finale, though.

while some gundam series, the earliest ones especially, are good at showing the horrific effects of war on the human population, i don't think it was ever really good at highlighting what could be done to end war. as much as i love turn A, it gave immense impulse to the 'war forever' vibe that the UC seems knee-deep in now. i would have preferred if they went no further than CCA and left the outcome ambiguous, but they still had a jumping off point in the late UC era too. even G, which is my favorite gundam show of all time, kind of just throws its hands up at the end and says 'eh, war will probably happen again, who knows'.

it's a very cynical view (and one i don't think is the only outcome for humanity), and seeing some AUs like 00 actually make headway into exploring the question of 'how do we stop this for good', even if some elements of how it goes about it are a bit too fantastical for my taste, felt refreshing to me even a decade ago, arguably moreso now. but forever war also has a secondary purpose for namco bandai, and that's forever money, given how gundam is now a cultural titan of japan and a huge cash cow that makes even something like dragon ball blush nowadays.

The best counter-attack to a funnel deployment is to engage at close range, where the funnels risk hitting the operating suit.
Bylrant Custome guy comes to mind
Unicorn nailed the grand scope of battles and showed off the "rank and file" better than any other Gundam work, especially the Battle of Torrington.  We get to see enough of the non main character suits to understand why and how the battle is going the way it is.

Torrington was an absolute masterpiece.  We start with the surprise attack by the Zeon Remnants where we see battle hardened Zeon forces overwhelm what appear to be pilots with little battle experience and outdated equipment.  Everything then gets turned around when the Byarlant Custom deploys, a high-performance suit, upgraded and modernized, piloted by a former Titan ace with serious combat experience.  He immediately takes out the Zee Zulus which are the only suits that have a chance against the Byarlant Custom aside from the Shamblo, at which point everything starts to turn, followed by the arrival of the Jesta team and the Unicorn.
i have to give it a watch eventually. but something like that would never get a greenlight today.

Man, Fuck Harmony Gold, all my homies hate Harmony Gold.
Friendly reminder these are the only 2 people in history to create a breathing style from scratch
Yoriichi and Inosuke are the only ones who created their own breathing styles without basing themselves on an other existing one. Beast breathing is officially derives from wind breathing because it's the closest one to it's style, but inosuke didn't inspire from it when creating beast breathing. Kinda fun to think about.

I was recently thinking about how crazy it was Inosuke basically rediscovered total concentration breathing on his own.

Like, in an alternate universe where Yoriichi never existed, the progenitor of all breathing styles might very well have been Lord Inosuke!
Creating a breathing style from scratch is one of the reasons why Inosuke is simply the best kamaboko

THIS IS PURE FACTS

ONLY DEMON SLAYERS IN THE WHOLE DEMON SLAYER UNIVERSE OTHER THAN YORIICHI TO CREATE A BREATHING STYLE! 

  
AHAHAHHAHAHAH NOW SHOW SOME RESPECT !!! THE KING OF MOUNTAINS IS THE MAIN MAN ! INOSUKE INOSUKE INOSUKE

LORD INOSUKE!!!!!

People tend to downgrade Inosuke's IQ a lot but he is actually one of the smartest characters in kny
![gif](giphy|So4Yp61bm4pO1wYo1W)
I could’ve sworn Tengen created sound breathing himself too
Forgot about Murata and Galaxy Breathing. 

But it's ok, Murata-sama casts such a big shadow that people don't realize that they have been standing in that shadow their entire lives.
Fr 🌸
I am an Inosuke stan first, and a person second 
That's why he's the goat the goat. He does all things based on instincts and that too way fast. He saw how tanjiro pushed the boulder and did it just by seeing once. If he knew how to do it he could've done it way before but he sensed how tanjiro did it and did it instinctively. He is king of mountains for a reason. Lord inosuke coming through ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)
And that’s why Inosuke is best boi. 🦋
In the argument where it wasn't inspired by another breath this is pure absolute facts
Michikatsu was trying to use Sun Breathing but couldn't do it exactly, so the derivative that was the result was Moon Breathing. So technically, he accidentally made his own style too.
https://preview.redd.it/iqlw0ao4gred1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80d4f12ceea609cf18381e1d89baebe127852dab

\*Three people
Inosuke is literally one of the best slayers in the whole saga. He might not be that strong but he sure is one of the greatest.
Chads :3
The way Inosuke even found out about the demon slayer corps was because a member was sent the the mountain the Inosuke lived on to hunt a demon, (which was probably Inosuke tbh), and Inosuke beat his ass. He watched the guy do what was likely wind breathing, because that's what beast is derived from, and made his own based on the techniques he saw.

And Yoriichi was BORN doing sun breathing, so does it really count as creating it?
This is why people should not sleep on Inosuke. Yes he is rude, yes he lacks academic knowledge, yes his personal hygiene is poor and yes he is excessively loud but he is a prodigy demon slayer.
what about insect breathing
I fell in love woth Inoske after his hand to hand fight with Tanjiro, deserves a rewatch, he was going the fuck in
Michikatsu would like to have a word with you for leaving him out of this list.
Thats why he is

https://preview.redd.it/nd0sql1ynved1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4d7178e36cbf626b8073b827c752d2aa03e5954
Didn’t kokushibo create moonbreathing
The only one in the kamaboko squad who was not trained by a current or former hashira and can more than keep up with the rest of them. True goat (boar?)
Isn't Beast Breathing derived from Wind Breathing, just like Mist Breathing? Sound Breathing is derived from Thunder Breathing, Love Breathing from Flame Breathing, and Serpent Breathing, Flower Breathing, and Insect Breathing are all derived from Water Breathing. By that logic Muichiro, Tengen, Mitsuri, Obanai, Shinobu, and Kanae all created their own Breathing forms.


Let's also not forget about Kokushibo and his Moon Breathing.
Inosuke stole his first sword from a demon slayer that he bested. It’s possible that person was a user of wind breathing or at least knew some basics of total concentration
Mitsuri????? She LITERALLY invented love breathing????

Muichiro invented mist????
I was under the impression beast breathing is somewhat based on wind breathing?
Closest one to them is like Michikatsu right
Doesn't inosukes breathing style branch off of wind? I remember seeing charts always saying beast branches off of wind
and only one of the two succesfully prevented another demon king from existing
Kokoshibo did as well.  He created Moon Breathing to be a direct competitor to Sun Breathing if I'm not mistaken.  Or something along those lines.  It is the only Breathing technique other than Beast that isn't a derivative of Sun Breathing.
Technically wouldn't Tanjiro count too? Or does he use Sun Breathing? What I mean by that, is that before he used Hinokami Kagura, the only reference that he based the Breathing on, is his father dancing the Hinokami Kagura, which wasn't a Breathing Style but a way of dance, to get the blood flowing. So in a way, he created the style out of a dance. I don't recall exactly how Sun Breathing was created, if it was explained, but that couldn't that have a reference? And Inosukes Breathing can be similar, the breath of Instinct, to live, to defeat, to hunt, his reference was life. I know I'm half talking out of my ass, forgive my doing so, but I don't exactly get what would set Hinokami Kagura aside from Beast Breathing and Sun Breathing.
It's stated in data in the end of the manga that beast breathing was an offshoot of wind breathing. Like... No, he wasn't specifically trained in wind breathing, don't get me wrong. But the point is, it had a basis whether Inoske knew it or not.
EVERYONE FORGOT ABOUT KOCHO- WAIT DONT LEAVE EVERYONE KOCHO CREATED ONE TOOOOOO😭

![gif](giphy|Yq1tXTNe5PDdQEhKXG|downsized)
Thought INoske breathing style is based on wind breathing
He can also move his own organs.

No wonder he forget names. Why would the clear protagonist remember the NPCs?
101% facts ❤️🐷🔥😤🙏

That's because Inoskue was trained by animals. It's like how Toph became the strongest non Avatar earth bender by being trained by badger moles.
…Let him cook.
>Like, in an alternate universe where Yoriichi never existed

I think in this alternate reality, Suzanne may have succeeded in wiping out at least Japan long before Inosuke ever came around 

Edit: *Muzan. It kept autocorrecting to Suzanne
Until it is confirmed otherwise, and given how f\*cking stupid he is on screen, despite the baseless credit his fans try to give to his intelligence, it is INFINITELY far more reasonable to assume he copied parts of the breathing style of the slayer he stole his first sword from than to give any credit to his lonely braincell.
COMING THROUGH

BEHOLD!!THE KING OF THE MOUNTAIN!!!!!
Are you sure you're not Inosuke himself...?
Inosuke ghost wrote this
Read this in Inosuke’s dub voice 😭
he feigned fatal injuries like twice already I think which resulted in victories instead of sure death
regular iq and battle iq are separate categories tbf
His intelligence > his wisdom
He is street(forest?) smart, not booksmart
my man has 6th sense, can literally move position of his organ, is highly competitive, learns fast, improves faster, great strategist. What more do you need?
He is kinda like Goku since he’s naive and slow on anything outside of fighting. When it comes to fighting though I think they have the highest IQ to survive, adapt and overcome any challenges even in comparison to characters from their own universes
Sound was inspired by Thunder Breathing but was adapted to fit Tengen's own unique skills, same with Love Breathing being made by Mitsuri who based it off of Flame Breathing
sound is a form derived of thunder
It is well known that Galaxy Breathing is a secret that Murata only unleashes offscreen, to weaken the demon enough so the cast can have a shot.

Fun fact, Galaxy Breathing transcends time and space, it was actually Murata cutting Muzan, not Yoriichi.

And the drug was just propaganda to confuse Muzan, it was actually Murata hitting him with the 10th form creating micro black holes that aged Muzan rapidly.

He is **HIM**
I think what they’re saying is that Inosuke never got inspired from another breathing style, just purely made up by him. While Michikatsu tried to use Sun breathing and created moon breathing based off sun breathing (I could be wrong though)
All the other breathing styles (besides Beast) are variations of the original Sun bc no one could do it properly, they are imitations adapted to what best fit the new users.           

 Moon is the closest but still lacking and an (inferior) imitation all the same
Idk but he looks goofy in this one for some reason.
It wasn't ever implied obanai created serpent breathing without inspiring from water breathing.
Beast breathing has absolutely no similarities to Wind breathing, I know the official guide says it's a derivative but I see no evidence to support it.
you mean there are other 'vanilla' slayers who can do breathing techniques? how come we didnt see anything. even murata didnt show anything
Derived from flower breathing, Kanae's breathing style which Shinobu took inspiration from
Derived from sun breathing
Yup it does, but it probably wasn't intentional. Inosuke discovered tcb and created beast breathing on his own in a random mountain, whereas other derivatives always directly base themselves on other breathing styles. More of a coincidence than anything.
Mitsuri based herself on fire breathing, Rengoku's style. Muichiro wasn't ever implied to have created mist.
Yup it does, but it probably wasn't intentional. Inosuke discovered tcb and created beast breathing on his own in a random mountain, whereas other derivatives always directly base themselves on other breathing styles. More of a coincidence than anything.
Yup he didn't know it, but it still means he created it without any inspiration. It came to him instinctively. And he's the second person in history to do that
Shinobu based herself on flower breathing to create insect breathing, her sister's breathing style.
It's a natural derivative of it but he didn't base it off it since he had never heard of wind breathing before he made his own
This comment made me realize that Toph and Inosuke would probably get on like a house on fire
Correct me if Im wrong, but aren't elemental bending in itself actually learned from ordinary animals manipulating the elements in their own way? 
Like for example, water bending is learned from fish swimming and so on. 

I hear that it was retconned that elemental bending is given by Turtle Lions instead.
That isn’t why Toph is incredibly strong. At the very least, it’s not a main reason why. 

There were hundreds or possibly thousands of benders that learned from animals. Most were forgotten to history and not notable beyond having been an elemental bender. 

Toph is genuinely talented and I’d sooner point to her upbringing, force of will and dedication that lead to her becoming so strong.
bro has actual beef with a fictional swordsman
Was this the only reason you even came on this post? ​To absolutely sh\*t on one of the most well developed characters in the series..? Rather childish if I do say so myself.
HAHA 😤😤😤😤😤
... it's written
I just realised so did I! 😆
Who's talking about battle IQ? We're talking about the guy who learned how to speak pretty much perfectly (and understand what he said) while being a baby just from hearing a random old man and his care taker talk
Yeah Mitsuri was literally trained by Rengoku lol
Beast breathing came from win breathing. Plus Tengen was a former shinobi so he wouldn’t go got any training as he already was trained. Practically the same as Inosuke. Tengen practically made Sound breathing all on his own.
and Inosuke's beast breathing is derived from Wind breathing.
tengen literally used the sound of thunder and went.

yea lets turn that into a a BREATHIGN STYLE why not
Fair enough.
All breathing are variations kf sun breathing.

The concept of breathing came from inosuke.

Inosuke learnt this from his breath training in the forest with a master
It has quite a few similarities. The effects they produce look very similar but that's that's weakest link. Both styles are focused on aggressive non-stop attack with minimal defensive techniques the real difference is that wind attacks from up high while beast has more rising strikes from down low
Bro is literally mentioning the source for my point and just going "nuh uh"

Both have similar effects, both are based on aggressiveness, and they're both from the two most badass people in the show.
According to Wiki Murata uses water brearhing, it would be safe to assume that all slayers(except Genya) can at least use TCB
Okay
True enough.
No.

https://preview.redd.it/jmn4ucjrgted1.jpeg?width=959&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=518a6c31a3cbc48a77f691adbe29834074e7cc3e

She invented love breathing during the lower moon 2 fight.

She learnt fire breathing but couldnt perform it all.
Ahh thank you 🫸🫷
No, it just derives from it, it doesnt have a single move even similar to flower breathing, shes also the only one to use it because she isnt strong enough for any other. Youre talking about it being based off it because it is derived from it, this is not true. Inosuke's is derived from wind despite the two almost barely meeting- and him also having it before ever meeting Shinazugawa.
Until it is confirmed that the slayer he stole his first sword from was a wind breather.

Then, from his record of being amazingly stupid, it will be far more reasonable to believe he derived beast breathing from what he observed, consciously or unconsciously.
They even have the same superpower of seeing things true the earth
Turtle Lions gave people the ability to bend, but they learned the various styles of bending by imitating animals.
I think water Bending was mostly developed from watching the moon and its effects on the tide.

Most water Bending stems from the push and pull motion the tide follows, and flows put from there I think.

It's definitely possible for there to be a few sea creatures also learned from, but I doubt it'd be basic fish given that Earth Benders have huge badger moles, Firebenders have dragons, and Air Nomads have the Bison, though for the Air Benders, I think they developed Air Bending mostly before fully integrating their society woth Air Bison, given that the Bison became their single most prominent attachment to the physical world, rendering many nomads without the ability of flight, which comes from having no attachments to the world.
I have beef with the concept of liking his character more than the fictional swordsman himself
Probably best not to engage with this knobbly fucking troll lmao
"Childish" ? Nah at least try to lie believably. Try again. Find a more fitting word. I'm giving you another chance.

Also, how beloved he is should not be relevant. How old are you to bring that into this? He is consistently stupid on screen, just like Tengen and Sanemi are detestable, no matter how many people like them. How is this relevant?!?

Inosuke has to have uncounsciously or consciously copied parts of wind breathing from the first slayer he met off-screen. It just makes too much more sense than being a complete moron 99% of the time and then the story magically making him a genius with that
isn’t that just how babies learn to talk normally though?
Beast breathing is different in a way as both Uzui and Mitsuri were formally trained as Demon Slayers before hand and had learned Thunder and Flame breathing respectively, modifying the styles into Sound and Love to fit their respective unique skills. Inosuke on the other hand had 0 training or knowledge of any breathing forms and developed it on his own after fighting a demon slayer and stealing his swords. Since Inosuke had no training the only connection that can be made to wind breathing is the possibility that the slayer he fought used it, outside of that he made it completely on his own
It wasn’t though, wind breathing is just the style that it’s closest too. Beast Breathing was completely created by Inosuke without any outside inspiration.
Yes but Inosuke did not know Wind breathing. That's what makes it special!
Don't be shocked by "sound breathing" when "love breathing" exists.
Good point. Forgot that the base breathing is TCB at minimum
https://preview.redd.it/eswiu3xlited1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6550b85ff04b1bfd6a4ca893a4d02f004e8030a8

She did create it on her own, but basing herself on flame breathing which she already knew.
He's only stupid outside of battle. In combat he's extremely skilled don't downplay him lol
Through* Also, it's not the same. Toph feels the vibrations in the earth to get around and sense things like badger moles in Avatar, while Inosuke uses his heightened sense of touch to feel changes in the air. That's why he made a form of beast breathing literally using his senses at their peak to find the spider mommy- I mean spider mother.
And? They're both characters, basically the same, we dont know how Yorrichi created the Sun breath, nor do we know how Inosuke create the Beast breath.
Yeah lmao. I just decided to stop talking.
Unconsciously\* ;)

And how the hell is Tengen detestable? I understand with Sanemi but would like a valid reason for Uzui.
Tengen is detestable?

Chat i may have found zenitsu's acc
skinniest halo fan
this response gives me navy seal copy pasta vibes lol, the word childish hit a nerve
Can they talk like an adult tho? Kids don't fully learn how to properly talk until like 10 years old and inosuke did it extremely quickly
Ok where did it say Tengen learned thunder breathing though?
I didn't say that Inosuke did not create his own breathing. 

I just stated that his breathing is also a derivative of wind which is a fact. Doesn't matter if he learned it from a wind breathing user or not.
All breathings are a derivative of another breathing and the root of everything is Sun breathing. 

That's literally how it works in the verse. Whether or not Inosuke made it himself, beast breathing is still a derivative of wind which is a derivative of sun.
Especially when a lot of the forms have to do with cats as well 💀
>They're both characters

No, you might have gotten a little confused when reading
My bad ;)

He shuts down Inosuke's delusions of being "the mountain king" litteral seconds after shoving his own delusions onto us viewers and the Kamaboko squad. I might have a lower-than-average tolerance for hypocrisy, but that's too far and I never forgot.
Have my upvote, then
kids can speak properly way before 10 years old, toddlers are able to hold full conversations with adults
That's a good point, I'm not sure it's directly mentioned but it is stated that he had official demon slayer training prior to making Sound Breathing as opposed to Inosuke who made up Beast Breathing after beating up a slayer and then later got invited to final selection
Beast Breathing was not derived from Wind Breathing, you cant derive from something you dont even know exists, Beast Breathing was created with no knowledge of Demon Slayers or other Breathing Styles

Beast Breathing is considered “derived” from Wind Breathing because thats the closest they could get, but really Beast Breathing is like Sun Breathing and was made from scratch
my bad know that I read it back i see it. However thats your opinion I will respect it even though I wont like it.
But why would you care if he shuts down Inosuke's claim of being the Mountain King, you obviously don't care whatsoever about Inosuke as a character so why would this be at all relevant?
Mf he spent most of his early life being talked to by a boar herd and he can speak Japanese 😂 just don't ask him to read or write
Because it's objectively hypocritical.

Also, I don't hate Inosuke that much, I just can't fathom giving credit to his brain given what we get on screen. Reminds me of Bakugo magically getting good grades in classes in MHA despite being a low-atttention-span screamer all the same like Inosuke and there being no chance even with a plot-armor boost of him having even 1% of that intelligence. Just messes with my suspension of disbelief because it can't be.
Hey so here is a fun concept most of classmates failed to learn "dont judge a book by its cover", most of my classmates thought I was near the bottom of my class in highschool until they actually asked me my class ranking I showed them that I was number 12 in the class despite being the stereotypical example of a burnout stoner, just because someone appears stupid doesnt mean that they are, hell that goes both ways as I regularly interact with people at my job who seem to be quite intelligent and then after interacting with them you realize their heads are fucking empty.
Congrats on being ranked high, but ranking students is counter-productive in education. It shouldn't exist because it only creates inferiority sentiment where there shouldn't be. The skillset required for good grades is just too narrow to judge a person just by their grades. And it will always be like this. There's so much more to intelligence than school.

Coincidentally, one of the skills required for good grades is the ability to listen and gain new knowledge from external sources, which these "screamer" characters just don't have.

Either Rengoku or Sanemi.
It’s between Rengoku and Muichiro for me.
I think Muichiro's looks the coolest, but Rengoku's fits his breathing style perfectly.

Also am I the only one who feels like Rengoku's sword guard should be turned around?

Pink hearts 4 way please! 💖💖💖💖
I mean... Rengoku's is just 🔥
Zenitsu IMO
Sanami
The most practical one to use would probably be Tanjiro's. The circular design saves you from scrapes that may be caused by pointed guards, and the spokes connecting it to the katana make it slightly lighter and probably even more durable than if the circular piece was filled in. TL;DR: Tanjiro's sword guard is plain but extremely effective at its job.

The coolest looking in my opinion is probably Muichiro's, Rengoku's, Sanemi's or Obanai's.
SHINOBUUU
Muichiro
Muichiro.
Muichiro it interesting how simple yet a bit fancy it is
I really like Sanemi's
Sanemi's, Kyojuro's and Muichiro's, in this order
Rent Goku

Definitely my boi Mui 💨
Honestly I love all of them 😀
Muichiro is the only one that look like it be cool in anime and real life. Simple yet badass
Sanemi and Muichiro
I love mitsuris and muichiros
Between Sanemi, Rengoku and Muichiro for me
If you don’t Fw Obanai or Sanmei’s guards what are you doing?
Sanemi or Mitsuri
Sanemi's,Rengoku's,Mitsuri's, Shinobu's and Mui's (I can't pick one there all too good) 🩷💚
Muichiro has a sick one but youricchi one is sick too
For me it’s obanai or muichiro.
Kokushibo
I like Muichiro’s best but Rengoku’s is a close second
Tokio or sanemi
Sanemi is beautiful
Sanemi with Muichiro a close second for me.
Sanemi, no contest.
Muichiros 🌫
Sanemi
my favorite has always been sanemi
Muichiro's, sexy geometry
I really like Muichiro and Tanjiro's second guard (which yes is the same as Kyojuro's but it faces the opposite way, which I prefer)
Muichiro. Especially because of the intricate design which also has few gaps between that.
Muichiro overall but it has to be rengoku because its the most fitting for him
Sanami
I like how all of them are associated with the personality of the user. Like how Yuriichi is the strongest but his is just a simple/normal man just like his guard.

Slither!
Giyuu and Sanemi.
Muichiro
Obanai
I love Tanjiro’s wagon wheel guard
I like Shinobu and Obanai's. But if i have to choose which one will i use, it will be Shinobu's sword since i'm lack of physical strength just like her
Sanemi, Iguro, Muichiro and Mitsuri
Sanemi
Out of the ones pictured it’s sanemi or muichiro. 

Not pictured: tanjiros after swordsmith village. I enjoy how it’s rengokus but flipped so the flame is symmetrical with the blade.
I will never not love Zenitsu's lightning decorations on his sword
Mui/Sanemi/Obanai idk
Ichigos bankai 💯💯💯
Rengoku has the coolest sword guard according to me
Rengoku :3
Ms. Kanroji.
Rengoku but if the round part was facing forward
ofc my boy rengoku
Zenitsu or Rengoku
I don't like the flashy ones, so I have to say for me it's Giyuu's, Tanjiro's first one, Yoriichi's and Zenitsu's.
Coolest? Rengoku. Cutest and the one I like the best? Mitsuri’s! 💕💕
Easy It's kanao

Tanjiros was plain because his blade didn't change/he hadn't fully mastered water breathing. Where Tengen? But out of these bottom right is best
Gyomei
Rengoku for me

The Flavortown Hashira
Chain and ball.
Rengoku. By far.
Rengoku
SET YOUR HEART ABLAZE!
Muichiro, I'm not bias







JK I am
Kanao’s tsuba is not here but Kanao, Obanai and Muichiro
Kyojuro or Shinobu 🦋
I wouldn’t have designed Shinobu’s guard that way
Either Giyu or Muichiro for me
Inosuke
Muichiro
Muichiro 🌸
Rengoku and Muichiro ❣️
Mitsuri or Muichiro
Muichiros was the coolest guard but in terms of actual sword my goat Iguro
Tokito
Sanemi or Muichiro
Rengoku's, its so cool that i want to get It tattoed at this point
I'll actually disagree with you on Tanjiro's hilt guard. Although the design is extremely simple, and sure, even plain. I think the specific design it has was very intentional.

Every sword has a unique design, and obviously Tanjiro's first sword wasn't meant to be as cool, given he gets a much more badass sword later, >! Yoriichi's sword !<.
But I also think that the guard hints to the secret of Tanjiro and his "destiny" we'll call it. His guard, to me, looks similar to a simple depiction of the Sun. Essentially just a point with rays going outward from it.

Although I may be thinking way to much into this...I think it's a clever way to hint to him being >! A Sun Breather !<.
Rengoku, i mean I would look at that masterpiece for hours
Hard to beat Muichiro’s imo, super stylish yet simple
Isn’t it called a tsuba or something
Sanemi’s and Muichiro’s
Sanemi
Muichiro.

Shinobu's sword have a nice design but a really bad color palette!
It don't fit with Shinobu's design!

Rengokusan
Rengoku's my favorite one

Murichro
Muichiro's and Rengoku's blades are my favourite
I really like rengokus one but he kinda has it backwards for some reason so idk
1. Sanemi


2. Rengoku


3. Shinobu


4. Mitsuri


5. Muichiro


6. Obanai


7. Giyu


8. Tanjiro


9. Zenitsu

this one
I love mitsuri’s
I think muichiro but also rengoku because the  sword fits perfectly whit his breathing style
Flame hashirama!

![gif](giphy|6U47YlEnJQNeb05Csh)

Such a beautiful sword😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🌇
rengoku fo sho
Rengoku,Giyuu and Zenitsu. Honorary mention to Himejima.
I can't  decide
Sanemi or mui 100%
Yoriichi is simple and incredibly cool looking
The two on bottom left who's are they, pretty functional those are my picks
Sanemi, Rengoku, Muichiro
Rengoku or Muichiro
mitsuri and muichiro🩷🩵
Mommy 🍡🍡🍡
Muichiro and Sanemi
muichiro for me
Sanemi or Muichiro
It’s rengoku it fudging rengoku

https://preview.redd.it/3jxmi1xqhied1.jpeg?width=331&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5eb14af72a7cd28a8bf615a9a8a9aede7afd6077
Rengoku’s is imo the best simply because it resembles a flame. If you hold the sword edge down, the flame is “downwards”, because most of the flame breathing style relies on “upward” movements (mimicking a rising flame).
muichiro, rengoku or shinobu for me.
When you realize Giyus sword hilt matches the haori his sister wore…
Rengoku all the way
Muichiro
Ngl inosuke's is pretty underrated
Rengoku, Sanemi, or Zenitsu.
Sanemi is the best in all things
I love the simple elegance of Yoriichi’s guard.
Gyomei’s sword guard is his gigantic hand.
Rengoku for sure
muichiro and sanemi :3
Never realised how similar Muichiro and Yoriichi’s swords guards are.
Shinonu and tokito
Tengen Uzui

WHERE IS TENGEN???
The green, the pure black & the dark pink on the black sword..
Sanemi or rengoku
Rengoku by a mile
Giyu
obanai's looks so sick☝️
Rengoku for sure!
Gyomei :3
Mitsuris sword is super cool
Obanai
Wind hashira easily beats the rest
Yoriichi it’s just simple enough to make it the best
My glorious king Sanemi
Ichigo
Sanemi and Obanai
Shinobu 🎀
Muichiro because he’s my favourite character
Easily rengoku
muichiro imo
Whose is bottom right
Kokushibo or Yoruichi
Definitely Mitsuri or Sanemi
Rengoku definitely. Then Muichiro.
I love Murichiro’s and Tanjiro’s original, the open hilt seems so cool (and aerodynamic)
![gif](giphy|tEcIyVc6ukQV2eb86t)

Out of these, Rengoku. But I’m really a fan of how Gyomei fights, even if it’s not a sword.
the two golden guards were fire
Muichiro or Sanemi
Sanemi rengoku or mui
Love the design of Sanemi’s and love the look of Rengoku’s on Tanjiro’s black sword
Gyomei
did you just say "had"???
Rengoku or Mitsuri
Sanemi 100%
Tanjiro, its simple and efficient
Muichiro and it’s not close
Obanai it sanemi
Obanai or sanemi
I’d Say Sanemis is the Coolest But Rengokus is the best.
Muichiro
Muichiro's sword guard looks hella royal
Sanemi or Mui
Sanemi or yoriichi IMO.
Rengoku
I have extreme bias so Rengoku
I like muchiros, giyus and yorichis
Sanemi or rengoku. Sanemi has a shurakin and rengoku has a flame. Everyone else’s. Maybe expect for mitsuri and shinobus are extremely bland. That’s why the right gave tanjiro rengokus guard 💀
I like the snake on iguros
based but probably sanamis
Rengoku and Sanemi
Muichiro
Sanemi and Rengoku
Definitely Gyomei
Is it a cop out to say I love them all equally for different reasons?
Muichiro or Mitsuri
Muichiro or Mitsuri
Rengoku’s is just a bit too much for me, I prefer the simplistic design of Muichiro’s and Yoriichi’s, but at the same time Sanemi’s just fits him and his annoying ass personality. Like he could show you his guard and you’d think “Why’s it so sharp and violent?” And then the moment he speaks you finally realise the correlation
Mui or rengoku. Or maybe giyuu
Sanemi Sanemi !!
Rengoku
Where Tengen?
Sanemi
Rengoku
Really love that gold guard from Muichiro honestly
definitely not tanjiro-
Mitsuri
Whose sword is the 7th? The one that looks mostly Golden?
Rangoku/tanjiro one
The Mui
Muichiro or giyus afterall its like sabitos just in a diffrent color.
Muichiro
Sanemi 💨
Imo i think muichiro has got to be one of the coolest! I really like the intricate simple design!!
![gif](giphy|jh7F7XwHTywg85ekdl)
Rengoku
All of them
Prolly a bad opinion but I like sanemi’s and I do t really like rengoku’s at least on TANJIRO’s sword
It's between Rengoku and Muichiro for me.
Kyojuro rengoku
Rengokus is so cool tanjiro stole it so... ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6742)
rengokus was so good, tanjiro took it for himself
Sanemi’s wind mill thing was the best
Tanjiros new one with Rengokus guard is best, but between these I’d say Rengokus or Sanemi
Definitely Sanemi’s
Muichiro's
I feel like all of them match their character but Muichiro…how does his guard represent mist?
Sanemi and Muichiro
sanemi and muichiro tbh
Sanemi and Rengoku’s hilts are great, but Rengoku’s hit different on Tanjiro’s sword
I own both of sanemi's and remgoku's replicas, and honestly ilthe right answer is either of them, cause they're just so cool
I really appreciate Yoriichi’s tsuba for the historical accuracy. The bare ray skin wrap is also a cool history detail. The fact that both are gold is just a straight flex.
All gang
Rengoku all the way 🔥🔥
Rengoku imo

I LOVE the Flame
Definitely rengoku
Biased af but it's hotta be Muichiro. It's just too clean.
Muichiro and sanemi, they look simple yet so special
Either Rengoku, Muichiro, or Sanemi
I’m going Muichiro
Sanemi
Sanemi orthe bottom right (muichiro i think)
Fire
Sanemi has my favorite color scheme, Obanai has my favorite sword design
UPPER MOON ONE
Rengoku, it’s just so iconic
Kyojuro, Sanemi, and Mitsuri
Rengoku and Zenitsu.
Mitsuri. (This is biased I just really love mitsuri)
My favourite is Muichiro and Giyuu’s. I like simplicity.
They're all badass, but Shinobu, Mitsuri, and my boy Tokito take the cake for me.
Tanjiro and Yoriichi have traditional guards so they are cool to me. While I like Mitsuri's, my boy Rengoku has the coolest guard of all. 😁👍
Muichiro
As much as I hate Sanemi, his is probably one the coolest.
Tengen’s
Sanemi the best easily imo
imo muichiro or sanemi (im biased 🙏)
Rengoku's. But I am extremely biased
Sanemi or Muichiro
Rengoku and tanjiro
Gyomei has my personal favourite.
I wonder how many of these are going to end up in assassin's creed shadows
Muichiro, it's look so royal
Muichiro or tengen if that counts
Obanai and Muichiro's to me
Rengoku and sanemi
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Muichiro.

Rengoku’s is up there design wise but I have a pet peeve about it that makes me hate it. The pointed part of the flames being on the same side as the sharp end of the sword feels so awkward. I like Tanjiro’s version of the flame guard better
Why is Tanjiro even here? 😭
John Kagurabachi
Definitely Zoro
Whose sword is the golden one?
Sanemi, Rengoku, or Muichiro
Obanai
Top left. I have no insight on the show at all but that just strikes me as super cool. Anime is so dope !
Tokito
Sanemi or mui
I think the only answer is sanemi. Obanais lookin a lil sus ngl
Rengoku or Mitsuri can’t decide
Muichiro for me
Rengoku’s or sanemi but the way rengoku’s looks on tanjiro’s is even cooler
Inosuke
for me, its either Sanemi or Giyu
Muichiro's is really ornate. 😁
I like Shinobu's and Sanemi's most
Rengoku had the coolest sword for sure
Muichiro all the way
Zenitsu
mitsuri's
I love Muichiros sm but I think my all time favorite sword of the slayers is tanjiros version 2 sword, with rengokus flame guard and newly refined black blade they found in SSV. It’s soo sick with the engraving and just the story
I like muichiro’s the cool designs showing the elements are so overused it isn’t appealing anymore
Yoriichi's Nichirin was my fav one
Hate to be that guy but they are called tsuba
Rengoku, Muichiro, or Yoriichi
Sameni and uzui rengoku and zenitsu
Rengoku, muichiro or sanemi
Rengoku for cool factor, but Tanjiro for that simplistic elegance factor
Tokito and shinazugawa
Rengoku and muichiro
i really like muichiro's
Sanemi and tokito no doubts
 Sword of Obanai's. His sword is the better and coolest for me
Sanemi and muichiro
Inoske no guard keep a tight enough grip you never had to worry about cutting yourself
![gif](giphy|Yq1tXTNe5PDdQEhKXG|downsized)
Rengoku!!!! But I may be biased, he was my fav 😢
Inosuke
Tokito's looks like the gates to a diamond temple🗿
Gyomei
Had?… 😢
Muichiro
Tanjiro's
Rengoku no question, he’s the goat
There is one of the swords whose owner I don't recognize. The one just below Zenitsu's sword
Sanemi's and kokushibo's
Sanemi
Sanemi and Obanai.   
By the way, who's the sword guard in the bottom right?
Muichiro or Yoriichi
I love mitsuri’s it’s adorable
I really like Rengoku’s but Iguro’s is cool.
Zentitsu i Just Love the gold
Personally it’s between Sanemi or Muichiro for me
Muichiro’s. Simple, not too fancy, yet elegant.
I absolutely love Muichiro's and Sanemi's! 🌫
Zoros
Tengen Uzui. Or Tokito
Rengoku for the reason it is the most iconic. Probably because it was the first unique and detailed sword guard we were introduced to. The story behind why it’s important to tanjiro is cool.
obanai
Mitsuri. It’s really pretty
Mitsuri, Obanai, and Shinobu for me. Mitsuri and Obanai’s sword are really funky and cool while Shinobu has poison in her’s which I find interesting
Inosuke's lmao
I'd say Sanemi cause his sword guard looks like a shuriken and I think that's really cool
Zenitsu and obanai for me
Rengoku or Sanemi. Giyu's was nice too.
Mitsuri
Rengoku
Zenitsu and Muichiro's look really nice but Sanemi's or Rengoku's looked the best
Inosuke

No guards for the diehard
I like zenitsus. Clean and simplr
I like the symmetrical ones like Muichiros. Something about it is so simple yet so clean. I don’t think the rectangles that are floating outwards have any use though.
Giyu
Mitsuri’s
Rengoku/Sanemi
Top four for me

1: Tengen (why isn’t he up there?)  
2: Zenitzu  
3: Muichiro  
4: Giyuu
![gif](giphy|0qVkEbOWZHtiDq3Yhx)
![gif](giphy|So4Yp61bm4pO1wYo1W)

Guy with guard. His mother ain't raised a coward
Ichigo... but here ill take Sanemi
Tokito or rengoku-san
Sanemi’s is the most intricate (that ficker was hard to draw on nails -I’ll post later) but I love Tengen’s and obanai’s guard. Mui has my favourite tho. So detailed, yet so delicate it’s just gorgeous
Definitely Rengoku

![gif](giphy|6U47YlEnJQNeb05Csh)
Rengoku
Rengoku or zenitsu
Obanai
Rengoku & Zenitsu
Yoriichi
Rengoku's Is pretty fire
Kokushibo
obanai
Inosuke definitely
Rengokus is fire 🔥🔥
Sanemi or Rengoku. I really like their sword. But Giyuus will always be my favourite. I like simple things
Obani or sanemi
![gif](giphy|jh7F7XwHTywg85ekdl)
#tanjiro💚🖤🗡️
Sanemi
only me who thinks either iguro or rengoku? 🥲
Does tengen’s have a guard?
Muichiro, it just looks so clean with his sword
I just saw D&W! So many cameos: Chris Evans, Henry Cavil, Jennifer Garner, Wesley Snipe, Channing Tatum as Gambit, old X-Men movies.
Obanai’s is kinda cool
Ofcourse Muichiro's
Besides the obvious best (rengoku) Sanemi or Muichiro
Def the big tiddy goddess mitsuri, but I am a slut for anything pink so I’m biased.
Muichiro for me.
OBANAI
Obanai's sword looks so cool tbh.
Muichiro I’ve always liked the connected squares on his guard, simple is sometimes best
![gif](giphy|6U47YlEnJQNeb05Csh|downsized)
Gyomei for sure.
The donut man!
obami and rengoku
Sanemi or Muchiro for me
i like sanemi cause my fav color is green, and the design is super clean imo.
Gold one bottom left
Rengoku, easy. Even tanjirou using Rengoku's is bad comparatively. The way rengoku had it (as pictured above) when on his belt, in its scabbard, the flame was upward as his Nichirin was away most of the time. When haganezuka put it on tanjirou's sword he put it upside down. Sad.
Always though Rengoku’s was a lil tacky
Muichiro
Giyu
Wheres Zoro? 💀
Kokushibo. It has eyes in it...
![gif](giphy|xULW8jjeeLtBwrGZgc)

yu lose
I like the golden one 
My boi Kyojuro, Obanai and Shinobu. Those have the coolest designs.
Muichirou for sure!
Yoriichi, No Cap.
Rengoku. Obviously!
Sanemi's or Rengoku's. Muichiro also has a nice one but these two are best
Genuinely a tie between wind fire and water but Rengoku still my favorite character
For me, Rengoku or Obanai
Muichiro’s
Tanjiro's new sword >!or yoriichi's blade x rengoku katana holder!<
I like Muichiro's the best
muichiro probably
Tokito is awsome and look do coooll!!
Tokito he’s the goat
Rengoku or Sanemi
Rengoku
Sanemi
obanai's is as mid as his personality
Mitsuri.

It has cute hearts!
Ngl rengoku
Iguro’s looks sick
Inosuke, nothings cooler than showing off that you're too skilled by simply not needing a hand guard.
Definitely Muichiro
Definitely Muichiro
Rengoku by far
Got to go with Samenis that is just so cool
I like Giyu's
Rengoku
I really liked the basic traditional design of yoriichi and his katana
Mitsuri… I mean it literally bends
Rengoku. Easily.
muichiro has areally cool one
Rengoku
It's probably a tie for me between Mui's and Sanemi's, >!just becuase they're such a pain to draw right!< Coolest sword design I think as a whole though has to be Pikachu's. The lightning crackle reminds me of damascus steel's rippling, but colourful & that's hard to top imo.
I love Mitsuri and Rengoku’s those are just so cute 🥰
Zenitsu then yorichii
Rengoku as seeing it sets your heart ablaze
Sanemi
Sanemi
Sanemi’s and Tokito
Obani, Rengoku, and Muichiro for me
Rengoku
Mate, I am forever a fan of Muichirou's tsuba. I don't know why I love the look of it so much.
Muichiro’s sword guard is the coolest by far. However, my favorite swords in Demon Slayer will always be Tengen’s twin cleavers.
Sanemi or zenitsu
For the sword itself, I like shinobu's, but for the guard, muichiro's rocks.


I mean, the who design is just so good
Rengoku, easily. The others are basic, while Rengoku is fiery, which is FLAMBOYANTLY awesome.
Imo Rengoku

The one true answer.
Sanemi’s must be very uncomfortable for use though, those edges would constantly poke into his arms and sides
tanjiro stole rengoku's xd
Both technique fitting and bad ass
stole my comment word to word
Yes
Agreed 👍
Fax my brother
muichiro's is so simple, yet so cool.
When Tanjiro uses it on his sword, the guard is turned the other way compared to Rengoku.
I agree aesthetically but it's supposed to protect his hands from the sharp side of the blade, that's why the flames are pointed that way
**Poisonous potatoes 🍠🍠🍠 hehehe kukukuku**
Kinda just looks like a four leaf clover to me
🔥
https://preview.redd.it/0wjbppfgphed1.jpeg?width=219&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=604122b11ea9b334ab6882f916e333d57a96ae23

🌪️
Salami
Obanai is also nice, it protects his hand.
Tanjiro's Tsuba is my favourite too.

Not too much, not in lack of design : one of the best Tsuba
yum
That’s what I wanna know

Edit: through some quick googling I manage to find out that it is Yoriichi’s
Agreed. That burning Rengoku blade is the best one.

Sankyuu so much besto furendo!
He probably did that on purpose, he's def a masochist
Wind breathing 9th form 

Eye poke *boop*
sanemi cuts HIMSELF and you think he wouldnt like the handgaurd?
It’s really elegant and still cool and menacingly-looking
You're right, I didn't even notice! Hell yeah, I like it that way better.
Rengoku: setting sun
Tanjiro: rising sun

(Significance of the reversed fireball guard)
Well this picture actually illustrates why it makes sense aesthetically too. When the sword is in its scabbard, the flame "points" up, just as it should
Is this a black Clover reference I can’t tell
Noo it's a Sakura bloom!
https://preview.redd.it/vzrs22m4hped1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=702d650634ea1ad1b34cf260eadf830152e20546
OHHHHH YOU ARE NOW PROMOTED TO MASTER CHEF :)
Bruzzaaa , we are the exception
exactly.
Oh I like Todo. This is just representing the face I made when someone mentions Sanemi. 🌪️
Well, he cuts himself to attract demons and he definitely enjoys killing demons, so maybe he enjoys the cutting part too
Exactly. I think Zenitsu, Tanjiro, Giyu and Obanai’s guards are the best since they are the most practical - no sharp outward edges and they protect the hand of the user while using the sword.  Muichiro, Rengoku and Shinobu’s guards have the same problem as Sanemi’s, though to a much lesser degree. Mitsuri’s guard is somewhere in between since the design is not too practical but the edges are rounded
Check a comment of mine in this thread a little bit lower, I discussed this already with another redditor
I still think that Shinobu has the best one because of the small textures on it.
Rengoku: setting sun
Tanjiro: rising sun

(Significance of the reversed fireball guard)
I think mitsuri said that in the anime 
Not sure if its from black clover

THANK BRAZZA
Oooh got it. I recently watched demon slayer. Sorry I don't understand lot of reference. Thank u for explaining as well.
Honestly they all do a good job when it comes to hand protection. Some better than others. Sanemi's does have problems with risking hurting the users hand. But the others are mostly fine I'd say. We also have to acknowledge that tsubas were also meant to be works of art.
Yeah, they are all pretty ornate and beautiful, I admit. Shinobu and Obanai’s might be my favorite in terms of design due to small intricate decorations
Obanai's is probably the best when it comes to a good mix of ornate and cool designs. While also looking like it belongs on a real sword. For me I usually like more realistic looks. Which is why I love Tanjiro,Giyu,Zenitsu,Yoriichi and Obanai's Tsuba. They all look like they could belong on a real sword. My only problem with Yoriichi's is that it seems a bit thick. I love all of them tho.
Anyone wish that he kept his long hair
Does anyone else hear wish that he kept his long hair, compared to the short hair he often has?

Muzan would just have a heart attack lol
Not Muzan or >!Kokushibo!<, that’s for sure. 🦋
Muzan managed to keep his composure when they first met and that’s when he only has his earrings. If Tanjiro kept his hair long too, well, I imagine he would freak out right there and then.
Long hair Tanjiro is the GOAT so yes
I said the same until I realised he won’t look like the goofy adorable boy we’d know, he’d look more adult like. I prefer his shorter hair
And give Muzan a panic attack when they first meet?
I liked it better when it was this style:

https://preview.redd.it/dptfg7noedbd1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3881962f12ba2af5c26a2b1bec74dc23b55aa0ae
No because I'm hoping that some day >!We get to see an OVA for Demon Slayer with a grown up Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke, much like the Epilogue of UBW with Shirou and Rin in the Clock Tower.!<
Me he looked a lot like his dad
Muzan would shit his pants every time he saw Tanjiro
I do, Muzan on the other hand, doesn't.
Muzan is happy :3
I honestly like the long hair more but that might be biased because my hair kinda looks like that
I want him to look his age 😔
I love it when he ties like a little ponytail- it looked super cool.
https://preview.redd.it/wfogvwsk9ebd1.jpeg?width=189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87fa3422e4d72423a8deafd74edb5cedfebca590

He would start to look a lot more like Yoriichi, which I love.
Muzan Will never cure his PTSD
Better looks-wise, however less "goofy main character" energy.
I prefer the short hair ngl 💜
I think most if not all guys look better with long hair, real life/ anime all the same.
He looked so cool with long hair. It made me so sad when he cut it.
Me it looked awesome
As a kid in early 2000’s I didn’t know a man bun was an option and I was afraid of the pony tail so long flowing hair wasn’t an option….
Keep it short up until the hashira training arc just for when he fights Muzan
I definitely wish so. I’m a sucker for long hair 🐍
I wish Tanjirou had kept his hair long.
I like the short hair better but omg if he kept his long hair when he met Muzan, Muzan would have had a heart attack and I'm all for it (bc Tanjiro would look like Yoriichi)

It looks cool, but to be honest I like the shorter hair more.
Yesn’t?
No I really wish he hadn’t
It is rather cool.
Imagine if Muzan and >!Kokushibo!< thought tanjiro was yorichi ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6760)
Is that Monjiro or is it one of his ancestors?
Muzan would have shit himself, and freeze mid step... That would have been awesome to see thoughhh!
I 💕his long hair…
Unless he ties it back, nah
Ngl absolutely not
Muzan would shit bricks and straight up vanish out of existence
Id liked to have seen it get cut off in a fight, probably against Rui
I like long haired Tanjiro🌌
As a long hair, yes.
He would be way cooler but on the beggining of the show i didn't know if Tanjiro is male or female 💀
No
Long hair but in a high ponytail, Muzan will have a heart attack 🤣🤣🤣
Hell yeah I wish he’d kept it <3
I wish
Muzan would have shat himself and just would’ve disappeared for 100 years
author had to nerf that illegal rizz
every damn day. that was his peak design
Yeah I liked it
I like his short hair he looked like cavani at that point
Ima stand by it. I hate when MCs get long hair because usually it doesnt last long and they usually look 10x better with longer hair.
Literally!! I wish I had that hair
Long hair Tanjiro was so cool man
I do, he looked Cool
Yeah. He looks like that one sun breathing user and upper one
Yes! He has gorgeous hair. I’m so jealous of Yoriichi tbh
I miss the water kimono he used to rock
Muzan would be shitting himself
Then not even plot armor can save tanjiro from muzan
It’s def a look
I feel like him keeping the short hair fits him. He's shown to struggle with styling hair as seen when doing Nezuko's braids in SSV, so I'd imagine he sticks with the short hair for simplicity. I know this from experience, having longer hair was a nightmare to handle
He looks like Kokushibo with his long hair.
No
HE'D LOOK SO ADORABLE WITH LONG HAIR IM SO PISSED THEY CUT IT OFF
Definitely but it would’ve done Muzan no good thus they decided to remove it..
I forgot he had long hair.
I wish he often switched to his final selection uniform. It was so sober and good to look at.
![gif](giphy|hU0xtUMnXSrHa)
No
Just looking like yoricchi
He looks so handsome with his hair down , no homo
He should’ve kept it long and tied it up to look like Yoriichi so he could give Muzan a heart attack
He'd definitely look more like his father and Yoriichi.
Chadjiro
idk if i wish he kept it but it certainly should have come back at some point. he had it for all of 2 seconds in the series 😭
No, he'd be bootleg Yoriichi.
All the time
Imo he looked so much better with long hair
Honestly. Me with every male anime character who we see long hair on. 
Tanjiro, Ichigo,etc (there’s probably more tbh)
It does look good on him
Yes
He looked like a rock star before
No
Ngl I kinda hated this look when I was watching it originally
**inserts muzan ptsd meme**
Yessss
Why did I think this was some anime girl
Right here 👋 I wish he had kept the longer hair, I even remember telling my wife exactly that the first time we went through the series.
We all do
Muzan would have shat his pants
I wish he did. Tanjiro looked so good
True!
HE COULD'VE BEEN A MINI YORICHII(IDC IF I DIDN'T SPELL THAT RIGHT) IM SO MAD☹️☹️☹️☹️
Saw a meme that said if he kept it when he met muzan he would have had 5, 7 heart attacks or whatever number of hearts he has and i thought it was funny
Who ever approved his short hair count your days, he could have been such a thirst trap
Yes but only because the idea of Muzan having five simultaneous heart attacks makes me laugh so hard, I cry!
Before watching the show I saw pictures of tanjiro with his long hair and I honestly assumed he was a girl
Yeah I do
Muzan when he sees Tanjiro.

![gif](giphy|kVmzd3RxKqaT5Rm16e|downsized)
You should really ask if anyone didn’t want the long hair
I’ve always wished this
Obviously yes, he looks amazing 
Muzan will be like :

![gif](giphy|12RfP2odT4hEOI)
Absolutly
That's not Tanjiro, that's Yoriichi, and you can't convince me otherwise.
Tanjiro just doesn’t look right with his hair long but muzan would be out of shit at infinity castle
I do, but I also like how his short hair doesn't look TOO short. Really gave me notice when he unlocked his mark and his hair just started to flair out a bit
No because it will give anyone the idea how lazy they are for designing their characters. They all look the same
Muzan would die in PTSD

![gif](giphy|Y3q6PGa2wZzXCQ6ZR5)
Yes! I love Tanjiro but I was always upset that he cut it when the only reason it was short before was because it was cut in the fight with Giyuu. He kept long hair before everything.
I completely forgot that he even had long hair to begin with
I wish he kept his hair from the very beginning. The longer ponytail/bun thing looked great on him and made him look a little less childish without detracting from his kind look
Yes me
Muzan would shit his pants on spot
He looks sick like that honestly idk why the author made him cut it
Cute tanjiro
Yeah no, that look went hard.
Daddy tanjiro 😂👀
Nah
absolutely
Same
After final selection he should have kept it long cause all the demons would have been in shock from l seeing him
mmh hes a cutie but wouldve been the death of the animators probably lol, hes still pretty with short hair so im not too mad
Honestly loved the long hair. I very much wish he’d have kept it.
muzans gonna think its young yoriichi imaoo
As I was rewatching the Demon Slayer, I wished he would have kept this hair style! Damn it suits him and may be in the long run he will look like his father!
If kokushibo or muzan saw him with long hair, the mark AND the earrings the fight would’ve been over hahahaha
I much preferred it.
You can’t have him looking to cool
Despite anime logic, having long hair in combat is a safety issue.

Think about it, you're in the middle of a life-or-death sword fight with a freaking man-eating monster. Then, during a crucial moment, your beautiful long hair, which is wet with sweat, gets plastered across your eyes.

Do you think the demon will wait for you to clear the hair from your eyes? That's 1 of the reasons soldiers(except for special ops) have to keep their hair short.

In anime, hair tends to stay exactly where the artist puts it, which is cool but dumb.(I'm looking at you, Toriyama, RIP)
Yeah he looked more like yorichii this way

Muzan POV if he saw long hair Tanjiro:
Yep I loved it so much it's the only thing that kept my brain cells moving
ohhh boy the fight in entertainment district with this long hair of his woulda shown us the closest thing to a yoriichi fight scene.
If he had: Muzan would’ve lost his s***! No lie: that would’ve been amazing to see, but what can you do?
If he did, he'd put Michael back in the grave.
He’s sooooo cute w long hair!
I miss his ponytail 😞
Nah
i love this thread, people referring to muzan as muzan jackson always makes me chuckle
Muzan and Kokushibo would surely have ptsd cuz he looks like his ancestor named Tatsuya Kamado (Sumiyoshi's cousin who's a demon slayer in the Sengoku era).

https://preview.redd.it/kf2do8ok1mbd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd699630b1866a32e2f1d86c14c96038513d4405
yes its cute!
Yes
YES
He should have it would make Muzan Jackson shit himself also it looks so cool

no

it doesnt fit him plus its shaggy and unwashed he look like a hobo with all that hair
Muzan has enough pstd as is rn let himmm  beeeeeee 😭😭😭😭😭
Michael Jackson might have sharted his pants from seing him 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Goddamn that boy looks fine in long hair. 😍
I have never seen this look of tanjiro's I will cherish it forever
I actually kinda do. I think his haircut now is a Lil awkward but he's a kid so I guess that's why. I'm sure in the end he'll grow it out
Yeah we wont his old hair back😭
Yes
*here
Series ends due to Muzan Jackson having intense PTSD from seeing Tanjiro with long hair the first time. He forgets to take shelter from the sun and dies (he is in shock until sunrise)
That's why I wished he kept it
Well alot of heart attacks, I kinda forgor how many hearts he has
Heart attack(s), he has many hearts.

Makes me wonder, can demons die from heart attacks? Like, what if all his hearts just stopped working and he just like, died
which heart? /s
Status: Muzan retired due to trauma
For real😂
He would be like: Yoreeheechi
More like hearts attack
imagine Tanjiro in a ponytail
Such a missed opportunity on the writers part. Imagine >!UM1 seeing his brother's earrings AND breathing style...he'd have a heartache!<
>!Doesn’t Kokushibo still have long hair?!<
He would probably goes into hiding and never comes out like the scared pussy he is.
RIGHT ANSWER.
Wrong answer
That's why I think it'd be cool if he got it around the start of the upcoming movies.
Agreed
I thought Tanjiro didn’t live very long?
We kinda got that with the special goodbye's chapter along with an update on all the survivors
are you anime only? if so, this question makes more sense.
I thought he fit 16-17 pretty well, saying he looks any older than 19 is stretching
I love how the viewers as a collective decided to call him Muzan Jackson 🤣
Bro wtf I hope you aren’t right, you just like SPOILED the fuck out of this anime if what you said is true
spoiler much???
9 I think. And 5 brains.
What’s regeneration gonna do if their blood just stops? Blood demon art could work, but they’d have to physically move blood around their body.
From the shock? Probs all. Even more
He would also have the same demon mark to lol.
But we had to get closure with akaza tho, also at least we get mui with koku.
Oh he would absolutely go berzerk and end the series right there tbh
Yes, but the point is that if a long-haired, flame-marked, Sun Breathing swordsman were to cross their paths, either of them would lose their shit.
Nuh uh!
this sub glazes so hard its not even funny. 41 downvotes for not liking a haircut is crazy
The upcoming movies and end of the series all take place within the same night as the season finale if I recall correctly.
That would be hilarious if he just grew hair for a single night
Well Tanjiro age at EOS is >!16 years old in Chapter 204, and all Mark users live until 25 (with the exception of Yorichi who lived until 80)!< So I'd say we have plenty of chances to see a Grown up Tanjiro if Ufo/Gotouge ever wanted to make it a reality.
I mean, he is kinda of a smooth criminal
He basically is Muzan Jackson.
No fortunately it's not what happens XD
>!That's not what happens!<
It isn’t good but isn’t this sub more geared towards manga readers?
dang, that's just wow
7
How come he has 5 brains but only has about 2 or more likely 1 brain cell?
Lol yup
>!he'd speedblitz him just like he did gyomei when he mentioned his brother!<
Oh whoops I misread, I thought scout was saying they didn’t want muzan or >!koku!< to keep their long hair
Same earings too
Yuh-huh. Long hair Tanjiro is just Kokushibo with half the steps.
\-55 in 7h ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip)
real
Sounds right. I just mean maybe by the final episode he'd have the long hair again, kind of showing how serious he's going to be.
Smooth
Mfw anime onlys
im reading n watching demon slayer at the same time
Koyoharu Gotouge was high off fent 80% of the time writing this series.. I still love it to death tho dw. Demon Slayer is one my favorite anime/manga, as I do find the plot, characters, and stories to be very fun and inticing.
Roasted him harder than Yoriichi
Nuh uh! He looks so much better than short hair though!
If we're not including the >!timeskip!<, the whole thing will be over once >!the sun rises!<
That's my point.
Oh
Clementine cosplay
By kiku1569

She looks sad. I think she needs a... hug... from a big boned friend.

You should go hug that ainz cosplayer too.
Awesome cosplays deserves a hug, i mean dont you want your work to be appreciated with a hug?
She does great cosplays
Her Tanya Degurechaff cosplay is probably one of the bests out there, then she has a great Aura or Frieren (can't remember who of them she cosplayed) and others I didn't recognise.
Do **Cocytus** next time!

now missing getting bear hug by Ainz.

only beside her 5 meters away.
missing a board with "free hug" written on it.
An awesomely done Clementine - actually improves my appreciation for the character.  🙂
Great cosplay, deserves a hug
This is sick! This whole thing
Literally one of the best and most detail oriented cosplays of Overlord I’ve ever seen actual hype props to the og cosplayer
https://preview.redd.it/jhuanuerks2d1.jpeg?width=464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da976dee9ad876640c2d85d7b8ebd37d4bf6aaef
I see brain back there
Ainz! where u
Do you also have a picture of Nailcliper and Sorcerer King in the background?
Now you just need an Ainz with a "free hugs" sign behind her.
Now this is a cosplay this subreddit needed  
Absolutely amazing!!
It looks amazing, but somehow the first thing I noticed was 3 daggers. Pretty sure she only had 2, right?
I'd love to hug her
She looks amazing! I wish I could cosplay like her ❤️
ate that up
Not enough blood
Needs more plates, otherwise, epic cosplay...
Love the claws.
Awesomeness
This is so awesome 🥰🥰🥰 Now I need to try this cosplay thing..looks like I could be a gem in them costumes 😂🤦
Nice.
Now you need to hug the Ainz Cosplayer
Edith : Omg yes I hope no Anime girl cosplayers were harmed in the production of this series of photos
Fabulous all around. Hope to do fun cosplay like that sometime as well. Keep up the good work!
It's breathtaking to see Clementine... Hehe
Ngl, all of these cosplays are absolutely amazing
I can fix her.
Looks great, minus points for not being death gripped by ainz 😂 jk
Shit son thats a damn good cosplay.
I will hear myself out
That’s really good cosplay. I especially liked that Ainz cosplayer must be real awkward wearing that. Respect the hustle
https://i.redd.it/p1vjp8d6rx2d1.gif
The hair can also double as he man...
This is awesome
needs more adventurer tags
Well fortunately, once Ainz gets done with his own pictures, he's only a few feet away... I think he's conversing with Brain Unglaus... He could probably use a hug too.
"big boned friend" is really a term to use carefully outside of this sub X)
Beat me...

https://i.redd.it/y0xfecuuwr2d1.gif
    There were 3 of them, one of them contained a charm spell, so she didn't use it against Momon because it wouldn't work in combat.
Omg I love that demiurge
Oh wow that look. I wanted to horny out about the shiny tights, but now I'm scared. She did a great job with the make up and the character.
Do you have more of that shalltear as well?
Should have hugged it
that makes a lot of sense, thanks

Wait, There also was a Pandoras Actor Cosplayer?
To be fair, anyone can be a PA cosplay.
I mean because two ainz in same room how?
Finally made it to Fukuoka
And with this I have now visited all the Gundam in Japan. 
When did this go up and how am I only now learning about it? How many’s 1:1 scales have they got up and running now? Is the RX-78-2 still up somewhere or is it gone now that the Unicorn is up?
I've been to the Unicorn and caught a glimpse of the one in Yokohama. My next stop is definitely this, and then the one in Shanghai!
What is the designation of this Nu Gundam variant? It looks sick. Is that a beam smart gun? <orgasms>
Can't wait to see this place myself next year ~^^ and stock on kits
How do the ones you've visited compare for you and the shops that are usually in the same area?  Is the the same location with the 1/12 scale sazabi that's indoors as well? 
Was the Nu in the movie also meant to have blue markings? i always thought it was black.
I was there earlier this year. This one was by far the most chill of all the Gundam statues I've been to. Definitely less crowded than in Yokohama or Tokyo.
I've been the unicorn，i plan 2026 to go to shanghai to see the freedom
Majestic! I just bowed to a picture on my phone.
Do you know if there are any such Gundams in Osaka or Kyoto?  I've only been to the Unicorn Gundam at Odaiba's Gundam Base.
Just fought this is gb4.
Is this the Nu from High Streamer? Asking for a friend.
Wish I could one day see one of these in person, will probably never happen though.
Man didn’t realize how far this is from Odaiba was hoping to see all Japanese 1/1 gundams in one day
Probably won’t make it down to Fukuoka, but happy to have seen the original Odaiba RX-78, the Unicorn and Yokohama RX-78.
I would do anything to see this oh my god.
Holy shit that’s a big boy
Unicorn is still up

The RX-78F00 has been dismantled many months ago
There's also a Strike Freedom in Shanghai.
The old RX 78-2  in Odaiba that the RG 1.0 and MG 3.0 are based on was replaced by the Unicorn. The moving RX 78-2 in Yokohama was torn down earlier this year (it was always supposed to be temporary). However, the Yokohama RX will reappear in the World Expo in Osaka next year in the Bandai/Gundam pavilion albeit in a stationary position.
Yeah, Ive seen all 4 in Japan now, both Rx-78 and Unicorn at Odaiba, RX-7800 at Yokohama and now the V at Fukuoka. Unfortunately will never get to see the one in Shanghai.
It’s designated RX-93FF. The thing on its back is the Long Range Fin Funnel. They made it like that because it was physically impossible to build the Nu with its original fin funnel wing. In the lore, think of it as a hybrid of a single fin funnel, the Hyaku Shiki’s Mega Bazooka, and a very large beam saber.
It's called the RX-93ff.
Yeah, i spent a few pennies at the Gundam Base just near Nakasu and then more pennies at Gundam Park
I've been to a lot of Gundam Bases/Park/Side F over the years and have spent a fortune. Each of them have been subtly different in what stock they carry, there are common Gunpla in each store/base, but Ive also founs they dont carry some things I have been chasing. I really wanted to grab a Penelope while I have been over but neither stores in Fukuoka had it. 

And yes, the store next to this is the one with the 1/12 scale at the front door
Nope, this one is just for the outlet shop in Fukuoka.
I always thought it was navy blue. The model kit was certainly not black in the 80s.
Yeah, was the least crowded I have been since RX-78 at Odaiba in 2015
Yeah, unfortunately will never make it to Shanghai to see Freedom
As you should, Im sure as I was taking close up pics of the feet that people thought I was bowing in real life
No. There are only 3 statues. Unicorn in Tokyo, NuFF in Fukuoka and the Freedom in Shanghai.
There isn't
The Rx-78 from Yokohama is relocating to Osaka but will just be static, still worth having a look at once its up
Sadly no.
Its taken me 9 years to tick them all off, dont give up hope 😀
You could do it, when Rx-78 is back up in Osaka next year it would theoreticallly do all 3 in one day, Unicorn Odaiba first thing in morning, Shinkansen to Osaka by lunchtime, Shinkansen to Fukuoka and be there by about 1930
Its worth it, Ive seen both at Odaiba, Yokohama last year and now Fukuoka this year
It's truly amazing, because it was overcast my pics really don't really do it justice.
Yeah, its the biggest of all of the 4 I have seen
The RX-78FOO will return in a different pose for Osaka World Expo next April.
You meant Freedom.
Why not? Shanghai's a pretty great place to visit tbh. Worth the pilgrimage
As long as it is also a huge gun I am happy.
Ooooo!!! I do plan to visit both spots! How was the selection?
Thanks for the info. I was just in Japan the other week, but I have yet to make it down to Fukuoka, which is one of the places I want to check out in the future.  I kind of just casually like to look at kits nowadays, but I am always curious of how it is in other areas/stores, which is why I asked.  

  
I really like the look of the nu gundam statue over the other ones and the idea that they have the 1/12 scale gundams inside is an extra bonus that I don't think the other gundam statue/locations really had.  

  
I've only been to the Unicorn.  I never made it out to the RX-78 gundam base one, but I also didn't realize at the time that they were going to be taking it down, so I didn't really put much effort in to trying to see it.
I legit forgot the Nu in High Streamer looks more like the Turn X.
I hope this one stays up long enough for me to see.  Such an incredible suit
I forgot to mention this one, thanks.
I enjoy the irony of this one a lot lol
I loved Shanghai when I went there about 20 years ago but if I went now I would probably disappear, Im an Aussie who has Taiwanese friends and have been fairly vocal about my dislike of the way the Chinese government has been behaving in the region.
Its kind of an odd selection to be honest, most of the UC is represented, nearly complete range from Seed/Destiny, IBO and WFM,  loads of Haro and Gundam base exclusives but also some you would think would be there are not, really wanted to grab a Penelope, a Gustav Karl and a Command Messer but neither of the Fukuoka stores had them, heading to Akihabara tomorrow so hoping to be able to get em at Mandrake or Jungle
I hope so too, I get the impression this one will be around for a while, out of all 4 I have seen this one is by far the largest of the lot
Me too! i really what to know whom had the great idea " Hey, lets construct Freedom Gundam that everyone loves in China!" Either from Bandai or from China would be pretty hilarious.
Oooo I seee, in that I wish you great luck in your hunt!! Did they by chance had 00 kits ? >.>
Lol highly doubt they were thinking about that. Seed is just really popular
They had one or two but not even a 10th of the range of 00 kits
Oh darn okay, hopefully I can find what I'm looking for when I go xD
You might just have to spend a little time looking outside of Gundam base. I just got my Penelope and the new Murusame Kai from a shop in Ginza, If I had been 30 secs earlier I could have grabbed the 2 new Requiem ones as well, the guy in front of me got the last 2
Oh wow okay yeah will do then!~ thanks for the tip ~^^
Am I the only who keeps on repeating this exact scene?
It's my nth time rewatching Overlord because for some reason, there's no Manga available to advance read while waiting for the new season (I don't want to read the LN as it's a literal wall of texts. I wanna see pictures man. Anyway, here's Nabe getting smacked for acting rashly. I just thought her squeak here was too cute.
[removed]
I need a looping gif of it
Nope, bonk is satisfactory to watch
Season 1 adaptation was as good as they come for the budget available. Lots of great scenes that give the characters a ton of flavor and personality. Also I don't want to push my experience onto yours since I know a lot of people hate reading but overlord's writing (I recommend fan TL) is super easy to understand and creates very vivid images even though it's almost all text. There's a lot you're missing out on only watching the anime. Lack of budget, time, cut corners, scenes fail to convey the entire atmosphere and story of the LN.
I’ve watched the anime effectively 60x, and I still rewind it several times, she’s just too cute. Naberal Gamma is my Queen and I love her disdain for humans 🤩

Nabe pouting at the end was adorable. Also anyone else thinks she wasn't really upset and enjoyed the bonk?
[push 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xhljPkyH8Y)
She's so CUTE 🤣
No, you're not. That is unironically one of my favourite scenes in the show. I wish Nabe got more screentime, she's genuinely one of my favourite characters as well and it'd be cool seeing her grow accustomed to humans. No clue if that happens in the LN at all tho.
You are seriously doing yourself a disservice by y not reading the LN. especially if you like the series that much.

At least read it with the audiobook playing. That way you’re more like listening to it instead of going through the wall of text.

The audiobook can be found on YouTube. Not sure if it’s the same as the official paid one though.
No.
Personally I like the lukrut flirting scenes. Wish he’d survived so it was a running joke
You're not the only lol, i laughed hard at it, till my lungs said "no more" 💀
Bonk.
Why is Nabe so cute?
I didn't want to read the novels at first too (me like moving pictures). I was thirsty for more overlord content, so I read it.

I loved every second of reading the novels. So much details not included in the anime and manga can be found there. ++ Watching the anime helped fuel my imagination so I could just basically animate the scenes in my brain!
I have to go back and watch the first 2 episodes of S1 every once and a while, I just did that a bit ago. After that I'm usually pretty satisfied.
She's adorable in this scene!  So protective of Ainz!
It's my background gif for my Discord profile
I can get not wanting read a wall of text sometimes even though I do enjoy reading but have you tried listening to the LN on YT
If you love Overlord enough to watch the anime 9 times then you should be absolutely delighted to find out that there are audiobook readings of the whole light novel from first volume to current

Here is an audiobook playlist, every post is around ten hours long and there are 15 of them https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcXJ9GoqEC39kTNU3xdcmEA9iOuKrYTn_&si=d2oQgZoF-qJkMN_4

And here’s a link to the 16th volume on audiobook version https://youtu.be/evzMwaTPUTo?si=6akItlEgpqKBZq0H

Also here’s a link to a great little channel that animates and narrates the light novel at low production value, unfortunately they start at volume 12 and seem to skip volume 14 looking at their playlists https://youtube.com/@manascielyoutube?si=KRVQhpBCQhukjE5G

Listen to it boy, if I could so can you!
[Obligatory loop.](https://youtu.be/4tWV_g_DpyQ)
It's alright I usually do that for all sorts of other animes
Every rewatch, cant resist the urge
Bonk
Smash literally and figuratively
I need her
Perverts
Took me way too long to realize she voiced koko in Jormungand. Absolutely fantastic voice actor.
Povera Nabe
"it's literal walls of text"

Yeah, it's called reading a book, holy illiteracy.
Dumb take to not read. You’ve missed out on a lot of content not shown in the anime.
Name?
Name?
I guess it's because she wants Ainz all for herself. Besides, it's not like Momonga has those desires still. Well I guess he still does but lessened.

Here ya go

I have the whole collection of LNs and I can confirm, it is my favorite series and the novels are amazing. 

To add to it, there are several good audio versions of them, but if you want the absolute best audio version you'll have to pay (But man they deserve it!) because the best version is read by the voice actor of ainz in the anime, he is a great narrator and it's so cool to hear the novel read by the main voice actor
What's fan TL?
https://preview.redd.it/k8a5p7qjf51d1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93c9ec5f20f45a09419f2d494f1332a61b63371f
I think you oughta broaden your horizons a bit my man
Nawww, look at the cute grumpy human hater.
Nabe, you naughty naughty girl
I was thinking of doing this since I listen to narrated creepypastas anyway. Do you have any channels you recommend?
I just wanted you to know that I appreciated your comment so much. Now I know where to start and already have a channel to listen to. Poggers!
No, Albedo is fine with sharing Ainz as long as she is his first wife. Albedo and Shaltear literally fight over that in episode 2 they both agree that Ainz is too great to have just 1 wife, and so they fight over who gets to have him first.
Ainz-Sama is justice!!
A shorter GIF looped only her? XD
I need a 10 hour version
Fan translation or unofficial translation (I think)
Don’t worry, I’m very good at time management. Ever since I first watched Overlord in 2021, I’ve completed or have gotten caught up to date with a bit over 80 different anime. Many of which I’ve also rewatched a few times.

https://preview.redd.it/doy35tryx51d1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=379d0e7498ace571ee09be89d301ee6d50fdf97d
Also note that the official audiobooks are narrated by the VA of Ainz and he does the other voices as well, highly recommended!

Oh, I thought there is only a fan TL (in English), why is  the official version so rarely talked about then?

Ghost stories is legendary 🙌
What are your thoughts on saiki?
Ainz-sama using an illusion spell this entire time?!

She just wouldn't stop

She called everyone insects
This one is my favourite 😍
It looks like he’s…. Nvm 😶😳
Best version by a mile. God's work here lmao
Am I being perverted for saying the B and C versions look like she is being railed?
Ahh the thrusts got slower now
I think the official one is very hard to find that's why I think it's rarely talked about and also it's just a straight up wall of text and very hard to comprehend but the fan TL is easier to understand. Think of it like someone chewed some food for a baby to give them a much easier time to digest it (ik there is better explanation than this but this is the only one I could come up with lol)
official is yen press. Yen press are scummy to the people they acquire rights from. For a copy bought there's somewhere around 5% I believe that goes to the author so for every 10 dollars you spend he gets 50 cents. There are also translation issues with the names of certain institutions and inconsistent naming between volumes. The prose from yen press imo is much better than the fan TL so there's that to consider but either way you go supporting the author should be done by purchasing things directly from them, so the actual JP books or other merchandise, buying through yen press doesn't help the author much at all.
Yeah I always found it useful to have a list of them all, especially as a writer. Got the “Complete or Up to Date” list, the “Currently Watching” list, the “Watchlist Dub”, the “Watchlist Sub”, and the “Favorite Top 20” list. And ever since Funimation shut down and I had to use my Crunchyroll as my primary, I’ve been using their Crunchylist feature to organize my “Completed or Up to Date” list by my own personal (non-objective) rating system.

https://preview.redd.it/rkxnhiuad61d1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc34e6b41be1bf011adebd2504b022d2ab2bd8f2

Only for the anime they have of course, some they don’t have like “No Game, No Life” (one of my favorites), I just keep in my notes list.

I definitely agree with the background noise. One of the rewatches I’m currently doing is for “In Another World With My Smartphone”, which I do rather often along with Death March. I’ll either start and finish S2 today, or start S2 today and finish tomorrow, depending on how much writing I do today.
Facts 🔥
Oh I love it. I’ve watched and rewatched what they had on Funimation before it shutdown, which I believe was both S1&2. Thats why it still shows as currently watching, since they didn’t have S3, but Netflix does so I’ll plan to finish in the future.

But yeah I think its really good and definitely recommend it, that said I watched it in dub, so the dialogue will likely be different, but the scenes will still be the same.
this one specifically is only 355kB big.
this is why I made 3
yes.
Yeah but you wouldnt be wrong lol
lol this is new to me, when I first joined this community a few years ago almost everyone was reading through yen press, I'm glad the fan translation managed to become so much more popular than the official.

Remembered me of

"Thank you for changing my life"

"I'm literally the reason your parent is dead"
He unintentionally brainwashed her which is crazy
You have saved our lives. We are eternally grateful!

Will you just leave me alone?!
Anyone know when the new season is suppose to air?
I haven't seen a movie, or read the LN/Manga. Who is this chick?
Whats the sauce for the neia image
world-wide OPPAI ! i mean simp-pai, what i mean is senpai.. nyahahaha
[removed]
AYO
Are you stupid? That’s obviously overlord
Is that a reference to damian’s demon pet?
I subscribe to the theory that Ainz is actually crazy brilliant like his Intelligence stat would have him. That’s why his stuff just works out somehow, he just doesn’t realize cause he still has his old personality/memories.
Unintentionally?? No. This is all part of his 10000 year plan.
Season? The LNs aren't even there yet. The movie drops around the beginning of next year I think
Best girl
Our holy pope
Neia Baraja. She’s a human archer from the Holy Kingdom… and a fan favorite character because she’s actually a good person who respects Ainz. I won’t say more to avoid spoilers, but look forward to meeting her in the upcoming movie.

Hopefully, it’ll be long enough to do the character justice. I worry some of her arc might get cut short for time.
She's probably the only "non-evil" character who belongs in Nazarick.

Damian from spy x family?
Instinctively/unconsciously scheming sounds kinda impressive ngl
Imposter syndrome is hella strong with him lmao
I feel it’s more like his luck stat is maxed out lol
That is such cool theory. Count me as another sub
Orly? Thanks for the heads up. Haven’t followed the manga but really love the show.
IIRC doesn't NPC's like Mare technically have good karma?
Thank you very much kind man
r/whoosh
I get the Damian part but what about the demon pet..
Btw I have no idea who he is talking about
It makes way more sense than the intelligence one..
I think it's both.

His character has high intelligence, but due to the nature of the world shifting from a videogame to a real world, having a high intelligence isn't a direct benefit without knowledge and information.

On top of that, his character stats are directly impacted by (and affecting) his "old" personality.

This is where the theory of his Luck stat being Max comes in, as it serves as a handy boost in situations where his social skills are what is needed, which is something his "old" personality struggles with, especially when his unread status is eroding how much he cares about respecting human values
Unfortunately the anime is more caught up than the manga, and if there will be a next season, it will be the final season (unless it will become like attack on titan aka Final season, the last episodes, part 2 second half)
r/itswooooshwith4os
>Btw I have no idea who he is talking about

Don't worry, me either.
I doubt it will end up like train wreck AOT. It's more like demon slayer in the sense the movie will stall the series until the content for the next season is finished.
r/whoooosh
Damian Wayne, the demon pet that robin adopted after killing its parents, no one knows?
Ohh ok the latest robin? I'm just not familiar with him
That’s why I was confused what he was talking about cuz this is the closest I can think off to his reference
Pilots and their destroyed MS
Love his art
Just imagine an entire spinoff of this. Everyone would be dying for this.
We need Heero aggressively flipping the bird at his exploding gundam-friend
Setsunna:   
Exia 1-4: 👀
sir geese is such a handsome guy
No RX-78 my beloved...
This makes me even more happy the Strike Rouge lived on into SEED Freedom.
Wing gundam: WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?

Heero: *screeches*

Arthrun: *takes notes*
Getting Fate vibes from these.
Also, #4: long live the king.
Everyone else: awesome/cool/heartwarming/tearjerking 

Sandrock: Long live the Winner.
[Source](https://x.com/DTZ1200WG)
Wonder how Aegis would react to Athrun's self-destruct, or Heero and Wing
Bro, mika and barbatos...
Was not expecting Tallgeese to be so attractive
Iron blooded orphans seems like a shoe in for this series
Meanwhile, Atlas is hoping to tomato Io. 

It's my headcanon that Virtue is super harsh on Tieria (since...the testing, when Things Happened That We Do Not Talk Of) while Nadleeh is way too lenient.
Hathaway & Xi ;_;
"Mr. Amuro, this was badass and so fun...but now I don't feel so good."

"It's OK Nu.  I don't feel good either."

:: Char and Sazabi in the background doing a similar fade away ::

"WHAT ABOUT US?!"

Nu & Amuro: "Dudes, you're interrupting our epic bromance moment. It's not all about you."
Xi isn't destroyed tho unless you're referring to the manga
I'm just imagining Wing haunting Heero in various places while he just actively ignores it.
These are all very cute
Holy crap they need to do one of shining gundam. He even dramatically left it behind while it was being piloted by his mechanic.

Wait, what is #5?? It looks like the freedom??
Zechs pic looks beautiful…

Rip big duck.
I'm surprised you didn't make anyone for the mobile suits that actually feel alive and sentient like the unicorns, aerial, turn A. Or that one scene of god Gundam holding shining Gundam in it's arms.
No Barbatos?
Where’s heero and his suicide gundam?
This too, is yaoi
I'd like to see one with Domon and Shining Gundam, too.
Isn't Tallgeese constantly rebuilt? Like isn't Tallgeese III just the world's coolest Frankenmech?
*Heero flat on his back, Wing Gundam staring at him with both a look of scorn and exasperation.*
I need every name of this in a list to understand the one i don't
Wing Gundam be looking at Heero like this... [https://tenor.com/search/hand-on-waist-gifs](https://tenor.com/search/hand-on-waist-gifs)
Would love to see a Hero, he would just be standing there with the detonator switch like " I'm going to blow you up now k".  Cue sound affect.
Wing: WAI--
Heero: Bye bye
lmao kira on here too many damn times
Damn, this is making me feel things.
Is that a hathaways flash spoiler??
I’m loving the Tallgeese and Miliardo one.
I am suprised there isn't a wing gundam joke here
*"Rest in peace, my admirable friend."*
Was half expecting one where hero is just killing his mobile suit and it crying as it is abused
Lotta Kira in there.
amuro and nu gundam's epic brofist
Did...Sandrock just push Quatre of the hill?
Imagine Wing sobbing into a pillow in the corner and heero is a dot on the other side of the frame
Considering how prevalent the Freedom and little Strike Rouge are in their artwork, those last couple ones really hurt.
Soooo... we just gonna ignore Heero casually shiving his Gundam. "If I can't have you, no one can!"
Gundam X where Garrod just sells his MS into the slave market.
No wing or Exia makes me kind of sad.
The little Rouge is so adorable
Anthrun: "Next Tuesday?"

His yet another Justice: "Next Tuesday."
...why is it I'm imagining Athrun in court with all the MS he self-destructed suing him in this kind of concept lol
These are amazing!
is that a fucking headstone
Whose art is this?
I feel nothing for Hathaway, he deserved it
Needs a series of this.. this reminds me of btx anime lol..
ohhh, nah, not Nu and Amuro going at the same time, mister stark they don't feel so good 😭
Which is picture 5?
Took me way too long to realize that was the Strike Rogue as the little girl in the 3rd pic.
Amuro got them chimpanzee arms
Rip Tallgeese, you the goat 😔✊🏽
Plutone must be very traumatized then. Not just horribly injuring her pilot, but even killing her friends as well
I think I might know what their favourite MS is.

Anyways, cool art
Where is domon and shining gundam?
Which one is number 5?
Bye bye
Tallgeese died like a champion also the coolest mobile suit
Would love to see ibo
This reminds me of Brigadoon anyone else remember that series?
Amuro is my favorite of these. Like "Thanks, and see you again."
It went from Gundam to NGE... Also, I think Titanfall 2 got this spin, BT practically was a kind of personality that helped the pilot, similar thing in Which from Mercury, so... I wouldn't be anything knew, but would be cool if it was more harsher, like, a pilot bounded to a machine that it's uncertain if it was alive, even better if it is some kind of a biocomputer, like the whisper ships in the Foundation.
These are amazing
Zechs saluting the Talgeese is my favorite one
Bravern moment.
The Strike Rouge at the end made me smile
My reaction shouldn't be, "I ship it," and yet, here I am.
a gundam series in the tune of Fate where its Servant and Master themed would be really nice
That Tallgeese one. Perfection.
Dunno who did it but they have a soul like noone in the fandom. And I know Gundam fandom well.
Is it freedom from 5-9
I don’t know why but for some reason I think of gundam sandrock having a female persona rather than male.
Who’s the artist??
This is beyond peak and I want so much more
Whats number 5
Is there a Barbatos art for this one?
Mika and Barbs going out in a blaze of glory
Mika and Barbatos: It is what it is...
This is amazing!
Need Heero taking a tire iron to the Wing Gundam. Or vice versa.
That is such a cool thing I need to see a heck of a lot more of these damn! But yeah can you think of the emotions like even if you don’t see it well but like when these mobile suits that the pro tags have relied on for everything finally get bested or by a lucky shot  just think about what goes through their head when it gets badly damaged and things
Doesnt put barbatos pisses me off
Now i want to see barbatos, gusion, and ryusei go gundam human forms
*suddenly got Vietnam flashback but it's between Eclipse Gundam and Tatsumi almost dying together*
What happened to mikazuki
Sad I don't see G Gundam in here. I think that was the most emotional I got about a destroyed Gundam lmao
Wasn’t it Penelope that got defeated?
Couldn't stand Heero but I loved that Gundam
Why are there no characters of color?....

BANDAI! MAKE A SERIES ABOUT SENTIENT MS AND MY LIFE IS YOURS
We'd get to see Virtue berating Nadleeh for being too lenient on Tieria. 

Virtue: I'm telling you, he's a mess. 

Nadleeh: Oh, come on…that's too harsh. Tieria tries his best! 

Virtue: That makes it worse! What kind of pilot tries his best and still fails so much?! 

Nadleeh: He's just very young! Stepped out of his pod five years ago, don't forget...

Virtue: Oh, trust me. I don't forget. His pod malfunctioned, and that's the truth.

Nadleeh: It did not! Tieria is perfectly functional. He just...gets upset.

Virtue: Stupid idiot, that's what he is.

Nadleeh: If you gave him a shot-

Virtue: I gave him a shot! And look what he did, at the testing! 

Nadleeh: Tieria is very sorry for that...you know that! 

Virtue: Cool, cool. I bet he'll be very sorry when he gets all killed. As he absolutely will.

Nadleeh: Veda picked him! Hixar confirmed it! Tieria is our Meister and that's that.

Virtue: Well. What if we replace him with Regene?

Nadleeh: Are you out of your mind?! 

Virtue: Just hear me out on this. Same type, right? So no need to make any major adjustments. Smarter, more efficient and functional type 0988. 

Nadleeh: Again, Veda picked Tieria for a reason!

Virtue: And what reason would that be?

Nadleeh: Well- I mean- 

Virtue: I rest my case.
Right? We already have loads of Gundam waifus. Time for Gundam husbandos.
Just imagine the yaoi that would spin off from that.
That's an abusive relationship
He'd do that for Wing. Wing Zero, Mercurius and those two Leos were given way more care from him than Wing ever did. Even Lady Une used sacrificed it just to move Treize out of the way of Libra's laser

"I can take on all of them."

"Both ways?"

"Yes."
On the other hand, he go and got 00 destroyed.
As is expected.
Sadly the author of the originals hasn't made one for Gramps (or maybe they did and I just haven't found it on their Twitter)
Aegis: Oi
To my memory, the most affectionate thing Heero ever said about Wing was "...that's *my* mobile suit" as he fired a couple of torpedoes at it, hoping to destroy it.

He then *actually* destroyed it later, in front of Zechs.

And *then* ran it into the ground again (after it was rebuilt) while tracking down Treize, before wordlessly getting out and abandoning it.

...Heero didn't like Wing very much.  Probably had something to do with the fact that it's primary weapon could only be fired three times.
Lmao I was thinking the exact same thing, especially Quatre and Sandrock gave me Hakuno and Red Saber vibes for some reason.

If Wing was self-aware, like Zero or Epyon, I have a feeling that it would've refused to open it's cockpit to Heero ever again after he gave up on it for the **third** time.
Ah yes, Athrun, the dude whose self destructed virtually every single MS he's ever piloted.
Also, temporarily Strike Rouge, from the same artist:

It looks like a knight
aw fuck, TB Perfect Gundam would be *horrifying*.
Uuuh is this a manga thing? I swear the Xi is not destroyed in the movie
I was gonna say “spoilers for later Hathaway movies lmao”
Yup, dead Freedom and sad Strike Rouge by his side
Technically Big Duck is the final Survivor of Endless Waltz. Ironically the first MS is the last MS standing till Frozen Teardrop.
I didn't make these. The guy named DTZ1200WG made them, and I haven't found art like these about other Gundams
Blaze of Glory during the Final Stand
Yeah but it still was destroyed at some point
Nah, Tallgeese is just surprisingly easy to manufacture.

Tallgeese II and III are new productions, Tallgeese Zhilong is just with the Long Clan for testing.

It really was just a matter of finding pilots for it. Kind of like the Shelby Cobra 427 or the GT40 MkII.
To be fair, the novel is more than 30 years old now.
Not surprising since the artist likes Freedom and Strike Rouge a lot.
There's another...

Freedom and smol Strike Rouge.
I can say the same thing about Gundam Stargazer, albeit more motherlike since one of her pilots is a woman whose her age is closer to 30 years old.
[here](https://x.com/dtz1200wg) OP’s source post got swallowed in the comments
The artist actually did the human form for one of them. Literally the first one you mentioned.

Although I wish I could see the artist's interpretation of humanized Stargazer, Astray frames, Hyperion, Dreadnought and Eclipse too.
I know what you are saying but once again Asians are also people of color.. so Kira Yamato exists. 


Really tired of Asians getting fucking shafted every time minorities are mentioned.
The artists just didn’t draw those characters
Is this not just the Brave Series?
I feel like at that point we're just *asking* for the transformers memes.
Titanfall 2
… and people hated Narrative
SD Gundam exists
SD Gundam Force says hello
SD gundam series:
>!wfm exists!<
Evangelion? Brain Power'd? G-Witch? Heck even IBO kinda hinted at it a little.
Gundam sd
*I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the yaoi fans would finally getting a win after the yuri ones gets theirs TBH...*
They flip each other off so its romantic instead somehow
Wing Zero didn't get completely disrespected like Wing did, but Heero still tried to *throw it into the sun* the second he thought he didn't need it anymore. Dude hates his Gundams lol
Twice.
making one for grandpa is too hard since one would be crying all the way
Justice: ...yeah

Infinite Justice: *smirks*
The one Rouge laying dead from that time Kira used it in a line of marching Rouges is sending me I'm sorry.
Wtf she got cooked 😭😭😭😭

too fucken adorable i'll take ten thousand of those.
So dreamy 💖
Can you imagine the identity crisis…?

“I am Perfect Gundam- so I must be a Gundam- wait, no, I am NOT a Gundam. Must KILL!!!! all Gundams. So must self-destruct as I’m Perfect Gundam- no wait, not a Gundam. My head hurts…what if I remove this V fin…”
The novel. >!Xi gets EMP'd and Hathaway is executed.!<
I haven't read the manga yet, but I've seen some *things* lol
Oh right, End of SEED
Didn't Kira trash the Strike Rouge getting the Strike Freedom in GSD?
I think zechs take it with him to mars so he can use it for mars colonization.
With a few transplants from Epyon for good measure.

Makes sense when you think about it though, look at the 'sons' that came from its lineage and all they accomplished. Makes sense that the OG would be Tonka Tough.
The Prototype Mobile suit that helped created the Wing Zero and the 5 Gundams lasted longer than its Successors.
1st to be created and last ti be destroyed 
Oh okay
True, but I didn't read it (yet), so it doesn't matter.
Oh man i want to see stargazer and strike noir!
Hummmmmmm.......no your rite, I'm sorry thank you for pointing that out
Speaking of, have you heard about this masterpiece of a film that unfortunately isn’t doing so well called transformers one?
It's just one sentient Gundam 
I want one that's slightly more serious and has human characters in it
More serious series
Eh, it's more of a human soul trapped in the machine trope than a thinking mobile suit that has to come to terms with the fact that it's a sentient weapon of war
||Wfm|| mentioned!!!!
We'd have a better chance with an Amuro x Char one. Living on as force ghosts
Tbf, that was all of the Wing boys when the series was finished (well, except Wufei lol)
I like to imagine that Wing Zero consented to that one, considering that Wing Zero took the effort to wake him up and tell him they were going for one last fight.

Really it's a shame someone had to rebuild Zero and slap a Deathscythe like color scheme on it.
Bro knows his role and the role of Gundams as tools for change
Wouldn't it be too gory too? The RX-78 lost its head, and both arms.
Stargazer: That's horrifying...
Savior: OOF
Damn now I’m excited to watch this story get told 
More like Seed Destiny since Kira had to go for the new Strike Freedom instead of old Freedom
It's from when Kira lost the fight with Shinn and Cagalli retrieved him in the Rouge.
Ironically, Epyon might actually predate Tallgeese.

Epyon and The Zero system seems to be heavily influenced by the Wyvern Mobile armor and the SAM system which is a 2 Headed Dragon MA that was used to save the Sanc Kingdom decades before Operation Meteor.
I’ve heard very good things about Transformers One. Unfortunately the trailers were crap, the advertising is almost non existent, and worse of all, we had a decade of dog shit transformers movies before it. 

So I’ll wait to see it. Maybe in the next 5 years or so.
 SD Gundam Force exists. Lmao
Gundam Sentinel?
Sentinel Gundam?
SD Gundam exists
I mean, in Wufei's case it's like an emotional crutch and constant PTSD charm what with his guilt over the death of his wife dude :/
TBF, the Wing Zero Rebellion  was not a "rebuild", and more so a "recreation".
Gramps didn't hear no bell. That's why the Last Shooting is legend.
Strike Noir: no shit.
Tbf, at least Savior wasn't self-destructed?
Yeah, but I think it’s like 7 and 8 that are more about the fight with impulse.
...huh, never made that connection before...

Though I was just talking about the parts from it that were salvaged and slapped onto Talgeese when they upgraded it to III
I may be heavily biased but it really is an amazing film, genuinely has heart wrenching moments and scenes
Watch it

# NOW

you'll see that the good things talked about it are right
and with to scale MS people
I'm not talking about Rebellion, I'm talking about Vingt Khushrenada's Black Wing Zero.

It's the same Proto Zero Quatre built that got destroyed when Trant Self Destructed that was rebuilt by Zechs using the Flugel and Wing Gundam's data, and was destroyed in Endless Waltz.

It's that Wing Zero, and it fought Warlock and was revealed to have the ability to Hijack Funnels.

It also fought Snow White but Snow White tanked a facial Twin Buster Rifle shot showing how heavily outclassed Wing Zero was by that point.
Eclipse Unit 1: *-chuckles-* I'm in danger.
That's the interesting bit.

Tallgeese II and III along with Epyon were already in Treize's plans by the time Oz was rolling out the Taurus.

Tallgeese III was already being finished and if Treize had a bit more time, he would have fought Epyon in it which means the Shield was not the same one that Epyon used at all.

Would make sense they used similar models however due to being designed by the same person.

Tallgeese II was a Tallgeese designed by Howard for Treize when Treize requested a Tallgeese for himself when he was younger.
...man, frozen teardrop sounds WILD.
Da fock is happening during Frozen Teardrop snd what's with the power scaling of Gundams?!?!
Kinda sad how the WZ that was by Heero’s side for a long time is now in the enemy’s hands
I knew the shield wasn't from Epyon, but I thought I read somewhere that the Heatrod had been salvaged along with some other things they incorporated (internal systems and armor if memory serves.

Though if Epyon predated Tallgeese itself then yeah, obviously it was around before the Taurus lol
FT is the worst GW fanfiction ever written. I'll die on this hill. It is the "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" of the Gundam series.
Nanomachines, Funnels, Holograms and more.
00 Happened. Ever notice Frozen Teardrop and SEED Freedom are compensating.
Wufei Brightslaps Vinght after defeating 3 Scorpio Mobile Dolls synced with the Zero system by using a technique where he turns the Zero system off and on.

Wufei basically calls Vinght a **ssy who doesn't measure up to Treize.

So if the translations I read back then are correct, Wing Zero just followed it's face-heel-face turn trajectory.
https://preview.redd.it/gsh5cbk8myud1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc51768743c7b18b48e1b6d8adc2de66e1ac9ccd

Not pictured here, but Aquarius also uses the same Heatrods.

Another thing to note, Treize had the Zero system courtesy of Zechs around 5 years before Operation Meteor. This is why he had access to the tech required to build Epyon.
So they finally added their own funnels.
Well planet defensors exist but different purpose
So they're almost leaning to the super robot genre. Almost.
While the rest of the gundam series are boasting how powerful their gundams are and how they reign supreme and superior.


Me as an IBO:
When will we get the rest of the 72 Gundam frame's actual design?
The Warlock's funnels are strong enough to destroy the TBR in one hit so it's stronger than Vayeate's mega Beam Cannon too.
I can't see this happening
Ngl the demons can just put on sunscreen to go out in the sun. Just steal it from a kid st night

Comic Con Zaku cosplay
Another con, another opportunity to cosplay as a Zaku!  I also got the opportunity to walk down the showcase catwalk!  
Credits: the suit was created by a very talented team of professionals in Hong Kong.  I provided the appropriate model, color templates, and ensured that the relative size/placement of each suit component was correct.

My contributions: I created the heat hawk and machine gun from foam whereas the heat dagger was from 3D printing.  I replaced the original horn with a more modern one (3D printed) and redid almost all of the strapping to better fit me (though more work needs to be done still!).

Hope you enjoyed this :).  Seig Zeon!
What are the odds of running into a random Mandalorian cosplayer with the same color scheme?
Where's your buddies? You can't do the Jet Stream Attack alone
Dude, that looks so badass! I LOVE IT!
OOH MY GOD!!!!!!!! 👴🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Absolutely Amazing! This deserves the badass seal of approval!
Zig Zeon!
That’s is one of the best Cosplays I have ever seen. It’s just so cool and creative!
Awesome!! 👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥
I saw you around at Otakon! The suit’s freaking incredible man!!!
WTF!? This is way too good. If I **had** to criticize maybe thighs could be a few cms longer.
Oh my gosh I took a picture with you! Lol very cool, your cosplay was far and away one of the highlights of my day.
That's no Zaku boy... Oh that is a Zaku
This is no Zaku boy, no…oh wait actually it is a zaku sorry
[deleted]
Bangerrr!!!!
How much will it cost to buy a suit like that
Nice love the colours
Alright, this is peak Zaku
This look heavy and hot to walk around in all day
How is the mono eye built? It looks nicer than the one I use on my Char's Zaku II helmet (electroluminescent panel)
Not enough waterslides





/s (upvoted, great job)
Wow! That's awesome! Just watch out for that Stat Puft Marshmallow Man... He gets messy.
Honestly the coolest cosplay I've ever seen
Hey, I think I saw you at Otakon this summer! Absolute 10/10 cosplay
Had me confused with the colors for a sec there but I love it
🔥I love you for this!! 🔥
Damn its very good ! 
Sieg Zeon to you !
Holy shit that’s detailed.
That is fantastic! a black tri-star Zaku right? That is incredible.
Help I thought that was shockwave 😭
My brothers saw this exact cosplay at Otacon
Ya like jazz?
Yooooo Black TriStar Zaku2
I thought it was a Rik-Dom at first!  Damn, that's good!
THATS SICK
This is frikkin sick - amazing cosplay!!!
Wonderful!
Oh damn I remember seeing one of your old posts, the zaku cosplay still looks sick!
Seig Zeon
My absolute favorite zaku cosplay, the proportions are perfect.
It looks amazing
That's bloody amazing !!!
"Ortega! Mash! We are gonna do a Jet Stream Attack on that there Comic-con!"
I approve of this cos play. It's wonderful!
Now all you need is a picture with a Dom cosplayer
Dope suit, also the Alphonse cosplay goes hard
Loved seeing this at Baltimore Comic Con! Hope you had a great time!
Holy Fuk that's insane
Nicely done. Very well proportioned and very MG 2.0 like. Would not mind the Gundam origin version upper thighs though.

Imo much better looking than the recent dumb Guinness record breaking pgu costume paid to be built by Bandai. Not surprised knowing that the gunpla culture in HK has been historically more flourished than from the states side.
How much did you pay for the service?
When you're in Baltimore, pretty likely actually haha.  Purple is the color of Ravens (our football team), and I picked the Tri-Star and classic weapon color schemes for this reason.  Marylanders are also a cult when it comes to our state flag.  :)
Yeah, the cosplayer must be really Dom
zig Zeon tho
Thank you!
I actually tried doing this, but needed to shorten it back as the longer add-ons kept hitting the front and back of the lower leg armor when I was moving.
I'm so happy to hear that!
That's no Zaku boy, it's a Zaku man
I needed to alter the helmet and chest piece a fair bit to add holes throughout the armor so it would be more breathable.  I still sweat a fair bit, but can actually wear the suit for several hours non stop (with frequent hydration of course!)
It's just a regular white light with a red filter over it
Thank you :)
I'll message you
i feel dumb didnt even read the big giant baltimore sign behind you
Next you’ll say you love Old Bay
I've heard of the Marylandorian, as well as Lady Mary Land
>Thank you!

You're welcome!
It's one thing to see stuff like this online, but in person it was a whole different beast, especially as a huge fan of Gundam!
It's a dope cosplay now I want a OO-Quanta
I would also like to know! And how you were able to guarantee the suit's parts would be scaled to fit you properly.
Also interested in this
I put Old Bay on everything ;)
I third this, I must know I wanna complain as a sinanju
They asked for a lot of measurements to ensure that it'll fit
I'm interested to know how much this cosplay cost
The costume is made by a company called Joe's toys if I remember correctly and it costs like 2000-3000 usd
Why are there hardly any female Demon Slayers?
I know there’s Mitsuri, Shinobu, Kanao and Aoi, but since the Hashira Training started, I haven’t seen one female participant

Douma just eats them all
It takes place in 1920's Japan⚡
Women back then were kind of just cooped up at home so they didn’t have many encounters with demons so there was definitely much less female to male slayers. There are also many more female Kakushi to male Kakushi so maybe the women just play different roles on the battle field compared to the men 🤷‍♂️
Funny thing,Ozaki(the girl on the picture) is the only female slayer demon slayer in the series thats not a Hashira or connected to the Butterfly Mansion

But anyways i do remember in a databook or something(?,not sure) about Obanai it said that he resented most female slayers since they had a "weaker mentality" or something of the sort. And while typing that i realised how incredibly funny it would be to imagine Obanai having beef whit a 14-15 year old girl thats scared for her life which would be really in character for him.
I mean in taisho era Japan women weren’t exactly raised being call strong and brave and being told they could be a warrior one day. So I imagine only the bravest of women would take up warrior work
They're hiding from zenitsu
Because all the skilled females went to Gensokyo 40 years before the show happened 





(This is a joke by the way based on a Touhou/Demon Slayer crossover timeline I made when I was bored one day)
THATS WHAT I’M WONDERING. Since the fight with Rui, I haven’t seen one girl slayer aside from the ones mentioned. And the female kakushi don’t count
The author wants you to be into tall muscular half naked men flexing
Generally, men are the ones to take up fighting jobs as providers, not to say that women can't it's just that fewer women are willing to, especially with the patriarchal society of the early 20th century
everyone is thinking of social and biological reasons but we know in anime there are plenty of strong females (protaganists or otherwise) no matter the time period. I think it's simply because the author wanted to draw more muscles to depict how physically strong and fit demon slayers are
I know we're aiming for an in-story answer, but the real reason is that probable male fodder characters are easier to draw (shorter hair, less features).
Douma eats them 

It takes place between 1910 and 1920
Douma
Nezuko, Shinobu, Mitsuri, Kanao, Aoi, Caterpillar sisters, Tengen’s wives, Daki, and Nakime:

![gif](giphy|kqJt1cSSN0DrwwMmY5|downsized)
Douma 🤣
because they just didn't want to do it
Demon slayer is set in the tashio era of Japan taking place in the early 1900 to mid 1920’s. Considering this was when Japan just started to open their borders much of the way of life was still very traditional. Mitsuri whole character is based on her not fitting the ideals of what a typical Japanese women  in that time period is supposed to be and learning to overcome it. I think they’re are female demon slayers but considering that society still expected women to be the primary caretakers of the home. I don’t think many women stayed or participated in the corps for long. Also there are multiple support roles in the demon slayer corps outside of slayers. We see it with the wisteria houses and the clean up crew which was shown to have a lot of female members. Also I think it was slightly touched upon that to demons women were way more nutritious compared to men due to yk reproductive system etc
Tbh the whole "women are biologically weaker than men" is typically a weak argument when talking about fictional shows, especially when you have exceptions like mitsuri and it takes place in a fantasy world where you can be so flexible you can shuffle out your organs. however the fact that the author has set things in the Tashio era Japan and has kept most the women's jobs in demon slayer accurate to they times, we dive a little into women's roles of they times in season 2 with Tengan's 3 wives and how women live in the Red light district, it's clear the author wanted to make her story more accurate to the times not some shallow as "girls no strong, girls no allowed" so while Demon slayer is a fantasy show the author wanted to try and keep it historically accurate.
If they don't have a personal kemono or a unique hairstyle, they are fodder according to demon slayer
They have smaller lungs which makes it harder to use breathing techniques and less muscle mass
1920s.
Since this takes place in 1920’s Japan (Taisho Era), women are expected to stay at home, cook for the children, actually, cook for everyone. Yknow? Like the “Get back to the kitchen” slander. It was not common to see a woman fighting supernatural beings rather than cooking omeletes for their (arranged (forced)) husbands or children.
Mfers talking about history and biology. It's an anime. It was simply the author's wish not to include many women slayers. It's that simple.
Ive been asking that Exact same question, like in the Hashira Training Arc, I haven’t seen a Single Female Demon Slayer
Honestly it’s probably because they all get snatched by demons. Or get targeted in particular
Maybe they taste better so all of them get targeted to be eaten
i believe it’s because during the time that demon slayer was set in, women usually preferred to stay at home and tend to the family and stuff (?)
Most of them are the doctors iirc, I know they have an actual name but I can't remember it for the life of me. Basically they work at butterfly mansion and clean up what's left after the slayers kill a demon I think.

Plus given that it's set in 1910 / 1920s Japan, most women were probably at home.

Or maybe doma just ate them all.
Because females belong to the kitchen*

*in that era.
I feel as if Mitsuri should've personally trained female prospects in flexibility, agility, perhaps even diet. Don't think they would've endured Tengen's merciless training.
The story takes place in 1920s Japan in the fact there are any female Demon Slayers is a plot miracle given how 99% of soldiers would be male and how prevalent, popular, and reinforced traditional gender roles were
They live in older japan

Even if you think about modern military there are simply more men than women. This is due to just biological wiring and advantages.

Not saying women cant be warrior and soldiers just much harder for them to hit the standard due to biological disadvantages.
Women tend to be physically weaker, so less are fighting. Pretty universal, since forever, there are much less than men in wars and the like.
because most Shonen are like that sadly
because women biologically tend to be weaker ON AN AVERAGE compared to men.

I mean there are women particularly strong and intelligent {mitsuri and shinobu} in hashira roles.

p.s come on we already have male and female sport category for a reason, and its not sexism .

yes taisho era is sexist but this is NOT BASED ON JAPANESE TAISHO ERA. there are no demons in realm japan
Because women tend to be physically weaker and don't make as good a soldier as men. The only female pillars are Shinobu, who is stated to be the weakest of the bunch and she hates herself for how weak and frail her body is, and Mitsuri, who has an "anime disease" mutliplying her muscle density and making her much stronger physically than any other human in the show. Also, this is 1920 japan and women at the time weren't exactly known for enrolling en masse into the army (not like it has changed today lol), a part of Mitsuri's backstory literally adresses how she felt out of place in the corps at first. And supposing a woman decided to become a demon slayer anyway, she would have a lower life expectancy than her male counterpart, since as I stated before they would be less effective fighters and would be more likely to die while fighting demons, unless they were prodigies like Kanao, or cowards like Aoi, who spent her entire career in the corps doing cooking and laundry.
Timeline
Women are naturally weaker bruh
I feel like it’s obvious, women are more targeted and less physically fit to fight demons, mitsuri being the one and only exception
Probably the same reason Shinobu is unable to decapitate a high level demon despite being a Hashira; physiological handicap

There are girls that possess the necessary strength (Mitsuri could probably arm wrestle any male slayer and win, even give Gyomei a challenge) but the average strength difference means boys are more likely to be able to deal a killing blow and survive fighting a demon.
If resources for workarounds were more available, as they are to Shinobu, then there would be far more slayers surviving in general, both male and female. There are also males who cannot master the necessary techniques of breathing to decapitate that rely on workarounds and alternative means, such as ninjutsu, American breathing and other tricks
In season 2 the show basically told you with Tengens wives. The women can't compete with men physically so they need to resort to other methods to fight like poison. Mitsuri is the big outlier here but she is an abnormality. Also Kanao I guess 
I feel like they all have been taught to either stay away from demons because the demons usually prey on women to get stronger and another reason is because at this time since it was the 1910s-1930s women were made to A work in the house and work for the husband or have kids, normal house wife stuff at the time. or B most women at the time were made to feel less then a man so most women stayed in the house.
Because similar to Mitsuri a man never wanted to date her because she was strong and thought for herself 
She wasn’t considered house wife material that’s why there Aren’t a lot of female demon slayer, because they were preyed on or eaten or the woman were made to be "normal" house wives in
https://preview.redd.it/65mwi20tmn5d1.jpeg?width=3818&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4f6a32506e8bfbd7881504c4aa428df0a79582f
Because none of those useless ass demons killed Douma as a human when they had the chance 🙄
thats a really silly question considering the era and country the story takes place in....I'm surprised there are ANY female slayers
And the female slayers who weren't as gifted as Shinobu or Mitsuri were most probably eaten off by demons, by Douma in particular. As we know, females provide more nutrition to demons when consumed than a man or child.
They wanted to do group bath scenes.
Douma eated them all
The percentage of female Slayers is still higher than today's percentage of women in every armforce in the world combined
Demon Slayer is set during Japan's Taishō Period. Which is about 1912 to 1926 some what in ww1 Woman till WW2 were highly prevented to join army or any kind of dangerous job. Demon slayer corps is basically an army. 
Along with the fact that most demon slayer know about that corps because they found it when wondering through a forest or something searching for a job young womans (about 18-21) at that time were much more busy doing households 
Social structure kinda like this:
Got a boy? 
> train him
> tell him go find a job
Got a girl ?
> make her look beautiful 
> make her marry to a rich guy
So their much more young mens were available for certain jobs especially deadly jobs.
Because the writer sucks at writing women
In my opinion is because of how dangerous it was for women in general en 1920, let alone if you aren’t as gifted as Mitsuri or Shinobu, they are figthing demons it isn’t really something many are exited about let alone women who for years have been house wife’s because of the era they where born in.
Just remember, the author is a woman.
It's kinda like asking why aren't there any black people, it's the early 20th century and Japan was rly traditionalist at the time, we can understand this by Mitsuri's backstory too.
Because women are mostly weaker
Its a product of the period. The women you even mention are exceptions to the norm. 

Mitsuri was so unsightly as a marriage prospect due to her immense strength, she became a hashira to find a husband. 

And Shinobu, kanao, and Aoi were raised by a female hashira who would routinely find and save women that society failed. 

The majority of society for much if the series didnt even *know* demons existed and those that did would much rather raise families than put their own lives at risk.
It’s a shounen anime so it’s aimed at teenage boys and any women that do show up are likeable for that demographic.
For me the most obvious explanation is that the time in which things are set were somewhat sexist, and since a demon hunter is somewhat "male" it is not surprising that there are not so many women
Same reason why soldiers are mostly men. The average woman is physically weaker than the average man, and most women can't keep their cool in stressful situations. In addition, the manga/anime is set in the early twentieth century in a country that has recently transitioned from feudalism to capitalism.
I guess it's really just because females are biologically weaker than men, so statistically it has to be like that, that's it.
Cause demon slayer takes place in the taisho era and maybe the author likes drawing attractive guys
Doylist answer: it's a shonen manga aimed at adult or teenage males so they have more male characters for the audience to identify with.

Watsonian answer: it's set in the 1910s/1920s so sexism was unfortunately rampant meaning most women were probably turned away.
Well, the main reason might because it’s the 1920s. Not to sound misogynistic, but women typically were expected to stay at home and raise children. Not that there weren’t clearly exceptions, but I’m sure most of the Demon Slayer Corp were recruited after they experienced some kind of Demon attack in their lives and young girls were typically weaker or were the main target of the Demons, giving them lesser odds of surviving the initial attack to become Slayers. Even Shinobu acknowledges she’s weak compared to the other Hashira due to her inability to behead Demons and had to invent a new way of killing them to even stand a chance.
There are female demon slayers as support roles, but I wouldn't blame any female member of the corps for wanting to avoid the front lines
I know we're aiming for an "in-store" answer, but the reason it's they're probably easier to draw (shorter hair, less features)
Same reason they’re hardly in most military positions probably, idk I don’t think there is a lore reason I’m just making guesses
Because theyre female, it's not a secret that the demon Slayer goes through hellish training.
Some may have been in the Kakushi division, along with Goto.
Alright, strap down and give me a 20... Thousand. Lol

On a real note? Its probably a case of the author doing a bit of a realism set piece on how hard women have in the corps as a whole.

Like, apart from an incredible drive required to surmount the basic difference in strength, would anyone really place much stock into a slayer that is practically disabled for 2-5 days every month?

This is my headcannon at least on why there aren't very many high ranked women slayers or just lower ranked women slayers in general, work that isnt as intensive is better suited for them thus they have clearly formed the majority of the recovery service members even on screen.
Everyone is commenting about biological and historical reasons but really, when we think about it, at the end of the day it is a shounen manga with little to no fanservice (apart from mitsuri’s shenanigans and daki) so naturally most of the characters are going to be male. Also even if it was targeted at a more female demographic it would probably still be more “male centric” since in Japan women tend to prefer male characters (like in bungo stray dogs). That being said I miss a strong willed muscle mommy like Mereoleona in the hashiras…
the time period that it takes place in was one where women weren't seen as fighters and they were physically weaker. While there are female slayers most of them are outclassed by the male slayers because men are genetically designed to be stronger.
real
Cause
Shonen genre
It’s cause they all die at the final selection cause they’re weak
Unpopular opinion

In the tashio era. My best guess is that it is rare because given tradition, Swordsman Ship is something a man should master and woman not

But that doesn't mean a woman can't fight. I mean, there are great examples like Shinobu

In short, they're rare, but that doesn't stop em in the demon slayer corp
I’ve been wondering about Female Slayers Too
I don’t think Aoi is a Demon Slayer. She just helps out at butterfly mansion
Lack of physical strength and family-rearing responsibilities.
Because we are products of our culture
I don't think I wanna say what a demon might do to female demon slayers, so just look up goblin slayer.
Maybe doma ate them
I dunno
Cos doma gets to them and eats them first?
Because this is set on Taisho era but! Even in this time period their are still some female demon slayers as we know but if talk about sengoku era there would be literally 0 female members and Hashira is out of question
Because women are weaker in reality and author as a woman knows that
Women are generally weaker so probably they got killed.......
Because they're normally easier to prey on cause they're weaker.
I think I actually read somewhere that women have more nutritional value to demons.
There’s 2 possible reasons in my opinion, 

1. Women were too weak to be demon slayers, as it was the 1910s

2. Demons ate women more than men, as they are supposedly more nutritious
The women may die easier and be more likely to be targeted first by demons because they are weaker. “Not to be sexist or rude”
Cuz they weak, my main issue is why they all so young🤨
Demon Slayer takes place in a time where women were expected to stay home. It also takes place during world War 1. As we saw by Muzan's fits, Japan was adopting western ideas.

There was also a time we're Samurai could write letters to cowboys... so that also adds to the idea.

Also, The Demon Slayer Corps were a secret organization unknown to the government. They were basically the Men in Black, but on their own.  So it's was either found by accident, the Hashira/ slayers found you first bcs of a demon attack, or you were a part of it from the beginning. 

And since women stayed home: less chances to find/ join the Corps, or being so weak, they're cooked as soon as a demon breathes in a mile radius.

Even Tengen's wives, despite being pretty formidable even if they're not slayers, were scene in the new eps acting like  usual SAH wives.
1. females are biologically weaker 

2. 1920s japanese culture

3. douma
It doesn't have to be equal for everything all the time does it? 

Does every man and every woman have to be represented in every form of art to an equal measure?

*Upper 2 Demon would like to know their location*
Because men are stronger, end of conversation
The Patriarchy
Timeline wise: 1920. A lot of women wouldn't be fighters as much. 

Biological wise: men are stronger than women. Plus, only the best of the best men became hashira. Shinbou and misturi are only exprctation because shinbou is super smart and intelligent.  They didn't make her hashira because of her strength.
Misturi is basically flexible, dude. Her bone density and muscle phyiscal close to a man, and then women .

Censorship wise: people more ok with guys getting cut up then girls. 

Can they add more women? Sure, it's a make-believe show. However, the creator wants to make the hashira a little bit realistic . Even the breath technique is fake.
Feminist has entered the chat
Stupid ass question. Why are there relatively few female soldiers on the frontlines even today?
Blame Douma.
Same reason as why there are not many women in Military. Women in general are not as physically gifted as their male counterparts.
the same reason there are barely any female blackbelts in martial arts.  the amount of dedication strength and  resilience it takes is something not a lot of women can manage
Women are weak
![gif](giphy|I6n8YSKRIJqPwGll4n|downsized)
Because in demon slayer woman have more nutrients for demons and are probably hunted by demons more and that's why
Because anime boobs flop around too much and would hit them in the face during these moves
If you're looking for a realistic answer, it's because women physically can not compete with men. You will obviously always have outliers and exceptional women but they are not the norm.
Because there all kitchen breathers
Because women think of a Pikachu when demons are mentioned. 

“It’s a forest spirit!” 

How many times has this been said in an obvious anime death flag moment.

Jk, I’d imagine it had to do with Japanese culture. I can’t remember the exact name but in Heian-Edo era Japan in most villages there would be a group of rice threshing women who, if they were needed to “defend the portcullis” would be called upon by the local lords because they were strong and knew how to use a scythe/Naginata type weapon. It’s not either of those but I remember the artwork we were shown of it in college and I thought it was pretty cool. 

Mounted Samurai were known to fear these groups of women because of their weapons ease at dismounting a rider.
Simple, most woman aren’t as strong as men. Mitsuri is unusually strong and Shinobu uses a special weapon because she isn’t strong enough to wield a big weapon.
I mean, look at modern day dangerous jobs. 9% of firefighters are female, 14.2% police officers, 16.6% of wrestlers. So, it's the same reasons as why there's not many women in those professions, PLUS the fact it's taisho era Japan, and women are told to be home makers, and fighting probably isn't a "proper womanly activity"

As a girl, I would also not want to be a demon slayer lol. I feel like from my personal experience, woman tend to just have more propensity for survival? Like, I just see men do way more risky things, and it's proven men just engage in more risky behavior than women. There's plently of women out there whod take up the sword, but I've found women are generally less willing to put themselves in situations that can cost them their lives. I know i wouldn't.
Probably societal stuff
I have two theories.

1. Women are biologically weaker than men, as men are naturally built for survival, so it must've been harder for women to become a demon slayer at all.

2. The producers went with the idea of a traditional wife, and that's why there's not many female demon slayers.
Women are weaker than men.


Swords take strength to use for what they need to use them for
Because this is a story directed towards young men/ boys not women. 

Sorry if that hurts your feelings but that’s just how boys manga is most of the time even now there are few main stream action/ Shonen manga that feature many women main cast/ back ground just in general. 

Also the period that demon slayer takes place in realistically wouldn’t really have many women in combat situations just like how women weren’t in combat in modern day until very recently, just a primitive way of thinking I suppose but very time accurate if that’s the head cannon you support.
Douma ate them to extinction
Because most of the female characters are already dead and consumed by demons in the first place. Demons are known to eat a lot of women and children because of their nutritional value, so they would prey on women and children more than men. I hardly remember demons any men except for shoichi’s brother who has a marechi blood.
Because demon like doma exist
Them demons do look kinda rapey.
Its takes place in the 1900s, use common sense
we  obviously know that there is no electronics but there are trains and clocks so it's most likely taken place from 1910's and lower and there are no wars too
I'm going to give a Doylist answer and just say easier to draw male Demon Slayers then female. Or maybe during the training arc there's more female demon slayers in the background.
I'm not sure but very few women have been depicted as wrathful enough to be a solid slayer. People like Shinobu and Sanemi bear a deep seated unshakable resentment to muzan and demons for the deaths of their loved ones. That type of deeply rooted hatred from losing your family is needed to become a slayer in most cases unless you're born into a slayer family, and as we saw with Tanjiro, muichiro, and rengoku's families just seem to have had more boys.

There's also the real chance that like we saw with Kanao, poor families that would be more commonly attacked by demons just because there are more of them, would sell their daughters off to brothels or private buyers like we saw in the entertainment district.
Because all of them are all busy being subjugated.
In 1920’s Japan, women were more traditional, which meant hardly any of them even thought about fighting in the first place.
Well seriously bro the story demon slayer was set in year 1910-30 and in that time there were no such a women have no particular independence and feminism didn't exist and that era and that was a good thing they have to spend less resources in such a liability of women and maybe the manga artist have added them to attracts more audience just as normal script writer or bro don't want to be canceled and according to me he have to include only few female characters like Matsuri,  Shinobu and her adopted sisters in demon slayer unit not in even hashiras Matsuri is a exception because of her strength and Nezuko is a demon so she don't have silly issues like other girls and well well well she is not a demon slayer after all and now I'm going to be canceled.
most likely if you wanted to get any job in japan that paid alot. demon slayer def wasn't one of the first opinions and their is much safer-ish work.
Due to the era of the time
While true, 2 of all the Hashira are female…
Skill issue
[deleted]
I mean, women in general are physically weaker and in a fight against literal superhumans and monsters every last bit of strenght counts. Its likely that they get picked off much easier than their male counterparts unless they have some sort of gimmick (like poisoned blade for example) and there's just less of them in the first place as it tends to be in irl militaries.
isn't it set back in really misogynistic times? so it's probably something to do with that
We all know the messages are going to be deletet in a matter of seconds.
Douma
Just Douma having a big lunch, normal as usual🥰
i think its just that we dont see them. like i get that thats the only view we have into the world of demon slayer but i still dont think there are hardly any female demon slayers in the grand scheme of things. if there can be female hashiras, theres probably many female demon slayers too, just not ones that we see.
THANK YOU I was thinking the exact same thing earlier today and was wondering if I should start a thread.
Bcz it's a good show
Because Anime Community always creates hentai mangas on them always disrespect them and s*xual objectification of them defaming the women's image.
cause… women
Well I mean, it's the Taisho era so women were not seen as warriours, the misogynistic society likely doesn't give women many chances to do something like join the Demons Slayer Corps especially since that's already difficult.
No clue
Because it's not a waifu fanservice anime...
Because it's taishou era Japan, when woman were mainly meant to be housewives
Author choice to be honest :3
It takes place in the 1920s
It's not a female oriented role just like a lot of labor combat sport fighting and military positions are mainly male no matter the time period.
1920’s Japan. Women inequality🐍
I don’t think it’s that deep. It’s a Shonen manga so by default that means you’re not gonna see that many women.
Real question is why are there no Black demon slayers? So strange for such a mainstream show to lack inclusivity.
Who'll be in the kitchen then?
I'm pretty upset about this, even though it's somewhat realistic for the time period. It's just that out of all the realistic elements in this unrealistic show, why did the lack of women fighters have to be one of them.
They only wanted to make one generic hunter body instead of two. Just saves ressources.
Adding more female characters will just makes This show a trash since demon slayer have barley any story and on the other hand its a SHONEN ANIME!

Its 1920s Japan with strict social norms and women are physically weaker than men. In breathing alone, female lungs are 10 times smaller than male ones.

Mitsuri is just the exception and Shinobu uses poison for a reason
1920’s Japan is why
Because they have Zenitsu
I love how one of the reply sections turned into a whole debate on feminism and biology
Dang it, this is how it starts. Just look at what happened to Star Wars.
The writers don’t want us getting too horny
In the story they state you have to be incredibly physically strong to decapitate a demon (the only way to kill them).

Mitsuri is unusually larger and stronger than your average woman, with an unusually large appetite to boot. She is an outlier and a representation of exceptionally strong women who can go toe to toe with the men, but in this case, demons. 

Shinobu is physically unable to decapitate a demon, but she is an hashira because of her intelligence and speed. Her katana is actually a giant syringe and her speed allows her to be quick enough to inject demons with poison. 

Given this is the Taisho Era (1912-1926) the progressive and liberal society we live in today where women are free from the restrictions of *just* domestic duties hasn’t taken hold yet. Therefore men take on wartime, hunting and protective roles while woman take on care-giving roles due to our child-bearing nature. So women in military positions were far fewer and in between. The show shows most female demon slayers taking on administrative leadership/care-giving/hospitality roles, which is more accurate to the actual role a female would play. 

However, the show would suck if there was no female hashira (I am a feminist) and since there is always those few exceptions in a society we have our two beautiful and lovely female hashiras. 

I will say in most anime’s, they do not make any limit or distinction to male and female biological strength, with many females being considered “the strongest humanity has to offer” in MANY different shows. However, I think demon slayer tries to keep some historical and cultural accuracy despite being entirely fictional.
Men are psychologically and phisically built for battles in previous eras. Hell, we even have that fantasy of dying protecting those we care about or sacrificing ourselves for greater good. Women on the other side aren't just usually romanticizing death but life since they want to take care of those under them, while still being alive.
You making this post has brought the armchair biology experts out in force.
Japan in the 1910s and 1920s like most countries. Then and even today was a patriarchy. Women's place was in the house and that's why there are very few women to be demon slayers.
Shitty profession, women tend to be smarter about not dying
I dunno look at history maybe
Men are better suited for the job, stronger, faster, more physically capable
Given how unknown the slayer corps are to the wider public, chances are the most slayers come from families who have history with the corps or demons, as a result the selections of humans that can become slayers is small, pair that with sexism, biology and the dangers of the job there is probably some stigma about women being trained and instead their roles are to stay away from the front lines and focus on helping in other ways such as medics, messengers and other stuff aswell as most importantly having children. 

Slayers are always dying, so it's probably very important that babies are being born all the time for the purpose being trained from a young age to replace the dead slayer. Otherwise the corps with be diminished too fast if they were relying on cases like tanjiro just happening into becoming a slayer.
Their in kitchen acting like yoriichis wife, dead inside and out with a mini submarine life form them
Because they will seduce da demon

![gif](giphy|cM2CN5U99VVWdDGcSA)
They exist but most of the background character designs look like ops picture. Bland
It takes place in 1920s Japan, where women most of the time stuck to traditional roles instead of fighting or going on the battlefield. I’m not saying women can’t fight, they could and they can help out in the battlefield, but most women preferred not to and I don’t want to use the argument “women are biologically weaker than men” since even if they’re weaker, they can contribute somehow in fights and as a warrior. Overall, the author wanted to keep it accurate to that period of time
yeah it’s kinda weird! but there is also a looootttt of charcters with black hair and berely any other color
for the same reason military forces are mostly men
This is a task where strength and speed is required. Men are stronger and faster than women. Plus as other mentioned it’s another time. Things were different. 

We now have women in the police or military force mostly because we have guns.
In lore? Might be biologically since men are generally (pls don’t blow up my notifs) more physically gifted than women. I mean men evolved to be able to do physical stuff (hunting, fighting, lifting, etc). Women on average don’t have the same physical stats as men. Misturi and Shinobu are outliers and shouldn’t be taken as the norm. There’s reason why men have been the ones fighting wars for the entirety of human history. Again there are outliers (Boudica is a good example!). Anyway, Mitsuri has been shown to have been born (or at least developed) her strength. It’s unnatural for anyone else. While Shinobu is one of the fastest Hashira (might be below Tengen bc of ninja stuff). Shinobu also has to use poison since her body limits her strength. So to sum up, Shinobu and Mitsuri (and later Kanao) are all outliers. They’re gifted and shouldn’t be taken as the norm. 

However…men may just be easier to animate. I mean think of the isekai protagonists. They all look the same and are basically carbon copies of each other. Plus it might spark a lot of…art if there were an abundance of female slayers. Anyway, it might be convenience more than anything.
They’re in the kitchen
N-nezuko
Skill issue
Cus the majority of them would die
Women are weak.
Remember it’s the Taisho period. That’s 1912-1926. During this time anything remotely martial in nature was mainly male dominated.
Because women were evolutionarily designed to be caretakers, not warriors.
They should make one story of the First Demon Slayer Huntress... her backstory how she was killed.... Certainly was Douma who killed her...
Start of 20th century Japan. I won't say anything else
Historical reasons purely
1.) Shounen...

2.) The era. This is the early 1910-1920s Japan. There is a certain societal expectation for women and training to become a swordsman is not one of those expectations. Not to mention the Final Selection is essentially a suicide mission which not many would want their daughters training for.  

3.) As Shinobu demonstrates you need immense upper body strength to slice off stronger demons heads. Most women in the Demon Slayer universe don't have that. So they either need to be an exception like Mitsuri or use other methods like Shinobu.
It’s been a common string through the series that women have a stronger or sweeter blood.

Demons crave it more and this female demon slayers are probably targeted way more often.
I think the most basic and unfortunate answer is just… misogyny
I mean the time period was the 1920s, it was more egregious then (although as an American I won’t sit here and assume what Japan’s social culture was back then, ain’t my place-)
I feel like the animators sexualize female characters more so it’s harder to animate them. And men are more likely to become a demon slayers I guess cause most of the women in the verse are just not powerful enough to at least put up a fight against demons.
I ate them.
Probably the time period
![img](avatar_exp|177543072|fire)

True
Most get rsped
Maybe they have a secret area where they have them constantly popping out babies so they have more slayers
Should be logical right? Biology says females are weaker than men. Strong people are needed in the corps. You should be surprised that there even are females in the corps, which is solely to have some diversity. Realistically speaking there would be no single female in the corps.
The same logic as to why are there hardly any female in the military
Because they're smart enough not to deal with this shit
You people are embarrassing
Cuz women in that time were the most vulnerable 🤣 duh
1. Time period 
2. Men are more predisposed to grunt work combat than women
3. Author’s choice
4. More women would make the editors want the author to oversexualize them, and the author doesn’t want to do that (I think)
5. Douma
 It’s the time period.
because the writer is a coward? obviously theres no real societal reason seeing as how theres demons so realism isnt important.
Why is there lesser woman in the military /police / firemen in modern 2024. 

I belived that answer your question
I am SO relieved this comment section isn’t full of sexism. 
this is like asking why theres more male police officers than female police officers. the demon slayer corps is essentially a glorified police force.
Probably :
- the misoginy of the setting
- the amount of demons that tend to prioritize eating women
- the possibility that demon slayer families preventing their female members to join. 

Aside from that, there’s the matter of strength but it doesn’t really matter that much as strength isn’t the only factor that’s going to help you defeat a demon and, man or woman, you’ll always be at a disadvantage against one in that domain so…🤷‍♂️. But it’s not like there isn’t any, there’s just less of them.
Since the anime takes place during the 1910s, a time where gender roles were really enforced, I think that women themselves just believed that they didn’t need to be demon slayers and that they belonged in the kitchen while the men fight demons
It’s not truly stated why there aren’t many. But in this timeframe, there aren’t many because it’s not expected of them to become a swordsman or brawler of any kind. Women were expected to do house work and assist with farming and cooking. Therefore: Any female slayers seen are either out of coincidence or because they grew up in families where they are subjected to a life fitting for a male to be in. Though the Slayer Corps don’t have rules against volunteer females. This is my deduction as for this timeframe it makes a lot of sense. And a lot of women are picked off from Demons either because they’re incredibly nutritious than males and some demons are mentally twisted and specifically target women like Douma and the Swamp Demon did.
I think the leading reason was because at the time most women were stay at home wives
I was wondering It too!
I heard it's mostly because the action takes space somewhere in WW1 and in that time in Japan women were strongly believed to belong at home married with children, not out in the battlefield. You can see it even in mitsuri's backstory, she thought that as a girl she should stay at home and get married before becoming a demon slayer
Biology
It's a fuckin shonen
They be dying on the field first
Periods per off nahi demon slayer corps mein thats why and btw mitsuri flexible hogyi hai and she doesnt get bothered by it
Probably bc it was during a time where women were seen as just wives and nothing more
Most men are stronger then most feman shinobu is an example but she found a better way than just strength
I think it is because they were
A:eaten off because there are more nutrients in women for demons
B:There are lower ranked demon slayers, so they die quicker if they are not in groups (same with men, there are probably a lot of weaker male slayer, so not just wemon)
That's all I can really think of
Why are you expecting world building. This is demon Slayer lil bro
Men are stronger
why are there hardly any female construction workers or fencers?
They rare
I will assume douma takes a interest and eats them
Probably because of the time period
The show takes place during the Meiji restoration period, so your lucky to have ANY female demon slayers.
First of all it takes place in japan in the beginning of the 20th century, culturaly speaking jap women in these times do not fight. Secondly men are in major part physically stronger so they get a better chance at murking demons. Sure there are exceptions, but broadly speaking in any conflict all over time and over the world men are the ones fighting it just makes more sense
The same reason more men are in the military than women.
It's a shonen
E
Lore reason:  it's Japan in the early 1900s. Women weren't really doing anything. Most of the female characters were shown that our demon slayers physically aren't strong enough. 

Meta reason: Tengen has more than enough fingers to count how many anime have strong female characters that remain useful and important throughout the entire show.
The simps
because there weaker most of them are cannon fodder
Probably have the Shinobu problem. Too physically weak to cut off a head
Bc it doesn’t make sense to for women to be at the front lines. If women population collapses then humans would be doomed. How would make new babies
I also find it very odd why there is literally no female participant in the hashira training arc. If I remember correctly there were a few of them who fought and died in the spider mountain arc in s1. There were also some of them deployed at the start of the mugen train arc. I think its either just bad writing or the author forgot they existed. Even Kanao, a tsuguko should have been at the forefront of the hashira training.
what's her name?
In general, any reason that would apply to why there is more men in the military than women would probs apply here.
Prob cuz its in old japan.
okay more like why do they all have black hair
Probably because most girls get eaten by demons or something/ douma
There’s to answers the first being douma eating them and the second is it’s a shonen anime not to be rude but it translates to for boys and most boys would prefer to see more men in cool scenarios 
I cant tell if this is a meme and Douma be getting a feast
How it works





Douma inhaled all the woman in the universe the end
Most likely the same reason for why there hardly are any female soldiers today, if you compare it to males.
I mean the majority of soldiers are men because men are naturally physically stronger because of testosterone, so they’re kinda just being accurate
Women are generally weaker than men. If you have an army, you're going to want the strongest people. Obviously some women will be in your army but not close to the amount of men. I also wouldn't say sexism is the reason, there are female hashira.
Well yk, back then women weren't allowed to do much, and tbh I don't think most women -at that time- would withstand all the blood and death and the demons. I am not a sexist, please spare me
It’s the same reason shinobu couldn’t cut douma head. Not many women are as strong as mitsuri and can be on par strength with a demon.
The same reason. There are more men then women in the Military
Idk, ask biology
Coz Fake Feminism Always Ends during War
I guess that's true but it also depends on the training maybe? Like mitsuri, kanao, and Shinobu. There are other female corps members but they're with shinobu's healing/hospital part? But they are still considered part of the corps
Cause females are weak.  Shinobu is a hashira and can’t even cut a common demons neck 😂

Mitsuri is an exception cause she was born abnormally strong. Even so, she was the weakest link in the infinity arc
This is going to start world war 3 but i will say it again men are generally physically stronger than women
The answer is so simple, the author herself just doesn't want to have many female demon slayers😂
The demons in general mostly targeted women because many did not have combat or self defense training. Like a wolf picking off sheep.
Stay quiet or I’ll eat you also ✨

I love this idea 😭
Shinobu will stop it though
This answer is top notch
My dude is inhaling them
Or that women who aren’t as gifted as Shinobu and Mitsuri can’t compete in strength
it's really just physical strength difference, most males don't even pass final selection, so it must be even harder for girls
I wouldn't say that's why, there are female hashira. I don't think (or remember if;) Demon Slayer shows any sexism.
Fax
Oh yeah that’s good point
But women’s right and status in 1920s Japan was a MASSIVE improvement compared to Edo period.
Yeah that too, it’s clear that the men are generally just better for combat
Also women are naturally weaker than men.
There was one other female corps member

She was in episode 1 of season 2 (the anime-original one). She isn't credited anywhere; unamed and voice actor unknown. Or at least i can't find anything on her
Wonder what he'd think of zenitsu
>Obanai it said that he resented most female slayers since they had a "weaker mentality" or something

Obnai has a long history of some snake women torturing him or something so he started resenting women, if i am not wrong
Yes, they’d also have to be super trained and strong like mitsuri. But that was already a rare case
Nezuko punching the air rn
i honestly wouldn't even be surprised if this is canon
There was a female demon slayer in the Mugen train arc, she is seen with Rangoon at the (I dont know the name of the building so I'm taking a wild guess) train maintenance place

edit: it has been a month and I still didn't notice how I did rengoku dirty by making that typo
Aren’t the majority of slayers we see around 5.6/5.7?
They could've drawn women with muscles
Because it's a Shonen and the author probably didn't think too much about it.

It's like wondering why dbz is filled with dudes.

Anyone talking about biology or whatever are kinda just outing themselves lol 

This is a story about people doing super human feats by **breathing** fighting **demons**
Makes sense. Tbh I still can't get used to seeing Tanjiro so jacked when he has such a baby face 😅
Yeah i think so too, that’s the most logical of all answers here. It was also my initial thought when I watched it and wondered why. If they started drawing female characters they have to make all the males distinguishable aswell, which just costs time and money.
Happy cake day 🎉🎂
op already mentioned most of these, and in comparison to the male cast they /are/ quite few in numbers. + tengens wives arent demon slayers, theyre shinobi, and daki & nakime are demons 😭
Yeah am I a joke to you😤
He is inhaling all woman
We saw douma killing shinobus sister so it's probably safe to say douma ate all the strong girls
What about Mitsuri
Nezuko punching the air rn
Douma that you
No he inhaled them
The issue is that Mitsuri is even more physically abnormal. Im not sure she would have enough of a baseline to train normal women.
Don’t forget that the US military wouldn’t allow women in combat roles until 2015
Yeah, because it takes a penis and big muscle to pull the trigger on a gun /s
Baldjiro
Technically we have less muscle mass compared to men, if you want to be specific.

That being said, women’s muscles don’t tire as fast as men’s do. So what we lack in strength we make up for in endurance.
Idk why ur getting downvoted
Not only that, but demon slayers operate outside of society so whatever politics is going on outside of demon slaying doesn't really apply to them. So even if society is sexist, there's no reason for the demon slayers to follow suit. Plus Ubuyashiki doesn't seem like a particularly sexist person.
Don’t call Aoi a coward
Her disease isnt actually as fake as you’d think. Look up myostatin deficiency
Nezuko and Mitzuri punching the air
HMM HM HM HMUHH
HMMMMMMM
I would definitely agree with you and I really had high hopes for Kanao....but I feel like her whole character development was just dependent on Tanjiro to give her agency to which she lacks. Hell, even in the 178.5 vol 20 extras in the manga,  she gets motivated by the mention of Tanjiro. 

I like her and she is a good character, she at least had a bit of potential and appreciate it that she isn't a plot device like Nezuko but it feels like she was just written to be Tanjiro's love interest and to me she still felt underdeveloped even after the events of the final arc. 😓 

At this point I might as well say that Ochaco from mha feels more fleshed out and better written than Kanao.
Doesn't really make sense since there are two female Hashiras and Ubuyashiki seems like the last person who'd be sexist.
I don’t really think sexism is why at all because there were female demon slayers I think it’s just they didn’t really want to or never considered it plus what girls do you know (other than one that love demon slayer) would even want to do this so I don’t think that’s the reason and it’s factual that men are genetically born stronger and have bigger lungs for breathing techniques so that also probably is some of the reason
Either that or it takes place in 1920s Japan when all women were basically locked inside to cook…
She went through Final Selection, but she mentions she was too scared to go on the front lines, so she went to the butterfly mansion.
Lol ! he manga had already ended and nothing like this happened
If I had to guess, prolly cuz they’re in Japan and the anime was dated in the Taisho Era which  was 1879–1926, so you can probably fill in the blanks from there
It’s prob a sexist thing
Because it's Japan.

Men also benefit from training (for fighting) a lot more than women as it's easier for men to build mass which is necessary to be slicing off demon heads. Just look at how shredded Tanjiro is at his age. Also another point, Shinobu. It just so happens she compensated for her lack of strength in other ways and Mitsuru is a biological anomaly.
Aren't they more nutritious for demons or something?
And the Red Light District pretty much had them as cattle
And it's the tasho era
When was this ever stated? There are only few demons who target women specifically (one of which likely enjoyed them more since they are more nutritional for demons) and then there are those who don't discriminate.
I honestly think many women just don't want to be warriors during that time.
Shinobu isn't gifted in strength, no offence to her but like she's the weakest hashira, no she isn't the weakest slayer, but in terms of physical strength, she's definitely top 10 there
Keep in mind Mitsuri also was aware of it. She asked if it was okay for a woman to be that strong as it was an unusual thing at the time
They’re probably being eaten by demons more than men so they don’t have the chance to become demon slayers anyway
to be fair, Shinobu cant compete in strength, thats why she has the scalpel katana
Basicly
yea, plus shinobu said she is weaker than most regular slayers, and she has to rely on her posions and such, while mitsuri has unnaturally dense muscles, which gives her massive strength vs her size.
Orrrr just like Mitsuri, the ones who acted or were built different were seen as weird and so they hid themselves. Stronger women might've been shunned like she was. Women who wanted to be stronger were probably also not treated well. Remember Daki didn't get treated respectfully because she was strong; it was because she was pretty and followed what the people around her expected of her. Nobody knew anything about her being not-normal as a demon. They just saw a pretty "young" lady.
Those female hashiras come from wealthy families. Not to mention, in Mitsuri's backstory, she was supposed to be married off to another wealthy family.
> I don't think (or remember if;) Demon Slayer shows any sexism.

Not intentionally but there definitely could stand to be more female characters, not just slayers. *side eyes the only female Upper Moon who can't even claim the spot for herself and shares it with her brother*
Reddit when biology, Lol and no one better bring up the female hashira Mitsuri has chimpanzee muscle density and Shinobu uses cyanide to kill demons. 

In genreal when it comes to military matters dudes loving running to death
Physically
İ mean irl this logoc works but in anime with superpowers just no
reddit moment
Why would you be so controversial yet so brave my guy
Oh yeah,there were also a couple in the background in the manga too. I meant as in named ones
Didn't Ozaki die in Season 1?

Edit: Plus when searching Ozaki she looks pretty different from that pic in S2, also the fact that she died in S1.
You just know he beat Zenitsu extra hard when he was training him.
Yeah, i think Obanai's issues with women go beyond just his distaste for ther mentality.
Or super smart like Shinobu
Touhou- Demon Slayer crossover when?
Ok but none during Hashira Training?
Yeah. Tallest ones that come to mind are Gyomei and Tengen.
That was tall for the 1920s
>Aren’t the majority of slayers we see around 5.6/5.7?

You need to understand it ain't Europe, men average around 5'7 to 5'8 worldwide and this story is set around the 1920 period in Japan, it's pretty realistic height for men during that era.
yes but it doesn't fit the author's style, who prefers to draw them curvy (slender with big boobs) and it will be too erotic to draw them half naked during hashira training
Mitsuri has abnormal strength due to the fact that she is a fictional character.


Edit: I believe that she is made this way to be “unlike” most Japanese women. In Japan, women often eat smaller portions than men and do not show their physical strength or are as “out there” as Mitsuri is. This is shown in her backstory when she colors her hair to “fit in.” I think the writer created her to be a role model for girls who are like Mitsuri and that even tho you are different you may still find friends and love :)
Isn't her entire story that she is different than Missy of the woman and she eventually became afraid to be herself and tried to act like she thought she should based on how other woman around her were
She has abnormal muscle(and/or bone, don’t remember perfectly) density.
She is a rare exception with physical strength of a sumo wrestler. Gotogue wrote her as being genetically abnormal (not that it’s a bad thing), which was further enforced by the reaction of her formal suitor (the guy everyone hates here).
I don't know about her lungs but she for sure keep them in huge containers
There's always an exception.
Legit answer: Individual exceptions exist obviously both real world and fictional world alike however don't expect an 'exceptional' woman to beat a man of her own weight class in reality.
😔😔😔😔😔
I was downvoted? Damn, some people really can’t accept biological facts uh
Yeah. Even ubuyashiki helps female demons (tamayo) .


Female humans are fine too
She pretty much admits herself that she is one though lol
I mean Mitsuri being an exception. She's literally built different
That is also something to take into account, but it is the explanation that seems most logical to me, perhaps it is simply that the majority of women do not enlist in the demon hunter corps because they are "doing women's things", but who knows, it's more of a theory than a statement
Oh, my bad
Whoa that's so crazy how the answer to that is so obvious. One could assume a special Samurai division had little females because actual samurai divisions had little to no females, but hey that may be a stretch.
Noooooo
I assumed Douma was just picking on Akaza with that line
Huh… I don’t recall that being disclosed in both the manga or anime.
I remember one of the early demons at least preferring women and getting a bit into nutrients/flavor before Tanjiro kinda had enough of it
I don’t think so, Douma is just a freak with it
I think it is more like personal taste like how some people prefer steak and some pork
Yes.
Women are also typically weaker too.
Same goes for men, not many people would want to soldier up to fight demons.
thats not an offense, thats just a fact about the character. She's a textbook example of work smarter not harder, though, with how she compensates with poisons
I agree since her sword was built in a way that she does require as much strength since shes weaker than than the rest but she is also very smart and agile .
Ik but i meant just every category that’s not built in on physical besides speed. She’s definitely top 3 or 4 in speed and she’s super smart. So she’s super helpful
She says this herself in the Spider arc so I don't think she would have considered it an insult
It’s a lot of reasons, which is why there’s a lot of female kakushi
Ik I meant that she also has other amazing attributes that make her capable enough to fight as a hashira. Especially that insane speed with her small body
Well daki isnt the only female upper moon. We just havent met the other in the anime yet.
yeah Daki was a joke. coming in the same arc as Tengen's 3 subservient wives with gigantic tits as well lol
I personally just think it’s silly to use that as an argument on a show where there are:
-demons
-people that…summon elements to fight
-a girl who is a demon but also changes her size when needed, can heal people with fire, and can go outside now
- a guy that was a train 

It’s like when people are like “erm ☝️🤓 there wouldn’t have been black people in this time period” but they can have wizards, dragons and shit lol. Why is a women’s strength where theyd draw the line on fantasy? I think it’s fine to just say “it’s 1920s Japan” lol
W
That's alright
She only stood out to me 'cause she had a line of dialogue (she also has some pretty eyes ngl 👀)
Ozaki did die
If you're talking about the corps member in image of my comment, they are different
Mitsuri should’ve had muscles imo 😭
What about bandages covering their chest. Or just a shirt like kanao? 
Bro Mitsuri and Tengen's wives have half their breasts out 24/7, they could've got away with ladies in chest wrappings haha
Hee hee😔
Nezuko is angy at you



NO CHOKY MILK FOR YOU
Well, we all know at the end of the day, the author probably forgot about it (or it isn't important enough to remember) since the series itself doesn't really try to make a statement of it.

The only other explanation I can think of is that they split the genders so they don't get distracted while training? And since we are following Tanjiro, we'd only see the males training.
No worries. It's a passing comment so some didn't catch it.
So then why does Douma eat women only
He said it in both the manga and anime. It seems like he might have been joking but who knows. [https://www.quora.com/In-Demon-Slayer-is-it-true-that-women-are-better-for-demons-than-men-If-so-why](https://www.quora.com/In-Demon-Slayer-is-it-true-that-women-are-better-for-demons-than-men-If-so-why)
My dude is the ultimate pervert
bros being downvoted for stating biology lol.

there's a reason wars were fought by almost entirely men in the past and it aint just sexism, men are built for hunting and fighting, that was their evolved role. The Demon Slayer Core is basically an army set in 1920s japan

Can women fight and contribute? Sure, slayers like Shinobu and Mitsuri show that, but of course there's gonna be more men when men are literally more built for combat
I am a feminist, but this is true. Women are biologically weaker than men. If people state Mitsuri and Shinobu, we all know that Mitsuri has an unusual strength since she was a toddler, and Shinobu is known for her lethal toxins and speed. I might get downvoted but it's a fact. My mom is a doctor and she too approves that women are biologically different than men, just as women have less testosterone than men.
Bro get downvoted for stateing fact.
If it's a female then it would be like female and male gymnastics. https://youtu.be/ndTpHrbF4tI?si=giAQde2MFIaL60ZC
People downvoting you are cave dwellers lmao. The keyword is “typically”. Some people needs to learn and go back to school i think.
Shinobu or mitsuri can come and gang bang you if you say that one more time
Women biologically are stronger then men 10x times, mentally and physically. So this comment makes no sense
But in a ratio, there are still a considerable number of men who would like to take up the job than women. The time setting of DS is in the early 1900s, women are not really expected and even educated to take on physical and combat roles that much. During this time, there is a high rate of stereotyping and such.
I don't really buy that Shinobi can't decapitate any demons. Her fight with Doma showed how she was able to destroy a bridge with her speed. It literally collapses. I think its just that she can't decapitate the higher tier demons in one swing and her blade is not meant for decapitating. But for the lower and weaker ones she definitely should be able to considering how much force is behind her speed blitz attacks. 
Kakushi are like the most underated people in demon slayer along with the weaker demon slayers that sacrificed themselves against muzan
No yeah, I'm not trying to short sell her. Just the joke was there, especially with Mitsuri there for the comparison
Wasn’t she though for basically the whole manga? Like before the started killing them off 1,2,3,4 and 5 were all dudes.
"Well actually the elements aren't real"-☝️🤓
Forreal tho, in anime, a skinny guy that happens to have some muscles on his bones can go through seven floors of concrete just fine, no one bats an eye but god forbid a woman ever does anything😭

https://i.redd.it/wwmjv6ponu5d1.gif
But the favt that irl women are strong af too, and theyre just misogynistic and egotistical. 😭
Yea,i honestly dont think theres a single slayer in the verse that doesnt look good😭 Even the background slayers look better then most isekai protags
Is the corps member in the image unnamed?
Fr tho! I hate the 'men get to be bulky but when women are they have mysterious muscle density and are still slim' like no!! She can be LEAN, but let my girl have the six pack she deserves!
definitely she shouldve
WHO WANTS TO SUMMON MICHAL JACKSON 
Yeah, I didn’t realise that she made it through final selection
Cause he's a creep.
Cuz they taste better
Douma eats both man and woman just mainly woman
Oh. That scene. The entire context revealed Douma trying to instigate poor Akaza’s after he had just been verbally/physically reprimanded by Muzan. And since Akaza is under Douma’s rank, it further justifies Douma exerting his power over him because Akaza can’t do anything to him. Notice how NONE of the Demons are friends and are often depicted working against each other.
Also, the sad fact was men were more expendable. Civilization (or just ecology in general) needs women to give birth and feed the children, but men have little use after they mate

I theorize this is also why female insects devour their partners after mating.
As a biology student who has also studied anthropology and archeology, this is a misconception. Men did not “evolve” to be hunters / warriors, and women did not “evolve” to be gatherers / healers / carers. These ideas originate from the highly biased viewpoints of scientists in the Victorian era, who often twisted their findings to match their worldviews in regards to the role of the female sex, not just in humans but in all species. The size dynamic of the egg and the sperm were used to reinforce pre-existing gender roles. In reality, while humans do display sexual dimorphism, where men have higher muscle mass on average than women, these dimorphisms predate organized human society, and thus gender roles have no impact on how they came about.

When did we decide to draw the line that these people can rearrange their own organs to avoid a fatal wound or slice spider monsters in the blink of an eye while asleep and that’s part of our suspension of disbelief, but then having more female demon slayers that break our normal biological conventions suddenly become TOO much of a fantasy?
I'm not entirely satisfied with that explanation. Yes, this is probably the author's explanation and biology is a factor. But this is a world where people regularly surpass human limitations while fighting monsters with a wide array of magical abilities. 

Plus we know that even people without these special powers or who don't have as much physical strength find work arounds; poison blades, guns, eating demons.

I think the original comment about 1920's Japan, specifically its gender norms (and out of universe modern ones) makes the most sense to me.
Exactly.
It's an anime.... biology is whatever the writer wants it to be. They could've created an entire clan of Mitsuri.
True, Demon Slayer is a biologically accurate show 👍 wouldn't want those pesky women ruining the realism!
Idk, bringing real world biology in a series where people perform supernatural feats by breathing really good is kinda silly to me XD
Yup. We must qualify this statement as women being biologically weaker physically but also endowed, biologically, with more resilience than men. Carrying a child to term, delivering it (especially during a time without anaesthesia) and nursing babies requires resilience. It is believed that estrogen plays a role. I’d say childbearing requires a good deal of strength that isn’t physical.
Fr.
💀
Least obvious bait.
This man (or woman most probably) right here is fishing 🎣 for replies and thought we wouldn't notice 😂
Oh I was agreeing, I was just adding on that you'd have to be a crazy person to want to fight these demons. Id be out of there the second the baby face spiders start crawling at me.
I forgot this crucial, hard hitting fact
Yeah like…these characters are leveling cities on a regular basis there is nothing realistic about it in the first place lmfao
Sadly, no. She isn't even credited. At least, i don't think so
Thiss, the only reason why she’s slim despite her muscle density is because of fan service. I love Mitsuri but she deserves better 😔
Nah I don’t think so, I mean yeah he is a creep, but I’m pretty sure it was mostly because of the fact women are more nutritious than men, that’s why Douma told Akaza the reason why he was stronger than him was because he consumed women, whereas Akaza only consumed men making him weaker as a demon than Douma (and to be fair, he’s a creep to men too)
They’re more nutritious
i agree
Pretty sure muzan actually told them not to work together because they always ended up fighting
I may not be an anthropology student, I'm only a human biology student, but I'd like to add to the conversation. I always find it sad when someone with an actual argument gets ignored. 


Sure these dimorphisms predate organized society, but so do a lot of things about humans. Just because a trait evolved before the modern human, it does not disprove the necessity of these traits or that there was a reason for it. We can infer that Homo erectus very likely had gender roles just by looking at the rest of the animal kingdom. There is an actual point to gender roles in the animal kingdom. 


I am sure you can agree humans are very very new on the evolution time line. Life has been evolving for millions of years before we arrived at modern animals. Many things evolved and were decided before we ever built the first sharp stick. Such as the females having the ability to bear young while the males don't. This was decided even before the Cambrian era. Our primate ancestors probably lived a life that selected for the traits we have today. 


Gender roles do exist in nature when looking at creatures more similar to us. Gender roles do exist in animals that take care of their young together. The easiest example are birds. Many of them have roles each parent plays. Also, I'd like to strike down the idea that gender roles are only when the man hunts and the woman cares for the young. Emperor penguins have the role of the man takes care of the egg while the woman hunts for food. The men have a specialized pouch that evolved before modern penguins for this purpose. In every animal where the mom and dad both take care of the young gender roles keep popping up over and over. 


Life is easier when everyone has a defined role. Evolution tends to select certain trait more than others. Such as the meme , everything keeps evolving into crabs. This can be seen all over the animal kingdom because some strategies are more viable than others. And one thing that continues to evolve are roles. I'm no longer talking about gender roles but just a role in general. In large herd animals you have soldiers, watchers, and leaders. In colony animals you have scouts, gathers, and mothers. For the naked mole rat only the dominant female gives birth. You can argue modern gender roles are a construct and I will agree. But roles in general especially when it comes to rearing young is present throughout the animal kingdom.

This is my biggest beef with fans of fantasy. They will be totally fine with all kinds of shenanigans and bullshit and magic but the second it comes to things like “this woman beat this man in combat!” they’re like “BUT BIOLOGY?!” 

Like bro you were fine with a dude surviving a fireball from a giant ass dragon by casting a giga shield drained from his bussy soul power core, but you’re mad bc some booby armor lady beat a dude in a swordfight? 

Sure, women are weaker and slower than men IRL. But if we are bending a million other laws of science in a fantasy show, why can’t we make women be equal/stronger sometimes? 

They need to just admit they’re sexist tbh.
To be fair, I think Inosuke's organ thing was a really stupid asspull lol, I couldn't believe that was actually the canon explanation for Inosuke surviving a stab through the heart.

And I think it just depends on whether these details contribute to your show in a positive way. If it was purely "There are more male slayers than female because men are more built for fighting", while that would make sense it'd be hella boring. But the show takes that and creates awesome characters like Shinobu who is one of the fastest Hashira but the also the only slayer in the show that kills demons in an alternative way that isn't decapitation/sun. She's also one of the smartest characters

It's also a known fact that females have a more flexible body than men, which is why female gymnastics is a lot more popular and there's way more women doing it. Mitsuri's whole thing is flexibility, then Kanae and Kanao's flower breathing feels like a style that takes advantage of their flexibility

Keeping biological conventions allowed for more interesting writing
No magic in demon slayer bro
Just breathing techniques that increase oxygen to muscles and giving heightened strength and endurance
The light works are for show
I agree on all but.demon slayers don't have magical abilities.The animations of breathing techniques was just added for us.They don't really summon water,fire,stone,mist.normal ds side character won't see a thing.and yes when the demon slayer mark awakened and transparent world the body temp goes high and the sword is converted into crimson red blade as mentioned in the story.and if cut with crimson red blade upper rank demon Take time to regenerate.


If any spelling mistake sorry😅😅😅
Yes. Each sex has it’s own strength and that is okay
Mental fortitude especially those who had issues with their pregnancy and have to be in the hospital multiple times a month but followed through. 

Or those who were told that they would die if they gave birth to the baby but still managed. 

It is respectable.
I don't know if that necessarily equates to alot of resilience outside of that purpose cause women's bodies are hard-coded for that very purpose, but could be... I dunno.
Ok man
Oh I see, sorry if I misunderstood your comment.
nah it's he's a creep. akaza was weaker because he's a demonlet
I would assume so because one of the first demons tanjiro fights says that only young women taste the best but demons like the drum dude (can't remember his name) was pretty clearly taking men women kids doesn't matter. 🤷‍♂️
No it's because akaza only eats men so he eats like less than 50% of what douma eats
Granted, he had a cult where he could get humans vs. Akaza, who needs to hunt for it.

I'm pretty sure he also eats dudes, too, just less often.

He just has a larger supply of victims. I think he was just fuckin with Akaza to make him get stronger (he's cutting off his supply of power)
Both.
Or was he too scared that they'd gang on him 😶
You’re confusing gender roles with life history strategy. Gender roles do not, evolutionarily, exist. Evolution does not have foresight.

Furthermore, so-called “gender roles” (aka differing life history strategies across sexes) in nature are nowhere near as rigid as humans like to think they are. That example you gave, about emperor penguins? *Both sexes engage in solitary parental care, and both engage in hunting to feed themselves and their young.* The only reason that the males tend to the egg over the dark winter is because the females have expended too much of their body mass creating the egg to survive. They return to feed first because they and the chick will both die otherwise.

In many species of fish and arthropods, multiple male “gender roles” exist; these are defined by differing reproductive strategies, and are typically recognized as different polyphenic morphs. Some of those morphs serve as adolescent forms of other morphs, the individual’s reproductive strategy / “gender role” changing as they mature. Sexual dimorphisms occur when the genes which control a trait in one sex are different from the genes that control that trait in the other sex. Polyphenism occurs when the genes which control a trait change depending on the organism’s environment. The dimorphism is evolved because different traits are favoured by different life strategies, not because they “fulfill a role.”

Sentinel behaviour, what you called the “watchers” of herding animals, is specifically a task which all members of the group must engage in equally. Any individual who slips out on their turn is liable to punishment by the group. Which animal serves as the “leader”, if there even is a decisive leader, is often the parent or grandparent of the other group members, and leads by some ratio of dominance and recognized life experience. And herding or pack-forming species do not have dedicated combatants, with the exception that juveniles are too small to fight. A behaviour or group dynamic may be evolved, but in these species who performs what “role” is almost entirely environmental, aka not evolved. Honey bees are eusocial insects, and they have different roles the colony needs to fill, but unlike the caste systems of ants, they differentiate roles based on individual age and the proportion of workers which meet those relative age categories. If all of the older workers are removed, the young workers will transition roles early. If the young workers are removed, the youngest of those who remain will revert. 

Yes, you are correct that human sexual dimorphism existed in our hominid ancestors before they reached the level of sapience by which we modern humans define ourselves, and that there was a reason for this dimorphism. Males and females persisted under differing evolutionary pressures. *But we do not know what these pressures were.* We weren’t there when our hominid ancestors first descended from the trees. As a student of human biology, surely you are aware of how fraught the field of human evolutionary history is. There is SO much bias to sort through in any historical data / studies because we humans have spend so long thinking we were the centre of the universe, that we were somehow separate from the rest of the animal kingdom, that we were the ultimate life form to which all other organisms aspired to become. *We are not.* Biology influences culture, but culture does not influence biology. The “gender roles” we humans have given ourselves are only marginally reflective of actual sexual dimorphism, and usually only the visible elements of it. What they are actually reflective of is the worldviews (and interests) of those who hold power over a society.

And honestly, I think you missed my point entirely; the person to whom I responded was quoting heavily biased ideals of biological essentialism to justify bigotry. He invoked the concept of directional evolution, which as I’ve stated above, does not exist. Nothing evolves “to become” anything; natural selection is a sieve, it simply selects out that which is not well adapted for the current environment. The “gender roles” he was citing, and I was disproving, we’re that males are universally dominant, competitive, and mate-seeking, and that females are demure, need coercing, and are choosy. This is not the case. Hyenas have a matriarchal hierarchy, where the most competitive females are on top, but even the lowest-ranking female still stands above even the highest ranking male. Many “monogamous” female songbirds will cheat on their mates. Nothing in the evolutionary sciences is absolute except for the fact that evolution selects for what produces the greatest reproductive fitness *right now,* and damn the future consequences.
That is not how that works. The average man has more muscle than the average woman, but the “average man” and “average woman” don’t exist. Muscle mass occurs on a spectrum, and many men are weaker than women of their own weight class.

Furthermore, how much muscle you have is only half of the question, when it comes to strength. Type of muscle fibres is also important. Are your muscles made up of more aerobic or anaerobic fibres? Aerobic fibres produce more force over less time. Anaerobic fibres produce less force over a longer time.

Finally, women have a higher average pain tolerance than men. I don’t know what could possibly be more important in a fight than not keeling over the moment someone kicks you in the nethers. So you can take your sexism and shove it.
But it's a canonical fact that there aren't much female demon slayers even if u/sexistguy blames it on biology if anyone were to be sexist it would be the author
The effects may only be for show, but saying the breathing "heightens" the strength is an absolute understatement. For example they fucking demolish buildings in the Tengen fight. There is definitely supernatural stuff going on, might as well call it magic
Then how do the light works interact with demons? If seen a few times where the light is what cuts demons instead of the blade
Yup. I don’t believe in either sex being better than the other too
Yes. Some studies show women have a different response to stress that enables us to withstand such activities.
👍
Nah, women actually are more nutritious for demons
Yeah but my point still stands because it was mentioned by him, it’s both
It's mentioned in volume 3 of the manga that muzan instructed the demons not to work together cause they would end up eating each other but that's a lie, and that it's only because he's scared they'd gang up on him and kill him. This is said by tamayo so you're right.
Only Demon who MAYBE has 0.0001% chance of wining is Upper Rank 1
They cant cuz of muzan Jackson's control over them
Om sorry I missed the point of biological essentialism I don't agree with that line of thought. But thank you for your reply, good day.
[deleted]
Look closely bro , its the sword

And please specify when that happened
It's kind of werid seeing full grown adults still fighting about gender like they're still in elementary school
That doesn’t make sense though Muzak could fight every upper and lower moon at the same time and be fine. Not only is he supremely strong and fast but he literally can control their biology since everything they are comes from him
Kokushibo has a much higher chance than that even by himself. It took the two strongest hashira, a demon eater, and Muichiro who is incredibly strong to defeat him and they barely won. Koku paired with Akaza and Douma have a very high chance of overwhelming Muzan.
Biological essentialism is scientifically incorrect and ALWAYS sexist, so no, nothing contradictory at all. You are the one who fails to understand biology beyond fourth grade.
I dunno if there’s an element of indoctrination
Coldest take of the century: 90s OVAs were the peak of mobile suit designs 
CCA also counts
No argument over here. I love when Gundam has a somewhat grounded feel, so the grit of 08th MS Team, the mechanical evolution of the designs in Stardust Memory, and the very human story of War in the Pocket are absolutely peak for me.
Vietgundam, ColdWardam, and Top Gundam.
Just because it's cold doesn't make it wrong.
I agree with the statement above. During this era, the variety of mobile suit designs significantly influenced the themes of each series. The 90s offered something for almost every type of audience. For instance, there were semi-realistic machines in *0083* and *08th MS Team*, retro designs in *Turn A Gundam*, super robots in *Mobile Fighter G Gundam*, and futuristic, cool aesthetics in *Wing* and *Gundam X*.
1000% 

Wing? 08th Team? WitP? Stardust Memory? F91? Turn A?

All beautiful

Edit: included non OVA because 90's gundams were *chef's kiss*
I love the Kshatriya too much to stand on that hill with you, but I can’t say you’re wrong either.

P E A K
I love them so much. 08th MS Team being probably my favorite Gundam thing, period.
They are certainly my favorite Gundam media and I would generally agree that the mobile suit designs are my favorite. I do have a soft spot for some of the Zeta and ZZ designs too. I'm a big UC fan though.
Couldn’t agree more.
![gif](giphy|TFIoWBxZp2EKM38IO3|downsized)

the 90's were 30 years ago
I think peak art happened just before the switch from analog to digital.

Its just never really been as cerebral or visceral, its always just seemed like…soft?

90’s hand drawn art was hard as fuck - both in literal skill requirement and the visceral gothic tone that came with such extreme talent.


Computer/digital art is effectively like “taking the easy way out”
90s OVAs were the peak of mecha anime, period.
Weird, I don't recall CCA coming out in the mid 90's



(Mid 90's mobile suits are very awesome though)
Considering that image of the Rx79G is currently my phone wallpaper, I have to agree. 08th is my favorite Gundam series, I'm definitely not biased.
I love all those suits, GP02, Kampfer and Alex in particular
I would set the date back a few  years. the period from 89 to 96 has THE best mobile suit designs. ( war in the pocket, stardust memory, 8th ms team)

edit, i hadnt seen the other pictures, we basically agree 100% then, just war in the pocket is technically from the 80s.
War in the pocket gets me every time
GP01FB my beloved
"What if we made mobile suits look like war machines?"

The results were awesome.
So cold it went around to being hot again
Isn't war in the pocket from the 80s?
They were the best imo OP
i keep coming back to these damn ovas. they're really something special
I agree to an extent, love Alex and the Gundam Ground type, was not a fan of the Ez8 or GPO2
100% agree. God I wish we had old style Gundam series still popping off. Hand drawn everything. Oh Lord.
EZ-8 gotta be my favorite gundam
Not an ova but F91 my beloved
Cannot agree harder
Indisputable fact.
Turn A was the true peak, sorry.
The late 80 through the 90s was just peak anime in general… aside from many terrible English dubs. But in terms of art and animation it was the golden age and most (but not all) modern productions look pretty lame by comparison
8th ms team was amazing showing grounded guerrilla warfare. It was so good I wish we had a spinoff prequel like it for DBZ with low-class Saiyan's dropping on planets and doing similar stuff.
Back when they had a looooot of money.
Where the best place to watch War in the Pocket? I love the 08th Mobile Suit Team and this seems like it’ll be the most similar.
It’s why I love Thunderbolt. It brings those designs back and tweaks them just a bit.
Totally balanced with both cool and real factors.
I've only seen 08th MS Team. I really should get to the others.
08th MS Team is probably my absolute fave to this day 🥳
*Peak of Gundan
It was peak times
The 90s ovas are peak gundam artstyle for me. The later series just don't scratch that particular itch
Definitely the peak of pre-CGI animation. The swan song of amazing hand painted cels.
Another post where we can glaze the glorious chonk of GP-02? Sold. Physalis is exquisite design 😌
0083 is peak mech design.
Hell yeah UC side stories are better then some of the mainline stories of uc and a lot of the Other time lines. even the games back then hit different Zeonic front hit a lot harder then you would think it would story wise especially the last mission post credit it was a in suit camera start up and then you have a battle as a remnit group recusing anther band of zeon remnits from GMs and old pal mud rock.... DOM blizt and blinders.
Stardust was amazing 🔥🔥🔥
WITP is from the 80s
Disagree. Gundam, Zeta Gundam, ZZ Gundam, Gundam MkII, Nu Gundam, Zaku, Marasai, Sazabi, Nu Gundam, Jegan… there’s so many great designs from the original tetralogy
The RX 79 Ground type will always have my heart first Gundam Anime that I've watched first Gunpla kit that I bought 😊
Every time there’s a new MSG anything I just hope it’s more in the 90s OVA vein. TB and IBO pt 1 almost scratched the itch.
I like how these 3 don’t feature super-poweres new-types as the lead
Gundam F91 is still my favorite
Late 90s was peak animation, period.
Well, at least one of them is close to peak.
Cold take: All Gundam designs are peak. Somewhere out there, someone's favorite is the ugliest Gundam you can think of.

Me when  literally any Gundam:

https://preview.redd.it/zr14z046bgod1.png?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41571c9f5d6dd975013467071c66116f30e42e2b
wrong! turn A and gundam X exist.
You're right.
Zaku II FZ is hands down THE best Zaku design. The Kampfer is the most incredible mech that gets like 7mins of screen time.
Yeah, I'm not sure how to explain it but the lighting and linework give a sort of "gritiness" or "groundedness" (though I'm not sure if those are the right words). It's similar with how I feel when I see Akira or the Patlabor movies.
Valid take
These three following 0079 are what got me hooked on the franchise, during their initial Toonami runs. 
What a hot streak.
What a weird way to say that the OG UC timeline had the best realistic designs.
F91 and Victory agrees with you.
Absolutely, great designs, hand drawn and 80/90s soundtrack all around wins, honestly Gundam fell off after the early 2000s
Actually I'd say this is a relatively warm take. Not hot, but more like leftovers left out overnight and now it's warming up in the middle of the late spring day. And I disagree(but they are pretty consistently decent).
Stares in Endless Waltz (Also a 90's OVA)
08th MS team and Gundam Wing were my joints.
You mean for all of mecha in general
80's and 90's anime were peak everything imo...
Yep, I sure agree
Gundam 0080. For ALL the reasons.

You think Z Gundam had great mech design and a dark story? Hoo-fucking-boy…..
I’ll have to agree. SeeD absolutely did not do it for me.
That's not cold, it's just facts
90s OVAs were the peak.
RG GP-03 Stamen or MG 2.0 please thank you.
Best animation too.
Those were nice but I'm more partial to some of the newer stuff. I think I rank most of the IBO stuff as the best but I like seed a lot too.
Yep those boxy type body's are peak design, that's why I'm not a fan of aerial
Generally I would agree there are some notable exceptions not that I know the names of them just that I would know them on site XD.
It's tough to top a Kawamori mech. It's been done, but it's tough.
So far the Gundam Ground type is my favorite gundam of them all. I especially love the shield and all the ways they use it
Agreed, at least in terms of minimalist perfection by virtue of their simple complexity.

Now funnels have funnels.
Ok you convinced me. Making a wallpaper out of this…
It's more the tail end of the early 90s, but I still love Victory's design above most others.

https://preview.redd.it/vqmr5gzoenod1.png?width=880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5096b62072688ea7c04d998861a96382db0a69d
8th Mobile Suit Team is the best Gundam series.  The Ground Unit is one of my favorite suits ever, along with the Gerbera Tetra and the Karmpfer so...


No argument from me.
I think the animation and presentation was at its peak in the 90’s OVA’s and movies, but not necessarily design. They’re still great, but not my personal favorites.
Do you like 90s OVA MS designs or do you just like OYW / Early UC MS designs?

Edit: MS, not MA
Between 00 and Unicorn, I'm more of a late 2000s fan.
Hell, Nah, you on sumthin man, 90s ovas were good but not as good as the IBO designs
Hot take: I've never really liked the older uc designs, I prefer the newer stuff way more,my favorites are some of the seed suits and the ibo frames, the ibo frames are just perfection to me
Nah, it's Zeta,

That's why these designs are in rotations instead of being a mainstay or development plan like Zeta in many media / merchandise

And that's coming from a person who love War in the Pocket
I have to disagree in part- I love 08th MS Team and War in the Pocket, but I really, really dislike the stardust memory designs. They feel like the equivalent of the 90s comic predilection for stuffing pouches on everything. I much prefer Gundam X in the 90s, and many series since.
Seed does it for me everytime when it comes too designs
W h a t
Disagree, 90s was full of good designs but arguably not peak.

Part of the reason was the 90s had multiple Gundam series drop at once, we got F91, 0083, Victory, Wing, 8th, X, and then a capstone of Turn A.
With that many so close together, they had to vary the designs enough to make them unique but not all of the series were hits.

Peak for popularity would probably be 2002-2005 when SEED.

My favorite designs are from 0079 and X

All designs are valid even if I don't like them.

I'm on mobile, so the formatting is weird...
Honestly the majory of it is the insane animation quality caused by the japanese asset price bubble. The desings arent mind blowing but maybe thats a good thing
💯
They have what looks like functional designs, like this thing could be real.

Some of the suits later on look like they ignore the laws of physics
This is exactly what makes The 08th MS Team one of my favorite series.
08th being more grounded (lol ground type) is why I prefer the Gouf Custom from it over the original. The Gatling shield is a bit different extra perhaps, but the non-heat sword, regular grapple instead of the whip, and having a wrist mounted cannon rather than in the fingers are all so much more believable than the original.
Same here, I agree with you 

I like my mecha animes grounded and gritty too
Today on Top Gundam I'm going to strap as many boosters to see how fast a mobile suit can really go
BRO! WTF?  Ive never noticed that before! lol. Spot on!
I’m absolutely fuming at the accuracy of this 😂😂
You know what else is good and cold? Beer! :P
What's funny is I think Wing's aesthetics are practically a 90s time capsule. 

All the scenes on civilian space shuttles or aircraft were just pre-9/11 commercial airliners. Almost no cell phones and the computers are just post-DOS. All the geopolitics are Gulf War 1: rise of PMCs and drones. 

The Gundam designs themselves are basically 90s sports cars crossed with Gulf War jets. They've got lots of gentle curves terminating in squared faces.
yeah we not really saw the like of it again in anime till seed destiny stargazer ibo and witch.
I would remove f91 and tun a from that list
NOPE, nope, nope. Sorry dude, that is an cool suit,but definitely doesnt hold weight against the ones from the 90s. 

 also, the design is HEAVILY influenced by the suits of the 80s and 90s, mainly zeta gundam, stardust memory, and 8th ms team.  i mean, they're all influenced by previous designs but this one makes it very obvious. 

I think the sinanju,  Efreet Nach, and the gundam unicorn are better examples of great original 2010's design but i'd still go with the 90s. 

https://preview.redd.it/gea6qiem5god1.png?width=2398&format=png&auto=webp&s=94ac75fc4cf1d767e47f2908332211c907a4c2f4
Quinn Mansa is way cooler than the Kshatriya
I also love a lot of the zeta and ZZ the qubeley byrlant MK2 kapool etc. but we also got a lot of designs like the bound doc and hizak marine type.

That's one of the main reasons why I called this the peak, it was just exclusively banger designs and so so many stand out designs like the GM cannon, GM command space type or dendrobium
zz designs look cool., but i think what makes the designs from the 90s stand out, is that they really take into account engineering. like the designers were into industrial design and had an appreciation for it. zeta gundam is more of like, "extreme" design, like, give it more angles! give it more spikes, more sharp edges!

meanwhile the 90s wave of mech designs took the actual engineering in mind. looking at those designs is like looking at great engineering on a watch, or a car, or a fighter jet. there is something that just resonates with people. 

https://preview.redd.it/1azgvntg9god1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c1848794dde39d5941eb50e6a7ebf06a2416244
That's a massive oversimplification. You may like it more in both design and rendering but that's different from making general statements about skill level and commitment. I don't know how people think digital art works (real digital art not genAI) but it isn't magic, it has a lot of conveniences but if you can't draw on paper you are likely even worse off on digital. There is a reason why some people will start the drawing traditionally and switch to digital to render later. For a lot of people, digital art is to trafitional what Microsoft Word is for typing machines. It makes editing and fixing mistakes much easier with the trade off that digital pencils aren't as natural as the real thing.
Well it counts as a part of the absolute peak
Couldn't agree more
Cold take? Sir, this is a freezer burn take. So cold it's cookin
Well like yes but for brevities sake it's counted too
The FLAT is peak
I think that's just the result of filtering and availability, though. The mid and bad stuff has mostly been forgotten, and most of it wasn't easily available outside Japan to begin with. There's a ton of great shows nowadays, it's just that the bad stuff is also now readily available, and easier to remember due to its recency.
In terms of art style? This is a matter of subjective taste. I can appreciate the hand drawn styles as well as the modern, computer developed styles.

In terms of animation? Heck no. First off, if we are comparing OVAs to TV shows (since OVAs don't really exist anymore), then it's not even a fair comparison to begin with. OVAs took a year or years to create, had a ton of budget, and literally released one episode every few months on a VHS, of course they could potentially look better. Comparing them to a week-by-week TV series is like comparing a movie to a TV series. 

But even then, it's not always the case. Some of the sakuga that is done for fight scenes is absolutely incredible. Unlike the 80s up until about 2005 where for TV they had to animate on threes (1 frame of animation for every 3 frames), computers have now made it so that TV shows can now have their action scenes be animated on twos and ones (1 frame per two frames or even every frame being animated). To completely ignore how good some of the sakuga is today is simply an act of not doing enough research. Just take a look at what is possible in One Piece now compared to 1999. The difference is staggering to the point many call certain episodes "Cinema Piece".

And as the other guy said, we tend to engage in curating. We are only remembering the best of what has been done before and we are ignoring 80% of the stuff that has been forgotten. Even peak anime years like 1998 has had 80% of what came out that year left behind, just like in every other medium.
Imo you hit the hammer on the head of the nail,  peak Gundam in every way
For brevity's sake no one cares
Nah X had a couple of ok suits and turn is beaten on numbers alone

Not saying they are bad in any way, in fact they are awesome as sh*t, just compared to sheer perfection without misses, they aren't peak
I wanted to like Gundam W (and did as a 13 year old. But the Gundam were TOO OP. Now Brian Drummond? I guess he was too OP also. 😂
Ain't saying anything is bad just that they were just consistent bangers with no misses like we got the Hygogg, ez8, dendrobium, Neue ziel, kämpfer and Dom GM could district type all released in those three
As much as I love the IBO suits, I really think these just have a consistency of bangers and standout design unmatched to this day
Nah, once they started with the transformable mobile suits, it dropped off
Ignore the downvotes, Seed has my favorite AU suit designs and I agree with you
Well I was talking about the OVAs which were just consistent with not a single one having any design I dislike.
It's mostly this for me. I enjoy my Gundam most when it feels like something that could actually happen. A lot of times 0079 feels like Star Trek to me. Even if some explanations are kind of hand-wavey, they at least have a logic based on something scientific and the writers are trying to make something feel grounded.
Do you remember what happened to the last Char???
“And now, the Stig’s Zeon cousin!”
Really? I mean, First Gundam is just World War II in space with mechs and a dash of Star Wars. Gundam Sentinel was just the Boshin war (so much so that the New Desides are literally the Shinsengumi).
Could use one, you buying?
I’m an ice cream man myself.

![gif](giphy|z6nCcqfd8WVq)
Absolutely, the semi-realistic ones featured contemporary tech. Wing’s aesthetics stood out with their sleek, angular designs, moving away from the clunky UC mobile suits. They often showcased sharp lines and dramatic, wing-like appendages. These designs also triggered my inner 7-year-old artist—the type who adds an excessive number of weapons to their drawings. I’m looking at you, Heavyarms Gundam.
Why those in particular?
F91 is good and TURN A is one of the best gundam stories over all i thinki it even wone the poll for best gundam anime
Part of the reason I love it is because of how much it calls back to the Neue Ziel! That was the coolest mech I’d ever seen up to that point in my early anime days, and it set the standard.
>is way cooler

If you prefer the Quinn Mansa that is fine, but *way* cooler than Kshatriya is a level that doesn't exist.
We’re all entitled to our opinions…but you’re wrong! Wrong!! lol
thats probably the direct inspiration for it, but I think the kshatriya is a better looking and more refined suit design. its basically an updated improvement on it. still not better than the designs coming out of the 90s
Preach it mate
Z'gok-e, Kampher, and Hygogg are perhaps my favorite Zeon suits of all time.
Yeah, for sure! My point is that I like both!
I’m not trying to knock digital art and i really don’t see it as a reason to get as defensive as you are nor is it an oversimplification - its simply what happened to japan, as a whole and not just with art.

Overarchingly, and more slowly, its happening to the rest of the world too. First to engage with new technology is the first to be eroded by it.

“AI” art is over taking now anyways and in a few generations people will no longer be doing ultra complex hand drawn pieces at all unless something is done about it.

The incremental increases in skill and talent that came from the 70’s to 80’s to 90’s to 1998ish hand drawn style was like 30 years of hardcore development.
Also 0080 is from the 80's. Iirc it was made for Gundam's 10th anniversary.
Ok
They fear him because he speaks the truth
I mean, when you got the scientist who made Tallgeese the first MS in that universe. You know they are not going to make second class mass produced garbage. Of course Brian is the Lightning Count and Ocean Dub Vegeta except no less.
Then it means for you only the original MSG is good,

Because Zeta is like... the second entry of the whole thing
Yea my friend who just recently got into gundam after hating on it said seed has the most gundam looking gundams
Right?
Like take the Ksthatria (however the f you spell it): physics still apply in space - but that thing takes 90-degree turns at mach10 without the wings/shields tearing off lol
Hey, sounds good to me!
man done creamed in his pants
if you cant see why those 2 series can be placed on a separate category from 8th ms team, stardust memory, and war in the pocket... then you wouldnt understand whatever explanation i give you.
If you really think about it, the Kshatriya is basically the evolution of the Kampfer if someone say “let’s make it like the Neue Ziel”, and then did just that.
Refined in some ways, yes, but it's a little busy and the proportions are too wacky for my taste. Like it feels like a suit attached to wings rather than the other way around lol
"Effectively like taking the easy way out" that's a pretty big generalization, which also happens to be disrespectful but I didn't reply out of exasperation if that's what you thought, I didn't  even bother downvoting any of your comments (I'm more aggravated, out of pettiness, by the fact that you wrote AI and then the word art together, if anything) if that's what you think by all means enjoy your right to free speech but I honestly don't see the basis of it. Do you mean to say the designs of stuff like IBO, Unicorn, 00 are a regression of skill level? I can totally understand you liking the oldies better but I don't see any signs of stagnation (quite the opposite for me)  and traditional art didn't die either people still make amazing work traditionally you are simply less likely to see it because digital art is much more appropriate for comercial applications (again, because you can make edits and changes) and yes more convenient too. 

The issue I'm talking about is that you are making that weird association between digital art and a supposed downfall of talent when the difference of skill required by the two mediums is not enough to cause a general stagnation. Again it's like using Word instead of a typewriter, much more convenient but the core craft is kept, you simply don't need to scrap the whole thing now whenever you make a mistake that bothers you too much, that doesn't mean digital artists are less passionated or committed is not that black and white corrupting force. For example some people do digital because of commercial considerations others because they are very perfectionistic and being able to fix stuff with the precision of fractions of millimeters until you are satisfied, is great, others just want to save on cost of materials (art supplies can be very expensive), for people who work with concept art being able to change stuff without having to begin anew from scratch is amazing, and some just like it as a medium better because it is more extensive than other mediums. 

Digital isn't the easy mode of traditional (unless you start off with a fancy tablet I would argue it is the other way around until you really get used to it, depending on the traditional medium you are comparing to), the fact that it brings significant benefits does not mean people will cripple their progress by using it specially considering it also expands the possibilities of what can be done too. 

>AI” art is over taking now anyways and in a few generations people will no longer be doing ultra complex hand drawn pieces at all unless something is done about it.

AI is something else entirely. Hobbists will still do complex hand drawn pieces because artists do that for the sake of crafting itself and AI is a completely sterile experience on that end but I'm afraid your argument will become reality for the coming generations unfortunately.

Anyways, my two cents.
Well it's also peak

Actually my favourite
*vibrates in agreement*
[AND DRUMMOND’S STILL GOT IT!!!](https://youtu.be/S-pkvtM0s7g?si=5HYvbWl43wqi5jgX)
The origin, 08th MS team, Stardust, memory, war in the pocket thunderbolt, all had designs of that style…
Alright, we'll meet at side 2
Okay. I was talking about 90's Gundams and they were both made in the 90's. I'm fairly new to Gundam compared to most outside of Wing, so I honestly welcome your explanation. Yeah I may not get it right away, but gatekeeping and being troll instead of having a conversation is a weird take.
Whats really important to remember here is competitiveness and trends - when everyone is forced into the same method, there will be various reasons for people to “get better” or improve - skipping your insinuations and aggravations, lets look deeper into what i mean:


If everyone is forced to use pen and paper style snalog drawing, everyone who draws will unknowingly compete with everyone else either intentionally or unintentionally, and as a result many breakthroughs and art “styles” will evolve from this competition. In the act of “breaking through” or “making it” artists have to consistently improve themselves until they are recognized as the best and with which almost immediately a harder grinder comes forth with more — unless you introduce a new style, you are forced to improve and improve.

With the onset of digital art, another style arrives that is so unlike analog that we begin to remove the skill bars - easy lines can be set using software point a to b, mistakes can be erased, the “skill” and discipline required to draw a straight line or a perfect circle or cube becomes unneccesary because of the program, however this erodes talent and creates a rigid art form where literally less can be done in more time compared to “peak artist” its very apparent in the quality of detail.

That quality of detail is also very much the reason things have innovated the way they have - an analog photo from the 70’s for instance could have been considered peak photography, when compared to a digital photo from the 2000’s you’d be missing out on subtle details, light changes and little renders that are simply being missed. The trade of convenience is replacing finer nuance, which is fine for amateur things but not so much the case with “peak craft”

Even as I type this out my little spelling mistskes are simply autocorrected if I choose, I can go back and edit to make up for my chubby fast fingers tapping on the screen. And this whole issue isn’t just relegated to art or gundam but humanity as a whole - we have lost our edge

If I offended you, it wasn’t my intention. And I’m not trying to lambast digital art - I’m certainly not talking about erosion of creativity either, however I am suggesting that the division created by “digital” v “analog” removed or at least halved the progress of the competitive pool to push each other into becoming better and removing the idea of “breaking through” and switching it for “well analog is so hard, I can just switch to digital and get my art out” and the self improvement factor pivots from grinding to learning a new ability.

Instead of developing level 20 hand drawn art we simply have level 15 hand drawn art with level 10 digital art - those 10 levels of digital art could have been ground into more and more progress towards hand drawn art but instead it wasn’t, so total peak performance is down.

“Practice makes perfect” used to be the name of the game but now its just about “oops, its okay I can just reload my progress” the same reason 90’s video games were so brutally unforgiving in today’s autosave world.

as for the ai art aspect thats just another layer of humanity’s move towards automation and ease - you’d never see the mistakes you see in AI art with a *true* hand drawing king, they would’t allow themselves to make such simply mistakes because each line is a case by case basis with purpose instead of some algorithm that is effectively doing auto-fill. 

You two cents is kind of lost in some half offended rant about saving grace for yourself - put the ego aside and look at what I am saying objectively. It has nothing to do with pettiness or downvotes or even reddit, it has to do with the divergence of having so many options which eroded the complexity of the original medium. As a result we have duller minds, softer hands and less determination to improve or become the very pinnacle of the best.
While it is not my favorite (that's unicorn) I will agree that 0080 is absolutely peak.
He sure does.
oh i can have a conversation all day long. look at my other responses on this thread and you can see that i back up all of my arguments.  its just, the fact that you couldnt see a huge difference in the design cues between those series means it would require too much explaining for me to want to give you an explanation. but here is an answer that i gave to someone else on a different comparison that might apply to this one: 

https://preview.redd.it/dadzp8bmbgod1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=49fea5ee2151adeef3066f8b3641ec42cdd18066
2/2

There are 4 problems with your assumptions:

 the first is supposing that competition is the most important driving force for improvement, maybe for some but the most intrinsic driving force is simply the personal craving for improvement and artistic identity. We may like to share our work, some of us care about likes way too much but in the end we are our own most important audience. Even disregarding that being more skilled does not necessarily directly translate to being on top of visibility, don't believe me? Go ask on the art business sub but even before the digital era, there are plenty of artists that are famous now that only got their work recognized after death.

The second is assuming that lower entry barrier means intrinsically lower skill ceiling, the fact that there are corrective tools does not mean intrinsically that everyone will be perpetually reliant on them nor that the final output will be of lower quality. Again, the typewriter example, someone writing an entire chapter on a typewriter without redoing a page can serve as proof of skill, still doesn't mean the final result is better than if it had been written on Word.

The third is oversimplifying art progression. Artistic competence relies on a varied set of skills and they can translate to other mediums both directly and indirectly through synergy. The reason why I'm so certain about my stance is because of empirical experience, contrary to your assumption I have far more time doing traditional art, Ive been doing digital for about a year, when I went back to traditional not only I had improved at it, I had improved at a higher rate than before. Dealing with different problems actually improved other aspects of my skill set. It's not a videogame class system, art skills don't always work in such linear way. Trying different media can actually make you a better artist overall. (A large chunk of art skills is not even intrinsically medium specific). 

Fourth is associating the value of a medium based on its difficulty. Digital doesn't exist to be the easy version of "pen and paper" it is it's own medium with its own crafting methods, people will resonate with different mediums on a personal basis. What you value in art isn't necessarily what I value in art. For me my idea of improvement is mainly linked to design quality (concept art) and very specific rendering, I will pick the medium that is better suited for it, someone who wants to do photorealism will pick graphite/charcoal. Someone interested in portraits will likely pick oil painting and so on. We don't need to commit artistic eugenics to "save" art from degradation for "peak artist", different mediums serve different niches and different people. "Peak craft" is linked to the artist, not medium not what other people are doing.

~~Except for genAI, we should banish this disgusting acursed aberration back to the hellish dark pit from which it came with extreme prejudice (I wasn't being hyperbolical before btw, how dare you!).~~
Thank you for the screenshot. I wasn't saying you were wrong, I was just genuinely curious why you said to remove those. I didn't think you were weird for suggesting it, just wanted to see why someone thought differently than me because I like hearing other people's point of view.

You seemed pretty defensive and I don't know why, but then you also seemed a little gatekeepy which was even more odd as all I did was ask why you suggested that.

I just happen to like 90's anime art styles the most because that's what I grew up with. 2000's was a little too saturated and 2010's was too flashy. It's why I didn't like Seed or the Thunderbolt movies that much.

With regard to your point about the inspiration coming from an engineering mindset, but F91 and Turn A are based centuries after, so it's only natural that they may have a more "fantasy" design.

Again, not saying you're wrong, I was just basically saying "hey, I like the way anime was drawn in the 90's."
Let me preface by saying AI art disgusts me - I abhor it. I am an opponent of AI art - it should be called “automatic art”, and I would call it dog shit except for each one of my dog’s coils is unique from the other and each one is its own work.


So with point 1 I would argue that the desire to improve one’s self *is* in fact spurned by competition because without others to share your progress with, it would be a lonely world indeed.

Point 2: writing used to include its own “style” of font, each writer had to become not only good with the pen and the craft of word structure but also had to create their own visible writing font - you actually prove my point better than I could have: almost nobody does “handwriting” anymore and the amount of “ fonts” one can change the machine to set has reduced the need/desire for penmanship style, the advanced calligraphy in english is out the window worse than a Russian diplomat.

 
I can’t actually argue with your third point because it opened my eyes to a way of thinking I wasn’t aware of or had thought of and it was actually a refreshing notion, so thank you for that consideration

Now with your fourth point I can only hope you are correct - and that there will be a tapering off point from what I call “the swarm” or the general status quo - eventually enough people will break off into their own stylistic groups and the “new hotness” of using computers to enhance/create will level off and more unique Hand Drawn/Digital hybrids will arrive, humans do their best work with when tools are like “spices” to enhance their work, not to actually do it. I like to think that when faced with no other options, humanity pushes its boundaries further than it ever could - hence why swordsmanship begins at a young age, as a for instance. The ability to master a talent before beginning to improve it and push it to new levels of decency is exquisitely important to its true potential increase - “thinking you know it all” only to find out that your knowledge only plateaued would be not only embarrassing to the self but shameful to the craft, even the very best keep improving.

If humanity is to keep building new tech to enhance ourselves, we must at the very least keep enhancing ourselves with it and in spite of it, otherwise we’re the tools will become us. Reverse polarity exists in many forms and one of them is “master the tool before it masters you” - in my personal work I rely on myself before anything else because it begins and ends with me, but using assistants - whatever they look like, enhances it, but it doesn’t change my fundamentals not does it take over for me - in fact my job was taken over by machines a long time ago but still the limitations of building safe work platforms has reached its maximum objectivity with those skylifts and swing stages, at the end of the day a guy still has to go up into the conveyer belts at -40 * C in the blowing wind to assemble a safe place for the welder to do his work or nothing goes back online.

I truly hope that the “gothic” style of art we saw from the late 90’s will resurge and take our minds to new heights, and if it takes months for an artist to produce a work that is truly invigorating, than so be it - as long as it was done with passion and created by the self with their heart and soul.

I have to say, I have rather enjoyed this discourse
F91 takes place 27 years after Gundam Unicorn and about 40 after stardust memory, It’s not centuries after, So not THAT far into the future. 

What sets F91 and The formula series mobile suits apart is that they have less of an industrial mechanical look and more of a 90s race car design. They have spoiler like fins, lots of vents and exhaust grills, lots of lines, the thruster designs are fairly unique on F91. The big red F91 shoulder decals with that super 90s font.  BUT the animation style is still that super detailed hand drawn animation that’s so incredibly awesome. It’s a beautifully animated movie. It’s too bad it wasn’t fully realized.
Fair, I forgot it wasn't that far into late UC, for some reason I was thinking it was after G-Savior. 

I agree with the design deviating from the more mechanical look, I just like that 90's anime style and I think that race car style Gundam was such a cool and unique concept
G-savior is after V gundam like G-savior is the last part of the uc time line before it turns in to turn A or the recongista time line?
It’s that time of the year again

Yes.  Time for the Earth Federation and Principality of Zeon to have a Christmas truce with each other for at least one Christmas day, a la the Allied and Central Powers throughout World War I.  Because war is bad, and Christmas is all about forgiving your enemies and being friends and family with them, instead.

I'm sure it's what Yoshiyuki Tomino would have wanted, and why he created Mobile Suit Gundam in the first place.

After the colony drops any chance of a widespread Christmas truce would be completely gone, with the exception of a couple more empty / quiet fronts. 

Would be cool to see interactions between the two sides in the hours immediately after the ceasefire though

Live "average soldier" reaction
Ainz mentally to Dark Young "Also don't crush the soldier with the mic. The last thing my new kingdom needs is the bad PR from splatting a potential undercover journalist."
He already looks dead inside

Yep. I was wondering if anyone would pick up on that subtext. Nice.
Just started Overlord, the Ainz vs Clementine fight was SO SATISFYING
Like what a cocky bitch. Love it when characters like that get put in their place.
Clementine was used to being a big fish in a small pond. She ended up fighting a leviathan who came from the bottomless abyss.
Before you start season 2, I wanna know your opinion on Lizards, do you love or hate them?
Well deserved for killing those first friends of Momon.
Wait until you find out what happens to the other 'short hair blonde' girl
So sweet they are hugging each other❤
If you like cocky characters getting smacked then look forward to Season 2.
Aoi Yuki did an amazing job voicing Clementine. Specially during the fight.
"Oh I forgot to tell you, I'm very Hypocritical". Still my favorite Ains quote.
>!You have heard the kiss of death but how about the hug of death! !<
I wish I can experience Overlord for the first time all over again.  That was such a good conclusion to the arc.
It was one of the best sweet revenge moment.
Call me strange but I'm in my 50s and love this series. There are a lot of twists and turns that you may not catch the first time watching, and that is the kind of depth I crave in a good storyline.
wait ainz vs clementine fight? seemed more like a one sided hug of death to me op
Yea, "fight"
It’s a stretch to call it a fight given how it went
Wish we could have seen more of her, loved her design and fighting style

https://preview.redd.it/ywe5jjhn202d1.jpeg?width=622&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4da93cc76ab8137354d91daad5fc136374584743

Also, wow she was STRONG. Remember that she was completely disadvantaged against Ainz as her weapons can't hurt him, yet she managed to damage his armor which was made from his magic. In comparison when Brain, the second best fighter of the kingdom, managed to break Shalltear's fingernail he was overjoyed
Ngl, seeing clementine get crushed like a walnut in a hydraulic press will never stop being insanely satisfying

She seriously earned it
I can fix her 😳
fight? It was just a little foreplay before hugging each other. :)
A fellow hug enjoyer.
In the name of Canon, does he resurrect her, or was that unofficial?
You can't out evil an Overlord.
This fight is why I don't hug strangers. 😉
He should have made her a new servant just for those who love fan service
Indeed, watching these people who claim to be the pinnacle of humanity fight Ainz is hilarious as well as insightful. She never stood a chance😂
Felt kind of bad the Ainz didn't bring the tortured girl back to life... In his own way he repays here late I suppose.
Honestly I was happy she died and didn't turn into a "she's cute, how about I try to fix her" stick, and damn was it satisfying to watch her die after what she did
Yes the first time watching that was wonderful.
They hug it out in the end.
Fight? That was pre so ainz just breaking in a new toy.
Indeed, I came so many times
I want someone to hug me like ainz does to clementine
Big hug! Cronch
Yes! Loved this episode
I was rewatching Overlord for the idk how maby times and i LITERALLY just finished this episode again.

So satisfying.
One of the better fan service animes
It deserves at least 1 more season such a great show
Muryama takes serious issue with blonde girls. Can anyone name a blonde character from the new world that doesn't get murdered, brutalized, or becomes an enemy of Nazarick?

Does Muryama need to tell us something?

I can only think of Enri and Renner.
Idk why do i get turned on from women death scenes. 

Especially those you crush between your bones... Delightful.
Things will be even more satisfying further.
Honestly it was horrifying
Things will be even more satisfying further.
But she such a baddie frfr
"You are a woman in an anime you don't get character development, NOW DIE!!!"
There is a retro game who show what happen to Clementine
Enjoy it while it lasts, thungs go downhill all the way frim S2 to S3
Yup yup... the only one I follow this series...
But this bict already died🥶
Me who thinks that s4=s3>s2>s1 but still finished overlord fully 6+ times 😁
Agreed 👍
I just finished this episode.
Yeah wait until you get to the one with The healer girl

The one who was adventuring for her Little sisters because her parents 

Who are assholes who keep spending all the money because they can't get over the fact of their not nobles anymore.



Because I feel bad for her


( And yes, before I hear it for the Millionth time I know Ainz Isn't supposed to be a good guy I can feel bad for a character if I want to.)
”you took your time with her didnt you”
I recently watched it my first time myself, it really was. She thought she could take on AINZ of all people lol 😆
"Haha Huggies! Snuggle Wuggles UwU" the fight.


-Nabe step on me-
Realistically he would use his skeleton penis and R word her
Oh yeah, that fight tealy popped off!
In reality, She is actually a big fish in the NW. She can fight against Adamantine rank Adventurers, which means She is a top tier human. Lv.25-30 is a big deal in the NW.

Not in the main story and we don't really know what happened to her body at the end, but for some reason we have seen her in several spin-offs coming back to life in various ways or just being around.
Her body went missing. But it was implied that she is alive and met with Zach (guy that solution ate) jn a alleyway before he was driving solution and sebas
I haven't actually played it, but isn't she the subject of the game that's on Steam? It's probably not canon, though.
I don't think she would've been able to withstand resurrection
In his blog post regarding this volume from 2012, Maruyama says something along the lines of, "I always wondered why in light novels, male characters are always dying but the cute girls aren't that hurt. I wanted to depict a gruesome death for a cute girl."

Heavily paraphrased bcus memory, but it was defnitely there. You see him continue with this notion throughout the series, even switching what popular votes decided as survival in WN to be gruesome deaths in the LN for the same reason.

As a funny side note, I think the same blog post had him write something like, "You didn't expect that Clementine would be the type to fall in love with Ainz-sama, huh? I want to grow/write a harem for Ainz." And then he also had some note about how Ainz was the second person to touch Clementine's breasts ever. . . Maruyama had some intriguing thoughts about the novel's direction back then.
Idk about any of that, but the voice acting was phenomenal
What the fuck lmao

Yeah, she says so herself that the only people she wants to avoid in the kingdom are Brain and Gazef. Even then it seems like she's avoiding them more for convenience than a real fear of losing.
She was a small fish in Black Scripture before she ran away.  But yeah, overall when compared to *Humans*, she was *a* big fish, yet still way below the biggest fishes in her own backyard.
"PROFESSIONALS have STANDARDS."
In general.
Would you for instance, ever consider fucking a lizard? It will become relevant, we assure you ;)
Death by broken bones.
For Clementine internally, Death by Snu Snu
In the web novel you mean
The novel version is low key worse
Someone else: "Dude, he ruptured her internal organs."

Albedo: "Did I fucking stutter?!"
It is, you could even see the twinkle in Ainz eyeball sockets while hugging her.
Solid point. I never considered that.
Muryama definitely faps to guro
Nah, too gruesome for my taste. Just an elegant death would suffice.
At that stage in the series, Gazef is mentioned to only barely be in the Realm of Heroes, so I think he was maybe Upper Level 29 or Lower Level 30, and Brain was weaker than him then, so less than that. On the other hand, Clementine was a prevalent Hero Slayer and a seat of the Black Scripture, so she was definitely floating between Level 31-35. Her equipment (excluding Gazef's Kingsom Treasures) and martial techniques seemed better than both Gazef and Brain as well, so I doubt she was avoiding them because she couldn't kill them. Definitely just would be a timestopping inconvenience and delay in her plans at the time.
She also mentioned “maybe someone from blue rose”
I think it's for the best to specify that the lizard in question is sentient
All thoughts occur in time. One who hasn't considered will eventually. 

Also. Would.

Me after that scene (I was disgusted with myself).....(I wasn't)
With a good ending tho.
what is it lol
I mean she left her real gear at Slaine and the new stuff just whatever she found. Plus Brain style kinda counter her, her signature move was bullet in and kill with 1 strike while Brain have extra speed boost inside his zone, so a 50-50 at best
Im guessin either Evil Eye or Lakyus specifically. Lakyus had to be tricked, beaten, and poisoned several different times for Blue Rose to overpower her while Evil Eye is a powerful mage with the increased power of a vampire.
Unimportant
Shouldn't this have been a picture of Shinji?

You made me laugh hahaha
Lmao
Wasn't saving her sisters reward for teaching Ainz dancing?
It still 50-50 since it back to timing, they both can 1 hit each other which mean both couldnt gauge the other speed. And Brain also a seasoned veteran who has pride in his speed and strength (like when he believe he could cut down Zero with tattoo) so it high chance he has way to deal with tanker

That's not Ainz, Ainz wouldn't do anything to them just because their sister did something wrong.
Not the sister arche she has to comply
To shalltear, yes. Saving the sisters was Ainz's reward to Arche so I would think they are under Ainz protection. And I did mean the Arche, Ainz wouldn't do anything to them(sisters) even if their sister(Arche) does anything wrong

This really hits hard…
1:1 scale RG right here
So it’s a Gundam frame now.
As sad as I am to know I'll never get to see it IRL, i gotta say that inner frame looks cool as hell. Does anyone know if any of the model kits for the RX-78-F00 have that inner frame?
I really wish I could seen it in person
No ab crunch
That inner frame looks so cool. I know it's just being dismantled and moved, but I always like to imagine RX-78 is being deployed. Ah well, silly, but there you go.
1:1 Gundam isn't even a Master Grade. That's a Full Mechanics frame.
Can’t believe the went to the trouble to panel line the frame…
I never realized it actually had a semi “functional” cockpit

Also a part of me feels like they could’ve done a RG or MG RX-78F00 with a similar inner frame to this
There's no way they just permantly scrap it right?

They're finally making the Gundam at home

This really highlights how little room there would be for a   pilot IRL.

Fans of frames must be lit.

Looks cool as hell to be honest
Is that a cockpit frame?
This really sucks, however as an engineer this is the coolest thing. The picture shows exactly how it works which is so cool.
Will live forever in our hearts.
The Unicorn gundam at diver city is still worth seeing
Ah, so it's a master grade
Rg 1/1 scale looking interesting
Great! Now's the perfect chance to start adding Zaku Parts!
I can't wait until the production models are available.
it's gunboy wilbur 😮
(Life goes on is playing on the background)
I cannot unsee it having high heels.
On the bright side its not being destroyed its just being moved as well as the store and museum
The gotta release the inner frame as its own kit
All PG frames gonna go back to this
This makes me uncomfortable for some reason. Like I'm seeing something I'm not supposed to.
Are they taking it down? What happened?
You could say the same things about my dreams.
pov: master grades
Is that the maintenance entrance on the chest?
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!”
My only regret in life is that I never got to see this thing in person :')
Ay IBO !!!! LESS GOOO. Even when it's getting dismantled it's giving gundam vibes. It's sad watching it go 😢
Seeing all these pictures of it being disassembled is surreal. I saw it in February, and it was just amazing how large it looked in real life that I don't think any picture could have done it justice without having crossed over the fencing to get closer.
gundam frame huh?

What if we put Barbatos instead?
Glad I managed to visit Gundam Factory this March before it closed for good. This really hits hard.
Now it looks like it was being used to take over the earth kingdom
The real grade frame was inside every one of us all along.
[F]
Huh. I did not think it would be such a simple mechanism for movement. Making an actual gundam may not be as much of an arduous journey as I thought...
F
In here from all, what are we looking at?
next time, gadget, i mean, gundam...
RG 1.0
alright, I'd actually buy a model kit of this because it looks kinda sick
im always been amazed that they built it like a gunpla 😅.
Anyone know if there is a Timelapse of it coming apart?
giant rg frame
Those joints are crazy!
*They took my fucking eyes*
those 1st gen rgs are pretty crazy
Damn!! They replying or what
Torso area should have a cavity for a pilot.
😢

Well we can do that so why not just use it to build a gundam🧍(Idk if it’s unpractical)
I want to cry. That had hit me real hard.
Surprised they're dismantling it at all
I really enjoyed Yokohama. Don’t know if I would have visited if it weren’t for the statue. Hope
It can go up some where else. It’d be sick if it ended up In the US
Edgar your skin is hanging off your bones
*Creepypasta intensifies*
Was this the one outside Diver City Plaza? That shit was so rad!
Woah, Gunboy-Wilbur
😭
Wait what happened
Why r they taking it down?
I wonder what they're going to do with all those pieces?
Oh that is gorgeous. That is a superb thing of beauty.
:’(
Have they said where their sending it next?
EXPOSED FRAME IN MY SOUL

SOMETHING SOMETHING

IBO
what grade of gundam is it
and how much
As sad as this is, it’s really cool that it has an actual inner frame.
So sad. Would have loved to see it in person.
NNNNOOOOOOOOO
rg commercial
How nice of them to replace it with the statue of barbatos rex
Now put gurren lagann on it 🐱
I just thought this was them building a new one and thought they were building an EVA unit
I saw it in person way back in 2016, it was glorious
With included E.R.S (early real grade syndrome)
Lmao what I was thinking too
Raise your flag!
*IBO Main Theme starts playing in the background.*
this is actually true
Put a new armor, and these baby are good as new.
what have you done?! you've summoned the edgelords!!
The only thing that had the frame is the $1000 Chogokin dx set. You could take the armor off of it

Looking up the 1/100 on Dalong, not really close besides just having that typical inner frame look.

You'd probably find something more like it on different RX 78. It kinda reminds me of the pre-built frame from early RG models.
I have. Kinda just was strolling around and came across it. Dude at the entrance was my biggest fan ever. Glad I still have the pictures.
Same
Same here

I Didn’t have the chance to see it
What about the giggity-giggity-goo?
"Silver tier"
*Oh the irony*
And the weathering is so freaking realistic. That's the mark of a true craftsman. Attention to details that nobody might ever see.
I wouldn't call it fully functional, it was more so just a place to sit. It was never occupied during the shows, obviously.
https://youtu.be/wPNCj5AfHWY?si=u27Pz9PikKdegizy
Around 1:34 the cockpit opens.
I believe they’re relocating it. So they gotta take it apart and put it back together at the new location.
The parts will definitely be put into storage. You don’t make something like a 1/1 Gundam and just scrap it when you’re done with it. 

It remains to be seen if they’ll rebuild it somewhere else. I imagine they’ll want to at least take the opportunity improve on some things if they decide to put it back together.
[deleted]
I was gonna comment that it looks like the G-Frame frames, but by god youre right, it's Wilbur
Nobody expected For The Barrel reference
The J stands for Joe. Joe Gundam himself
Only with a gel ink pen lmao j/k
Probably still far more than a fighter jet or even a modern tank if you fully crew it
Core block system!
Yes
It is but it pales in comparison
In the end, it all goes back to them BIG FEET.
It was always supposed to be a temporary attraction, due to salt water and location iirc
Maintenance i think
No, cockpit.
No, the physics still don't work out.
The problem is balancing it.
The inner frame for the life size Gundam they just recently took down
*replacing
This one was in Yokohama, the Unicorn Gundam is still at diver city!

It's being scrapped
That’s a different one. This one had a moveable frame
These are resin kits meant to stand like statues! Not cool scale model robots that can mimic action poses done in the shows!
Koe no kagiri!
🫡
Why can’t they just build the barbatos?
[Barbatos…](https://youtu.be/-0S2FiplJaY?si=ZxDzpA7K6Im8jgAn)
*headbangs to Rage Of Dust*
Says the one with a Heero profile picture.
That is actually awesome as fuck.
That's awesome!
The beautiful spread?
Yeah I was already kinda aware of that; my fault for not wording it properly mb
Where is the new location actually.
Considering how often it would malfunction and just simply not work in the later days of its run (the second to last day it was open it didn’t work at all) I really doubt it. This thing was built to be temporary and they kept it going for much longer than expected. Saying goodbye is okay.
Yeah, wasn't the platform it was located on starting to crumble due to the weight of the Gundam?
Where?
What does the Chinese government have to do with this?
It's so sad I wanted to see it when I traveled to Japan 🥺😭
No, they're taking it down, it was temporary. Maybe it will move somewhere else eventually but they haven't announced anything so far
Have you forgotten? Physics can be weird by itself already!
The problem is making a frame that dosent crumple under its own weight
Use a systematical gyro followed with ground detection and gravitational detecting system to to apply a knowledge on the current point it needs to be, then apply human-like progamming so that it does such human-like actions to continue and try to remain standing up
Why/where was it?
Depressing
Koe no kagiri!
No one as the alaydushhds vinanasdnsa

bro how do you spell it
Because seeing Barbatos moves like animatronics are cursed.

The thing about Iron Blooded Orphan's Gundam Frame is about how human-like their movement is.
Risk of breaking and falling. His waist is too dang sexy!
Wich of the 6 or so forms?
he was faithful to his goal, plus hr had an actually good show
Swivel HERE
Nothing has been announced. Just people speculating.

  
Most compelling thing I've kind of heard is Osaka, in part because of the world's fair in 2025.
Is there a gundam base or something in Kyoto? I think it might be there.
Wouldn't surprise me. However maintainance is probably also just really expensive. It's right against the ocean, and saltwater is HORRIBLE for metal.
Ignore that I didn't pay enough attention And thought this was about the Freedom in China.
It is very much possible to do so with a metal that has a combination of the property of spring steel and the density or strength of carbon hardened/carbon steel. If a material like that can be obtained, it may be possible. Either that or recreating metal from meteorites.
Easier said than done. On a smaller scale, Boston Dynamic probably has it down but on a gundam scale, we are decades off.
Due to upkeep on it they are taking it down, it was located at the Gundam Base in Yokohama.

He had an actually good show? Wait are we talking about Wing here?
INdividually articulated fingers 👌
It certainly won't be Kyoto the Gundam Base there is tiny compared to diver city, and there is no room for even a normal gundam statue outside the shopping mall it's part of.
Yeah, but not a century tho

Not at all.

Grandpa moves like regular mobile suits, so it's easier to make a moving statue with it.. Fast, but still robot like. Its not until MK-II we have mobile suits moves like a person.

Got something in its acgu-eye
That's one of the main issues with mobile suit design I have, there seems to be a very limited number of sensor arrays, like the Zaku mono eye, which once disabled it renders the mobile suit useless, at first I liked to think that it was only the main optical sensor, but many times happen that if the head is disabled or destroyed the pilot is blind and disoriented. We in modern times have multiple cameras in and around our cars, which give us a nice awareness of the surroundings, so it's kind of stupid to think that what are essentially the most complex machines ever built by humans in almost every Gundam continuity fail to take account of that.
Does Ainz let Naberal Gamma use 4th or 5th tier magic since they're Adamantite, or is she stuck using 3rd the entire time as Nabe?
Since 3rd tier is around Platinum by the NW standards and 4th tier is Orichalcum. Is she allowed to use higher or only 3rd?
When they first started out, that was the plan, only because Ainz was not certain what kind of potential dangers the team would encounter as adventurers. At this point, he's pretty confident that in this line of work, 3rd tier magic is sufficient for *most* kinds of work requests.
Normally she’d cast up to the third tier.

In volume 2 she was also told to cast 5th tier magic in an emergency.

“The two of them had already discussed their plans for emergencies. Narberal would cast magic of the fifth tier if things came to that. And if that did not work either, Ainz would shed his armor and take the situation a little seriously.”

Excerpt from
Overlord, Vol. 2: The Dark Warrior
Kugane Maruyama & so-bin”

And, of course, when she fought the Skeleton Dragons she was authorised to cast 7th tier magic.

As for her actual magical limit I’m not sure of. But it’s safe to say if she were to cast to her actual abilities it would cast much, much more attention on her.
Only 3rd tier as it's the highest impression by general and as Nabe. I imagine she could use 4th and 5th tier magic now that they're adamantite and kinda famous in adventurer news.
That's obviously Momon and not Ainz. Why do people mistake these two so much..
I don't care what the story say, look at the tear! Let her cast some spells here and there. Every mage needs to release their spells at least once a day.

![gif](giphy|eBN6oifiv4k5G)
Don’t cry, Narberal. If the doujins out there are to be believed, Ainz will do plenty to make it up to you
Is it just me or is Momon doing the Suffering From Success pose...?
I’m pretty sure there’s a passage that says exactly what tier she’s allowed to use normally, and then a tier if she’s in actual danger. But I don’t remember where or which tiers
The pick looks like  
"when your bf is too busy being cool and mysterious so he forgets to call you mommy" or "you after bf scold for saying 'come to mommy' in front of his friends"
The image is very cute
I think Narberal Gamma can use 5th tier without permission. In her battle with Lhaljiit, Narbe used Dragon Lightning to fight the Skeleton dragon. But after Ainz gave her permission to show the true strength of Nazarick, she up the ante to Chain Dragon Lightning which is a 7th tier spell.
This picture gives me the "senpai I'm pregnant what do we do" vibe
Only 3rd Tier. Above that is an anomaly and would bring unwanted attention, even as Admantite. Maybe he'll let her use 4th Tier.
Narberal should be his third wife
Lol this honestly looks like Ainz is suffering from ED or something.

"I'm sorry, Naberal... this doesn't usually happen..."
No one can convince me he can’t stop being an undead if he wanted to I’m 100% sure he could through magical means become human or whatever else he wanted
I'd say he allows her to use up to 5th tier magic, since adamantite class mages can use it.
I think Narberal Gamma used level 3 magic during her time as Nabe because she wasn't upgraded yet? (someone tell me)
Restricted to 3rd tier unless the situation calls for it 
She had to use chain dragon lightening against Kahjit, which is a 6th tier spell if I’m not mistaken
All magic enabled residents of nazeric are able to use up to 9th tier magic at minimum with the focused one's being able to use up to 12 tier magic and super tier magic was exclusive to players so only mc can use it as for combat focused one's they have skills that can bridge the gap and allow them to fight on equal terms with magic casters

Up to 5th.
  No
Naberal Gamma is lvl 63, she can cast 10th tier. Only needs 54 levels to be able to cast tier 10. She casted tier 7 spell with meta magic (twin maximized magic dragon lighting), that alone is hint enough that she can cast tier 10.

Also spell modifiers increases with level, Nabe's tier 3 magic is not the same as a new worlder's tier 3 magic.
Tier 3 is good enough for newbie that is extremely talented since tier 4 and 5 is for Great Mage like Fluder (he is nearing tier 6) and tier 7 is considered peak of magic while anymore above is considered at godhood.

Most mage is around tier 1 to 2.
When are they gonna give us a 3rd and 4th season?!
When nabe took her anti divination ring off in front of fluder, fluder estimated her to be able to cast 8th magic, and then estimated Ainz to be in the 10th tier class. Not sure if he could see actual talent/capability or just the amount of mana a person has, but since band is like below level 70, 8th tier magic would be a reasonable guess of her limits,
Not sure if the side shows are canon, but in ple ple pleadies, she said she can cast up to 10th tier on a good day.
Her tier limit is tied to to how many magic classes of the same type she has
Shed his armor, what does Ainz mean with that? Because from how I understand that line, it doesn't make any sense: why would he prefer to reveal himself being an undead over Narberal revealing she can cast higher than 5th tier?
I don't get it either they look and act completely different
Believe it or not in the original Japanese and surprisingly English dubs both Momon and Ainz have the same voice voice actors. So people are probably thrown off by the voice.
Momon and Ainz sound kinda similar but like come on obviously momon is a warrior class and Ainz is well to quote SAO abridged a "cheating haxor f*****" (distinguished title).
watch Isekai Quartett to see her Reaction to the spell Ainz used to make it snow\^\^
I don't remember exactly, but I think this picture of her being sad was in response to Ainz telling her she can't address him as "sama" in public lmao.
Now that's disgusting!
Tell me the numbers so I can clearly avoid them!

Reminded me of this at first.
It was 3 and then 5. Though when she was released to be narberal gamma she had  no restriction
This is oddly specific...
I think that’s just because she planned to leave no witnesses
First
Agreed.
Narberal IS his third wife. The one he takes on trips
A man of culture and reason!
Nearing? Fluder CAN use 6th tier, and rituals are needed to use make shift 7th tier and even then we've (as far as I can recall) only seen the Slane Theocracy and Khajit's group do that. 
 
6th is the highest humans can use.
Eh? We have a 3rd and 4th season. ._.
Fluder could roughly guess based on mana capacity how much the tier one could do. That's what his experience taught him. **But** Bone Daddy made him reconsider his experience.
jokes on fluder, Ainz can cast super tier magic!
I swear I thought it was going nuts.

I remember reading some source outside the novels about her being able to cast 9th Tier magic but I could not find it after reading this post.

I think it was a Ple Ple Pleiades episode after all! I’ll have to rewatch them to find out.
with the right equipment she can..i read it on light novel dont know what volume so basically just give her equipment can boost mana pool
>Shed his armor,

Not about his undead status, it's about Ainz being the best magic caster between the two, if his swords can't kill it, "Nabe" can't kill it, and if even Naberal can't kill it, Lord Ainz will be able to.

Edit: the armor itself restricts his magical capabilities, I believe he can only cast up to 3rd tier iirc though I may be wrong about the tier limit
Imagine theres like idk a really big frog infront of you that you cant kill with 5th tier magic. 
I think that it would be more lowkey if Ainu shed his armor and did some „you should kys“ shenanigans instead of narberal calling a big ass meteor or smth like that.

(I have not read the light novels and watched the anime for Albedo. Please shit on me if i said some bullshit rn)
Same height and general build I guess.
I'm pretty sure it's a joke but Momon And Ainz are the same person 💀
>!434946!<
Only
Tbf he estimated 10th, then immediately went "no, even above that?!"
It's 8th based on level counting. If her classes were different, she's high enough level to be 9th.
Can't she just use less flashy magic? For example, Chain Dragon Lightning is tier 7, but looks a lot less flashy than Electrosphere which is tier 3.
But Momon is jacked and muscular and Ainz is nothing but bones
Completely asinine! How could that damnable Sorcerer King be the same entity as the great hero Momon!? Don't you hear yourself when you talk!?
Ainz and Momon literally walk around together?? R u dense

Nah that would be impossible ! How can Momon and Ainz be the same person
Ah...one of the best ones.
This is peak overlord ✍️✍️🔥🔥🔥
Ainz can probably pull some illusion magic like when he showed his "face" to Swords of Darkness,
He might be bones, but "he might have the strength comparable to 5.000 soldiers while Momon went toe to toe against the demon Jaldabaoth, surely stronger than a mere magic caster"

I mean, so were Genya and Gyomei. It wasn't meant to be something only Marked Demon Slayers could accomplish.
what do u mean. the marks right there. 💢
Well he is the Lord of the Mountain
Inosuke is just stronger at base/physically.
Inosuke also passes through all that training faster than Zenitsu. I really would like to see how he fares with Muichiro and Sanemi. Bonus for Mitsuri training , do they just out-flexible each ? ( Inosuke dislocates his shoulder for funsies so flexibility is not a problem for him )
Zenitsu moved it so fast that it happened off camera.
only tanjiro managed to push it all the way in one go tho.
I mean he can move his organs around. He’s special in his own non demon slayer ways.
He's lord of the mountain for a reason 🌸
Good for him
It is, thanks to tempura
Expected nothing less from ***Yama no Kami*** !!
I mean dude is from the mountains though 😌
Insosuke's strength comes purely from motivation. No technique no breathing no bs thinking. Just "He defeated me I have to do this" and that is what is best about him.
Oh wow it’s true! From the slayers that are still living by the end, Insouke, Zenitsu and Kanao are the only ones that didn’t awaken their marks and get to live past 25
Am I wrong or does the mark only take affect when it appears that mark on his head has been there a while
Yeah 🌫
Inosuke is stronger than tanjiro, he moved it without the DS mark and no incantation
Yeah this is perfectly fine! Inosuke been a Beast since the very first moment, we’re talking about the same guy that can dislocate his own bones to fit in holes no one else can and switch his internal organs out of place when you least expect it🤷🏻‍♂️
Tanjiro: My family! Nezuko! Everyone I care about!

Inosuke: TEMPURA 🍤
Chad :3
Yup 🦋
I think because of the tempura hahaha kidding
Its all about Tempura.
Inosuke is just the goat
INOSUKE TO THE END
He wasn't moving the rock. Inosuke just scared the rick into moving itself
*Pure skill*
Inosuke is a beast
Inosuke has always been physically stronger than Tanjiro
yes, its canon-
Well i mean hes the brute of the group. If he never could then thatd be sad
Inosuke is just built different, he was definitely a prodigy.
How do we know that he was doing it without the marks?
Still, I don't think that man is fully human; made his own breathing style, had no mark, and got that good at sword skill without training?
He's a different level of "I don't want to see that in a dark alleyway"
Inosuke be like : ego breathing 1st form
Don't they usually get the mark somewhere on their face?

Inosuke is wearing a mask, whether or not he got a mark, it won't be visible…

So I guess we'll never know
Yeah, Inosuke grew up in the mountains so his base skills are usually higher than Tanjiros in pure base.

Dont forget

>!He was able to go toe with Upper Moon Two (Even if said demon wasn’t being serious) for a good bit, all without a mark!<

I had a stroke reading this
I mean,Dude is from the mountains though!
Unfortunately it is
Yep, he never officially manifests a mark and is just one badass boar man.
That mark was always there, I thought?  Like yoriichi(except not from birth)
He could have hade a Mark and we just did Not See it
Inoske (I can't spell don't judge me) moved that mf out of pure spite
He was super motivated by tempura 🍤
"Big boss Inosuke!"
It's proven that Tanjiro has to be near the person when their blood pressure is high and they have a fever.
Well so did Genya ( he budged it a little) and Gyomei (this one is out of question). Tanjiro's mark doesn't seem complete and it seems to be permanent. Not saying Inosuke didn't do anything impressive but its not a direct compression to a full mark.
inosukes father was chris redfield
It’s cause he’s the king of the mountains duhhh
Inosuke gets stronger as his competition gets stronger. That's how it is 😂
Obviously because he grew up in the mountains. I wouldn’t expect any less from my boar headed king (The ultimate explanation for anything Inosuke ever does)
Didn't they say in the harisha meeting that activating the mark will strengthen those around you, or something?
tanjiro's just special
Tempura Tempura
I am always a fan of zenitsu 💥 dude jst does stuffs in his sleep..😂
Pig Power
Yes it’s canon! Inosuke is one bad MoFo
Did tanjiro's demon slayer mark have an update?? y is it shaped different
He was raised in the wild alone what do you expect
There's a mark right there on his shoulder /s
Inosuke is an actual genius he grew up in the mountains single handedly crafted his breathing technique and has kept pace with everybody in the show/manga man Is a g
That you can see
HI(M)nosuke
Tanjiro = Goku weakest at first but power spikes with constant training. Inosuke = Vegeta raw strength but can never surpass Goku no matter how much training. Zenitsu = Gohan wimpy but unaware of hidden strength
It was not about mark though
. Genya tells about what they need to learn.. Nothing to do with mark
I thought Genya did confirm to be able to move it without a mark already? Or am i missing something within this post?
Most exciting moment of the season right there
Not sure why being marked mattered here yes Inosuke got so pissed he was falling behind that he did it!!
https://preview.redd.it/ho3i6f75a4dd1.jpeg?width=1169&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ca39ab89ed80158a254c87412cc91dcc81868ad

He does it better than anyone
Haven’t watched the new season yet but read the manga. Holy shit. Inosuke tops.
Bro, look at him he made his own breathing techniques, still alive and happy at the end of the training arc and excited to fight some upper demons lol.
He could have been getting it under mask idk🤷‍♂️
How do you know he has a mask on?
Inosuke just can't let himself be outdone by Tanjiroū. Or anyone else for that matter. 
Inosuke wants to be the strongest Demon Slayer full stop. Tanjiroū only wants to get stronger to fight Muzan Kibutsuji
He is the good of the mountains💪🏼
He's built different. 
I mean, isn't he the only one without a breathing style? He just names his moves right?
Yes, inosuke is just built different. You'll see in the Imfinite castle
Yes.  He and Zenitsu never manifested the mark
Rolling a boulder is easy lol
It’s Inosuke. 

Of Course It’s Canon.
I guess he was working out with the boars
Literally the vegeta of the demon slayer world
I would expect nothing less from the King of the Mountain.
Are you guys confused. Him and zenitsu had to hype themselves up just to do it and tanjiro finished first. It's not specific to having a mark
Tbf, couldn't see his head
I haven’t watched season 4 yet but Inosuke has his boar mask on here, is it not just under it?
Yey he is the weakest of the group
Tbh Bro Is Wanting To Be Strong From The Start
How did u know? He’s wearing a mask
Tanjito might have been the strongest demons slayer after yorrichi if he hadn't died. Tanjiro light have been the weakest demon slayer among other named characters if it was not for the the plot armour. Inosuke is the strongest among the new gen wanne be hashira while zenitsu is the best candidate for next hashira. Yes tanjiro is strong only because he is the mc.
Light work for a king of the mountains such as himself
Well, we can't really see his face soo
Inosuke is actually kinda ridiculously strong. Don’t forget, his natural senses work basically like Akaza’s blood demon art. Tanjiro recalls a conversation he had with Inosuke about it while he’s fighting Akaza, and it’s the catalyst for Tanjiro figuring out how to win. Mix that with his Poison immunity, full control over his body (rearranging organs, extending arms, etc), and the fact that he made his own breath style, Inosuke is way stronger than people give him credit for
https://preview.redd.it/sn7fefbs09dd1.jpeg?width=949&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2ddd1eacbc5c46c5b4282d25ddf20ae4a1062d3

it is canon, yes. no mark. guys a beast after all.
This is why Inosuke, in my opinion, has more potential than Zen (even tho he's my fav, I know when he isn't the best at something) If there's something he can't do, he'll continue trying. The process will go so much faster if he sees someone else do it.
It is spherical so that should help a lot tbh
Well... How do you know he didn't use his mark? His face is covered (it's a serious question, is it like a fact he didn't use it or are y'all just saying that)
He doesn't need a demon slayer mark for that, if the King of the Mountain wants a rock moved then it will move
He is wearing a mask so he could have one and we didn't even know. In theory he could have one and not have noticed it himself.
“This slayer keeps pushing the boulder by sheer force of anger alone.”
What I hate is the fact that tanjiro put a lot of work in trying to move that boulder then Inosuke just suddenly moves it when tanjiro does
It's a cannon ball.
INOSUKE SAN IS SUPERIOR!! I SUPPORT INOSUKE SUPREMACY!!!
Of course. 

For what is boulder? Part of the mountain.

Who is King of the Mountain? Exactly.
Baseline Inosuke is stronger than baseline Tanjiro.
I mean that’s the only thing insouks has over tanjiro strength but everything like speed durability iq battle iq skills haxs and etc go to tanjiro
I mean, so were several other characters. And really thanks to the boar head we don't really know if he had the mark or not
Has anyone actually done the calculations on how much the bolder weighs and how much force it would take to move it
Tanjiro's mark wasn't active either.
[removed]
LMFAOOOO he should be dead!!!! HE GOT STABBED IN THE CHEST!!!!!! FUCK THE POISON, YALL HEARD OF BLOOD LOSS???😭😭😭💀💀💀💀 I love this show but the plot armor throws me across the room in laughter
The mark isnt active at all times , so even if tanjiro does have the mark doesnt mean its boosting his power at the moment
He wears a mask tho
How do we know he didn't have a mark if his mask was on the whole time?
He has his mask on so maybe we just didnt see it 😛
I mean, we don’t know what happened under his mask 😅
How do we know. He has a boar mask on
Why TF aren't they rolling it, a teenager could probably roll that thing forward if they tried
Looking at it from a game perspective, Inosuke is the strongest among the three boiz with only base stats. Tanjiro has the inferior base stats but have the best scaling, earliest powerspike, best weapon, and best skillset.
Where you get that only mark could accomplish, it simply means having mark = stronger so inosuke being able to push it without it is impressive
Gyomei is stronger than inosuke and is far more skilled than him. Inosuke pushing the boulder is far more impressive
Wasn’t it confirmed genya has his mark on his left butt cheek
But Tanjiro, Genya, and Gyomei did it due to Repetitive Action(or wtv its called) Inosuke did it js be he wanted to beat Tanjiro
But Genya wasn't able to move it completely. The thing is that Inosuke's strength is shown to be able to push and complete without the mark. Shows his potential from the GROUP OF 3 not the entire the Demon Slayer
Ofc who tf states a mark is required. its just mark makes you stronger so it would be easier to move the boulder
[removed]
As a symbol glows, power courses through you... Authority.
The mark of the Breath of Correction 😭😭💢💢
It looks different from his demon slayer mark, and it has the silhouette of his forehead scar...honestly idfk at this point
What emoji is that
Honestly, Inosuke is an extremely talented guy when you think about it. Pity he did start off with any formal training
It's interesting consider how Tanjiro came to the Hashira  training like a Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I would have really enjoyed seeing how Inosuke faired with Mitsuri's training or if she spent 5 minutes on him and just let him go
Inosuke would finish Obanai’s training in a blink of an eye since he grew up in the mountains w all those obstacles
Unironically, Mitsuri would have been the best teacher for him. The flexibility of attack... a level of physical power (before breathing) that pretty much no one else can match... an affinity for love that he doesn't understand even when it smacks him in the face... it would be hilarious.
If you put tempura at the finish line Inosuke would’ve finished in one go
Well mark is a huge boost. if this inosuke really did it at base then its more impressive
in one go???? it literally took him multiple days and multiple tries
And? It was possible only using the mark so whats your point?

Still what Inosuke did is more impressive by a long shot
This is cool, but just not true. He learned TCB on his own, and mastered constant TCB like Tanjiro and Zenitsu did. He was also using the repetition technique Gyomei and Genya use to push the rock. He even makes fun of Genya for not being able to use breathing techniques.
The age limit thing is a myth
It's stated that it's getting darker, and also does get darker and darker over the course of the series, implying that it is now always active. The anime didn't portray that as well as the manga.
Take effect*
I thought him repeating tempura then pushing the boulder was his way of repetitive movement
Was it Rick C137?
Because he doesn't have one
Wel mark is kinda big deal i doubt they would not let us know if someone activated it
🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
Yes!
Manga spoilers:

>!As you've already seen, Mitsuri's is on her neck. But Gyomei's is on his forearms and Iguro's is on his left arm. So they can appear anywhere. And Inosuke never got it.!<
The only base skills he has that is higher than tanjiro is at most physical strength.
Why? It's perfectly understandable.
He doesn't
No it just spread, allowing those people manifest if too
Tought himself language too?? A true genius lmao
Mark boost your strength, so it would be easier to do it with it
He probably ate a demon to boost his strength, its not about the mark itself, its the boost in strength to make it easier to push the boulder
Obviously mark boost one's strength? Stronger = easier to push the boulder
No he has Beast Breathing or whatever, he made it himself
Then do it
Not rolling when they are pushing it
He is very strong
Based on [this statement](https://imgur.com/PGCGZ75), I believe that it is now permanently active like >!Yoriichi's was!<
????? nobody was hating on inosuke?? stating that other characters did it as well is not hate???
Imagine being such a fanboy that you are manifesting haters out of thin air just to argue with them. Like what the fuck?
Did you not pay attention when he said he can rearrange his vital organs at will and also stop his bleeding?
Because he takes it off in the Infinity Castle
He takes it off in the manga
First of all it's part of the training to get stronger, and second of all no teenager could roll that thing
No
Zenitsu unlocked hidden perks after putting all his skill points into the level 1 offensive skill.
Inosuke runs on spite, madness and his lack of understanding. There's nothing he can't do.
And Zenitsu is there to roleplay
I mean even in final selection we were told inosuke did it in like record time or sum I can't remember
Well tanjiro is the main character 😅
Why is Tanjiro's sword stronger? If anything, Inosuke's razor dual swords are stronger and dealier against both demon and humans
Lmao that's one way to look at it.
In Paul’s got raw stats, Tanjiro can self buff, Zenitsu spams a single broken ability.
Is Inosuke stronger than Tanjiro?
the sense of touch is his strong suit so you could say it makes sense
Strongest with base stats would be the gun guy since he can move the boulder without using a breathing style right?
And sun breathing is the best attack type against demons as well
Wow. A souls gamer here people. 🫶
Tanjiro literally kicked his ass in hand to hand combat didn’t he?
Huh? What game?

Immediate edit: oh you’re saying to explain it from a gaming perspective. Not bringing up some actual demon slayer game that’s worth bringing up. I’m stupid.
[deleted]
Almost like looking at it from a game perspective isn't a good way to look at it, because it's not a game and game logic doesn't apply
I'm not trying to say that Inosuke pushing the rock isn't impressive at all, I'm saying it wasn't impressive that he was doing it *without a Mark*. It was an exercise intended to be possible for Demon Slayers who don't have Marks, such as Genya. If it were intended to only be possible for Demon Slayers with Marks, and he could push it anyway, *then* it would be impressive that he's doing it without a Mark. As it stands, it's just impressive, no modifier.
Bro what
uooohhh
Fuck, I really went back and forth on upvoting or downvoting this.
buddy chill
I think they’re being sarcastic lmfaooo

ETA: finally get to use this: r/whoosh
It's 💢
Inosuke is the most impressive of the three considering he literally made up his own style with informal training and was able to keep up.
Knowing him he probably saw it like a challenge and tried to compete flexibility with Mitsuri but she would just see it as harmless fun when he sees it as a real contest
i could see gyomei dangling a tempura from a stick in front of him like a cat 💀
Yes, but he did it with repetitive motions like genya. Tanjiro could probs do it markless using repetitive motions as well.
In one go after he learned the proper way to do it - through repetitive motions. When he started to push the boulder in ep 6, he didnt stop until he reached the end in ep 7. Genya and inosuke both used the same technique but still couldn't complete the exercise. And that's bcos they dont have the mark boost.
my point is that if tanjiro didnt have the mark, he'd still be able to do it with repetitive motions. the mark just helped him get it all the way.
Not really. Having a mark in and of itself is impressive. Inosuke has the more impressive base, sure, but Tanjiro is overall more impressive.
Yeah I  am not talking about his motivation to learn these things. I'm saying his sole motivation is competition.
They never said it was a myth. We’re told straight up that every demon slayer who’s unlocked it dies before the age of 25 due to the heavy toll it takes on the body (with the exception of Gyomei who unlocked it at 28 and died hours later, and Yorrichi who was born with it). 

In the postquel manga that appeared in Fan Book 2, Tanjiro says a few words about accepting his short life and being prepared for it. So although not explicitly being shown the deaths of the living slayers, it’s implied that those who achieved the mark during the final battle die before 25 based on the facts that we know.
I hope it's a myth. Makes the ending even more depressing. 🥲
Maybe you're right
Maybe it spread to him and it's just hidden under the mask on his beautiful face? (Idk, i didn't read the mangas)
No he didn’t. Genya quite literally explained that it’s possible without the mark or any breathing abilities through repetitive motion. Also there’s no demons around the training area or anywhere as they were all waiting in the infinity castle. Genya did it in his human state so i don’t think it’s that impressive if inosuke did too 🤷
Three of which didn’t have a mark to boost them at the time so this only mattered for one.
cry kid
That MAKES ZERO SENSE THOUGH, HE WASNT HASHIRA LVL AT THAT FIGHT😂😂😂 my man was still losing lots of blood as he was slicing Dali
Ah yes now I remember, you're right
Oh ok. I haven’t read the manga
Dude picked the cheesiest ability and honestly kept with it through thick and thin
I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
I want this game 😭 imagine an open world demon slayer game where you chose your breathing style and built your own character. Then fighting through demon after demon until you finally help take down Muzan? I wish I could make a game like that myself. I can only beat games, though. I can't make them 😫
The "Maple" of Speed
Zenitsu is basically a warlock who picked all the Eldritch Invocations that buffed Eldritch Blast.
inosuke’s entrance into the infinity castle was cold asf
The fastest in attack and movement speed i guess
Wasnt the final selection a trial in which they had to survive a week on that demon infested mountain top? How do you do that in record time?
He's using yorichi sword
Hes using a legendary blade of the strongest demon slayer
In reality Inosuke's swords would be really bad because he basically destroyed his Katana blades :D
Baseline? Absolutely. Everything but his head is (ironically) stronger. 

Tanjiro carves through demons using his breathing that has a major focus on precision. Inosuke does it by just swinging with raw power. Also, that generation's graduates all have an affinity for a different sense. Inosuke's is Touch. His physical body is his best attribute, like Tanjiro's nose is for him. Inosuke also carves up demons that gave Tanjiro trouble, in terms of durability. Often not by much, but look at the attack on Mugen Train, where Inosuke had to attack first to reveal the weak point for Tanjiro. Look at Spider Dad that Tanjiro straight up couldn't hurt, but Inosuke at least got his blades to sink in before snapping.

Inosuke is 100% the physically strongest of the three main boys.
Zenitsu is never able to push his boulder, making him physically weaker than Tanjiro, Inosuke, Kanao, and Genya who all did push their boulders (Tanjiro the only one who needed to be Marked to do it)
They never said demon slayer mark.
You downvote I upvote?
No like the name
All while crying and taunting him. “ this poor boar lad, can’t get any tempura, namu amida butsu”
He grew up in the mountains and you don't know what the person who trained him taught him. Also, it's a fucking anime.
Zenitsu has crap everything but OP Ash of War
Zenitsu is basically a warlock spamming enhanced Eldritch Blast.
If it ain’t broke
Like an old Ragnarok Online PVPer with every point in attack speed.
The megunim of subaverse
Bro is a genji main fr
I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 sword techniques once, but I fear the man who has practiced one sword technique 10,000 times.
"I fear not the man who has practiced 10000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10000 times."

-Bruce Lee
So does that mean Gyomei practiced 10,000 kicks 10,000 times? 😂
Bruce Lee 2024
Why does every game these days have to be open world I kinda miss linear games
A sekiro style game where you play through the main story would be amazing as well
You could say that. He's like 4th Hokage fast. I remember his skill didn't have cooldown. He could go again and again and again. It doesn't one shot strong demons like how we seem many Hashira do but you can almost see the enemy's lifebar steadily going down with each strike of that level 1 skill. He'll just keep hitting you until you're HP is zero.
Bro got no idea what’s happening and doesn’t care, he just wants to fight something
He has the best sword skill as hes never cracked his blade or destroyed it.
Tanjiro is faster in attack speed, which we will see later.
Not that bit, it was like U have to rush up the mountain and down the other side or something, I think after the actual final selection they were saying he's basically unscathed and rushed down the mountain to the finish and got his nichirin before the other 4 (?) even got down there

He didn’t need to be marked. Even tho the scene looked that way the whole point of tanjiros training was to maintain his mark. So he used the boulder training to do it. If kanao and normal corp members are expected to push the boulder then ofc tanjiro can without the mark lmao.
https://emojipedia.org/anger-symbol
and then inosuke gets pissed off and tries to outdo gyomei, completely forgetting about the tempura in the process XD
Bro I’m saying the plot armor is crazy. Obviously it’s an anime, just read a bit and think a bit longer. I’ve reread the manga like four times. All I’m saying is it’s ridiculous.
Blasphemous blade AOW spam and win
Zenitsu is just playing with pre Nerf rivers of blood.
Suddenly D&D huh
Don't fiddle with it
Nezuko did.
Less agency for the player. Takes away a whole element of exploring. Generally smaller games, likely played faster with less replay value. 

The happy medium to me is God of War style. While open world(ish) it makes you progress at certain parts and directs you, but also allows you to go off and see how much of the area you can clear.
For real that would be so awesome. In that case, I'd expect to just playthrough as Tanjiro from start to finish. Maybe play as some other characters for certain parts or specific fights.
If that's the case then Zenitsu tops in movement speed
He also stole his original sword from a demon slayer he beat up and proceeded to invent his own breathing style
Ah, okay.
His new sword, the one from the mechanical training doll
It's theorized that people with black swords have an affinity for sun breathing. They mention that people with black swords don't last that long. This may be due to using breathing styles they aren't suited to.
Soulsborne ass katana
Wow just wow. Do one for Gyomei"s Flail and axe.
I think you played too much ARPG my dude.
That's fair IG. I didn't expect the protagonist of doki doki literature club to be a demon slayer buff though
Outdo Gyomei? Lol. Inosuke has a reminder of what happens when you try to "outdo Gyomei".
Read the manga, it gives a lot more information on Inosuke.
Pre-nerf Bloodhound's Step
For suuuuuure!. Daki was pissed about that 😂 "iS tHaT alL yOu CaN dO?! iS  kIcK?!"
Thats fair. However I am worried that if every game feels the pressure to be open world it will exponentially increase development times and development costs
Or even a Rising revengance style game if they're worried about accessibility.
Idiot savant perk for sure
Ohh, I'm sorry I kinda forgot
>! During long time Muzan and Kokushibo hunted and killed the Sun breathing users until the point sun breathing become unknown and disappeared, that is why there is the believe that black sword users doesn't last long.!<
this and Muzan order 66-ed sun breathing users that it got wiped out, only surviving as a kagura getting passed down in the kamado family
Yuri was playing too much so I had to join tanjiro and the crew
never stopped him from trying before lol

lightning enhanced swift step with the backhand blades
Some games def shouldn't be open world. That being said, Kakarot is one of my favorite DBZ games, Legend of Zelda has always been open world, and they kick ass at it! GTA is so much fun. My point is, I can definitely see the potential of an open world Demon Slayer game. Side note, have you seen the experimental Open World Naruto game on You Tube?

https://youtu.be/bqs3q7kXFfo?si=-Y5kxSnHudnrzUr-
different genre, demon slayer is adventurous, it could work as open world
I've never played that. Is it a more linear style?
i love your flair
Blinkbolt with swift step would amazing
Zelda hasn't been really open world until botw tho, the other games are still linear, they just have a world to explore but the game still points you in 1 direction
They could also be similar to monster hunter having quests and areas instead of full open world
Thanks bestiee🥰
Google: "Is the original Legend of Zelda open world?

Answer: Yes, the original The Legend of Zelda, released in 1986 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), is an open-world game. In open-world games, players can freely approach objectives, rather than following a more linear and structured path. The Legend of Zelda also features nonlinear gameplay. 

More recent Legend of Zelda games, such as Breath of the Wild (2017) and Tears of the Kingdom, also feature open-world gameplay and settings. Breath of the Wild is considered to have a revolutionary approach to open-world game design, trusting players to find their own way to the endpoint instead of overwhelming them with quests and map icons.

_


This is a true fact stated by Shigeru Miyamoto in 1986: "I wanted to create a game world that conveyed the same feeling you get when you are exploring a new city for the first time. How fun would it be, I thought, if I could make the player identify with the main character in the game and get completely lost and immersed in that world?"
true true

Amazing Calibarn cosplay by @panzer_kit
https://x.com/panzer_kit/status/1729231782556651949?s=20
That is an amazing amount of dedication! Wow, really impressive!
My favorite part of the Calibarn has to be its thighs. Just something about how angular, rectangular, and sold they are is pleasing to me. It really feels like there is plenty of room internally for stuff.

Gives that whole suite a utilitarian esthetic, but in a high-tech way as opposed to the typical low tech look.
I bet this guy knows a thing or two from those skiers and snowboarders who shred with full mobile suit cosplays.

Does this cosplayer have a YouTube channel or something? I feel like a build video from them would be fun to watch.
incredible attention to detail but it looks so uncomfortable and restricted movement
Amazing cosplay and design. Seriously its out of this world.

But its movements remind me of that *I Think You Should Leave* sketch where the dude is wearing the fake suit and keeps saying "I don't wanna be here anymore"
Which grade is this?
Severely lacking with missing Broom Cannon. Integral part of the Calibarn, 0/10. 

I kid. This is awesome! I wonder if they've seen Aerial Gundam snowboarding to get this idea. Either way, the work involves must be insane for something like this and all my respect to the cosplayer.
I love the Calibarn
Supreme craft
That looked awesome!
Awesome. Best G-Witch Gundam deserves the best cosplay.
ngl, I like the cosplays rendition of the head and face more than the art version
Their AMBAC seems a bit out of sync
Suletta, your sister is on the loose again
There's something really funny about Silver Wolf excitedly running up to Calibarn
Just built its hg kit last night. Great suit
I love the red chin being a spot for the person who wears it to drink from lol
Same here

This cosplay is pretty good!
BRO FUCKING SAME

I LOVE HOW ANGULAR AND ALIGNED THEY GET AND AAAA I LOVE BLOCKY SUITS
In simple words: thicc ~~mecha~~ thighs ~~crushes~~ saves  lives!
There are some progress photos / videos on their Twitter. The bulk is actually recycled cardboards and the surface seems like printed PVC sheets.
Welcome to large armour cosplay.
Eh, when you see space marine cos plays alot, the movement feels honestly fun and intimidating

He was injured as hell during the recovery exercises, like shattered bones, internal bleeding and the works
So, imagine how a high-five feels like. Now imagine how a high-five feels after your hand is run over by 3 semi trucks.

He was fine in the first picture, but he was pretty injured in the second
It’s like getting rehab after recovering from a severe injury. They were also in bed for days.
Inosuke got his shit crushed lol 😭
He was injured and it’s different when someone is moving you
Imagine you were once an athlete. But you gotten injured and did not stretch for a few months in order to recover. Then try stretching again.

I would have no doubt that stretching to the previous extent will be very difficult, if not painful.
In the top picture he was in peak physical condition, in the bottom picture iirc he was bedridden for recovery for some time, so he needs some exercise again before he's back to where he was
Reading comprehension curse
Stretch and exercise every day and then get in a car wreck that really fucks you up. Then, be bedridden for weeks without being able to stretch and exercise daily. THEN have a nurse try and help you stretch and exercise. It's gonna hurt
I'm going to smack you on the back first.

Then I'll smack you on the back when I drop kick you off Burj Khalifa and summon fifty meteors to fall on you.

Let's see whether or not you'll hate my existence
Facebook tier post
Stretching and being stretch feel completly differnt
Doing it yourself and having someone force you into it is very different.
His back was broken
I’d like to see you getting forcibly stretched with massive internal injuries
He was severely injured and bedridden for a semi extended period and doing physical therapy in the second picture, compared to the first pic where he only has minor injuries.
Its just inosuke 💜
Second picture is after he got broken bones from the spider demons I believe, so he's in much more pain than he was before
Once I had a plaster on my hand, with the surgically operated thumb. When I tried to move my other fingers that were normal but didn't have any movement for several days; may be 1.5-2weeks; it was tttooo painful.
Yeah, for real! How do the tears come out of the mask eyes?!
It’s different if you move your body yourself vs others moving it. Also, he was badly injured.
Wasnt a severely injured and had to literally rearrange his internal organs in the fight before that bottom scene? Like yeah when you are recovering you arnt as mobile as you are when you are in tip top shape.

Theres also a difference between when you do something with your body vs when someone else does something your your body.
It’s called recovery training for a reason
He was injured at the time but also, when doing the "head between the legs" trick, the pressure is evenly distributed throughout his back.

In the other scene, not only was he being bent in a constricting position, but the force and pressure of Aoi's stretched out body was focused into a single section of his middle back, directly onto his spine
Leave him alone! He was severely injured and bedridden for quite some time!
funny how someone can move freely when at full health but wont be able to move freely after having almost every bone in their body shatered. Makes you wonder, huh?
After the spider mountain mission, he had been pulverised by Father and then atrophied while bedridden. Only way it makes sense XD. 
(I think it was also a reflection of his mental state. He was lacking a lot of his normal drive to ignore pain and show off)
Well this was before he was majorly injured 

In a dancer so I’m pretty flexible or was I could bend a lot but then I had a surgery and I lost a lot of said flexibility from recovery so it’s just what happens when you get injured 

✨
Have you never had to do rehab?
that image where they are pulling his arms back is called the octopus hold. its a wrestling move and it is the most painful shit ever. had a girl do it to me ironically and i didnt know what the move was until i felt it. i thought my back was going to snap.
Bro doesn't even pay attention to the show if they don't know why he was temporarily less flexible.
There's this thing called "use it or lose it."

In the first image, Inosuke had been free to do his daily training to keep his flexibility.

In the second image, he had been hospitalized and on bed rest, causing him to lose some of his flexibility.
He was injured while in the spider forest. This is a comparison before and after he was injured. And even with his insane skills of moving his organs within his body, internal bleeding and broken ribs won't save him.

He had 4 broken ribs 😂😂
Psychological damage
Being stabbed through your back must be the cause, not mentioning the recovery time and loss of range of motion when bed ridden. 

Could also be that he wasn't ready and didn't have time to like..."activate his muscles"
this is the classic the boss when you fight him meme
We’re never beating the media illiteracy allegations.
He grew up in the mountains
To be fair he was injured as hell🐍
Maybe he's got extra joints in his spine or something
I'd like to see you stretch your torso with several broken ribs
It’s not the same when you do it, as opposed to being forced to do it after mayor damage
O cara tem limite elas tô querendo dobrar igual livro
I mean, he did get hurt a lot, so maybe it’s from recovering
Me waking up for school but I slept on the floor cause my cousins at my home but then I realize oh shit no school

![gif](giphy|sbrXFzxizp7OHjv9RI|downsized)
I guess bc its wemen and not him doing it
If you stop going to the gym after a serious injury. You won't be able to lift as hard as you could
Inosuke just doesnt like to be touch
no
By this logic if I do a cartwheel then it shouldn't hurt if someone forcibly flips me over and I faceplant.
They are demons in disguise
I guess just writing something doesn't make it true. 

If you dislike it that much, whyd you engage with it?
ah yes you will run a mile with broken leg same as when you're normal
If we had an image of what his broken bones and internal injuries looked like, this would make perfect sense. Dude was in the most literal sense internally 💥shattered💥 at this point.
He was injured bruh
It's like biting your tongue consciously and unconsciously.when you bite it consciously  it doesn't hurt but it does when it's a mistake.
He was very injured, so it would hurt a lot more

Don't take it seriously bro just enjoy
My brain committed suicide
Wrestlemania breathing, Second Form, Walls of Jericho.
Different muscle group stretched and he was getting over battle injuries, so he wouldn't have been as healed and his flexibility wouldn't be as good.

Otherwise an oversight by very human writers/animators
Tbh even I don't understand it 💀
And if you haven't stretched in like a month, you'll notice the difference.
>This don't make sense bruh

Literally the first comment is the most logical answer that could ever be given smh ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6743)
Didn't he already have a broken rib in the first image, though?
Plus hadn't he been bedridden for a while in the second pic? He was probably stiffer than usual
Plus its one thing to display your own flexibility meeting your own known limitations compared to someone else pushing your joints and ligaments beyond their limits.
I laughed at the meme for a moment. But you're right.
But that’s just skill issue
He had a broken rib in the first one as well
He was also psychologically bruised so his mental capacity to relax probably also played a small role on top of being incredibly injured physically
BUT TANJIRO HAD JUST INJURED HIM IN THE TOP PICTURE TOO

it does make sense when you know they were all in bed for days though
no seriously, i never thought i was a hater before but there’s so many brain dead posts like this that i just wanna reach through the screen and shake sense into people lol. like BRO HES LITERALLY IN THE DEMON SLAYER VERSION OF A HOSPITAL
This implies it doesn't make sense. It does. He was injured.
its probably because its someone else stretching him, so it hurts, and he was more injured too
Yes, but it's one broken rib caused by Tanjiro vs getting beaten up by the father spider demon who got a power boost from a lower moon so probably more broken bones and other injuries.
Adrenaline was pumping through him by then I'm pretty sure
Only a rib though

In the one in Butterfly Estate, he's essentially crippled all over
At least a cracked rib, but he got way more injured during the spider battle and probably hadn’t stretched in a couple months while he recovered, and that’s on top of not being fully recovered in the first place
if you injure yourself, it hurts a lot more later on because the adrenaline and endorphins have worn off
Yeah but it's the injuries plus the recovery time stuck in bed letting his muscles atrophy. He would've lost much of that limberness.
Adrenaline, it hit him hard after the Adrenaline wore off lmao
He was bedridden for a while prior in the second image

Personal opinion
I would have preferred if Tanjiro was the first one to react and scream out "Muzan!" shortly after seeing him again instead of Gyomei, considering out of all the slayers here, Tanjiro was the first to actually encounter Muzan face to face

Understandable, but hearing Gyomei scream like that when he's usually so quiet and calm was exciting. 🦋
Meh, Gyomei is kinda the leader of the Hashira, especially now that the master is gone. it’s more fitting that he would say it, for multiple purposes. Tanjiro isn’t even a Hashira tbh, his presence there is only really coincidence in the first place. Additionally, the mangaka uses Gyomei yelling whereas he was always incredibly calm and collected, to express the urgency of the situation.
Gyomei was the first to encounter Muzan mace to face
Muzan had his eyes on Tanjiro. Bro saw his demon slayer mark and got war flashbacks lmao. And he personally called out Tanjiro when they were all teleported into the infinity castle. Tanjiro and muzan have personal beef at this point
I beg to differ. I think this scene emphasized tanjiro's expressions and feelings well. Realisation, then grief and rage. Gyomei being the strongest and leader figure brought muzan to everyone's attention whereas tanjiro was the first one ready for smoke.
Doesn’t take away from Tanjiro’s scream at all so I disagree
Gyomei was the insider, it was his job to relay the information. His epic serious scream of "It's Muzan!" to his fellow Hashira, as the lead Hashira himself.... is just so real and chilling. Also, Tanjiro locked eyes with Muzan beforehand. Perfect writing imo.
I think the hashiras trust Gyomei more than Tanjiro...If Tanjiro said Muzan first..sure the hashiras will believe him but there will be a moment of hesitance like "What? No way! That's him!?"..Gyomei saying that..they immediately went "Oh alright. That's Muzan! Time to attack"
I think it's good the way it is in the anime because when [Tanjiro shouts "Muzan!"](https://youtu.be/4XY14lXE_0k?si=aUj8dlaLo0wDlQEQ) it was the highlight of the season for me. It was a moment that gave me goosebumps.
As far as I see it Tanjiro confirmed it when he yelled
I think it actually works better this way. Sure, Gyomei is the one to inform the Hashira, but this still came as a shock to them. Obviously Muzan doesn't match up with the image they must have had of him in their heads, so there's the tiniest bit of hesitation in their minds as they ask "*This* is Muzan?" Meanwhile, Tanjiro already understands completely that this is Muzan and is immediately going in for the kill.

It really showed the sheer difference between someone who's only heard of Muzan and someone who's seen him before, even if the former are Hashira.
I was hoping tanjiro said something first but I’m just glad they had him say it in general a lot of anime’s would overlook that
My assumption is that the reason Gyomei screams Muzan's name is to burn the hashiras' spirits, signalling as if Muzan is the one who caused the explosion and killed the Ubuyashiki's family.

Based on my observation, before he screamed, Gyomei ensured that all the hashiras has assembled (they were all summoned at the same time as part of the plan), and he said 'Oyakata-sama's plan is brilliant'. 

But that's just my theory.
Gyomei shouldn't even know what Muzan looks like. He just assumed that this was Muzan because the leader told him that he planned on luring muzan into a trap. 

For all Gyomei knows, the demon that showed up could have been one of the uppermoons. 

I think this shows that the Gyomei could just FEEL the difference in power and know this was Muzan. I mean... he is blind and his other senses are way stronger. 

Even the other hashira didn't know they were looking at Muzan.
No way! This was such a good moment for Gyomei. He’s the leader at this point. Every Hashira looks up to him as he is clearly the strongest but also the oldest/most experience. Even though he doesn’t have any special rank over any of the other Hashira, he is revered by every single one of them as a silent leader by the amount of respect they have for him. This was essentially the war cry to start the final battle.
I liked how everyone was shocked to finally see muzan and took a brief pause while Tanjiro immediately took out the sword and was ready to fight
I really liked Gyomei's role here. Him being the strongest in the hashira and Ubuyashikis trust in him with the plan. It seemed like he was a war general launching the assault. 

Can't wait to see more 😁
Gyomei is hot
It was fine that Gyomei do it first :3
I too thought that would be more perfect
Its literally because everyone has just arrived on scene and had no idea what was going on. Place is rubble, fire everywhere, Gyomei is swinging at some dude. It makes zero sense for Gyomei to sit down and shut up and let everyone work out what’s going on, especially when he knows the fight that’s about to go down. Leaders lead.
Nah they did this perfectly IMO. Tanjiro knew it was him immediately and was the first to draw his sword. It was on sight for him no questions. Gyomei following that up to tell the hashira that didn't know what he looked like was perfect. It was better coming from him given what had happened and his proximity.
These arms 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Tanjiro is like : Fk hashira I'm not explaining who he is I'm gonna kill him myself.
I agree, but I think it's fine the way it is.
I understand what you mean
True, but given the situation Gyomei is much more suitable for this. If Gyomei screams "Muzan!" everyone will not have the hesitation to attack Muzan as no one even knew his face except Tanjiro.
Tanjiro screaming wouldn’t be abnormal he does that a lot ☠️

Gyomei screaming meant shit s about to go down
Idk what you all up to lol. He was the first one there and shouted who their enemy is as soon as the other arrived, just so that they immediately know who they up against, and dont waste time figuring that out first. 

They didnt rush to the castle because Muzan was there. They didnt even know that at this point because their messenger crows only told them the castle was attacked, but no by whom.
I just thought it expressed a serious situation. Calm Jesus losing his shit for .2 seconds.
Bro, it was better the way it is… it’s cinematic sequencing following on Shinobu’s “Kibutsuji….MUZAN!”

It’s art
im sry but can i js say gyomei looks so fine here 💔

But Gyomei is the best character. He is the new protagonist. That's just the reality.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
I didn't read through all the comments to see if this was said already, but I thought that the events in the anime subtracted nothing from anime canon, and only added a little more depth to Gyomei by showing how devoted he was to Ubuyashiki. 

Maybe I am alone here, but it seemed to me that Gyomei was underdeveloped in both the anime *and* the manga. If his personality was supposed to be a mystery I think he still would have been developed differently. Maybe by other slayers gossiping about him or something like that.  

Overall, I think the anime devs made a good move with that choice. I felt a little resolved watching the anime, it told me that the stone hashira is just a quiet dude that carefully observes other people's character from afar, and he demonstrated his highest degree of devotion to kagaya by accepting the orders he was given, and being first on the scene he was told would come to pass.
I prefer it this way, Gyomei shouting like that really show how serious the situation is.
I can understand but what we got was still more than enough.
When tanjiro drew with zero hesitation or fear i was so goddamn proud of him 
And the last season starts. If you have read the magna you know what happens to Tanji and I’m sorry I’m advanced. Pray for my boy
I also feel like it would make so much more sense for Tanjiro to be the first one screaming his name as Muzan hasn’t changed his looks and Muzan also personally murdered Tanjiro’s family. So if anything, out of everyone there, Tanjiro should have the deepest hatred for Muzan, and should recognize him instantly.
Well Gyomei was the first there and was alerting everyone as to who it was, considering him being there was a massive part of their plan
On the contrary the all should have shouted muzan
holy shit, the last arc is released?
I do kinda wish that Tanjiro put more into this scream

https://preview.redd.it/zdnc756qr9bd1.jpeg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c691de332aa9bac781f7a37b09c27aa8018844e8
Facts!
It's the start of War!!
"It's Muson, Michael Muson"
It didn't make sense to me either.

I expected Tanjiro to be the one to "confirm" Muzan's identity since it was him who actually knows what Muzan looks like.

Even Kagaya didn't know what he looked like so they wouldn't really know if it really was Muzan in an upper moon *pretending* to be Muzan.

Tanjiro should have been the one to "confirm" it.
YES, THANK YOU 🙏🙏🙏
It's does not matter anymore..
Yea but it makes more sense for Gyomei to notice him first cuz oh how much power experience and training he has over tanjiro
I feel the same way! But what we got wasn't that bad
The entire season felt a bit fillery. Could've been a 2 hour ova, or 5 episodes, and it'd been much better
That’s fair but Gyomei carries his own weight with those words🐍
I thought them all repeating *Master* and *Muzan* was tacky as fuck. Gyomei is the only one who should have said/shouted anything - they're Hashira, they can very quickly discern the situation and what has Tanjiro been training for if he can't do the same?
gyomei was the one who knew the plan and knew muzan would show up
Yeah that’s what I thought aswell when I saw this scene
Muzan!!!!
This was the first time Tanjiro had laid eyes on Muzan since Asakusa, so finally encountering him again (with Tamayo's hand stuck in him) while recovering from the shock of the explosion that took Ubuyashiki's life stunned him into silence. 

Meanwhile, Gyomei knew about the explosion plan, so it wasn't as shocking to him as to the other Hashira (no less devastating), and he assumed a proxy leadership role. So I think him being the one to scream out Muzan's identity and the fact that beheading doesn't work on him was quite realistic and fitting. 

Also, him screaming in a slightly panicky way, when he is usually so calm and collected, was important to display the urgency of the situation, especially when the other Hashira were stunned and overwhelmed with grief. He needed them to focus on who their enemy was in that moment. Example: Sanemi was so wrathful he was about to pounce without knowing who he was facing.
Gyomei screaming Muzan’s name was based tho.
What I wanted was one of the Hashira (Sanemi) to not stop at all when the explosion happened when all of em stood and looked at the explosion. 

Sanemi should've just ran into the smoke without stopping.
Facts bc tanjiro is the only one who has seen him before besides Tomayo. I actually was surprised it was rocky, had to go back to manga to double check.
Yep
Well that’s because they screamed for different reasons. Gyomei was screaming it’s muzan to let the other people know who they are dealing with. Tanjiro screamed because he already knew him and was going in on sight. So he’s still the first who “signaled” the charge so to say. It works well actually, everyone is shocked and processing what they heard and is seeing while tanjiro was immediately on go and gets the others to lock in and attack.
How did he know Muzan was there? Is he hashira daredevil?
MUZAN?!
Gyomei seems to me like the one who’d say it first since he’s the biggest, strongest and oldest so it seems like he’s leading the pack or something
I agree. He should have screamed and then Gyomei does the same. Would have hit so hard
Disagree I think I showed alot in terms of his devotion to the cause breaking so out of character with pure rage big difference from praying and crying.
i thought that scene was fucking great to be honest wouldn't have changed anything
I see where your coming from but I do like the execution and hearing the severity of the situation reflected in Gyomei’s scream. For me the fact that he repeated himself ruined the flow though.

I feel like it Gyomei should have announced “it’s kibutsuji” and Tanjiro basically cuts him off/ finishes his sentence by drawing his sword and shouting “-Muzan”
Wasn't gyomei in on the plan?  
He knew this was about to happen and the guy trapped would be muzan
I like to think of it as tanjiro being so angry that it left him appalled and speechless so much to the point he couldn’t even fester up the word “Muzan” until the other DS already did. Basically he needed a second to process the situation. Absolutely shocked that he was able to see this man face to face again. And it was once again after Muzan had killed somebody he/everyone cared about. His rage had to build up cuz he couldn’t believe what he was seeing essentially. 

Think of it like walking in on your spouse cheating on you. Your so angry that you start shaking and want to scream but at the same time you can’t because your still in disbelief trying to process these emotions/what your seeing. And the more you think about the situation in front of you the angrier you get all the way til you snap. All this is happening within a few seconds.
I agree, because didn't Ubuyashiki tell all the hashira Tanjiro actually saw Muzan. Then also isn't Gyomei blind and since he hasn't been around Muzan he wouldn't even know what the sense for Muzan is.
bro when was this omg
I think Gyomei had to tell everyone it was Muzan since they’d never seen him before. It was part of the plan
I love how it took a couple of seconds for the hashiras to process it but Tanjiro was like “Muzan I’ll fucking kill you” right away
Wouldn’t make sense though. Gyomei is informing all the Hashira that Muzan is right there. Tanjiro just arrived and was still assessing the situation as Gyomei was yelling it out.
GYOMEI‼️‼️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🙏🏻🙏🏻💯💯
I love how while everyone was stunned to see Muzan in the flesh, Tanjiro, sweet, understanding, loving and generally non-violent Tanjiro was on sight with him. He went straight to 'I'm gonna kill your ass' with no hesitation
To me it was perfect. Gyomei screams (one of the best parts of the chapter, you don’t expect that from him) like that because he corroborates what oyakatasama told him, and Tanjiro corroborates to the other hashiras since he is the only one who has seen Muzan in person… well for me it was incredible..
tanjiro let him get away once, he is not letting that happen again
Me: FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was thinking the same thing when I first watched the episode
I like Tanjiro's yell more, but I like the way it went. Gyomei announces that not only is it Muzan, but that he's immune to death by decapitation. That info sinks in for the Hashira as they finally get a look at the ultimate evil they've been hunting for so long. Once they digest that quick info, Tanjiro pulls up and gives his war cry, spurring everyone to action. The voice acting was SO good and I had goosebumps the whole second half of the episode. Stone breathing, Tamayo confronting Muzan, everyone unleasing a breathing attack and Muzan's sinister smile was ALL absolute fucking art.
Is this where the anime is at currently? Because I don't want to watch the rest untill they finish I know they are going to cut it off probably at the infinity castle arc, and I don't want them to because this whole arc was just training but I could be wrong because from here to the finish is relatively short in comparison to the other 4 arcs they developed into anime....
Tanjiro does more than enough. Give my boy Gyomei some spotlight.
It makes sense to have the top Hashira be the one to notify the others
The scream made up for it
Dude I just watched it and I watched the manga on YouTube you go back and check your shit lol and I'll do the same are you afraid to admit when your wrong because I'm not like I said we're both most likely right and I mentioned that I made up all of the facts besides two promotions the love hashiras and the wind hashiras and I just based those facts off of what was shown, told, and presented so why are you acting like I just didn't explain that to you, you must have adhd like my self or something because that's the only thing I can think of....
Muzan!
As someone who binged all the seasons, including the newest one in a week. GOD, I can't wait for the movies to release. It's about to be  fuckin nutty!
Actually, I loved it was Gyomei, because if you see it from one point. This is not about Tanjiro. It was about all the Hashiras, who just lost their boss and wanted to take revenge. Not only that but it is the first time they are face to face in front of Muzan, the enemy they have trained most of their life to kill.
It would make sense for gyomei to be the closest because he knows about the bait
Master; ‘this week Muzan will be here to kill me and I’m gonna fuck his shit up’

*muzan comes to kill him and shit gets fucked*

Anime watchers: but how did he know who it was??
I agree. Considering the only person Muzan made direct eye contact with was Tanjiro. Would have been sick if Tanjiro announced who it was.
Personal opinion. It is Muzan
Gyomei is telling everyone that Muzan is here, because they didn’t know
Exactly my thought! They could have Tanjiro screaming "Muzan" before Gyomei even finish his sentence.

But meeeh, we were still hyped, aren't we? LOL
bro both of em yelling will never stop giving me goosebumps… the va’s rlly went fckin crazy
Gyomei didn’t see Muzan.
Fire
i too have this feeling that tanjiro should be the one to say the name first or maybe they could have done it together.
If Tanjiro said it first, the episode ending scene of both of them cursing each other make more goosebumps
exciting
![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6755)
I beg to disagree. As much as I like Tanjiro, I think that it’s only fair that Gyomei took the first call as he is the leader of the group. And the episode is called hashira unite. The leader uniting the group.
The moment where Gyomei goes from calm, secluded and gentle monk to the mfing Incredible Hulk. Absolutely raw.
gyomei was there the whole time and obviously had figured it out
I thought this was gonna be a meme post where the post after the photo just says.
“I think they might be facing Muzan”
Gyomei the hype god
I think it worked well. There might be room for disbelief by the other Hashira if Tanjiro exclaims that it's Muzan, but the Hashira would all trust Gyomei implicitly.

Plus, I like how all the Hashira are just standing there and Tanjiro immediately draws his sword and is ready to charge Muzan. He ain't playin'
I was expecting the same thing I was waiting for tanjiro to scream it out but then gyomei did which was still cool but just not what I was expecting
While yes I woudk know it if Tanjiro yelled it out I see why they had Gyomie do it however I also think Tanjiro shorten attacks slightly sooner than the rest fi the hashira (minus Gyomie)because the didn’t wait for Gyomie to say that it’s Muzan they are fighting but simply knew at the moment therefore didn’t hesitate
I mean if you imagine Tanjiro and the other hashira point of view Gyomei was in a massive ring of fire and surrounded by blood pillars, it was probably pretty obvious it was a strong demon, but Gyomei also yells out first bc he doesnt want the other hashira to be caught off gaurd by the actual king of the demons
That would be fair if Tanjiro was the first to get there, but even Gigi was ahead of him.
Isn't the big guy blind?
i actually agree with this tanjiro is the main character with personal beef with muzan it wouldve felt more appropriate if he said it instead of gyomei
I do kinda agree with this.
Gyomei shouting that helps to show the urgency and seriousness of the situation because he's always so quiet.
This will 100 percent become a meme. “It’s tickle me elmo !” “TICKLE ME ELMMMMOOOOOO!!!😡😡😡” not to be political I hate democrats and conservatives
Gyomei was there before the rest, he was already fighting, it's only logical he is the one to warn the others, IMHO.

If no one knew it was Muzan, Tanjiro warning everyone would have been logical
Would it kill to be specific on what you’re asking
Exactly!!! That part gave me chills and when Tamayo screamed about wanting to see her kids grow up!
It does break the "quiet kid" shell or something when he screamed like that
Plus, he didn't "see" Muzan. He sensed his presence like Daredevil. Also, he was the only other human that was in on the "trap Muzan" plan. Him yelling out his name was to alert the other hashira to the importance of the situation.
He literally screamed earlier in the same episode
Yeah, but the pitch of his voice went so high it ruined the atmosphere, I imagined a deeper voice.

Now that I think of if it has to be one of the nerdiest things I've ever wrote.
Exactly. You knew it was serious af when Gyomei raises his voice
Right? I was like oh shit. Its fo real now.
He said it because he was the only hashira who knew he would be there and that it was in fact muzan 💀
Which now that you mentioned it Tanjiro should had being a Hashira at this point in the story. The boy faces more Upper Moons than most than the other Pillars.
In your opinion who should be second in command?
Leader of the hashira don't mean nothing when Tanjiro was the reason for the first defeat of the upper moons
I think it’s pretty clear he’s the faux flame hashira
I was about to type "Erm, it's tanjiro actually🤓", and then i saw you said MACE to face. Accidently clever comment, if it was a typo lmao.
I was about to type whole ass paragraph until I read your comment again
Then he escaped and now we have a maze to face
Take this Upvote and eat some Manju and gtfo here.
Brilliant 😁👍
I can't wait for the part when Tanjiro >!wakes up after being poisoned by Muzan and engaging in a 1v1 while the rest of the Hashiras are unconscious!<
Absolutely in my eyes better the way it was. Tamayo very hurriedly pleading to Gyomei shows exactly how they had planned this to happen. Gyomei was the only one in on it all so it had to be him. And I prefer Tanjiro being in the "what the hells going on group" because when he sees Muzan there isn't any hesitation, just drawing the sword and screaming. Showing that Tanjiro is ready for what's ahead i.e. he's reached the hashiras level which is a big plot point. There was after all a whole arc devoted to training.
Exactly 🤝
That was my favourite part, all the Hashira are trying to assess the situation and Tanjiro is already in battle mode. 

No hesitation, no fear, just ready to throw hands
exactly i think both of the screams conveyed their anger and urgency
I think while both are great in isolation the repetition took me out of the moment something fierce.
It definitely does
I see it exactly opposite. When Gyomei screamed everyone went to shock, or rather froze in a moment. But then there is Tanjiro, ready to smoke rushing towards Muzan screaming.
They was shocked and confused when gyomei told them lmao. But when they see tanjiro immediately draw his sword and charge in screaming muzan that’s when it clicks for them and they immediately charge in aswell.
Yeah if Tanjiro just yells out “Muzan!” they’d have a moment of “huh? Did he just say Muzan? Oh shit we gotta jump him now!”. While Gyomei clearly saying “this is Muzan” makes them immediately go to “we gotta jump him now”, both because of the clarity of his words and the fact that they completely trust him.
When he unsheathed his katana then the zoom in to his face screaming 🔥
You're overthinking it. Gyomei announces that Muzan is there because the other Hashira wouldn't necessarily know it is Muzan.
>Gyomei shouldn't even know what Muzan looks like.

I should hope not, seeing as he's blind 😭🙏
The demon girl knows
>Shouldn't even know what muzan looks like

>He is blind

Yes ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)

Plus he probably knew when muzan regenerated from a whole steel ball smashing his head off in 2 seconds
This is my level of no thoughts only Gyomei comment and honestly I’m just glad I’m not the only one
It’s also super important that he calls out Muzan won’t die from his head being severed. We saw with Zohakuten how that was used against Mitsubishi (god damn autocorrect) Mitsuri.
I SEE YOUUUUU
The scream lowkey gave me slight chills
I absolutely can't wait for every non-manga readers and un-spoiled watchers to cry at >!Tanjiro's "death"!<
?
Rumour has it the first one would be 2025, second would be in 2027, and the finale of finales in 2029/2030
cutting him off pulling someone of those vocals we heard during the fight with gyutaro
Do you seriously think he’d be a slayer let alone a hashira if his other senses essentially didn’t replace his eyes
He can still use his other senses, plus he knew Muzan was coming because Kagaya anticipated his arrival and warned Gyomei
He ends up being able to us see through world anyway
![gif](giphy|lo9HTe7gmjLrO)

I think you might have a bad case of insanity
SHE HAS KIDS?
He cries and now he CRIES!
Nah that’s just the gravity of the situation. Under stress our voices get higher. Communicated how serious the situation was to me
Maybe not the most in depth, but, Best answer.
Not mutually exclusive
And lower moons too. 3 at least iirc.
Ya but he can’t beat a single Hashira. The difference in their abilities is highlighted in this arc, it’s just that Tanjiro has the mark
Nah he still isn't upper moon level. Mitsuri held back 95% of hatengu.


After the training arc he is almost there but still pretty weak to take on an upper moon alone
If it makes you feel any better, Tanjiro is currently a Hashira in all but official title right now. 

In actual ability and skill he's on par with all of the Hashira, with the only one that's still significantly stronger being Gyomei.
it isnt an opinion and it isnt debateable gyomei and sanemi are the two strongest hashira and they are captain and the right hand man. the thing that sets them apart from the others isnt a skill level but their actual bodies. They’ve honed their physique to the maximum limit. Thats why kokushibou states “once i kill you two the other hashira should be no problem”. i paraphrased that a lil bit but thats basically what he says.
I mean. That’s only because Tanjiro is the MC and was conveniently in the right place at the right time. Any Hashira would’ve surely done better in his place
Lol 😂
Ngl, me too lol
Erm, it’s a flail, actually 🤓
😂💀👌
[removed]
Yeah there's some people saying he isn't on the level of a Hashira even now. He's been going toe to toe with them in training and has held his own against upper rank demons. He's there, maybe near the bottom, but still there.
I think it shows just how much Tanjiro has grown when you compare it to how he reacted to Zohakuten. Just Zo’s presence was enough to paralyze Tanjiro for a moment. But he sees Muzan and now he doesn’t even need Yoriichi to take the controller. Just fucking on sight.
I’m glad redditors don’t write these stories lol
How so? Their screams are for completely different reasons. Gyomei is alerting all the Hashira that the demon in front of them is indeed Kibutsuji and that he can’t die if he loses his head. Whereas Tanjiro’s scream is a moment of rage
Yeah but if Tanjiro was the one announcing it then there’d be even more shock or disbelief due to some of the hashira not trusting him.
there is both i guess
I think they would've been a bit shocked regardless of who said it..the reason they are shocked is because they believe it is Muzan..if Tanjiro said it first..it might have taken them a little longer to take it in.
Tbf, I’d trust Tanjiro more considering he’s actually MET Muzan before this moment.. and the Hashira all know that
Yes. This.
Fucking awesome that his sword was out faster than all the Hashira. Tanjiro saw a glimpse of Muzan coming over the hill and immediately went into attack mode.
Idk why you’re downvoted. That absolutely true. Tanjiro is the only demon slayer in modern history who has met Muzan and lived.
Her name is tamayo, and of course she would recognize him since she was turned into a demon by him
Yes, and Gyomei does not.
There are dozens of us!
She had kids
Yeah that was my feeling too. He wanted to alert every single hashirama that this is the big villain they were waiting to face.

But i would still prefer if everyone was alerted when tanjiro suddenly yelled "muzan!".
Also, username checks out lol
Isn't it just Rui and Enmu
Upper moon level isn't what it takes to be a Hashira. No slayer has killed an upper moon for a hundred years before Gyutaro and Daki. To be a Hashira without being a Tsuguko, you can either kill a lot of demons or kill either a member of the 12 moons. That means that you can be a hashira and only be at lower moon level.
He is. Giyu attests to it in the upcoming fight with Akaza. The Hashira training arc in the anime actually does a ridiculously better job at showing it too. In the manga he is just suddenly at Hashira level with barely any training shown in the arc. But thankfully the anime expanded it a bit so it doesn’t seem like it happened in like 2 days.
True but his other feats up until that point definitely put him as relative to traditional hashira standards. This generation of hashira is just Cracked. But normally Hashira level is just kill 50 demons or kill a kizuki (lower counts). Time in service also counts I guess since you have to be the second highest rank first but that seems like it’s fudgeable since Gyomei and Mui became hashira in 2 months. 

It is later confirmed by another character’s inner monologue that this Tanjiro in this scene is indeed Hashira level.
He's currently Upper Moon level.

He could 100% take on an Upper Moon by himself at this point.
Yeah he isn't recognized as hashira level untill mid-late akasa fight. Then after he could be even considered as surpassing some of the other hashira. But to put it in terms of strength multiple hasira mention that an upper rank is on par with 2-3 hashira and muzan being on the scale of all hasira plus combined. Which by the end of the series only two hashira meet that requirement Tanjiro and the snake guy being the two strongest and most agile. The ball and chain guy was already beat to shit by the end I won't count him out though so three hasira... Gyuomei was strong but was kind of a let down by the end... I believe gyuomei is the wind hashira I have trouble with the names so apologies if I mixed it up.... but the wind hashira was a let down by the end ball and chain was beat to crap but they were both really strong just not as strong as tanjiro and the snake guy. I also believe since the writer kind of rushed the end us the reason it played out this way....
He’s literally there lmao as the other guy said and he’s well in the uppermoon level. He’s stronger than base akaza and base giyu. And later surpasses both of them. Base tanjiro would slam gyutaro and gyokko. He would still struggle with hantengu due to the nature of his abilities but with stw it’s also a slam.
it’s absolutely debatable that Sanemi is the second strongest hashira. Giyu is essentially his equal, they’re very much 2A and 2B.
Well I asked cause second in command doesn’t necessarily mean the best to lead, like Gyomei in my opinion is the leader because of his maturity, not because of how strong he is
Being MC doesn't mean anything. Cause if that's the excuse we going with, then Akaza should've died and Rengoku should not have died. Or at the very least, Akaza would've gotten his head cut off by Tanjiro.

Idk why you’re being downvoted you’re right lol
He's not near the bottom.

Giyu acknowledges his strength later.

He is, in fact, entirely Hashira level.

On par with the rest.
Yeah but you’ve seen how some of the Hashira treat him. I think people like Giyu, Shinobu, and Muichiro would trust him right away, but Sanemi and Iguro would probably take a second. Either way story-wise it makes more sense for Gyomei to announce it first.
Tanjiro has been on sight with Muzan from the very beginning. Even back in season 1 when he could barely handle demons weaker than Kyogai, he was straight up calling Muzan a bitch ass motherfucker to his face.
yeah, and while I get that tanjiro could have been the one to tell everyone, it also works for the show for gyomei to put 2 and 2 together and know it's Muzan as well. But I don't think there's any reason to believe he's trying to disinform the other Hashira
So you agree with me ? lol wtf
And she called Gyomei telling him to strike Muzan which was the plan lol 💀.
My friends bully me (ish) for liking him and honestly it’s refreshing to know theres a community (im also relatively knew to the sub so there’s that)
Oh... So we talking Sanemi and Genya's mom.
Hashirama? 

You like Naruto don't you, u/Fragrant-House-2233?
You could argue the drum demon could count. Sure he was a former upper moon. But still
They fought against two lower moons with Tamayo I believe. The ones with the ball, where nezuko suddenly starting playing soccer with them.
And on top of that, you have to be the highest rank after hashira while killing a moon or your 50th demon.
No they mention hashira level is a person that can take a moon by themselves. They also have to have leadership qualities and be in for a little while... Tanjiro never takes on a moon by himself he has help with every fight that's why he's no hashira. But if your manga we know by the end he his stronger then 6 hashira combined lol
Is this not a spoiler
Current Tanjiro? Nah, absolutely 100% not upper 1-3, but I can see him taking on 4-6, especially Gyokko.
I wouldn't say Obani is one of the strongest. He was just the least fucked up by the time the Muzan fight came around. lol
Bro Tengen was getting pushed back by Gyutaro. Sure he fought him close at the end but he was going to lose/die. If you think tanjiro is appreciably stronger than any of the hashira you haven’t been paying attention. He just barely reached the level but was still getting carried by Giyu, which Tanjiro admits
Didn't Akaza basically just kill himself? Tanjiro and Giyu didn't really defeat him.
What did he say?
I said at the bottom cause when he saw the other Hashira sparring he said they were fast but that he could keep up with their movements. I took that to mean he's on their level and only a half step behind now.
I don’t disagree with Gyomei announcing it, but the master already revealed that Tanjiro met Muzan, and Sanemi was one of the FIRST people there to begin asking about it. He doesn’t like Tanjiro, doesn’t mean he doesn’t know his info about Muzan has to be reliable.
He embodies that righteous hatred from someone who's otherwise wholesome asf that's very hard to pull off believably.
I also just chalk it up to anime time dilation. Tanjiro is making eye contact with Muzan right when Gyomei starts yelling. He didn’t have a chance to react yet.
No Tamayo the demon lady lol
He was lower 6 but your point still stands. The second mission Tanjiro ever got had him fighting a lowest moon tier demon, with a broken leg and ribs IIRC.
No, they were deceived into thinking of themselves as part of the 12 moons. Tamayo actually clarified after they died.
Tanjiro killing upper 6 and 4 at kanoe ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)
This seems fudgeable too since Mui and Gyomei were hashira 2 months in. So it seems like they’re willing to just give it to someone if they’re very clearly just built different
You talking about 1 vs 1ing an upper or lower moon? Every upper moon battle was like 2-4 slayers vs 1 upper moon besides the Rengoku and Muichiro fights.
Current Tanjiro *is* on the level of Upper 3, and you'll see that next arc. There is literally no difference between current Tanjiro and Akaza fight Tanjiro. He's able to hold his own against an Akaza that's actively trying to kill him.
I agree with that as well. Obani got to reserve his strength for muzan as well as the love hashira. It's a shame she didn't have a bigger roll in the fight if you ask me Tanjiro and OBani did the most in that fight, but when it got to the nitty gritty Gyomei the stone hashira and naki the wind hashira came through when they were absolutely need though i will say that because they prevented Muzans escape as well as hitting him to prevent the death of the remaining fighters...
This Tanjiro with mark active is almost def stronger than Shinobu. Considering how he performs in the next fight I’d argue he might even be very relative to Rengoku and Tengen… and by the end of the next fight he’s definitely stronger than some of the active Hashira
No you clearly have not been watching 💀 Tengen getting pushed back is irrelevant? Lmao Tanjiro is stronger than him. He was literally able to outpace and beat base akaza. And again with selfless and stw he surpassed and blitzes him. If you think that tanjiro would lose to a demon who lost to unmarked slayers, you clearly haven’t been paying attention 💀
That’s irrelevant. Selfless tanjiro still blitzed and decapitated akaza and akaza himself stated tanjiro surpassed his speed and beat him head on. Tanjiro would have only died due to stamina. A fresh tanjiro with selfless and red blade slams.
He implied some people may not make it that far
That was early in the Hashira Training.

This is after all of it, like a whole year.
I mean did she do the same thing as Sanemi and Genya's mom.
Oh i see mb then.
Unfortunately not Kinoe
No they have to be able to take a moon on by themselves they state this numerous times in the series...
Sorry, I wasn't too specific it can be any moon but mostly lower moons because it also stated it had been 100 years since the defeat of an upper moon.... but with this show it seems like they say one thing then we learn another sometimes it's all over the place with the facts lol...
Doesn't he use his mark + unlock the see through world ability in the next arc? That's a pretty massive main character power up.
Trust me I’m not tanjiro hater. Love the kid, favorite MC. After the fight with Akaza and once he really starts spamming sun breathing I think you could absolutely argue he was stronger than a lot of hashira. 

I guess what I meant to say was that all the hashira have pretty gigantic feats this arc. Things you know tanjiro couldn’t possibly do when he fell into the castle. This isn’t a typical MC gets stronger than everyone manga, it’s a knock down drag out fight where tanjiro just happens to get two of the most powerful tools to kill muzan, STW and sun breathing. 

All I’m saying is this, the current hashira fighting, Gyomei, Iguro, Sanemi, Muichiro, Mitsuri, Giyu, and shinobu. By the time he fights akaza we know he’s not as talented as any of them. While he’s training sure he moved to the next level but he never turned the tables and started beating any of the hashira… the only argument I’ll entertain is Shinobu because she doesn’t have a feat outside of crafting.

All (most?) of the hashira consider tanjiro to be a very powerful swordsman who would have the skills of a hashira. But he’s not already hashira++++++ 😂
While I think Tanjiro is strong as hell here and def hashira level. Maybe even relative (but weaker) than Rengoku and Tengen he also gets a lot stronger throughout the next fight and I don’t think him keeping up with an Akaza who was literally not trying and wasn’t even using his BDA puts him above the other two. For all we know casual Akaza might be Gyutaros level. Giyu was very clearly carrying at the beginning of the fight. Tanjiro only outpaced him after see through world. The first half of the fight it was all he could to to just not get himself killed while supporting Giyu. 

This Tanjiro puts up a decent fight against Gyutaro but doesn’t pull a dub. Especially considering Tanjiro has no poison resistance and there’s no way in hell he finishes Gyutaro without taking damage.
Tanjiro is not stronger than Tengen LOL. The more I see your comments the more they make me laugh. Tanjiro is hashira level but not above Giyu.
So is Tanjiro only 2nd to Gyomei after the Akaza fight or is he basically stronger than every hashira at that point?
As in people dropping through the movies or dying before it launches?
The clip I'm thinking of was from the end after he pushed the bolder.
She killed and ate them
Ah ok kinda spoilers idk if she talked abt what happened yet but it’s def not the exact same situation
Lol A. >!Sanemi was promoted after killing lower 2 with help from his buddy Masachika!<, B. No it's not. Whats stated is that you have to be Kinoe and kill 50 demons or kill a moon. Alternatively you can be a talented enough tsuguku and have your hashira retire.
No worries dude. I get whatchu mean lol
His Mark becomes permanently active after he pushes the boulder, so no.

He also does *not* use the Transparent World to fight on par with Akaza. Tanjiro's able to match Akaza in base (which is technically his Marked form), and he later decapitates Akaza after using the Transparent World.
Yeah for sure i see what you mean; he’s still not at most of their level but this gen of hashira is also just broken and way above most other Eras except MAYBE the “golden age” Yorrichi started, whatever that means lol

Considering Daki killed 7 hashira I think this Tanjiro is probably mid level or even high level hashira throughout most of the corps’ history
Stw tanjiro is easily above giyu tf?
Stw tanjiro would be just behind sanemi or equal. It’s not until tanjiro gets 13th form that he surpasses gyomei.
He's pretty much 2nd only to Gyomei at that point, yeah.

He has the biggest and best set of abilities at that point, but he just isn't on Gyomei's level physically until he unlocks the 13th Form.

Think of it like this-

Sanemi \~ Giyu < Mark, STW, Red Blade Muichiro =< Mark, STW, Red Blade Obanai =< STW + SS Tanjiro << Mark, STW, Red Blade Gyomei << 13th Form Tanjiro
Yeah, but that was during the Hashira Training.

Current Tanjiro is post Hashira Training.
So yes? Bro, keep up.
It's.. literally talked about in the scene before this one
How you going to tell me I've been on a benj the last 3 days with the manga and the anime lol. But I also know it's case by case as well so we're both most likely correct honestly there also other factors as well I'm just telling you what I have seen while watching. But the scene your talking about I just watched as well and he said he felt like he didn't deserve it and he gave the master shit thinking he was treating every one like pawns before knowing that he visits the graves and knows all of there names. I just watched that episode and he already had been a demon slayer for a little while.... the love hashira got her promotion after defeating a moon by herself and because the lower ranks respected her. Kocho got hers for her knowledge in medicine as well as taking the roll after her sister muchiro tained untill vomiting blood and was promoted for his dedication as well as his strength and lineage. The flame hashira rengoku took the spot when his father retired. I don't recall hearing about the others promotions and I took a guess on kochos and muchiros but the only two promotions that have series details is the love hashira and wind hashira the rest they never really explain... I also believe you have to have the strength and reliability on that level... so like I said we're both right most likely but I have just watched the entire anime and manga up untill the last two episodes out now....
Lol I totally suck with remembering names especially Japanese names...
Wait so you're telling me that current Tanjiro is on the level of Akaza, yet you've written in past comments that Akaza handled marked Tanjiro + Giyu with ease? Something's not adding up lmao
Absolutely fair. Hashira in the sense of the word? Hell yea. You can’t tell me he’s not stronger than baby Sanemi who killed the lower moon
https://preview.redd.it/pde7vedlojbd1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdb1f3cf0e9b8c88f21ae7384ce9c7e149fd840e
Based on what you've described, I'd place Tanjiro above Sanemi. I doubt that latter is speed blitzing and beheading Akaza.
Binge it again then because your reading comprehension ain’t there and you’re making sh** up for most of these characters. And we do get details for Rengoku, he didn’t just become a hashira when his dad quit. He took on a mission his dad refused that ended up putting him against a lower moon and he solod it. It’s in Rengoku gaiden. 

You can even Google it. It’s tsuguko, kill a moon or kill 50 demons. You don’t get promoted for “dedication” that’s cornball head canon.
Dude that's like my biggest gripe with anime in general. There's no way I'm remembering like a dozen+ Japanese names. 😅
He *is* on Akaza's level, as he can fight on par with Akaza, evade his attacks, land his own, and repeatedly clash with Akaza's strikes.

That, however, doesn't mean that Akaza can't handle Tanjiro and Giyu with relative ease, though.

Akaza's Compass Needle is extremely useful for handling multiple opponents at the same time, and despite Akaza not being immensely above either Tanjiro or Giyu physically, he's able to hold his own (or "handle") a tag-team from Tanjiro and Giyu.

Akaza isn't easily able to *kill* Tanjiro and Giyu in a 1v2, but he's able to easily stand his ground in a 1v2, if that makes sense.
Lol oh for sure, just by virtue of him being able to consistently fight back against an enraged Sanemi he’s probably walking through the lower moons lol
You speak defunct reading comprehension lmao.
Well I mean marked sanemi, his speed feats on koku are impressive depending on where you scale that form of Koku and take into account how much work marked gyomei is doing. But either way he’s in that range before 13th form
Jesus Christ Amuro
Can we all just take a moment to acknowledge how dirty Gyunei was done in this? Amuro memorized his first fight with Gyunei that he relied heavily on his sight in battle, using this Amuro then drops his weapons as a feint, circles to his blind spot and strikes his weakspot killing him instantly. Not leaving him any time for any last words.

It’s even worse when you realize that even if Gyunei realized what was happening and turned around Amuro would shoot the bazooka behind him like in his battle with Char.
Amuro just on a different level. 

"Oh that was an ace?"
His death was so anticlimactic. 

And Quess’ reaction is so underwhelming too. “Did you get Gyunei!?”

And that’s it, dudes just gone like that. Amuro fucking owned him.
This is how Aces wins in battle. You see a weakness, and you use it for your advantage. When it came to battle, Amuro didn't have any chill or zero fucks to give. He just took care of business.
Bruh, this guy killed Kayra.

Amuro's lucky he didn't decide to piss on him afterwards
It's a great demonstration of just how absolutely goated Amuro is as a pilot.
Every time I see Nu Gundam fight onscreen, I look up at my Nu MG Ver.Ka standing above the shelf over the tv. I think to myself, “fuck yeah”.
Amuro's just a a really good pilot. He knows what kind of tactics work.
By CCA, Amuro had so much combat experience that he's basically the embodiement of that line about being wary of an old man in a profession where men usually die young.
The way Amuro fights in CCA is *extremely* distinct and interesting to me. 

He has absolutely no time for games and fights to end the encounter as fast as possible at any cost necessary, every time - and, on the flip side, Char is doing everything he can to throw absolutely every distraction he can in between them ("you wanna get me? Better kill those kids first!" Real classy, buddy...). He has no problem using decoys, mines, tricks, whatever he needs to, because at this point he's leaned fully into his identity as a professional soldier as his *only* identity and that means he accepts and internalizes the brutality of what he's doing and wants it over with quickly to achieve his objective.

Not a single other character in the movie fights like this - *everyone* else brings other baggage - from the least professional soldiers like Quess and Hathaway, who are more or less blinded by their naivete, all the way to the most professional soldiers like Gyunei, Rezin, and Kayla, who each are using combat for some kind of personal gain or growth (to realize ambitions, feel true freedom, and be a true hero, respectively). And of course, Char, who is always using combat as a piece in his 5d chess game and never has straightforward reasons for anything.

And so this scene, and the scene where Rezin, the undeniable top ace of the old-types, goes down to lame ol' turret fire, really highlight the central theme of the movie: all the bullshit, from believing that combat is a route to honor or growth or heroism or love like the other pilots, to using war as a tool for your own personal bullshit like Char, all of it is meaningless fantasy. The *only* thing that's real is the sudden, brutal deaths which all that fantasy causes and the tragedy it leaves behind afterwards. Amuro is the *only* character who actually understands that
Amuro only “lost” the first two fights against Gyunei because he was respectively using an inferior mobile suit and dealing with Gyunei and Char at once the first time and had to worry about saving Kayra and underestimated the Gundam’s funnels the second time. The third time’s the charm because this time Amuro both knows how to fully use the Nu Gundam and is explicitly fighting to kill Gyunei instead. 

Just goes to show how good Amuro is as a pilot.
Amuro ALWAYS used cheeky tactics since the original series, like hiding the beam saber behind the shield, and many other dirty tactics, He was always very cunning and the one Gundam Pilot who fought to win regardless of how He achieved it.
By the battle of A Baoa Qu Amuro was already basically a God of War. Just one-shoting gelgoogs & doms like clay pigeons.

Char was essentially his only match and even then it wasn’t close.
Both the shield and bazooka can remote fire too. This was checkmate
Gyunei is the prince of cope

but who do you think are the challengers to that throne?
No, bitch deserved that. That was for Astonaige, Kayra and the salad they never got to eat.
Amuro is just a monster like that.
That prick had it coming
At this point in his career Amuro is a beast so I'll commend Gyunei for lasting as long as he did.
Kinda reminds of Hathaway's last attack against the Penelope in the movie. Hathaway used his Beam rifle instead of Bazooka.  Pretty neat
We're talking about someone who sliced a Zaku in half within 5 minutes upon getting into a mobile suit for the first time... while still reading the manual. And after realized that doing so could make the Zaku explode went straight for the pilot on the second one. There's a reason why he's called the White Devil
The whole movie was just Amuro being done with this shit.
“Anti cyber-newtype cannon: activate”
I know Amuro might not be the strongest new type but I always felt like he was the most impressive strategic pilot in gundam
Hesitate and die
I think Char’s Counterattack is all about returning Gundam to its roots: evils of war and ideology, concepts of human development, importance of personal relationships, and a realistic view of what human existence in space could be. This fantastic scene reminds us that war is hell with no glory. There usually aren’t “last words” in war. You are alive, then you are dead. It’s also makes us harken back to what Amuro has become since the teenager that fell into the cockpit.
I think of this movie a lot when I watch 08th MS Team. Where the main cast struggled against Norris and the Gouf Custom for several minutes, Amuro would have killed him *on the way to fight Char*.


His character development of regretful teenager, to a washed up hero with PTSD, then to a stone cold war machine is world class writing. 
Also, if I remember correctly, the Nu was rushed, and the funnels were not fully calibrated either, so he technically was piloting an unfinished MS.
Yeah you know Amuro was gonna smoke him easily in the Nu Gundam when he more than held his own in the ReGZ.
He’s the White Devil for a damn good reason.
"The grim reaper won't come when you're ready for him..."
Isn’t this exactly what Hathaway did to defeat the Penelope in the Hathaway movie?
Gyunei became Gonei. 



Vintage Amuro doing his thing.
Gyunei’s spidy sense didn’t tingle
Unrelated but I hate that people always praise the fight against Norris in 08 MS and ignore fights like this can also be well crafted and has interesting strategies.
Gyunei had used Amuro’s friend as a hostage in their prior fight and ended up killing her. Amuro wasn’t gonna go easy on him.
Amuro has no chills.
The second Amuro figured out the Gundam in the OYW, all of Zeon heard “Lost the Lead” at the same time.
Gyunei, why did you take your hands off the controls in the middle of a fight?
Not the first time Amuro's pulled this trick either.
As it would appear, Nu Gundam ain't just for show
However that was clean of Amuro
Gyunei at least deserved a shot of him blowing up in the cockpit. When Quess says “did you get Gyunei??” I was also wondering because dude was just gone
And Hathaway  somehow copied a move he never seen.
The animation for this scene is absolutely stunning
That right there is why he's #1. I'm so glad Gyunei got a total wet fart of a death, absolutely bodied and nobody gave a shit.
That was for Kayra
As the old saying goes, all’s fair in love and war and, well, guess what this is.

Plus, Amuro owed Gyunei fur crushing Kayra to death.  I imagine he didn’t have much pity for him.
It's okay, he deserved it, he was a bit of a prick
Gyunei thought he was Char's Kamille but instead became Amuro's Jerid.
All is fair in war.

I actually appreciate how they did this. In war there is no big fan fare for your death. People might make a big deal of it after, but you normally don't get a glorious send off. And yeah amuro is a veteran of multiple wars how many pitch battles did this kid get bailed out of by char?
Amuro has been deleting "Aces" like Guinea for half his life, dude was barely a mini-boss to my guy.
This was one of my favorite moments.

It just shows that Amuro is on a whole different level than anyone else.
I really love how they constantly show us how Amuro is just built different, like atleast 7 parallel universes ahead.

Even in 0079 he just does shit nobody else does and after that both in Zeta andd CCA he just fucking combos everyone.

And its never like pulling shit out of his arse "oh i can disengage the limiters on the alayna-vinyaska" or "whats that moonlight butterfly button?", its just insanely quick thinking paired with the most finetuned machine.

(Both examples mentioned are great gimmicks and conpletely justified btw)
Soned him
Well, concerning that massive rock moving towards earth leaves Amuro no choice but using all tricks in his sleeves...
Ray pulled the ol -teleports behind u- “nothing personnel, kid”
Just realized Hathaway does an homage of this during the last duel of Hathaway’s Flash 🫨
Amuro was a goddamn savage in fights. 

He never wanted to fight, but if he had to. He. Would. WIN.
Amuro did nothing wrong...
Gyunei was a little creeper, and he got what he had coming to him after his earlier encounter with Amuro, and his being a weirdo at Quess.
That’s why he’s the GOAT the GOAAAAAAT
He killed Kyra, he deserved worse 😤
Lol get fucked moment
I always love posts like this these where Amuro's showing WHY he's the best UC pilot XD
Distraction is one of Amuro's favourite tricks.

Going all the way back to the clash with Char under Jaburo where he'd toss and shot through the Gundam's shield to get at Char's Z'gok.
Gyunei? Done dirty? He wasn't done dirty enough in fact. I still remember what he did to poor Kayra.
Makes me wait for another gundam origin focused on the rx 78 instead of char
This is classic Amuro's "lizard tail" move.
I love Amuro, he's just so done with everyone by the time CCA rolls around, he tried to kill Char several times outside of an MS he was so done with all the BS.
It’s just war man. Especially war in such a high speed machine like a Mobile Suit.

In an instant your life is over.
its the same universe that the antagonists or "bad guys" does experiments with children or even bombs some civilian places, nobody reacts; but Amuro OH NO how dare he do combat XDDD jkjk
Amuro's a menace till the very end.
my king
Gyunei deserves it, he’s the actual fucking nonce in cca.
Yeah, by this time Gyunei had no Char to save him and no hostage to keep him alive and not even the skill to go toe to toe with Amuro so his death is pretty much set in stone.
👌🏽
Is this from the original gundam series?
I like that Hathaway kinda learned this trick and used it on the Xi vs Penelope fight
All of which of course being even more extra unnecessary, because Amuro could have just flown the fin funnels behind the guy and shot him with those instead. But noooooo, we'll just leave those in place doing nothing, because Amuro wants to show off.
The fact that Gyunei was just desTROYED... when Quess yells "DID YOU GET GYUNEI?!" gets me every time. Mans didn't even get last words. Amuro is a beast.
I'm pretty sure he uses the same trick on Char later inside axis when hes setting the explosive charges on the nuclear thrusters.
It’s easy to forget since he’s am emotional wreck for most of his screentime, but Amuro is a tactical and combat savant. At the start of Gundam, he’s shooting down veterans with while thumbing through the manual, and by the end he’ downing the best of the best, all in state of the of the Art machines like it was nothing, in what is basically a fancy GM.

In CCA, he’s in a state of the art machine for the first time since episode 1, and he has had his shit together, so the dude is basically untouchable.
It should have been Hathaway.
Gyuunei has the reaction time of a slug lol
I wonder if that final moment in the Xi vs Penelope fight during Hathaway's Flash was referencing this. I couldn't be sure, but the way Hathaway launched his beam rifle and Lane got fooled successfully into attacking it, only to have Hathaway fire his missiles at the Penelope kind of reminded me of this moment.
im sorry but i hear the indian accent "Goodbye My 🇳🇪 Back To The Lobby" audio
i love Amuro too
https://preview.redd.it/spvc73czrgrd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc521f8a604c5239abd231c517af4b71b25e8f7e

To be fair, he kinda had it coming...
Amuro was so good that he was kicking gyunei ass with the regz and was giving char a hard time when he was fighting at half strength with his sazabi

And the regz wasn't at his final form so one could imagine how far amuro would fight in the regz custom
Gyunei deserved a more drawn out death after what he did to Kayra
I actually don’t care for it. I get the idea behind it, but without anything obstructing Gyunei’s view of the Nu Gundam this tactic only works because Gyunei is an idiot. The Nu Gundam apparently starts in his field of view and only is able to get to his blind spot because Gyunei hyperfocuses on the rather static gun and shield rather than the mobile suit arcing off to the side. 

It’s not like Amuro ducked behind an asteroid and floated out his shield and gun as bait or anything.
Is OP mad at the better soldier for being a better soldier?

wtf is this post?

You’re mad he watched tape on his opponent and actually learned something then used it as a strategy?
meh, it’s war . it’s also a cartoon🙈✨
LOL! 

Amuro: "oh, I guess aces be dyin-like-dat"
It’s always fun to note that in real life you need to shoot down 5 planes to be classed as an ace pilot. So Amuro reaching double digits every time he enters a battle would make him a monster. 
Amuro just casually demonstrating the classic Tomino "Natural Newtype>>>Cyber-Newtype" aspect with this scene.
"Must have been a wind"
I think that is intentional. All of the slice of life storytelling leading you to know the character deeply, then the horrors of war erase them from existence in seconds with out a second thought.
That's war, bro. Tons of souls out there written down as missing in action.
Man got owned by Amuro in a regz without a paychoframe he had no chance with the Nu.
Thats war for you, I miss that about old Gundam. After that era I feel like the later shows really drag out villains and they almost never die till the end or they don't die at all!
And plus, Gyunei 100% had it coming regardless.
In signature amuro fashion by sacrificing a shield.  He is the shield murdering king.
That be how it is
That's what being such a massive simp gets you.  Let that be a lesson.
Haha got eeem
Somtimes death happens too fast and there’s no time to process it, not until you’re alone with your thoughts. One of my favorite examples is in the walk-in dead comic where the friendly prisoner guy simply gets shot in the head during a gunfight. Just dead, without fanfare and they can’t even stop for him
God I hated Quess SO MUCH.  😑
Yeah, don't go into battles if you can't use both eyes
Also Gyunei had killed his comrade prior but also held her hostage to get Amuro to give up the Nu. He wasn’t gonna go easy on him.
This.

Amuro doesn’t relish killing, but if it’s a battle he’ll stack bodies if he has to.

I really like Unicorn, but Banagher’s constant waffling over doing what had to be done kind of got old…
That would've been awkard:

Char: What is Amuro doing?   
Zeon agent: He seems to have stopped the Gundam, the cockpit is opening and is getting out and - oh, OH  
Char: What?  
Zeon Agent: He didn't like the guy did he?
I look at my Hi Nu and imagine how much damage Amuro would have done with a monster like the Hi Nu.
Always having the best equipment helps too. I can’t imagine he would be doing the same in a Jegan.
And he’s not even old!
There are other experienced pilots out there, so I don't think that's what distinguishes Amuro.

You've probably heard the joke that he's Weaponized Autism but what that refers to is his work ethic regarding his profession which is piloting mobile suits. He's the guy whose put in the 10,000 punches or hours and he's mastered his craft. Amuro is a try hard because he gets fixated on things and what he does is drill down into his topic of fascination and learns every last thing about it. When he was a kid he was sneaking into his Dad's office and studying engineering manuals, and then realizing he didn't know how to parse Engineering anything so he started teaching himself electrical engineering which is where we find him at the start of Mobile Suit Gundam. When he jumped into the Gundam what was the first thing he did? He read the manual. You see him throughout MSG using the simulator and personally running diagnostics on his Gundam, you see him being friendly with the technicians and learning from them, and by Zeta you see that He's consulting with Anaheim Electronics on how they can make better Mobile Suits in general. In CCA he's so well known as a master mobile suit pilot that AE builds for him the Nu Gundam as a bespoke Mobile Suit made to his every exacting specification (and Char's psycho frame tech). Amuro is the GOAT because he outworked all of the competition-- Even Char.
Yeah, always wanted to see what a late 40-early 50s amuro would have been like.
and if anyone rewatch those battles, notice how most of the time Amuro wasn't even that vested in the fight, he was busy trying to figure out how to stop Axis. 

that way he feinted that Geara Doga pilot is hilarious. took a shot, baited the fool out of the rock then boom.
Amazing essay
He and Mikazuki would’ve probably been fast friends had they ever met then.
Amuro has lost so many friends and comrades across the years and he's internalized so much of it as a failure on his part to protect them. Part of what started driving him to Get Gooder at being the Gundam's Pilot was that he wanted to protect his friends on the White Base. In every conflict he's been part of though he's lost people he cares about or blamed himself for failing to save someone so he always tries to be better, he's always working towards becoming capable of saving everyone. Its the dragon he's chasing. By CCA he's honed his craft, piloting a mobile suit, to its essentials. There's no showy moves, no unnecessary movement or time spent doing anything-- its just brutal efficiency in piloting the Gundam and killing his enemies before they kill his friends and comrades. He has no time to mess around because any hesitation on his part could be the death of someone He cares about.
The thing I like about CCA is the first time the AA guns on a ship actually did something
I mean he has seen combat from the age of 15-16 and he's 29 by CCA. That's a lot of combat expeirence accumulated even if there were lulls in between.
I don’t think anyone saw his first battle with Gyunei as a lost, most agree that it was a stomp with Char coming in for the save. The fact that Amuro would bother remembering someone like Gyunei’s quirks to make the kill even easier is really fucking scary and very fucking funny
I mean the first fight against Gyunei would have been a win for Amuro. He had him dead to rights but Char intercepted the shot at the last second. Without Char, Gyunei would've died within the first 15 minutes
Probably helps that he didn't come into things as a someone vying to be a soldier. His survival instincts are likely a lot more heightened than others because every fight was a fight to the death in the unknown. There really was no "proper/trained" way of combat for him: you just did what was needed, whatever it took (not unlike real-world situations). Amuro was also pretty intelligent from the start, too.
I was going to say that: he's been doing a version of the shield fakeout since 0079, it's not like it's new to him. I'd be surprised if the Federation didn't actually have him teach tactics after the war, and then make recruits study him, given that he was the Federation's first (surviving) mobile suit pilot.
You mean Char in the most expensive MS Zeon at its prime could pull up vs. an MS on par in specs with Zeon's grunt suit (Gelgoog)
It was way closer than a lot of people think. They were fighting for quite a while, and both dismantled the weaponry of one another's suits point for point until they were both completely out of weapons and reduced to fist fighting, and Char did land first blood. Even if the damage from the blow Char inflicted was ultimately largely cosmetic, his saber was only a few feet away from Amuro's cockpit. It wasn't until the last few seconds of their fight, where Char started to suffer the loss of a limb that Amuro's advantage started to snowball.

Amuro's certainly the better pilot, but the difference is far smaller than the last 15 seconds of their several-minute-long battle characterized. Amuro was in real danger. Had Char been less reckless and self-defeating going into their battle (we'll ignore the fact that, had he not been in that suicidal mindset to begin with, the battle wouldn't have even happened), things could have ended differently.
Man got pincer attacked by a single dude, shit’s nuts bro
It's a trickier version of the stuff he pulled in the OYW- that giant shield was great for disguising his moves and as a decoy.
Probably Jerid or Riddhe.
Char. ‘Oh Amuro will need to build a Nu Gundam if he wants to fight me on equal footing so I will graciously leak the blueprint’


Amuro has beaten this man 20 times. 
By acknowledge I mean “wasn’t that kill sick as hell?” Not that Gyunei didn’t deserve it.
Still feel so bad for Astonaige. Dude survived the death carousel of Zeta and the tomfoolery of ZZ only to be unceremoniously sent off in CCA. He deserved better.
It's definitely a reference to this trick, as well as some others he used in the original series.
I always thought Hathaway as a middle ground between Char and Amuro, both in their greatness and their flaw, it would be natural that Hathaway would use Amuro's tactics
Lil bro doesn’t play by the rules of war
Tomino verbatim said that.
Man got feinted for 0.05 seconds and got murked lol
Unexpected Sekiro
Also, the Funnels couldn't reattach after deployment.
It's very similar: Amuro pulled a lot of stunts like this using the shield in the original series, and having Hathaway (who actually knew him for a while) pull the same trick establishes him as Amuro's 'successor' in the story, ironically being the 'disruptor' like Char while Amuro himself was extremely conservative about the Federation.
Oh it tingled. And he reacted.

Just not enough.
It's because 08th ""doesn't"" have Newtype Magic, so it's better.  
Even though 08th is every bit as unrealistic as other Gundam series, just without the ""Newtype Magic"".
At least it’s realistic to real life lol
Yeah that’s what he gets for squishing Kayra
It’s CCA, Char’s Counterattack. It directly ties into the OG series timeline
Tbf him saving the fin funnel for later was a good call, he nearly used up all of them during this fight and barely left one for his fight with Char.
*Gyunei deserved*

*A more drawn out death after*

*What he did to Kayra*

>It’s not like Amuro ducked behind an asteroid 

I mean he did, but that was during his first fight with Gyunei on the Luna drop
Like all magicians their job is to get you to focus on one thing while doing something else while distracted.
> I actually don’t care for it. I get the idea behind it, but without anything obstructing Gyunei’s view of the Nu Gundam this tactic only works because Gyunei is an idiot. The Nu Gundam apparently starts in his field of view and only is able to get to his blind spot because Gyunei hyperfocuses on the rather static gun and shield rather than the mobile suit arcing off to the side.


thats basically most tactics. the enemy is either unaware or unfocused.
If you look at it closely, you can see Amuro shift the entire body of the Nu Gundam behind the remains of the shield before he flies away. That probably threw Gyunei off.
The shield and bazooka could still be fired even without him holding it, he was screwed regardless of where his focus went.
OP isn’t mad, he’s shocked at the sleek and efficient brutality that Amuro puts on display here, bro doesn’t back down and doesn’t leave any time for last words
By that point, how many aces have he terminated lol?
TBF, real life pilots are rarely thrown into the thick of large scale aerial battles since WW2, and even then it barely happened (the Battle of Britain and the Pacific front are the only examples that pop into my mind), I think most modern fighter pilots don't actually get into a situation where taking down another plane their whole careers.

The ace requierement would certainly get raised if Minovsky particles forced pilots to only shoot what they can see with their own eyes.
The Top Ten  Zeon Aces had over 100 kills each.

Amuro was the second best EFF pilot with 142 MS kills and 9 ship kills.

[https://anaheimjournal.blogspot.com/2017/01/ace-pilots.html](https://anaheimjournal.blogspot.com/2017/01/ace-pilots.html)
Yep, that’s war for you. No epic battle, final words, or even realization that you’re going to die. Just anticlimactic death.
Absolutely. I also think it was intentional due to the earlier scene where Gyunei says he's even stronger than Char. Amuro wrecked him in seconds because literally everyone but Char is just a minor obstacle to him and the Nu Gundam. Char was always in a different league and Gyunei learned that the hard way... Well, for a split second anyway.

Also consider what Gyunei did the last time they met, using a human shield. This fight goes to show what happens when Gyunei doesn't have that cowardly option.
Bingo. Doesn’t matter you’re a “boss character”. You can still die in an instant just like any peon.
Yeah look what happened to Astonaige. Man survived Gryps, Neo Zeon and joined Londo Bell with Bright and gets cooked by a stray shot, just poof… gone.
A lot like how Amuro is killed in the MSG novelization.  For all his skill, a lucky rookie kills him.
That's why uc is my favorite timeline. It's more realistic and everything just happens. No heavy plot device unless it's the space magic we are talking about.
This
We get learn about gyunei's ambition, his personal quirk, his military achievements, and his relationships; all of that is gone in 3 seconds of screen time. 

And the best thing is neither Char or Amuro is immune to the same thing, their epic saga ended in both of them dying to perform a miracle at the ripe old age of 30-33...

I think tomino gave the perfect ending to his original gundam series, both zeta and double zeta had a relatively soft landing; it didn't quite have the same message amuro carried with his ending.
Instead only the protagonists die constantly and unceremoniously.
Lt Crank got killed early on, but fair enough for the rest of them in that show.
Valid. I love that mobile suit but never got a kit because I hate the pilot. Both of them.
Oh, hell yeah. By this point, Amuro had enough and was blasting Neo Zeon pliots left and right like it was an FPS. Showing everyone that the White Devil/Unicorn was here and he was pissed and no longer playing. Gyunei was a dead man walking when he did that, and Amuro showed him what a real pliot/Newtype can do to his punk ass. The sad part about the comrade is that she just got engaged when she launched, and when Amuro brought her back, he witnessed the fiance morn over her, begging her to come back to him. So you know that motivated Amuro to after Gyunei and drop his ass hard.
To be fair, Banana was less about "boohoo I don't want to fight" but more like frustration over things he THINK should've been under his control and yet they aren't.


Like, the dude rides the most powerful suit in this general side of the solar system. He thought it'd be as easy as "stop fighting or I'll burn holes into your forehead" and everyone will do what he says. Turns out most people would rather die than have a civilized discussion. For Banana this was exceedingly absurd because dude never once lost a fight on his Unicorn. If overwhelming power can't change the world then what can?


That's why while he's stacking bodies he cries a lot because it's ridiculous how powerless he was despite how powerful his mech was.
Nobody liked Gyunei, unfortunately for him lol.
I wish they would make a legit movie version featuring Hi-Nu and the Nightingale. A more novel accurate version from Beltorchika’s Children. All in the old school 1988 visual style of CCA.
is it just me or do i prefer the design of the Nu to the Hi-Nu
He did do the same with the Re-GZ during the fifth Luna drop, the same machine would then get wrecked by Gyunei when Kayra fought him
FYW Amuro kicked a lot of ass with his Jedah (prototype Jegan) and it didn't even had any major upgrades
he was kicking ass in mid to late one year war with grandpa, by the mid point most MS's of zeon reached the level of gundam, in late war MS's like gelgoog surpassed grandpa, and that didn't stop Amuro, infact, while gelgoog was having no problem keeping the pressure on Amuro, Gundam's joints was not capable of holding up
29 by CCA: https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Amuro_Ray
I need old man Amuro vs grandpa Char, still fighting each other decades later
Thanks!
I don't think so just cuz Amuro has ideals and beliefs and Mikazuki is just a hollow vessel who follows orders. Where Amuro fights for a cause and sees the bigger picture Mika just follows orders. I see Amuro being okay with Mikazuki just not being friends.
Generally, yes, though I'd disagree about only one thing - I think there's strong evidence that by the time of CCA Amuro believes that it is impossible to actually save people in that way. 

It certainly doesn't stop him from trying, but he's really resigned himself to the fact that he can't stop seductive ideas like romance, honor, and Char's ideology from convincing people to go out to fight. You see it in his refusal to really try with Chan or Kayla and most clearly when he straight up says so to Hathaway - he's practically *begging* the poor kid not to throw away his life and when he sees that it's not sinking in he tells him directly "you'll die too if you keep this up". 

I think part of why Hathaway's Flash is so compelling is that it's pretty clear that experiencing the events of CCA really *did* teach Hathaway the lesson Amuro was trying to give him, but both Quess and Amuro had to die for him to see it, and he ends up being a very interesting blend of the best parts of Amuro and Char as a result (as of the end of the first movie, at least, idk what happens from there).
Amuro only “lost” his first fight with Gyunei in the sense that he failed to stop Fifth Luna from hitting Earth. But otherwise, agreed: he was already putting Gyunei on the back foot in their duel even while using the inferior Re-GZ and having other things to worry about simultaneously at the time. Were it not for Char, Gyunei would’ve been a goner then and there.
Tomino distilled the whole "Amuro figuring out Ramba Ral" arc into how easy Aumro reads Gyunei after a few battles. Love that Tomino has kept that a define character trait of Amuro all these years.
Well, usually the shield fake out is used up close when the opponent can barely see pass it. The one I posted worked due to Amuro conditioning and understanding Gyunei’s quirks as a pilot and capitalizing those, and even if Gyunei realized what was happening it was already too late, countering Amuro would result in the white Devil remote detonating his Bazooka and shield right behind Gyunei like he did with Char
Imagine how it would have gone down had Bernie not wrecked Gundam Alex.
This is something I think more people need to remember about A Baoa Qu. The RX-78-3 was no longer state of the art/advanced as it was when it first activated on Side 7. It was Amuro’s skills as a pilot & Newtype that were actually growing past the limitations of the Gundam.
It’s pretty funny when you realize he custom made his shield to be big ass fuck since the Jegan’s have pretty small shields lol
No, Jerid is the King of Cope

so yeah, probs Riddhe
Glemy Toto is the emperor of cope. Dude sank his own entire faction because he couldn't deal with taking orders from someone born to a lesser noble house despite the fact that she had very nearly won control of all of space when she took the Federation capital in Dakar. Toto burned Neo Zeon almost to the ground in a failed attempt to become king of the ashes. Also manifested his inferiority complex through a desire to control and exploit young girls. Dude wanted to be Char but became Prince Andrew instead.
thats the thing, War doesn't have ruled, only survivors, and Amuro was a survivor alright
Huh. Makes sense
It’s my father in law’s motto but cool if it shows up in that game too
I mean I guess, but there’s still plenty of ways to give him that extra second of screen time going down without taking away from realism
The funny thing is, the last time Amuro dropped something Gyunei almost got hit by funnels. So this time he payed attention but ironically that was what got him lol
Except the thing he focuses on should be of no real concern. Why would anyone ignore the mobile suit in favor of the weapons the mobile suit just dropped?
There’s a difference between failing to recognize the real purpose of an action and just ignoring it completely. 

When B misreads A’s actions in a way that makes sense, it can make A seem crafty, cunning, exceptional, superior, or whatever compared to normal or merely competent individuals.

When B just ignores A’s actions, it can make B seem rigid, slow, stupid, inferior or whatever compared to normal or merely competent individuals.

I actually think this is a problem Gundam has a lot where in trying to show the superiority of the protagonists they choose a path that makes the antagonists look incompetent rather than making the protagonists overcome competence.
I see that but it still feels like Gyunei should see the streaking white mobile suit moving away from where he just shot.

I think this sequence would hold up better if the shield or bazooka exploded, or there was some other visual obstruction that would make it so that Gyunei was forced to look away or look one direction while Amuro went another. Instead it reads to me like Gyunei just stays locked on to an unmoving object while ignoring the moving one that started at the same point. That’s weird and feels like less of a story about Amuro’s skill and more about Gyunei’s lack of skill.
Did he know that at the time? Because the shield and bazooka firing remotely would have been a way better outcome. 

Then you’ve got Gyunei getting caught off guard by something novel, not just going “no way that Gundam piloted by Amuro Ray is a threat.”
He quite literally ate aces for breakfast in OOY already lol
He's offed enough aces to qualify as an ace himself just by counting ace kills alone, not even counting the grunts.
During WWII the pilot was not expected to live long enough to become an ACE, so there is that
The mystery pilot in first place is rumored to be some obscure made-up Earth Federation propaganda too.
Don't take Ace kills too seriously, if you pile up all the kill counts from Zeon Ace pilot, it is almost more than the total amount of GM produced.....
They didn't accrue anything after 0079 for that count mate lol
My money is on Bright and that Ace breaking slap
142, huh?  The highest scoring IRL ace had over 300.  Granted, Amuro accumulated that tally in a matter of months, which is fucking insane by IRL metrics.
This is only for the one year war
I practically gave a TED talk to my wife about how Gundam sucks in an audience who wants giant fighting robots and war, and then tells them, in no uncertain terms, that what they want is awful.
Quess didn’t go out too pointedly either.  She took a bullet, or missile as it were, for Hathaway, but no big speech or last words for her either.  Just gone.
I think it’s also a commentary to blind fanaticism. He never questioned Char’s actions and saw nothing wrong with killing. He had learned nothing over the last several conflicts. He ends up wanting to be the next big ace by putting in all the work to learn to kill but he never grew as a person. He dies as a footnote.
I remember Layzner, where a character thunked her head inside a car and died.
The double irony also being that Gyunei almost got offed by Amuro in the ReGZ in the opening if not Char saved his ass too.

Gyunei never stood a chance against Amuro, nor even Char for that matter.
Not to be the power scaler, but I disagree.


Char is ace, but he is not Amuro level or even one the best UC aces.


See his performance in Zeta, many other pilots did bested him multiple times and many of these times with mostly inferior suits, the only thing that made Char in CCA any threat to Amuro was the Sazabi being a powerhouse of a machine, and even then when he finally fights Amuro, he gets wrecked, the only thing he could do in that fight was hold Amuro a little bit, and that's without mentioning the fact that the Nu is supposed to be not finished.


His performance as an ace in the One Year War doesn't prove much either, before the Gundam he was just known as fast and sinked 5 battleships alone, but the battleships can't even defend themselves properly against a mobile suit at that moment and is just one shoot to the bridge and you have a battleship kill, he only bested Amuro at the beginning of the anime when the Amuro didn't know full well how to handle the Gundam, after that Char didn't won any fight with him in the OYW, even with something like the Zeong.


I think only The Origin and Char's Deleted Affair portray Char as the ace of aces, in the original saga he is good but his fame is more due to the historical context than necessarily his skill.
Quess was Hathaway's boss- ironically
Oh- you mean he survived the weird pink glow and atmosphere rentry explosion at the end of this movie!?

Last words: "WHAT!?"
That moment really bummed me out. I really liked him
In the Beltorchika manga he’s not quite sure if he died or not
Theres much more to it than that…
How does Amuro die in the novel? I thought he died in the novel version of cca
That's just victory gundam.
A really good example is zeta Gundam, Camile refused to kill any of the pilots cause they were women and nobody died till the end other than some of the good guys.
I think her name was Keyra.
Gyunei was dead the second he decided to square up on Amuro.  It was just a matter of when, not if.
Dude, good explainer on it.
Alright let me redo:  
Amuro to Char: I've come to make an announcement, Gyunei the pilot is a bitch ass motherfucker-  
Char: Amuro, ar-

Amuro: Shut up or I'll piss on you too!
Yeah it would be cool. Start off the first half of the movie with the OG designs of Nu Gundam and Sazabit and then wreck them at the halfway point and then make their final showdown be Hi Nu vs. Nightingale. I gotta read Beltorchika's Children. 

At first I thought they would never entertain an alternate timeline of the UC events but New Translation Kamille survived so not impossible! 

But then i remembered the stuff with Amuro's VA and goddamn it.
This is something I have always wanted. I love CCA but seeing the more authentic story would be really cool to see actually animated.
I prefer the Nu also. Asymmetric design is cool.
That's also why I built both!
Not saying Amuro can’t do it. Re-Gz is still essentially Temu Zeta. It’s just in a Jegan, the fight would be way more lobsided and not sure if skill would necessarily win out in that case. 

Amuro is literally space Jesus in CCA.
Grandpa Char: Lalah Sune was a woman who may have become a mother to me......now and forever.
old man yaoi real
You're right, Amuro damaged Gyunei's unit enough that Char showed concern and needed to basically tow Gyunei back to the ship.

rewatching the scene it honestly looks like Amuro just took a pot shot at Guynei. If he had a moment to aim better he probably would have killed Gyunei on fifth luna.
Even Kamille is becoming more like Char with CQC and using Kicks with a mobile suit. But Amuro has been consistent with his approach to use his weapons the moment someone got in his range ever since 0079.
Big chance Char wouldn’t make it out alive, but then depending on how damaging the Alex would be, Amuro won’t have the core fighter for escape if he needed it
Jerid is genuinely a good pilot, the dude just has zero luck and completely lose himself on his vengeance against Kamille. Becoming more and more reckless as more and more people died around him.

In a way he is what Kamille would have become without the support of the AEUG team. Jerid meanwhile despite getting higher in ranks lost all he loved and everyone else was pretty much bullying him.

There’s a reason Kamille weeps when he killed him.
Honestly,haman should have kills him the moment he act suspiciously.
Believe it or not humans are very stupid, a large object floating or taking a non linear path takes precedence over one taking a linear path. Our brain thinks the linear object will remain in linear movement while focusing on the floating/curved movement of a second object because we don't know where that's going to end up.

Even being told to stare at a coin, all it takes to distract a person is a cloth being tossed and floating down at the same time the coin is dropped then snatched by one hand then fake grabbed by the other. Humans will see the coin falling in a straight line and even tho they were told to stare at it will lose focus because the brain wants to look at the cloth floating down and will assume the second and expected hand caught the coin.

Amuro did the exact same trick that's been fooling people for recorded history
Yeah, I can see what you are saying.

I think the clue is that when the beam from the Jagd Doga comes, you can't even see it in the cut, presumably because it's really far away -> when Gyunei pulls up and you see the shield and bazooka from his perspective, you only see the tail end of the vernier trail from the Nu. So I always saw it as Gyunei shot at the Nu without actual visual contact, Amuro hides behind the shield and flies backwards, Amuro shoots from off screen (from Gyunei's perspective).
Aces? For Breakfast?!

Yeah, but can he see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
Amuro was casually crushing Zeon war heroes and aces after piloting the Gundam for like, 2 months.

Bro was thrown into the deep end immediately, no wonder people like Gyunei are just a blip on his radar years into his career.
I’m no breakfast boy! No breakfast!
Is it a mystery? I thought it was [this guy](https://zeonic-republic.net/?page_id=7260), who mainly got such a high count kind of as a technicality because he shot down a carrier and every mobile suit on it, pilot aboard or not, counted as a separate kill.
Just a fog of war... everybody exaggerates their capabilities....
There are actually a couple things that explain this, it's possible Zeon was counting Balls, Tanks, and fighters because Fed MS didn't exist for the first 9 months of the one year War.  There's also a theory proposed that minovski interference inflated their kill counts.  Or that the production numbers are massively under reported.  I think the last point is the most probable because you have more mobile suits shown destroyed in the show then are reported created total in the model kit manuals.  According to some counts, those zeon aces shot down more suits than total Balls produced.  Which seems an insanely small count of units for a global earth sphere total war.  Less than a thousand GMS produced at six different production facilities. Come on. That's just crazy low. One Ford truck plant makes 1,000 trucks a day.  You're telling me the entire planet couldn't outproduce one Ford facility over the course of 3 months?
Zeon did make the mistake of making all thier ace suits brightly colored or very unique which probably got a lot of aces focused fired to death because everyonesaw it and knew whose suit it was
I've been interested in watching for ages and didn't know whether to start with the original but that finally sold me on it.
Facts
The of Gundam is so good.....even my brother liked it
War… war never changes
Hello, I'm a variant of you from another timeline. What we do want does suck. Hug our wife please.
Then Hathaway erased Chan under similar circumstances. 

Pretty much every death in CCA was (deliberately?) anticlimactic, even Amuro's WTF moment after finding out Char did all this because of his mummy issues.
I am happy that kamille did not become thus guy.
Gosterro using his rifle at low output to slowly pick off the survivors is honestly terrifying
char apparently being an ace of aces due to 'historical context' is such nonsense 😭 if hes not all that then why did tomino write him beating amuro in bc manga?
Me too, I sort of just blinked for a moment, rewound, watched again then paused. Just had to let it sink in. His death was probably the one I most wish didn't happen, imagine him ending up in Unicorn (and not dying there either).
KIA by a Rick Dom while piloting the RX-78-3 at A Baoa Qu
Zeta happened before CCA tho
Char:....  
Amuro:....  
Char: Don't threaten me with a good time
Re-Gz And the Jegan aren't that far apart in combat strength, aside from Gz's BWS and dummy launcher both suits had similar weapon kits. Skill would definitely be a deciding factor.
Re-GZ is more of a Backpacked Methuss than Zeta. only in waverider form it can contend nearly as Zeta.
Look at the Stark Jegan vs Kshatriya: that was a non-New Type pilot using a suped up Jegan to take on a Neo Zeon Ace Cyber New Type. He did well enough that Marida was forced to use her funnels to take him out quickly (so she could rendezvous with the ship). If the Hero Stark Jegan pilot can frustrate and challenge a very competent Ace Pilot who is a powerful Cyber New Type then Amuro in a Jegan would be a fair challenge for Gyunei. Amuro is a fantastic pilot, probably the best in the UC, and on top of that he's a powerful natural New Type. I think that fight be more fair than you think .
> Re-Gz is still essentially Temu Zeta.

Bro, I legit laughed out loud at this.
I see 2 issues with your argument

1. The shield and bazooka would have to be moving in a linear path since it’s space and absent some other force acting on them they aren’t changing direction. The Nu Gundam would be the only one capable of moving on a curve.

2. In the coin analogy, the cloth works as a distraction because the movement is more interesting visually and pulls attention. In this case the moving thing is the Nu Gundam not the shield and bazooka. So, attention should be pulled by the Gundam.
No because he's too busy coming after me lucky charms
![gif](giphy|tnYri4n2Frnig)
Wish it had stayed as just a bunch of different people's kills added up to a mystery guy.  
Making it an actual person just feels like they didn't want to give Amuro his dues.
Yeah mystery in the sense that he doesn't have a face and he's only got these piloting stories.
The only thing better than a Newtype who grew up in space is a middle-class man from Cuba
0080 is a great start too, it takes place at the very tail end of the first series, but is a fully self contained side story
You can always start from whatever interests you the most. The fandom is huge and everything’s well documented

With the internet, you’ll never really be lost and can move onto the next series that interests you or a series that relates to what you just watched
The benefit of the AU is it's usually got similar themes without the commitment of multiple series, interwoven storylines, and buildup. The downside is they are usually shorter especially newer ones like WfM
I usually personally suggest dipping your foot in with 8th MS team. It’s a short, self contained series set in the “main” universe that captures most of the themes of the franchise as a whole. 

The style’s a lot more grounded (both literally and figuratively) in a way that genuinely makes them feel like giant war machines; it’s less flashy than most of the other series, but the weight feels good imo.
Gundam, yes robots and explosions are cool. But it kills people.
I just got into gundam at the beginning of this year. I tried the original but the dated animation put me off. So far gundam 00 has been my favorite
Yeah, Chan is the one that hurts the most out of them all but that's the point. There one second, gone the next. That's war
idk, Amuro had a heroic last stand with his chair in the ending to CCA
Like most soldiers, Amuro died confused and scared. (I don’t know how anyone is meant to cope with Char’s last words being the last thing you hear as a living human being.)
It’s almost as if Char handpicked him to be the anti-Kamille, as a signifier of his descent into abject nihilism.
I have to yet read BC, so I didn't know about this fight.


If you are talking about a Nu vs Sazabi (or the equivalent to them in the manga) fight I could give you a point and admit that I may have underestimated Char a little bit.


If you are talking about the fights Char had using a superior mobile suit like the Sazabi against the Rick Dijeh and the Re-GZ I don't see the point, the pilot is not the sole factor behind a ms strength after all, even Amuro would lose using a GM against something like a Rick Dias.
Yea i know, I guess I was referring to amuro specially cause now that I think about he was the only one to get shit done. Every other series really drags things out
We all know Amuro is the one Char's been chasing after this whole time, all the girls he groomed were just tools to that end 😂
Yeah the AU shows tend to sort of skew us towards the notion that there are Super Saiyan level gaps between the primary Gundam and the grunts, but most of the classic UC follows a sort of model where at the very least, the protagonist’s starting suit is nearly matched by grunts either early on, if not maybe by the halfway point.
In the series beside Char, who really could match Amuro in terms of skill though?
Trick works even with stationary objects, a cloth is just the go to because it's easy to tuck away. As long as there is any reason for the viewers attention to briefly recognize the second object that is stationary or curving, such as being in front of the object you're watching.

Nu dropping them relatively static in space with just some rotation around from being dropped is plenty to act as the distracting object while the Nu gundam can dart behind.
This just unlocked memory’s for me for sure, gunna check out YouTube for the commercials
But the wiki has his face on [his article](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Tenneth_A._Jung).
0080 is the goat
Given Char has a distrust for cyber newtypes like Gyunei, yeah, he absolutely didn't care about him, as illustrated by his complete indifference to Gyunei's weird speculation about him and his personal life. He doesn't care about the opinion of just a cog in his machine.
saying that hes not one of the best uc aces or that its all due to some side material or zeon propaganda goes against what we are shown
I recently got my wife into Gundam (she's watched the OG series, cucuruz doan's Island, origin, and CCA and is currently watching Zeta) and she frequently mentions how amuro is, in fact, That Guy. He is HIM. That said, banagher also got stuff done eventually, or I guess it's more accurate to say the RX-0 got it done whether banagher wanted to or not.
Funny enough, i feel like 00, the show with super robot power levels does the whole "enemy catches up with MCs" concept better than most other AUs. By the time the GNXes arrive, the CB gundams are no longer invincible and a team of GNXes did what 3 entire armies couldn't. By season 2, CB was extremely disadvantaged since the enemy had mass produced gn mobile suits now so they had to rely on plans and coordination over brute force, even if a CB gundam is stronger than a GNX. If trans-am became a normal thing in season 2, CB would be screwed even with their superior weapons.
Not many if any up to UC0093. In the recent manga The Return of Johnny Ridden, Char was single handedly toying with Johnny, Yazan, and two early cyber new types. Then that Char was dismantled by Amuro literally in CCA.

Post 0093, in terms of piloting skills, maybe post Crossbones Tobia and Seabook during Crossbones, and possibly Uso.
I’m not arguing this trick as presented couldn’t be effective on anyone, just that the way it plays out makes it feel like more of an indictment of Gyunei’s skill than a showcase of Amuro’s.

It’s like if I showed a video of Steph Curry blocking a bunch of 4th graders shots. It doesn’t carry as much weight as if they were all blocks on actual adults, let alone other NBA players.

Also, if memory serves, the piece of cloth is used in magic so much because most people used to carry a handkerchief and tricks are always more impressive when the audience knows (or thinks they know) a prop isn’t gimmicked. Plus, it can help with patter and all of that. And there definitely wasn’t any patter going on about the perfectly ordinary bazooka and shield.
huh TIL
Char’s cold manipulation of both Gyunei and Quess is absolutely an over-reactive emotional self defense mechanism (in a planetary sea of Casaval Deikun psychological defense mechanisms) against children put up after what had to be the total emotional devastation of losing the one protege he genuinely loved and vested his hopes for the future into to the psychic revenge mutilation of one of the absolute worst most repugnant rebuttals of his father’s lofty aspirations for the new version of space man that defined the politics he was supposed to have inherited. 

I almost ran out of breath typing that one. One basket case of a sentence for one basket case of a man.
Uso likely wouldn't have been at that point by the end of the Zanscare war, but he'd certainly have the potential to surpass Amuro.
He was essentially raised from childhood on MS simulators. At 13 years old, he was pulling off some pretty impressive feats, and was probably the most creative pilot we've seen come out of the Universal Century. He definitely wasn't yet capable of the level of complete dominance of the battlefield that Amuro was showing by 0093, and didn't really have many opponents on a level that would demand that, but given time, it's not an unreasonable assumption for him to get there.
Wow.  That might be the most wild sentence I’ve ever read.  Certainly takes you for a journey.  Perfect
Yeah, the thing about Amuro is the combination of piloting skill, new type power, and years of experience. Most protagonist from other series lack one of the three.
(But I still stand by the belief that this sentence would have been rendered unnecessary if he just let Amuro come inside him, brother to brother, man on man, for uh…psychic healing).
damn, just finished overlord and this line hits completely different 
When I first saw it, I tought the writers just made a mistake but now I realize. 

This is actually some really clever writing ngl. 
Oh...

I JUST realized this.

That is great.
They hinted at Princess Renner being evil and insane in season 1. Prince Zanac knew what she was. She had to practice her human expressions in the mirror. By season 2 Demiurge is telling the other guardians and maids not to attack Climb. 

Also, the above scene hinting she’s already a demon. They don’t go into it in the anime, but she becomes a demon through sacrifice.

Spoilers***
















She sacrificed all of the children and widowed attendants at the orphanage she established. That’s why she created it. To gather enough people in one place to evolve. She’s monstrous!
So, that line is brilliant. We know at that moment that Renner has completed the fallen seed's requirements to race change into an imp. We can reasonably assume that she has already changed, or at least started to. Maybe she's hiding the little wings. What I wonder is whether she may actually have changed earlier.

What I mean by that is the seed required a sacrifice, and I remember somewhere that the sacrifice required betrayal in order to count. So her killing her father would be one item. And we know that the whole purpose of the orphanage was to be such a betrayal sacrifice as well, since she poisoned them, and that was done earlier than when she killed the king. It's possible the conditions weren't complete until after king was killed, but it's also possible the conditions were completely met by the orphanage and the king was just her first loyalty test. A third option is that the conditions were met, but she went further than the minimum by killing the king in order to make the transformation conditions more favorable somehow (speculation since we know so little about the seeds).

As an aside, when he wakes up, she convinces him to serve the Sorcerer Kingdom, and even gets an additional fallen seed from Albedo so she can race-change him too. But unless that one is already active in some form, or there is another workaround such as alternate conditions, I find it unlikely he would ever meet the required conditions that we know about.
I wish we had the Renner betrayal scene over Climb running around in an empty city tbh. 

I mean come on. The king own precious little girl who he adored more than life itself was killed by that same girl. Instead, we have Climb. Running. Alone.
It is clever writing
Isn't that Cocytus's frost virgins?

I wonder why such minor characters look so hot
Last human? Was the princess already un humaned at that point?
She’s the second worst thing to happen to those orphans
It'd be cool if they have Climb torture the traitor nobles in order to lower his karma. It'd probably be the only people he could justify himself torturing.
It also went over my head the first time, but after watching "What the Anime left out" I realized the wording they used.
Ok I'll say it lady in waiting / guards of 10 Yuki-onna, Feels so much like a pimp flex for some reason.
Omfg, you're right!
Yeah the I realized what they meant I’m just surprised climb didn’t realize. But he’s very naive
I did a bunch of mushrooms and rewatched overlord and it hit differently especially putting it into context of being a nobody in that world and how absolutely villainous that whole group is.
Love it
I don’t get it
I'm surprised that I'm not the only one who understood the meaning of this line just now. even after two rewatches of the last season. It's funny that I remember this line in full, but only now I realized it 🥲
Nice anime / novel indeed
My first thought was, "They killed the princess?"
Yeah, I realized rewatching it this time that when he gets that message as Momon at the end of Season One it lets him know that Cocytus failed to defeat the lizardman, and he says they'll all go together this time which is when he arrives as the great one with Gargantua throwing the big stone block into the frozen swamp
What episode was this?
Uh which episode is this
What season was this again
Is it? If they failed to have this line it'd be shoddy and bad writing. Its not clever to do the minimum of what's expected of the writer.
Reminds me of gaster's quote:

"You are the first of your kind, you will be the last"
Need to have enough negative karma in order to change into an imp, hence the orphans
Not evil, won’t argue with the insane because her logic is batshit.     
    
Her intellect jaded her at an early age. She couldn’t understand why people didn’t understand the things she was talking about when in her mind it was incredibly simple.    
She had no peers. This depressed her so badly she was on the verge of dying because eating would cause her to throw up.     
      
She was saved when she randomly decided to take a walk and came across a dying orphan in the rain.    
He looked at her with eyes that looked like they were looking at the Sun.     
That’s the part people often forget; Renner and Climb saved each other in that moment…with different angles.    
Maybe young Renner finally saw someone look at her as impressed at her as they should be for her genius instead of the child that spoke of weird things, or maybe she really just loved those puppy eyes.     
But Climb does look at her the same way someone would look at the literal smartest/important person in the world.      
     
So laying down that foundation, from that point on Renner didn’t give a fuck about the rest of the world. None. Just Climb.      
As an aside, noticed that Climb’s the same way? Everything is for Renner.      
     
Now, she’s in a situation where she’s a Princess and the person she wants to be shackled with is lower than a Commoner.    
She pulls a miracle and gets him appointed as her personal guard.     
But the Kingdom and its social structure won’t allow them to be joined in any capacity. Maybe part of why Ramposa III hadn’t married her off just yet was to give her more time with Climb. Hell he’s even willing to get Climb a title later and even let him escape with her at the end.     
     
So Renner, keep in mind she’s critically obsessed with Climb, needs to hatch a plan to overcome the Kingdom’s societal structure to be with Climb.     
      
This is the part that sets her apart from being Evil.    
She didn’t give a flying fuck about the method or the consequences. Just which plan was the most viable to get what she wanted.     
      
If Renner had been able to get what she wanted (before she was married off) by making the Kingdom into a utopia for every citizen and scouring the corruption clean, she would’ve done that.      
      
It’s just in cold logic, it was more viable for her to get what she wanted by making it so the Kingdom would get caught in Civil War, the Royal Faction wins and solidifies their power base, Renner’s deal with Zanac would have kicked in and she now lives with Climb in the basement in a Kingdom that won’t fall apart because the Royal and Noble factions were at each other’s throats.     
     
That was before Nazarick came into play.    
Keep in mind that Phillip absolutely fucked the Kingdom. The Nazarick plan would’ve played out the exact same as before, except using Jalbadaoth to accelerate the time table and the Sorcerous Kingdom would come in for the rescue.     
The incompetent Nobles would’ve been wiped out, and the competent Royals and Nobles left would’ve been tasked with running the conquered territory because Nazarick is critically low on management personnel.     
     
Same again with the Seed of the Fallen.    
She didn’t care what the conditions were. If it had been save dozens of dying puppies and grow them to adulthood, that’s what she would’ve done.    
Im fairly sure Albedo or Demiurge’s bias played a role her as Renner absolutely had no say in what race change item they would’ve given her other than maybe asking for one with immortality. So she could serve Nazarick and/or be with a limb forever.     
Doubt either Albedo or Demiurge’s first thoughts would be to give her the Angel race change item as in their minds, most of Nazarick is in the lower negative karma value afterall.     
      
So more psychopath. Her Imp character sheet even states that all the people that were killed were more like ingredients in a dish to her, she was thankful for all of them for allowing her to achieve what she wanted.    
It was just bad luck for them that instead of being a dish that would live in an utopia under the Sorcerous Kingdom’s banner that Phillip 86’d and instead became warning to others and a tiny little hors d’oeuvre instead.

Yeah, it's also implied she would make Climb into a fellow demon. Telling him he would be asked to do "horrible things." Well to climb they would be horrific, to Renner it's just watching her puppy.
I could change her, but honestly whatever is wrong with her is way hotter.
Climb will meet the requirement. You remember how Renner told Climb that the Sorcerer King may test his loyalty? Ainz and the NPCs have no intentions to do so, Climb is just a useless object for them rewarded to Renner for her loyalty, Renner is the one they want to use. Renner's simply prepping Climb to do horrific things SHE will plan for him, lying it's Ainz who ordered that, so she can stay the innocent princess in Climb's eyes. Climb will do everything for Renner in this way, because if he's "disloyal", he will supposedly be killed, and then poor Renner with her now-infinite lifespan will have to live infinitely with all those horrible monsters all on her own without the comfort of Climb.
He’ll be able to. Renner was able to so it isn’t a stretch to think he can. They have the backing of Nazarick to some degree now and it’s not unlikely Renner could get some help seeing as she’s able to do the work on the level that only 3 others can in Nazarick.    
    
His entire life has been a puppet that Renner’s been pulling the strings except now it’s even more so.      
His entire life he’s known has been an orchestrated lie, someone who doesn’t know they’re an actor on someone else’s stage.     
      
Little bit that usually goes over some people’s heads is Climb is as obsessed with Renner as Renner is obsessed with him, he’s just not capable of doing anything to help Renner.     
     
If Climb had been as physically capable as Renner was intellectually capable, he would’ve been a monster.    
     
That aside, in his ending he interprets what Renner did was for his sake (he is not wrong, but he ain’t 100% right). That she threw away her humanity and became a demon in the service of Ainz all in an attempt to save them both. To save him.     
He thinks he was so incompetent and useless that the Princess he swore to had eternally damn herself.     
     
So he does what he’s always done: agree to what she asks of him.     
It doesn’t matter what she asked, he was going to say yes.    
Everything will be excused.    
His Princess from before would’ve never asked him to kill orphans or blacken his heart to become a demon. But he failed and his Princess is now a Demon so hearing some of her thoughts be demon like isn’t out of the ordinary.      
     
All the atrocities he’s going to be asked to do, all the evil actions or damning tasks will be his fault in his mind. Because he was so weak that he wasn’t able to save the Princess and she had to make a deal with the devil to save them both.      
      
Unknown to him, it’ll be the same play he’s been in his entire life. Their costumes just changed.    
But he’ll play his part all the while.
Ig, but also this let the illusion of the renner being human stay longer.

I always tought the princess was kinda wierd but I didn't think she would turn out to be a demon.

I also kinda liked that scene where Climb was running around a dead city, it was so ominous and just it invoked this wierd feeling in me.

I have to hand it to the writers, they really know their shit.
Renner already betrayed her kingdom 10 volumes prior to this. Even before Vols 4-6(or season 2), there are hints that Demiurge and Renner already made contact because Demiurge is made aware of "remarkable people"  in which he named both Renner and Fluder. Renner didn't expect to go on an all out war against SK since her plan is about dismantling the nobility and the royal faction through the new third faction backed up by the 8 fingers and Ainz. But she was guilty from the beginning. Killing her father is just an after thought to her. And by the death of Gazef and the missing of the supposed crown prince, the King was almost lifeless so I don't think there's "satisfaction" to say when Renner betrayed him.
.. Does the king really adored her ? I don't really see it in the anime..
I don't know about hot, they look the opposite to me
Yuki-onna have you ever heard of one not attractive?
Yes
Lmao, Neuronist wouldnt let anyone touch them, they are her duty due to direct order form Ainz-sama himself. Instead, just let Climb kill a few orphans and call it a day, way faster and effiency
They're traitors, so in that world,  it probably wouldn't lower his karma unless it was killing and reviving them over and over
Renner was still in the palace, but the ice maidens didn't acknowledge her as a human within the palace.  She was already basically a demon, just hadn't grown wings or fangs yet.
 season 4 episode 13

UNDERTALE MENTIONED!!! WTF IS A GOOD ENDING 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Well to be fair, who's going to miss them? Their parents?
Kinda illustrates the severe limitations of the Karma system.  I mean, she's giving a painless death to some people who are certainly going to die anyway, everyone in the Royal family (and pretty much every noble in the Kingom) has done far worse...just not always with their own hands.
How did Climb transform then?
Imp? I wouldn't be surprised if she changed to a succubus.
I don't think the LN's went too deep into it, but what does being an imp actually mean? Does she have everlasting life like she wanted? Learn any special abilities/magic? Allow Climb also to live as long as she does?
The destruction of others life's to fulfill one's own goals is evil.
Cool story, still murder.
Character: sacrifices dozens of orphans and widows to ascend to demonhood (comically evil)

R/overlord member: shes not evil, just a misunderstood intellectual!!1!!
No, thats still evil. Being logical and evil are not mutually exclusive. She did not see any value in the lives of others. She performed morally reprehensible actions. All to satisfy her selfish desires. That is most definitely evil. Being able to list a reason besides “I like to watch people suffer” does not immediately justify your actions.
I'm pretty sure that either Demiurge or Albedo mentions in passing that Renner is an unusual human that has negative karma. Not to mention that they got along with her rather well, even *without Ainz smoothening things over to facilitate a relationship*. I don't think I buy that the isn't evil
What makes her evil, is that she could have passively earned enough souls to change race by staying in the kingdom, asking for a guard regiment on the pretense of acting as their healer.

Of course, her loyalty to the kingdom would be a deception, but she would genuinely be a healer to her guard squadron - the thing is that she has nowhere near the capability of healing them against the likes of even the Death Knight. Instead, she decides that she wants "the best ingredients" via exploiting the gratitude of orphans and widows in having a 2nd chance at life.

If she had met any other orphan in that alleyway and Climb had been born some years later, he would have been part of the orphanage slaughter, but he got lucky twice - Firstly, he got lucky that he was on the verge of death when she had met him, and secondly becaus he never betrayed her to enough of an extent to screw up her plans.
I mean, she got what she wanted so.. the world is insane? lol
That was a great explanation, so you have a YouTube channel or something? I would love to hear more about characters lores
You make a compelling point. You're probably right, that they don't give a damn about him, except as a lever to control her. I remember the line about them probably having a test for him, but I admit I never thought of the idea that maybe they won't and that she'd lead him to interpret her tasks for him as their test of him. That's a clever way to work the system, and underscores just how devious she is.
Yeah, I guess he is a good little sheep. It's true that he already misinterprets her transformation as his fault (of course she was active in pushing that misunderstanding). The other comment pointed out something I hadn't noticed about her saying Ains will likely have a test for him, but that in reality they don't care about him at all, so she can continue to mislead him on that too. It's not just "follow this" but "this is the test for you (even though it isn't)".
Guess my main problem with it is that the betrayal was easy to see miles away and we waited years for it, instead we got the empty city. 

I think part of the problem I have with it is that I did read it in the light novels first, so a lot of the inner dialogue is lost. During the Climb running around scene he spends like 10 pages wondering how he could beat Mare and if he should. Then the Arthas moment never happened. This is one of those cases where the anime conveyed better the feeling of dread. The inner dialogue was atrocious in the LN version and killed the whole thing for me.
No offense but you didn’t seem to understand what I meant. We all know she betrayed the kingdom. We never saw any of the betrayed reaction to it. While that can be called perfect planning, it feels a bit lackluster. What was Rampossa reaction to the truth? What were his thoughts? Did he realize his beloved daughter was a monster at the end? Did he notice anything? Who knows.
Yeah but this post is about the anime.
Why do you think she’s not married off yet? They get married at 14. She’s 16-17. Not only that, the LN clearly shows that she’s his most beloved child.
Yeah, their quite cold.
She might have been an imp well before killing the king. Remember when she drew and swung Razor’s Edge? 

Her swing was so strong and crisp that Climb was amazed. That level of strength and coordination would be beyond a pampered human princess who had never lifted a blade before.

An imp with imp racial bonuses, on the other hand…
That's what their families are for. And one could make a case that the act itself being evil could be enough. Just because someone is evil doesn't necessarily mean that torturing them won't gain negative karma.
No, as long as they haven't personally killed a large number of humans with their own hands, they'll be positive karma by default.  The karma system doesn't care about morality, it's just a racist specification system.  Humans have positive karma by default, demihumans have low karma by default, heteromorphs have very negative karma by default, all before they do anything about it.  And you only shift your karma by killing people with your own hands, simply issuing orders or other indirect causation doesn't do anything.
Oh yeah
IT’S OUT???
True and based.
I'm so tempted to ask this, are you a technoblade fan?
Let's be fair.
They would have been useless in a baseball team.
This has got to be the second worst thing that happened to them
https://preview.redd.it/84ddxat20gad1.jpeg?width=2532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2970689cf65ec5878f7044eac4c8465cc3308fe
That's why my favorite hobby is drop kicking orphans
No, but said parents were probably surprised about their sudden reunion
2nd worst thing to ever happen to them
I like your style
Her intent isn't that. That's where karma system plays. Not the silver linings but the intents from her stand point which is killing innocents people to decrease her karma, not for the sake of mercy kills or whatnot.
we don't know, last we seen him in novel/anime is when he bedridden in Renners's room in Nazarik.
Renner tells him that he'll have to "prove his loyalty" by doing something painful.  But that's a lie, it's not to prove his loyalty, it's to change class.  She just doesn't want him to figure out that she had to do the same thing.  Which is why Climb will probably have to use a sword to openly execute some captured prisoners.
An item of a kind. A Seed of the Fallen, a racial change item unique to Yggsrassil.
Succubus is a way more advanced racial path, Albedo is a succubus, for example.
Different IP but similar outcome: Rimuru and the 10,000 + Falmouth army. Evolved Rimuru into a True Demon Lord and allowed him to resurrect his fallen friends. Granted, the army was invading under false flag pretenses, but most were commoners or lower class footsoldiers with little to gain other than “Join or die”
The action is evil but the person doesn’t have to be to make the decision for the action, especially in different ages and different moralities.     
     
That’s the thing, a psychopath makes decisions based on cold, hard logic and ignores the good or evil of it.    
We even get this stated that if Renner had somehow survived her childhood without Climb, she would’ve become a pretty brutal Queen that made every decision based on cold, hard logic.    

I’ll repeat that if it was easier or more viable to instead save the Kingdom, that’s exactly what Renner would’ve done. If the seeds of the fallen instead needed her to slaughter demons that’s what she would’ve done.   
     
An evil person will do things because that’s in their nature even if a better and less evil option presents themselves. A good person will do things in their good nature, but both can go against their nature.   
Psychopaths don’t care, neither is in their nature.    
     
And we come to a twist in the New World:    
Turns out destroying people’s lives and literally eating them doesn’t make New Worlders evils if it’s part of the natural way of the world.     
We got a surprise in LN 12-13 when Remedios uses her swords’ ability that is meant to be used against Evil aligned opponents.     
Against an opponent who eats Humans, has slaughtered humans and very likely has eaten them alive.     
     
It’s a sapient being killing and eating another sapient being, just a different race.     
     
It barely does anything to him. The sword doesn’t seem such a being, who again I’ll point out literally eats people, as being Evil aligned in the New world.    
Even when he has destroyed other’s lives for their own gain.
Only if those other lives are *good*.

Which isn't exactly the case in the Kingdom.
Your Honor, in light of the insanity plead being denied, I bring this forward: my client sees humans as merely animals without real sentience. She cannot feel empathy or sympathy for them, the same as we think about mosquitoes, therefore the brutal murder of several children should be classified as merely manslaughter!
Well that and from whose point of view you are judged good or evil by.  Since the entire overlord kingdom views themselves as good.  While to everyone else they are obviously evil.  

Actions done also factor into this.  Although to be fair Ainz doesn’t have to do anything and just by being a skeleton he’d be considered evil.
We have no idea exactly what is needed to get the conditions to use the Seed of the Fallen except that it involved poisoning the orphans and nuns in the orphanage.    
     
The method you propose may be lacking in something that prevented the race change.     
Also Renner was never known to be a Healer, at all. She’s just a Princess to everyone’s eyes and for her suddenly to claim she can heal people would be looked at with high suspicion. Like she could’ve been doing this for a while but chose not to type of situation.    
     
That gratitude from the orphans and nuns might be a necessary component or Renner actually caring and nurturing the orphans while the nuns could be collateral damage to prevent a panic; there’s no point in letting survivors have a chance of spreading rumors and every kid dropping dead after eating what Renner cooked would make even the greenest detective point fingers at Renner.     
     
Also, there’s a good chance that only Climb exactly was able to fulfill Renner’s conditions. What she became obsessed with was those eyes of his that looked at her like she was the sun and it was Climb’s situation that allowed that. One of those situations where if he had gotten something to eat, hadn’t been beaten up as badly before, if his tent wasn’t as tattered, if he had known either of his parents, if he had any friends, anyone had helped him, etc. Change any of those and maybe a different orphans doesn’t react the way Renner needed to become batshit.   
     
Without Climb and his specific reaction to seeing Renner, Renner would’ve died. That’s what people miss about it, Renner was just as much on Death’s door as Climb was in that moment. Climb had enough in him to get him back to shelter, cleaned and fed to bring back to full health.     
Climb never betrayed Renner in anyway, his life was fully under control of Renner. He thought he had agency in his decisions but he was just a puppet.
I agree.    
She uses Ainz’ name since Climb believes Ainz to be the reason for everything, from the Kingdom being torched to Renner being a Demon.     
Everything in Climb’s life fell apart because of Ainz is his belief.     
     
Albedo seems unusually accommodating to Renner’s wants in regards to Climb. It was in Renner’s best interest to tell Albedo literally everything about Climb, in her words to show Nazarick the leash and hand it to them.     
     
Pretty sure Renner is going to get some allowances in making Climb a Demon, Albedo knows Renner is going to need some things to make it happen.     
     
Maybe it’s because they found someone in the New World that’s useful on the level of Albedo and Demiurge that they’re so accommodating.
If you don’t like confused inner dialogue, how did you ever get through any of the Ainz chapters?
Betrayal? It was even more miles away that we knew that Rener would want to have claim so she would not "betray" him in any way that might hinder that
It's like a page or two with Mare. It's pretty simple, and it showcases that he'll prioritize Renner and her words over all else. It's not necessarily to show pain or the cities agony.

Just like Ainz inner monologue, some people might even find it funny. Climb thinks Mare is a girl. He thinks he might be able to defeat "her." Mare obviously being powerful even among the guardians makes it ridiculous lol

After their talk, Climb hears buildings collapsing and kills the urge to look back. Then, see's pillars of smoke and thinks that Mare was with a sizeable contingent, not actually alone. Again, underestimating "her" because we know Mare is trying to kill everyone in one shot with as very little survivors as possible. 

“To destroy the capital and kill all of its inhabitants — hey hey, ho —” Mare threw his tightly clenched fists upward"

Climb wonders why he doesn't hear any screams, and like other things, he's still just trying to ignore everything and get back to Renner. It's Climb, his inner monologue being about getting back to Renner as a number one priority is not out of character. 

There's some sentences and paragraphs for dread, too, like not hearing screams.
"Even though this place was far away from the knights’ defensive lines, he should still be able to hear some sort of noise, even if it was just the sound of a sword clashing against something. 

Speaking of which— It’s even quieter than before. 

Compared to before, the silence became even more uncomfortable. Never mind the palace, the loneliness he felt right now was like if he was the last man in this world."

Well, all I mean to say is maybe you would enjoy it a bit more if you reread it. Maybe not, but it just seems like you're kinda hating it a bit too much lol to each their own, though. 

Also, what do you mean by Arthas moment? If it's a reference from another series, would you mind explaining with limited spoilers if any :o
I think the reality is that no one really knows (outside of Nazarick) Renner is involved beyond perhaps Jircniv guessing. Her betrayals themselves are more important than anyone she is betraying’s reaction story wise if they were even aware of it, and Climb is the only reason Renner is as motivated to do anything in the first place so his mindset is much more relevant to us than it may appear at first.
Demiurge also mentions this in the anime. However, it would be impossible to guess what he was referring to until a rewatch if you’re anime only.
It's practically said outright in the anime too
Oh... I thought with how she turned out, she wasn't adored by her father.
They give me the shivers just by looking at them.
That's valid irl, but the overlord setting is a bit more black and white. Sebas, for instance,  has positive karma because he only brutalized "badguys."

A lot of the karma system still seems to function like the game, so basically, pking pks = gain karma.
Bandits count as hostile mobs in the world, They go into it in the light novel. Treasonous nobles would, as well. It's based on DnD rules.. since, you know, the whole thing was originally based on a dnd game.
According to IMBD air date was September 27th 2022
Drop kick that child in self defence
Is it because they can never make it to the home plate
Worst?  No, no, no.  Don't you remember?  In Nazarick, death is a mercy of freedom from suffering in life.
You still need to meet the conditions in order to change race.
Albedo is not *just* a succubus. Same as there's a world of difference between Pandora's Actor and the common doppelganger.

And did it say anywhere that the class change item can only start you on the beginner species?
Well that was different they killed his people first, she did it just because
"She's a sociopath, therefore cannot be evil" is one of the most takes of all time
Evil is a designation a society gives a person based on their actions and intended effects, I'd someone commits evil actions they are evil. 

We are talking about 2 different good/evil alignment systems. Dnd uses the ego of the self judging one's own acts which allows for a paladin to do horrible things so long as they think they are good.

Where as I'm using the pathfinder system which is the universe judging one's actions. 

It seems that overlord uses the 2nd where a psychopath that uses cold logic to commit war crimes is evil.
There is no inherent evil. Every evil action is done with complete justification of the performer of why it was a completely reasonable thing to do. And it's evil because majority of people disagree that the justification is reasonable.

You're cooking some really wild shit and it ain't it.
A not so minor point.

The lack of negative karma wasn't cause of how or why he'd killed humans.  It was because he *personally* had killed more Demihumans with negative karma.  The karma system is an ass, so to speak.  It doesn't *care* about "good" and "evil" in any deep sense, just the races of the direct victims you've killed with your own hands.
oh my god, she got affluenza
You make a lot of valid points.

I assumed the royalty would have some basic magic training, but that would undermine the divine distribution of skill classes of the setting and the adventurers' reliance on potions- e.g. how Climb has zero talent to grow beyond his current limits. I made a wrong assumption that she knew basic healing, as it would help Climb but be inadequate to treat serious wounds, but Princess Renner lacked the aptitude and wouldn't even bother if she had it, now that I think it over.

Since we don't know the specifics, you make a good point that simply earning gratitude from, say, a recovering soldier, might not be enough. Also thank you for the reminder, as I had forgot she couldn't poison them all, even though it would be a lot less suspicious than surviving a monster attack.

I honestly have never thought about Climb's relationship to Princess Renner in that manner, and it is really eye-opening. It was the complete desperation in his eyes that dialled up her depravity, but it also caused her to prioritize only herself and him instead of playing along with the rest of the royal family.

She would still be her calculating, deceptive self, but she would likely be more arrogant, something Demiurge and Albedo would have killed her for
Ainz dialogue is funny. Climb dialogue was filling pages for the sake of filling pages. Maru instead of writing about dread wrote about how Climb thought he could beat Mare.
It's hard to call it an Arthas moment without giving away spoilers, lol. It's from Warcraft iirc, pretty iconic cutscene in a game
No the contact he says about isn't shown directly in the anime only subtle hints
Understandable. Anime is better at showcasing some things while other media is better at showcasing others. 

Renner turned out like that because she has always being a genius, smarter than anyone and everyone, so no one really could understand her and vice-versa. Her, being a woman, the youngest princess with no power or backup, a trophy to be married off for the sake of her siblings and so on. 

To make it simple, she’s as smart as Albedo or Demiurge and she has always know it. What would that do to a child surrounded by an environment like the one she grew up on? So she grew up full of disdain, hate and disappointment at her life, at her situation and lack of power to change anything while morons like Barbro have all the cards. 

At the end the only family that truly loved her was her father but with his position as king and his lack of understanding of her, he could do nothing for her.
Most people, her father included, believed her to be a perfect little angel.
Nobody knew about her real personality outside Zanac, Raeven and Nazarick.     
     
To her father, she was a darling angel who tried to help the people of the Kingdom. She was loved by him and the people.     
     
There was no way of anyone being able to find out as Renner was a Genius. As in had Genius class levels that allowed her to use those levels to substitute them for other basic Classes.     
Because of this, she was able to do things like Cook when she didn’t have much, if any, experience in it, wield a sword with a surprising amount of finesse, etc    
    
But namely use it as an Actress.     
     
Combined with her intellect that’s on part with Albedo, Demiurge and Pandora’s Actor (smartest people in Nazarick), nobody in the New World had a snowball’s chance in hell of figuring out she was acting the part of the pretty princess.     
      
As far as we know, she even had the Slane Theocracy intelligence network fooled and they have tools beyond what most other countries do, including remote viewing.    
    
What chance did her own father have when you take into account that parents tend to view their kids positively to begin with
Oh, her father adores her alright.

The problem is that he's so busy being a king he doesn't have the time to be a proper father. The tragedy is that, if the king were more heavy-handed instead of a dithering status-quo guy he could've channeled Renner's intelligence into productive habits instead of letting it fester and twist her into an evil genius.
That's how the law sees it...but the Karma system doesn't care about legislation.

A video game cannot function on the old DND game rules for alignment because those rules are purely subjective, they involve no objective criteria at all.
We found orphan's parents
That's a technoblade reference good on you mate
Exactly.
They can turn him into and angel or doppelganger or something 
It very well may have to do with your own personal level as well. Princess Renner isn't/wasn't very powerful personally so that may have had something to do with it. Class changes in most MMOs from my experience require you to re level all or most of the way back up in my experience. Imp definitely isn't a very high level race typically.
"What are you doing, my son?!?!"


"Succeeding you...FATHER."


Still gives me chills just thinking about it
Her father was a fool, Reaven met Renner twice before conclude that Renner wasnt any ordinary kid


The point of Renner backstory was no one, except Climb, love the real Renner, they only adore the Golden Princess, a role that Renner play. When she was young and confuse, when she still not put on Golden Princess mask, everyone treated her like a weirdo. There were no respect or unconditional love until she found Climb. She nearly die due to Ramposa mistreat her, his fucking 5 year old kid. 


That's why i think the Kingdom royalty deserve their fate (maybe except Zanac), especially Ramposa
He was so busy, busy doing nothing lol

Like seriously, fucker was one of the most passive ruler ever
I'm not sure you're reading anything...
You might be missing the point that Ainz's war was legally justified and signed off on by the majority of the human countries in the region (and from what we know, the majority of major human majority countries in the New World).

If your theory of Karma being affected by such things were valid, Ainz would be maxed positive Karma as a result of the war with the Kingdom.
Don't confuse yourself, nothing I'm saying here is opinion, assumption, or a theory.

It's literally stated by the author in his light novels.

You're not arguing with me about this, you're arguing with the author's statements in his own fiction. That he wrote.
You're flat wrong, or just lying.
👍
This show's humor doesn’t get talked about enough. What is the funniest gag in the series in your opinion?
For me, it’s definitely Gyokko getting mad at Haganezuka for completely ignoring him.

Muichiro roasting Gyokko. Like the sass from this twelve year boy was out of nowhere.
This show is so freaking funny! But I’m going to limit myself to one scene:

Inosuke’s face reveal. Especially this exchange:

Tanjiro: There’s nothing wrong with your face! In fact the feminine size, shape and complexion are quite attractive!” (Or something like that.)

Inosuke: “You’re a dead man!”
Haganezuka revving up like a chainsaw cannot be beat. That shit is too funny.
Love when the *demons* get confused when a human does something weird
Any time the characters go:

That they included the dumbfounded face from Tengens wife 🤣
*
https://i.redd.it/62nteafcujfd1.gif

Haganezuka always poking Tanjiro's cheeks
The main trio's first interaction with Tengen. The "I am god, you three are trash" scene. The exchanges b/w them was still funny to me.
Is there a lore reason that Haganezuka escaped the Aslume?
giyuu thinking SURELY tanjiro won't just barge into his residence
https://preview.redd.it/g8i5nmemdlfd1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80e03a4ff3340050044c7df278f9a36c459fbd9f

This is my favorite bit from the whole thang
For me it's like a inspiring scene as it shows the level of determination and dedication he has towards making the sword.
When Zenitsu climbs away from the hashira training like a lizard
https://preview.redd.it/xn5zwo2qzjfd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e5a4d78b4d004a453cd3269feff64ea0563caab

The wrong subtitles made it funnier
My favorite running gag is when tanjiro breaks his sword and haganezuka tries to kill him lol
The first time something got me was when inosuke was chasing the spider sister and she yells out “dad!” And hes all “who the hell u calling dad??”
When zenitsu gets struck by lightning
When the three of them first see the train 😂
Tanjiro saying he refuses to acknowledge Tengen as a hashira after they got into an argument.
Literally Gyokko:

https://preview.redd.it/7mdyke0usjfd1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=050f8100307195645d81b08e50d950441a6e48c6
Obanai out of all people being petty over Tanjiro being friends with his crush. 

He was the most unexpected person out of all the hashiras to be so petty like that 😂
In the same fight Muichiro reminding us he's a teenager and being just an absolute Brat mocking him during the 2nd half of their fight.
Inosuke being like 1 for 7 on getting someone's name right
For me it will always be how Tanjiro appears before Tomioka with bubble eyes
When tanjiro showed the scar face guy his tooth. That made me crack up
More recently, I love when Tanjiro invited himself into Giyu's abode and Giyu said something like, "I must be mistaken, he must've said he was leaving"
Surprisingly, I find Giyuu to be the funniest person in the whole show….not because he’s a funny guy but his total lack of social awareness caused so many funny lines and jokes

. “I’m not hated by others”

. Calling Inosuke stupid and tying him up

. Trying to ignore Tanjiro

. Asking Sanemi if he likes Ohagi
Inosuke on the ceiling.. those screams man, those screams fit a horror movie.
The first few episodes of the Entertainment District arc are hilarious. When Zenitsu is rage shamisen-ing and when Inosuke is told to keep his trap shut because his voice is way too husky.
when inosuke challenges giyuu to a fight and he just casually strings him up
Every single thing inoskue says
The disgusted look Tanjiro gives boar boy
The comedy routine between gyokko and muichiro along with hagenezuka and that other masked guy don’t remember his name but the whole routine of arguing and gyokko getting mad was so funny
https://preview.redd.it/mo1hetdmemfd1.jpeg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12326c96792d1c1fb432d40d6c08a347cf7fc23f

THIS MANGA PANEL THAT DIDNT MAKE IT INTO THE ANIME
anything with Inosuke
Personally I like Tengen giving Zenitsu away
Maybe I am misrembering, but when Genya and Tsnjiro met for the second time Tanjiro was all friendly and Genya reminded Tanjiro that he freaking broke his arm!

Every time Haganezuka-san tries to straight up murd€r Tanjiro for breaking his precious Nichirin swords😆
I love Zenitsu's non-stop screaming. So hilarious. Just screaming in every scene. What comedy genius...
Love anything inouskes in cause he’s funny
Kamaboko gonpachiro supremacy
Almost everything that has to do with Inoske doing/saying stuff and Tanjiro not reacting to it
Inosuke’s dream

On the contrary, the Inosuke saying tanjiro’s name and donut jokes are mentioned far too much
Man, I'm still bummed out that Gyokko got no backstory fleshed out, but Hantengu did lol 😭
I think it’s really funny when Tamjiro and Zen is going to Gyomeis training. First they see Inos and other below the waterfall praying and then Gyomeis shows up behind them, in fire while crying 😂
When Sanemi karate chopped Zenitsu when he tried to ditch his training lmao
When they sort of break the fourth wall and Tanjiro asks rengoku “when did you become so huge???” 😭
Muichiro sass 🌫
Why is Haganezuka ignoring him? Is he stupid?
Mans more demon than the demon in front of him 😭
Inosuke-worm was definetely peak
Nezuko that call Zenitsu with Lord Inosuke name :3
Haganezuka poking Tanjiro and trying to kill him.
*says the man with mouths for eyes*
Isn't a villian's mouth is eye, eyes are mouths, and shooting fish and tentacles to attack already a joke?
The drowning namu amida butsu
IKR?!?! Even the comedic timing in the shift between manga panels is perfect!

Zenitsu freaking the fuck out.

I normally find anime screaming cringe or needless but him… he makes it work.
It’s always when Zenitsu is being the voice of reality in their trio.

Also the Natagumo scenes with him and the spider demon brother. It was noisy as hell but it made me roll over in laughter.
Why is man not sane,is he stupid?

![gif](giphy|qrIlvM63x7x9IjrHw1|downsized)
whenever Zenitsu fights while asleep
By far:

"Let's eat this thing."
Not exactly in the series but based on it. It’s called Tanjro, the Rizz Hashira 😆😂
Nah he’s hot


Zenitsu getting called Inosuke by Nezuko

Tengen roasting Daki

Inosuke watching Tanjiro from the ceiling

Inosuke's "Who cares about your name" after nearly getting Tanjiro's name right
Tanjiro's and Kyojuro's nasty looks plus the amount of time Muichiro needs to swap his whole personality

The disgust on TKs face from zenitsu’s domain expansion called infinite simping
Haganezuka always pissed at tanjiro for breaking and losing his sword
That scene during Mugen Train when Tanjiro tells Inosuke that the demon is the train and Inosuke is just like: “…..I KNEW IT”
Is there a lore reason why he's ignoring Gyokko?

The hashira geiko hen was the funniest imo. Especially muichiro's scenes and obanais jealousy
Why does it look like he's grabbing  onto a big red "rocket"?🤣
Lol 🦋
Oh hey it’s an r/batmanarkham reference in demon slayer
All of the Kakushi Gotou's monologues.
Same for me, and I also find Muichiro roasting Gyokko hilarious 🌌
the eyes bulging out their heads
It's between Haganezuka trying to kill Tanjiro and Muichiro trash talking Gyokko
Arkham Reddit PTSD intensifies
my favorite gag is definitely whenever people would see inosukes face for the first time
Every inosuke scene
r/batmanarkham would like to have a word
Zenitsu fighting the spider demon and the way the demon says he’s gonna fall on his head and die
each time the kakushi are either sassy, sarcastic or freaking tf out get me
When Tanjiro straight up died but he was so dizzy he fell in the river and found the shiny life rock.
For me it’s Chachamaru every time they disappear with a single “meow” that fades (I have video of me cackling over that clip in the last episode of the swordsmith village arc except it’s on my old phone and I don’t feel like retrieving that clip atm🤦‍♀️), as well as Gyomei hiding behind the tree saying “Namu.” After Genya mentions something about Gyomei saying “Namu”
“Nenbutsu, nenbutsu, nenbutsu, nenbutsuuu.” and when Zenitsu was slowly falling into the waterfall. Idk the Hashira Training was so much funnier than the rest if the series.
r/BatmanArkham reference
We loved this scene, my wife is known for her hyperfocusing.

I often joke the world could be ending around us for an entire 10 minutes while shes engrossed in her work before she even notices and she usually replies that I'm giving her too much credit in the first place, that she probably wouldnt notice at all lol.
Genya's tooth
A lot of people hate zenitsu but I thought he was hilarious in season 1 lmaooo
I literally didn’t expect Zenitsu and Inosuke to be that funny💀
Why didn't he stop sharpening that sword? Is he stupid?
I love Gyokko so much 😂 Look at his widdle hands 🥺
Giyu San

GIYU SANNNNN
He's correct. He is not sane, seeing how he goes after Tanjiro when the sword breaks or chips.

Almost everything involving the Kamaboko squad, the "GIYUUUUUU SAAAAN!" with Giyu getting soooo done with like, Zenitsu when he first saw Inosuke and was like "BAKEMONO SOOO!!" and his eyes were out and his mouth was hella big! Inosuke choosing violence when waking up, Uzui yelling at inosuke to the point that he got intimidated, Giyu and Inosuke when they interacter, Zenitsu getting angry that the demon Tanjiro was carrying was actually a pretty girl and came to the conclusion that he was in cloud 9 with her when irl she's his sister Nezuko, etc etc etc omy i couldve added more!

And EVERYTHING HAGANEZUKA LIKE THIS MAN IS HILARIOUS! (i guess he's ND)

And the way Kotetsu interacts with Haganezuka lol especially when Muichiro fainted and Kotetsu was like "WAAAAA! HAGANEZUKA-SAN KILLED A HASHIRA!" I also love how Tanjiro is like "Haganezuka-san!" whenever Haganezuka loses his shit and is about to chase him omgomgomg!!!
Daki >>> gyokko

This scene is one of my favourites of Mui
What did tokito mean here by saying you look familiar
Moments before disaster
Which episode is this from?
This scene was too cute. I leaves me cooing at Nezuko, at the end.
this was peak cinema
This and him bursting through the window are the funniest Inosuke bits
![gif](giphy|R3tHUypTIfmFi|downsized)
I think the funniest thing is when Inosuke said "good for you for noticing Gonpachiro!". Then Tanjiro said, "of course, I was lying on my back" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sometimes I just rewatch this scene and cackle

He's literally me fr
The screams man.. any one hearing that from another room would think you're watching a horror movie
This shit will always get me. Like I will never not find it funny.
Now this was the only funny scene. I can't get over why he's up there.
This scene was so funny
This is the manga panel of all time 🩷💚
Aoi in that lower panel: "I'd tap that."
I laugh every time I see this scene
And then inosuke being confused how he was spotted and tanjiro saying “well I am lying down” I love it 🤣

He could probably say "GAZPACHO" from 70 feet away and Tanjiro would still respond 😭
KENTARO!!!
Always been the funniest to me😂😂in the entertainment district I had to pause n figure out who he was talking about
Those are the best parts of KNY

Fun fact the name "Kamaboko squad" comes from Inosuke calling Tanjiro "GONPACHIRO KAMABOKO"
KENTAROOOOOOO!
I can hear this picture
I bet Shinobu would laugh if she saw Tanjirou pretty much stalking Giyuu.
Too bad for Giyu , restrain orders weren't invented yet
r/screenshotsarehard
giyu was truly fighting for his sanity in this episode 💀
He's so pissed but it's so funny!
Female Zenitus almost spanking Nezuko makes it even funnier
I love the tiny rocks just bouncing off his face when he was "dying"
I may be mistaken but I read somewhere that the direct translation for Zenitsu here was along the lines of "WHERE IS THAT PIG?!" rather than "That Guy" which is hilarious imo
Zenitsu here transformed into the average JoJo character

He's my favorite only because of stuff like this
That shit sent me💀
That moment was Gold🤣
Zenitsu looks more demonic than any of the demons shown in KNY 🤣🤣
Bro turned into Thunder Sanemi for a moment
The average jealous BF be like:
He’s 14, he must’ve activated some of that broody teenager energy. Plus having abs like that when you’re 14 is crazy enough, but 12?
Yessssss! This is my favorite part!
I keep seeing that manga panel where he is flicking his tongue or something with his saliva lmao is that for this arc? If yes, too bad that wasnt animated
Overrated scene
Yas lmfao
Honestly that’s one thing I think the manga does better at than the anime, as the facial reactions are just absolutely insane. For examples look at other comments on this post
i love the fact that they do it to everyone, even the serious characters 😭

Ok maybe Inosuke is the only funny one. He's literally the only good demon slayer.
Bad bot
In this scene there’s a little pile of origami next to him implying he was sitting there waiting for them to wake up while playing w origami
Tanjiro has the same eyes as his father. He noticed the resemblance but couldn’t place it.
It’s somewhere in the Swordsmith Village arc.

Maybe episode 2 or 3(?)

Thank you for this reminder I just had to stifle a laugh so I didn’t disturb my sleeping husband 😂
That double replay sent me😂💀
I feel like Inosuke's presence itself can make a scene funny. He is the perfect combination of being funny with his bravado while being a badass because he can actually back it up with his skill.
MANJURO!
The most iconic, gonpachiro.
“Giyuu-san~”

“Giyuu-san!”

“Giyuu-sannn~”
But Sanemi had a restraining order on tanjiro, didn’t they say that
Oh I knew how to screenshot I just don’t have Crunchyroll mega fan so it blacks screenshot so I took the picture on my smart watch- sorry for the quality.

Good redditor

No, Tokito had met them but his memory is horrible.
Tokito is such an underrated character, absolute unit
Thank you!

Holy shit there was just smt like this on another post in this sub and it was like 14 comments long
Not exactly a restraining order more just that they werent allowed near each other neither of them had a restraining order on the other
I love seeing the clip of her saying arigato while sobbing but it sounds like she's sayin "el gato 😭"
Don’t even get me started lmfao
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Fun fact:I read the wrong subs even more wrong...i read it as "What the hell happened TO ME?" And that was even more hilarious..just Tanjiro getting beat up by Inosuke but it's like he can't see Inosuke or something lol
Dude… 😭😭

He did
Mika like his blunt weapons 
Funny enough he also helped in the upgrade of the barbatos lupus rex so he probably asked the mechanics to make a more bigger mace 
My favorite part is that he literally found the thing sitting behind a shed and went “Yeah, this’ll do.”
Idk what the fuck that thing is even supposed to be but I fucking love it. I wish the mace got more actual screen time but it's a close second
My man was not here to solve his problems with grace, finesse, or any kind of flourish. My man was here to solve his problems with the power of unspeakable violence. My man succeeded.
To be fair, he is kind of a blunt instrument himself, to the point of almost being a plot device at times.
Idk what the fuck that thing is even supposed to be but I fucking love it
*The Adeptus Mechanicus liked this*
That chainsaw mace was super effective at taking down Carta's goons, poor mfer didn't even make it to his cockpit. Mika's brutality is unrivaled when it comes to main characters
Chainsaws are cool af dude.
Rip and Tear, until it is done.
T-Rex headhammer all day
Blunt weapons make way more sense. The damage they cause will be significantly more impactful than an edged weapon. Especially as you'd not need to worry about edge damage reducing cutting capacity.
Maybe a hot take, but I've always thought that katanas were pretty lame weapons for mecha. They're plenty cool for people, but they definitely take mecha in a direction I'm not really looking to go when I'm in the real robot sub-genre.
Mika is Unga Bunga. I completely understand.
Mika just whips out a plastic dino grabber and starts whaling on people.
Mika wouldn’t be caught dead levelling dex
Who would win?  

A weapon notoriously ineffective against plate armor  

vs

sticc
The chainsaw mace.

He's dealing armor most of the time, not fleshy naked giants.
I love how Mika is so quiet and yet his preferred combat style is indiscriminate smashing 😂😂
**Chainsaw T-Rex stick go vroom!**

~Mika probably
No surprise, the price of using the katana properly against Graze Ein is losing the use of one of his arm.

Unless that means a permanent upgrade, I think Mika would stick to simple unga bunga.
I love how it looks like a sort of mecha dinosaur head. When you open it for the chomping action, the saw inside gives off the silhouette of teeth.
Everyone talking about the merits of swords v maces and kinda missing the biggest point- Mika's choice of weapons was all about the writing team saying "This isn't the Gundam you know. These aren't honorable warriors, these are brutal killers in a brutal world, with no finesse just power." And the maces barbie used were perfect symbols of that. Big simple lumps of metal that crushed everything in their way.
Back when I was watching 00, I was thinking there is "no way they could make this series more brutal"

Cue Mika in IBO bludgeoning the shit out of everybody with an oversized wrench, like a mobster bludgeoning a snitchin the head with a nail hammer.
Mikazuki go *BONK*
Mika’s a strength build man, he can’t help it.
Katanas are weapons that are carried entirely by finesse and technique and suck ass in any situation if you're not well-practiced.

Our boy Mika made the right choice.
Intimidation factor is off the charts and he can sue it as a shield for projectiles
Hey! At least it’s not another beam sword👍
Mika knew you didn’t have to slice through the shell to crush the meat inside it.
"Im gonna lay you out!"
Mika even says he doesn’t understand that thing until the fight with Ein, and he lets himself go full throttle.
That is because big unga bunga bonk stick takes less dexterity to use
Blunt weapon in Gundam universe is just so satisfying to see. It wrecks the opponent.
The skill required to use it was learned on the fly when pressed by ein. But he suffered before it showed its effectiveness. So he went back to what worked. Crushing blows.
Most realistic MC, people die in war
Why not both
The mace is easier to use. A sword, even one using bullshit high frequency technology, requires proper edge alignment. Big mace just needs to hit to bludgeon. Also, it has a chainsaw!!
Mika is a brawler, he doesnt go for fancy sword fighting he just hits them as hard as possible
Mika is working class. Katanas are privileged weapons. A chunk of concrete at the end of some rebar, that's more his speed
Well, he does use both in the last battle of the 6th form
Katanas are too basic and boring xD
I mean, when all your opponents are armored up with few exposed weak spots, why bother swinging a pointy stick when blunt force trauma hurts both the mobile suit, and the squishy pilot inside the cockpit?
I loved how much of a departure not only babartos but Mika was for a main suit /character in terms of fighting style and design.
Barbatos ain't no Dex user! Unga bunga motherfucker!
The saw mace had to be some construction equipment that just got left behind when the went to dort or something
Hear me out the anti armor nlunt xhainsaw weapon makes sense for a gundam
I like when he’s using the sword and he’s like “I understand how to use this now” proceeds to cut clean through the frame of a juiced up mobile suit
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
To be fair, bladed weapons against mechs would have one hell of a maintenance. And probably be less reliable. Then you got BIG METAL FOR SMASH which will do it’s job no matter how banged up it is
It’s especially funny given how Shino was baffled at seeing him just casually bring it out
Brick, Where'd you get a hand grenade?
I mean they basically found barbatos sitting in a shed so…
It likely was a tool used for breaking up large spaceships, as I was under the impression it was included with all the stuff Teiwaz sent with Tekkadan.
Blame Ein for breaking it in season 1 last fight.
Just a guess, but it seems like it would be really good at cutting large pipes.
A hammer snd a tin opener
When you’re a hammer, everything else is a nail.
My man was not here to solve his problems with grace, my man was here to dolce his problems with a mace
Not the sharpest tool in the shed.
Barbatos was more of a main character than Mika was.
![gif](giphy|NDwBaHYwNRtYs)
Tree cutter, gogle search some automated tree cutter vehicle.
Honestly that's less to do with the effectiveness of the mace and more due to how dumb Carta and her men are.  They had gone so long without a proper threat that they didn't know how to react to a real one.
Plus, a big metal cutting saw with a clamping jaw to hold the work piece (the shit-outta'luck opponent's MS) in place kinda makes sense when all your opponents are made of metal.
Yeah, if I recall this is on purpose. MS looking very knight-inspired in the IBO universe is not an accident, and the logic behind using blunt weapons is that, while using a blade requires precision and knowledge of weak points, crushing the armor wholesale (if you could manage it) allowed for quickly being able to disable, maim, or kill in actual armored combat IRL and so they reflected that
Atra would agree.
*gasp* What is that thing?!
"I don't know"
Yeah someone else said it's probably a tool for repairing/dismantling ships which likely means civilian MSs exist which would be cool to actually see some time.
But hits hard enough to get the job done anyway.
He was lookin kinda dumb with his finger and his thumb in the shape of an L on his forehead…
This isn't really the case, at all, I don't think.

You've actually watched *IBO*, right?
Actually 🤓: in episode 24 we see that Mika is sctually the driving force behind Orga, so, yeah he’s basically the reason anything happened.

What show did *you* watch???
I mean, I always took as a demonic, ironic punishment that Barbie ended up putting Mika on a lesh at the end there.
Like this thing?

https://preview.redd.it/vis1msf234ed1.jpeg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0cb7d6038adbf20c6461d250f459dcc777570f2
That, and also to some extent they expected everyone to obey rules in warfare. We can argue whether or not warfare ever has rules and there's good arguments either way, but Carta believed in a world where people fought fairly and evenly. 

Except for killing Biscuit the way she did, which always felt out of place.
Which is why I wish bullets worked better in the IBO universe. Seems like they're generally useless until you get to Dainsleifs.

A 120 mm round or larger should hit with more force than any slow melee weapon, but any Gundam suit in IBO tends to just shrug them off.

I get that they were trying to make the combat brutal, but IMO there's still a bit of a big empty spot where they handwaved some things so they could still have big cinematic melee duels.
Mikazuki: "Milwaukee power tools."
I mean, during the space colony's failed attempt at a coup, workers did use their civilian-retrofitted mobile suits against Gjallarhorn forces
We do know mobile workers are pretty common and a mw could probably carry one of those.
But what if blunt force isn't enough? "Giant chainsaw wrench"
People like to see Mika as a character without any writing when he's actually a character written to be a broken person
Weirdly, they are kind of each other's drivers. Mika does whatever Orga tells him, but Orga comes up with things to tell him based on what Mika thinks about things. They chase each other's tails, in a way.
I never thought about the leash aspect, that's actually a good interpretation. I always looked at it as Mika was so broken not just physically but mentally that he couldn't be whole unless he was with his weapon. The path they had gone down had so thoroughly destroyed him that he could have no life outside of battle.
Those are loppers, which are a lot closer to the full city’s scissor things
Nah that's Akihiro's
True, forgot about that bit. Tho iirc they were just grazes which is probably why they didn't register as civilian suits to md
And if that isn’t enough? \*Stabby stabby stabby with Hashmal tail\*
there's nothing wrong with being written as a broken person, but that + little to no character development is usually saved for a side character and not the protagonist of the series. barbatos has received more form changes than mika

imo i'd even say akihiro was more of an mc than mika
Yeah this is the big thing for me. Mika will do whatever Orga tells him to, but on the other hand, Orga feels like he has to satisfy Mika with his orders. 

And of course Mika does essentially expect Orga to keep telling him to smash stuff recklessly, because that’s how it’s gone in the past. He’ll even disobey Orga’s orders if they’re only for Mika’s sake, like with the Mobile Armour. But I think Mika would be fine if Tekkadan settled down as a group. 

This loop of misunderstood feelings probably drives most of Tekkadan’s story all the way through
Yeah it is like that - at first - until you realize that deep down, Orga is terrified of Mika - like to the core. Mika is Orga’s pitbull, but he’s still a pitbull. Respectfully, he gives Mika purpose - however - much Like the Barbatos, Mika must also feed.

At the end of the day, Devil enjoys killing because it *feels* good.


Objectively, and I hate to have to say it, Mika isn’t like “a good person” - he’s just a psychopath on your side.

In war, you really don’t want to be the only army *without* a psychopath, because well, they are effective.

We really see this in small doses - the flashbacks of Mika’s first kill, the little smile of bloodlust at the sight/taste of his own blood, or just his indifference towards loss of life that isn’t “of his own people” so to speak.


In a weird way, Orga and Mika were using each other - Orga was using mika to get away from him and Mika was using Orga as a means to kill and spill blood. All of this was shrouded in a premise of trying to break away from their own miserable upbringing and the society that had created them, but at the end of the day their reasons were almost very selfish, and I think it was because of this ignoble streak that Tekkaden was never sanctioned to have a chance after Biscuit died.


Having said all that, Kudelia and Atra were the real deal and definitely took the worst of what they were given to make the future better, and because of the boys that got them so far, were able to use that momentum to enact real changes for everyone. Though of course this is all my interpretation.
I mean they are Yakuza brothers. It's ride till they die.
Theyre a pair of escalating forces that could really do with a cooler head in the room that they unfortunately never had.
I would disagree entirely. Mika's time with Kudelia not only encouraged him to read and write, it encouraged him to think about his own dreams. He started talking more about finding the "place they belonged" and about having a farm to grow crops. 

Now, in the end, it wasn't enough to save him from his fate- Orga getting ambitious and McGillis being a traitorous bastard sealed that. But the Mika of the later episodes was far from the person in ep 1.
His character development was reckless winning until it killed him
You're sure you actually *watched* the show? Because Mika is far more interesting that you're describing him as.
Character development is not the only sign of a protagonist. Flat protagonists exist. Everybody loves Goku after all.
I don't tend to think of Mika as being good or bad....he's almost feral. As you said, a pitbull. He doesn't understand how to human, and now Orga has this literal tiger by the tail and can only survive by pointing him at the next target.  

I also don't tend to think Mika enjoyed killing that much. I always think of Mika's thought process as "=". Ally=protect, enemy=kill. He might enjoy the thrill of combat (I think a lot of that is more Barbatos working through him since it ramps up when the limiters are off), but taking life is just an inevitable outcome of "=". You can't let an enemy live, because they might threaten you again. Kill them, they stop. Simple equations. 

As for Orga, I think he also got too big a head. He saw in Teiwaz and the Turbines the chance to be a big shot- "King of Mars" as he put it.  He thought he could be some sort of badass mobster lord sticking it to everyone that looked down on him, and Tekkadan was how he could do it. The more he thought about those dreams the less he remembered the people under him- and that was what got him killed in the end.
I hadn’t really considered the aspect of Barbatos living through Mika and “influencing” his bloodlust - thats certainly plausible, and I don’t think that Mika was like “ooh killing!” Like it was a bar of chocolate, more like “meh, its not so bad. Actually i guess i kind of like the pain”, but sado-masochism could be a side effect of having AV surgery so many times - “intense” feelings can  become addictive, especially in the absence of anything - eventually just being able to “feel anything” is better than nothing?


And as far as Orga, I feel like the “big shot” concept was something he manifested as a coping mechanic for having lost his only voice of reason that he viewed as an actual comrade or brother in arm, instead of a “charge” he was directed to defend. Orga was like a door that swung back and force as the moment needed, but Biscuit was the hinge that made that possible, without it, he was doomed to drift in an only ever forward direction, at any cost, whatever that looked like. 


Whew, time for a re watch methinks
Biscuit was very much the soul, the morality, and the anchor of Tekkadan, and it's no mistake he died so early in the story. He was the only one of them that really could have changed how things turned out, I think.
Biscuit 100% could’ve changed the fate of Tekkadan from making Orca snap into reality instead of being overly ambitious
They win
Holy kindom manga be like
Ainz after hugging her: So, looks like i won

Clementine: Nuh Uh _dies whilst winning_
I have no idea what the meme is about but I'll always upvote Clementine.
The meme doesn't really work when it's Ainz and Clementine together.

The irony of Clementine losing is what completes the meme.
i want to see these two fuc
It’s spreading like a plague Jujutsufolk is the strongest subreddit
I'm pretty sure from Nazarick's perspective, Clementine did win. She got hugged by Ainz-sama, tightly, after all.
Skill issue
I love Clem's boobas.
Clementine won in my opinion,she got the grace of dancing in Ainz arms and even feel his sweet embrace,she could feel her entire body almost fusing with Ainz in a cacophony of movement and terror in her final momments.
r/Jujutsufolk is leaking

First thing I see when I redownload reddit that’s wild
Ainz had such a "crush" on her....🤭🤭😅
When I first saw "They", I thought it was a reference to her two big personalities 💀

Mmm Clem
Me: "Suuuure..." *Loads Glock 38* "...let's see if you win against this too, thou fucking sadistic bitch."
Now this makes me wonder what would happen if Nazarick underwent the NG+ treatment, where Clementine and Khajiit were Lv100 and could fight Ainz on equal terms overall power wise.
When will this unfunny meme die already?

The JJK fandom hasn't been the same ever since CH 236
I wonder what albedo's reaction was when she found out he killed Clementine with a hug
You’ve been blessed
They'd still get wiped out. Ainz is a very skilled player and will rarely ever challenge for the sake of challenging. If he pulls up on you, know that he's done research on you tenfold. The only difference this time is that he would most likely not fight alone. His best attribute was always being the main support

I can see him hiding a few guardians as an ace up his sleeve
Nah I'd win
Would you die? 

Nah, I'd win
It did, bone daddy resurrected it for the happy farm.
I think they are at season 5 right now

Yeah, bro didn’t stand a chance in base lmao
welp sukuna got into megumi so it was game over from the start. infinite void can't be active all the time so it's impossible for gojo to beat sukuna half power inside megumi
Plus this character was said to be the strongest, yet he didn't accomplish anything of note and died offscreen I'm pretty sure that's why they're memeing it so hard
Your comment is hilarious though, good job to 7 months ago you
ok takaba, go ahead and tell us something funny
You jealous?

>!Either Gojo's completely dead, in which case his death was unsatisfying as hell, or he's not dead and Gege's stuck dealing with an even more OP version of a character who was already troublesome for being OP.!<

>!I personally hope he's dead so we can move past him, but his death was undoubtedly lousy.!<
Idk he basically killed the strongest member of the bad guys team in the first 10 eps of the anime I don't think there was any question that he could no diff all of them.
tbf he didn’t accomplish anything because he wasn’t permitted to. He had to literally be removed from the story so the characters could actually do anything otherwise.
>ok takaba

takawho?

Would honestly be the funniest thing in the world.
Gege loves trolling his audience.

No spoils but, those things you climb up to reach things that a high...yea...and a lady friend that umm, let's him sorta use one....

Any more than that and I'll need Protective Custody. 

Snail phone out...."cLLLiiiicK"



*In the anime it will be quite some time Kikashi's cocky lil' bro reappears, partly because of what's happened to him, and also because of the Mappa Studios strike, and finally just for the length of time it takes to adapt all the manga there is to animate.
i used it correctly, you called jjk fans unfunny yet you are being unfunny yourself, also its kiddo, being hyprocritical yet again

LMFAO HE BLOCKED ME, JJK SWEEP
Just in case you guys are wondering what happened to Erya’s 3 slave elves
Looks like their ears are also healed. Feels good man 😁
Yeah. They even gets the chance to have a drink with Ainz-sama. So lucky!
are they wearing military uniform?
They join navarick?
I assumed that they joyned Nazarik in some capacity, well, not as much assumed as I hoped, but it's nice to know that that is what happened.
Simple: They were slaves that were abused and force into Nazarick.

Begrudgingly to Maure, they come to enjoy the employee benefits under Aniz.
they also got their PTSD treated by Neuronist and the Pleiades in the side stories. Those stories can be really serious at times!
Ainz isn't a bad guy he is just put in the position of one, but in time, he too would forget who he was and miss it all too well. Which overall, makes him a great character as I wonder how Ainz will turn out in the end.
I seem to recall that Mare was also super uncomfortable/annoyed with them.
I think my favorite part of this is they got their ears back <3
Why weren't they killed tho? They've invaded Nazarik like everyone else.
Why do they have fatigues?
Is Aura&Mare drinking Cola?
Is that an art book? I don't remember this illustration in the ranobe
Because they never wanted to go in the first place without any choice ainz was nice to them
Which book and chapter is this. I wanna buy the audio version since i have book 1 to 6
Hi what volume number is this? I wanna read again but i forgot what volume and chapter is it
Lightning lobotomy?
so THATS what happened to the healer slave squad. Glad to see them living their best lives.
It nice to see they are in good shape
I'm so glad they are safe, they deserve the best after what they went through
I see this post as very wholesome
So what happened was - 

All three of their heads were hit by magic arrow. Instant death.

Ainz laughs with a sinister smile.

Aura is amused.

Mare is blowing bubbles in his cola.
They got drafted to the bootcamp level.
Pandora's Actor was in charge of their wardrobes
I don't remember what they called them in the novel but they're basically attendant outfits. They serve Aura & Mare at this point in the novels but mainly Mare due to his druidic powers.
Yes and they also work under mare
And they don't want to leave. 😂
These Elves were brought in as slaves with little to no choice.
Disobey their master means abuse and death.
Or dying in unexplored Tomb may also risk death.

They were not willing invaders, so they were spared and offered solace in Nazarick to also give Aura and Mare Elf companions (they are also still children).

The Elves agree on the additional factor of the twins having hetrochromatic eyes, which is a sign of royalty among Elves. So they are devoted to their task to take care of the twins and devoted to following Ainz for saving them.

For the record, If these Elves were instead Human slaves they would not have gotten this hospitality. Ainz would most likely set them free after a rest with a memory wipe, or they could pledge allegiance and become spies. Either way they would not stay in Nazaric due to most hating humans.
Navarick?
they actually love serving mare and aura
"You see, I'm not a bad guy. I'm just ahead of the curve."

- Ainz, probably.
They were slaves, they did not make a choice to be there.
Ainz likely recognized they did not have a choice.  He realized they were slaves at the start of things.  Swapping over to the service of someone who freed them, treats them better and quite possibly gave them freedom or at least a place in a hierarchy, and a better life would be more profitable in Ainz’s eyes likely.
They were slave and didn't have a choice, so Ainz spare them.
They weren't come there with their own will, they were forced to be there as slaves, also Ainz though Aura and Mare need some elf friends so they was kept alive
They are alive it is revealed later in the story
They’re elves. They need to have forest camo
nah. its included in the light novel
Overlord has amazing worldbuilding and character development but damn, the power fantasy attracts the creepiest edgelords
And he's the only one uneasy with that.
*They work for both of the elf twins
Hell yeah. Bro's getting some action!
i think they work for both twins but they seem to enjoy the small boy the most
To add: even while they obeyed their master, they were constantly beaten and abused. Nazarick felt like paradise to them.
I agree up to the fact that Nazarick NPCs don't actually hate humans, they dislike everyone outside of Nazarick which in the new world is mainly humans. However, they put up with anyone as long as they are useful to Ainz, recognize Ainz as their master/lord/king/God, or if Ainz told them not to harm them.

Mare actually dislikes the elves but doesn't act on it because Ainz told Aura and him that they would serve under them.
The Denizens don’t hate humans in particular. Just everyone else who wasn’t created by the Supreme beings. Even the lower classes like the maids despise them
Autocorrect I think 😂
Ainz himself most definitely would say he is a bad guy. He said so himself when a certaint Pope called him Justice.
No, I get it, I know who they are. But to think of it, so what? I'm pretty sure other groups also had some sort of hierarchy and maybe other workers were reluctant to go. Yet everyone else got fking obliterated, but those three get a free pass?
Ainz to Foresight:

*- When you find a worm in your food, do you open a conversation with it, or do you crush it mercilessly?*

Not a word-by-word citation, but you get the point. Suddenly Ainz decides to not only open a conversation, but to spare their lives too. That looks contradictory to me.
in the novel they were pretty happy about it and iirc they refused a chance to go home
More reasons to re-read, then. Thanks!
they were making an out of context joke about the artwork. those lines coming from the elves heads are commonly used to show surprise or shock, but this person joked that it was magic arrow. And if it were other characters in the series that context could be very accurate, so I don't even see it as offbrand humor.
It isn’t that deep =.=

Ainz’ expression and pose makes it look more menacing than it is so I made a joke on it.

I thought it was funny… funnier than all the holy club and baby armor spamming in this subreddit at least

Every other joke is about sending people to a literal skinning factory and surprise white lines looking like magic arrows is where you draw the line =.=
Well, he is an incredibly powerful sociopath in a child's body with a child's speech pattern that's being treated like a child by former slaves trying to clean him and dress him up. Anyone's but Ainz' and the NPCs' existence is a bother to him and someone involving themselves into his life is quite the offense to him.

Like, Mare's personality is just downright awful. Nothing redeeming about it.
** practically just Mare though. From what I remember in the LN Aura has no problem telling them she doest like being waited on and they double down on serving Mare who is too meek to say that he doesn't really like it either.
To add even further; they wouldn't want to return to their original homes either since it's a very dangerous forest with many beasts that can easily kill them. But in Nazarick, they're safe, they get good food, and serve royalty (what they think).
They also love Nazarick’s pizza!
I think he realised he was a bad guy at the Katze plains, I remember him mentioning something about killing thousands and feeling nothing.
Ainz also wanted Mare and Aura to get some elven companions. As they are the only elves in Nazarik.
As Ainz says, he doesn't kill without justification. He saw that they were slaves that were brought there by force. They had no choice whatsoever and would've been beaten or killed if they disobeyed. 

So, Ainz decided they didn't deserve to die and that they would be more beneficial as Aura and Mare's companions. He hoped that they could teach Aura and Mare elf culture and how to be adult elfs.
Well they got their without coercion, they go through voting and have a say if they want to. While the 3 elves has no other option, and even get kick whenever Erya feels like it.
If others had an issue they could've just refused and left. Besides, there is a difference between being reluctant but still going along, and being dragged in against your will.
i don’t think being reluctant is the same as being forced against their will or they’ll get abused/killed
Because a member of a party could just.... Not go, slaves don't get that choice
Just a proof that Ainz isn't an evil as many want to believe.
Well Ainz is a bit of a hypocrite, he even admitted as much to Clementine.  And he did crush the worm.  The worm in this case just had amusing luggage.
He very well may have gone lightly on Foresight if they were blunt and honest with him, sadly they chose to roll for deception instead of persuasion.
well they happened to be useful worms because he thought it would be beneficial for aura and mare's development to hang out with members of their own species
You posted something, everyone decided to downvote you as a joke. 

I thought it was funny
And the twins are heterochromatic, in elf terms they are royalty, iirc the three kinda instantly chose to serve mare of their own accord.

Ainz wanted adult elves to teach the kids, ended up being just one of the two :)
they literally got a life of luxury and got asked “do you wanna go home?”
In a way they aren't actually mistaken, Mare and Aura are effectively Emperor Ainz's children
To add even further further, they live in the floor where there's a lot of nature so it's almost close to home.
Ainz is an extremely self aware dude, living most of his early life with self esteem issue. He know the moment he turn undead and save Enri, he is no longer human.
Btw, is it stated in the novel, or is it just a speculation?
Archie has had no other option either ;-) But Ainz Ooal Gown decided to become Nice Ooal Gown and saved them elves \^\^
He at least would've given them painless deaths

Ainz respects straightforward honesty, just look at how he treated Gazef and Zanack
Too bad that half-elf girl from Foresight wasn't considered worthy for Aura & Mare's development \^\^
Pretty much.
they were sent to heaven and then was asked: you wanna go back to purgatory?
to be even more technical:

Mare and Aura are Ainz's nephews. The only children of Ainz is Pandoras Actor.

Now, Ainz says he loves them all equally as his children, which is fine.

But the family tree indicates they are his nephews.

So, as you said, they are effectively categorized as prince/princess, but not direct candidates of succession, since Ainz isn't going anywhere.
Stated in the novel. That's why you see them here.

Shut up and read dude
Where did you get the info Archie doesn't have the option? She always has the option to run away with her siblings. But she didn't. She keeps enabling her parents buying excessive stuffs while she paid their loans. She's not a kid who doesn't have her own decision. She made her choice.
Arcie was a worker. The 3 elves were slaves. She had a choice to pick the job or not. Big difference.

Also Ainz talked with her prior. She gave an answer fit for a worker. She said nothing about her twin siblings. Ainz only decided upon the cards played.
Don't tell me what to do, and I won't tell you where to go.
Comparing Archie to the *slave* Elves is wild 💀
Don't tell me where to go and I won't tell you where to come.
It's masterpiece 
Judul HG ni Koisuru Futari
~~If you look at the scan's credit page, you would know that it's an actual build.~~

“The Dreaming Girl in Me” starts playing.
This build was a nightmare to pose without falling off the stand, it is cool though
Psycho Zaku x Deep Striker?! 

Damn, it looks good.
"Judul" lol


Your Indonesian is slipping out
The Psycho Zaku Thunderbolt is honestly peak Zaku.
bang "judul" belum di translate
I can’t be the only one that thinks the packs are getting to be a bit too much, can I?
Saving this so I can make it in GB4 later
Ah yes another post reminding me that Bandai will likely never release another Thunderbolt kit ever again.
I see a radome but can't tell, does it have an I-Field generator too?
It.... it's beautiful...
I NEED IT
That one Side Character Gundam during the final conflict with heavy Artillery designed to let him keep up with the MC (He still gets no-diffed by the Villain)
What am i looking at-
Why that zaku have a v.o.b from armored core 4A?
How much I wish someone scanlated this
The most psychotic zaku
Almost looked like the REX radome and railgun at first glance.
Uhhh…that’s a bit more daka than I remember it having
What's the name of this Manga?
man i should probably get vanguard overboost units for my model kits
i am so sad that the fan-translation of this manga stopped at chapter 18 and there is no way to read official english translation anywhere
Honestly, I have the same reaction

Did HG Futari address the existence of SEED Freedom (which redeemed Shinn to the public) and G-Witch (the yuri series of the franchise)? While HG Futari isn't inherently yuri, but more of a slice of life promoting High Grade kits, it should be able to address other modern entries right as the story ended.
Thank you for getting us the credit sauce. Now I can go enjoy the pro modler and the artist!
For_riner churning out insane custom models and getting into that manga is so cool to see since I follow his IG
It’s beautiful…
looks like all the weapons from the gundam and the zaku are also mounted on the deep striker pack.
okwokwow lupa dan nghk bisa di edit deh
Yeah but tbh that already applies to base Psycho Zaku imo, this just feels like a self parody and just bad tbh
I think it need just a little bit more.
Everything. That Zaku has everything.
Psycho Zaku with Deep Striker parts added on
HG ni koi suru futari/HGに恋するふたり
The series primarily takes place in 2018-2019(one of the chapters references the passing from Heisei to Reiwa), a short scene in 2020, when the RG Force Impulse was released, and then a couple of years later, when the girls were at Gundam Base(I think about 2022, 2023), when they announced that the Seed movie(then unnamed) was in production.

Spoiler: >!the epilogue chapter is in Jan 2024, when the movie was finally released in theaters, and Kanzaki(main MC), Sora, and Momo(the girl in this picture) went to watch the movie together. Kanzaki was just stuck in her seat for a bit after the movie ended because of how touched she was.!<
>!Hmm... Interesting. But no mention of G-Witch is kinda unfortunate. But at least it shows the growth of our High Grade-loving girls in life.!<
Oh the series is actually over now?
Well, yeah. Of course there wouldn't be. Kanzaki, the main focus character, is an OG seed fan. So seed is the main focus series for the manga(Gundam X is only included when taking MC's age into account)

Also, G-witch is far too recent, so the author probably didn't have the permissions for it. And considering that the series officially occurs in 2019-2020, and then jumped to the Seed movie, there was no space to squeeze in G-witch anywhere anyways.
The last volume released last month
grr we really should TL these for the sub, but I forgot: is this on Gundam Ace or a different magazine?)
Yep, Gundam Ace, but since it's already concluded, the best way would be to get the volumes.

I could try to translate it, but I would need a team to do the cleaning and redrawing and a raw provider
> cleaning and redrawing and a raw provider

try talking to u/TrafalgarLog; I reckon he has contacts he can she for you
I do the all the stuff mentioned myself so I don't have much resources but I also do have this manga on my list of stuff to do once I'm done with the stuff I'm in the middle of if that helps
Do you've got a translator for it?
When I do it the translator will be me yes
