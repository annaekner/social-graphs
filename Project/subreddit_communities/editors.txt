Adobe is the Worst Company Ever
So some background -- I've literally been using Adobe Premiere since high school (I graduated in 2005). It enabled me to create some really artistic things over the years. Compared to AVID's workflow -- it was a dream for me. 

Somewhere along the line -- it started getting worse and worse. The constant crashes; weird quirks that had no logical explanation or origin; things like Auto-Save actually making the program crash and LOSE WORK; the constant updates for Creative Cloud App that break everything until you update it (and often break things even more once you do); the s\*\*\*\*y way Adobe treats its customers and their complaints about this dogs\*\*t software...you get the idea.

Recently, it has literally ruined my life to the point where I had to switch to DaVinci Resolve. And wow -- am I glad I did. It feels like the day I switched from Adobe Audition to REAPER. Refreshing. Actually works. Doesn't make you want to smash your computer out of frustration. Much easier to use than Premiere.

As I'm finishing porting my project over to DaVinci -- Adobe starts yelling at me for having Creative Cloud installed on two computers. I'm licensed for up to two installs and this is the first time it has every done this. It's not the standard "Oh you are logged in somewhere else so you have to log out." Just tells me I can't have more than one person using it. Adobe are scum and I'm so glad they are being sued by the government.

The cherry on top? Today, I was exporting from DaVinci and it was taking way longer than normal. Then -- I notice that every title is screwed up in the export. What do you think was causing it? Creative Cloud had updated itself overnight (I still have the license for a couple more weeks until it expires) and just uninstalled the font I was using. I literally hate Adobe more than any other company. It managed to screw up a project in a completely different system.

Switch to DaVinci. If you are even having a few of the issues I outlined -- it will get worse. DaVinci is so much better that I'm kicking myself for not switching earlier. Peace.
Hard agree, esp with how theyre going about AI rn aswell has put me off their software too.
I am no fan of Adobe. Let's start with that. 

I have been using Photoshop since version 2.0. I learned vectors in Aldus Freehand and moved to Illustrator on version 3.0. I have been using After Effects since the COSA days, Pagemaker since version 5, and InDesign since its inception. I used the old Premiere and the new Premiere. 

None of these apps have been, at any time in their decade-spanning lifecycle, any more or less buggy than any other software I have used. 

The only time I saw constant crashes was when people ran on systems that were either infected with malware or generally very unclean (lots of "shareware", system utilities, and other stuff that could interfere with the stability of a system). 

I use Photoshop about 7 hours a day. I switched from Premiere to FCPX because I like the workflow more (not because Premiere has anything wrong with it). 

I hate Adobe's tendency to prey on users and overcharge. I hate their subscription tactics. I hate that they are heartless. I hate that their products are do expensive. 

But I have never experienced instability of my system due to Adobe software. Mac or Windows, it's been fairly reliable.
I agree. Just finished a 60 minute show on Prem and it was such a headache from start to finish. Avid and Resolve are both so so so much better, of course both are far from perfect themselves.
I hate all editing software. I just use Premiere because that's the one I get paid to work in.
I hate to tell you this but this morning DaVinci Resolve borrowed my car without asking and ran over my beloved cat. I'm just not sure what program to use anymore.
I'm pretty sure that Nestle is a far worse company.
Strongly disagree 

Once you understand the workflow, Premiere works well. There are still some benefits to using Avid but the difference is becoming less each year. Resolve is a great colour tool. Not sold on the edit side. Not many people have jumped over for that reason. It's still fantastic and I like Grant. 

Adobe as a company has some crap parts to it. As editors we should engage more with the forums, engineering teams, make groups to feedback and improve the software. 

Currently working on a HUGE feature doc with 100s of hours of footage. There's been some issues but broadly it's been good times. Some errors we made setting up. Adobe should offer more professional level guides to setting up and running the software (its complicated after all)
So you hated Avid, then you hated Premiere. When is your 'I hate Davinci' post gonna drop?
To each their own. 
I switched from FCP7 to Adobe the day Final Cut X was announced. . It’s been great. I’ve cut trailers, feature docs, episodic TV, shorts, commercials… never a problem. I don’t understand what some of you guys are doing or experiencing.
I've been using Premiere professionally for 10 years (currently editing a TV show at WB), and I've never had any of the issues you're describing above? Usually when I see people complain about Premiere here their issue ultimately boils down to either incorrect workflow or hardware - both of which are out of the company's control. The Productions workflow has especially been a game-changer for us on the TV side of things, and I like it way more than anything I've done in Avid. 

I usually recommend Davinci to beginners or students because its free and more advanced than consumer-friendly alternatives like imovie or capcut, but if you want to work at a professional level I don't see it ever competing.
I'm finishing a big project in Premiere now, alternating between banging my head into the wall and screaming in rage, just trying to get through it - and as soon as I do, I think i'll finally, years past due, take your advice and make a permanent switch.  Premiere has gotten borderline unusable...
I've been running the Adobe suite as a producer / editor for 20 years. I've worked in both MAC and PC shops. While Adobe does some things that I'm not a fan of, I have found their software to be no more buggy or crash prone than any other software I run. As long as your box passes the Adobe HAL, it should be as reliable as any other software. At least that's been my experience.
i HAVE to use Adobe for a client, since I have a team that also uses is to edit episodes, but once i lose this client im switching to DaVinci. Dreaming BIG
As much as I dislike the dinosaur that is Avid, my MC session has now been running for over 3 weeks without restarting/crashing once (not just during the day, it's been left switched on and running MC for over 500 hours).  While slightly more modern, I can't stomach Premiere and its instability.  I do like Resolve, but its hard to convince my clients to go with it (i'm normally on multi-editor projects).
I have every bit of software they subscription sell...they don't get a dime from me. It's fully activated, updates, and I even downloaded it legally directly from Adobe.

Damn it feels good to be a gangster.

I also avoid using them unless I have to. 

I've been using Resolve as my preferred NLE since 15 came out. I've been using studio since 17, I think, and it's only gotten better and better.

Seems like every update I find something else that feels like a real game changer.

Edit: I want to be clear... I'd rather pay for something else than use Adobe software for free, and I've been actively looking for other software to replace the rest of the Adobe software that I still depend on.
Dude I've literally cried from the frustrations it's caused me. Every time I call support I try to calm myself by simultaneously googling  if it's possible to sue them for distress. When you're working on deadlines and shit hits the fan, no I can not wait for your tech guy to call me two days later! No I do not need you to send me links to articles,I've already read through. I need you TO WORK!
yo dude - I found this homeless guy on the street that knows iMovie and CapCut - screw Adobe, and Resolve, and Media Composer - I am paying this guy in Meth, and he is doing a GREAT job - I have 100,000 hits on TikTok now, and I am starting to make REAL money !

............. this is what this forum is turning into.

I agree. In a professional environment I notice most agencies and companies switching away from Adobe since you can have issues that can break entire projects. I introduced a few clients to resolve and most of them were surprised about the stability, speed and ease of use when there's not "Adobe" in front of the softwares name. This doesn't only apply to resolve but to almost everything these days. (Affinity for example works great too).
Also most agencies are saving thousands of € per year since cancelling their subscriptions. My bet is, Adobes times are starting to being over. 
I've been using Pp since 2007, and the only time it behaved any way like this is because of my hardware than anything else. Regardless, I'm shifting to Davinci in November because I hate having to pay for both Pp and AE in perpetuity.
Forever Avid was the most hated (snobby) company. I used it for many years before switching over to Premiere out of necessity to be more compatible in my area. Was super reluctant and certainly had to rethink my way of working but in the end I love it. I brought over a lot of my Avid traits / shortcuts. At least those that it can handle. But ultimately I found in my work (mostly commercial/corporate/social) it works wonderfully for what I need it to do. Especially how it works with other Adobe tools. For those that have technical issues there are a lot of resources out there to help prevent/fix them, but like I said for me it works wonderfully. And clearly for others, it isn't stable enough for what they are using it for. The fusion page on DaVinci was just too much for my brain with its node based way of working. More like smoke or flame. And my earlier experiences trying out the edit page led me to believe it didn't have enough tools/ability to not have to learn the fusion page to accomplish what I needed. But love the color page when I need it. The great thing is we have options. None of them are perfect.
I work on Final Cut and rarely have issues and when I do it’s because my crappy Mac has run out of room or needs an update. I’ve always thought premiere was not aesthetically pleasing or fun to work with. Glad it’s getting the hate it deserves. Haha
As a 5 years premiere user, I fucking hate it. Even though I work so fast in it, my software speed is incredible as I’ve found all the shortcuts needed to make my work flow faster. With that said, premiere is the worst software I have ever used in my life
Adobe can suck cocks. Fuck that company.
Yep, I'v been complaining to, and about Adobe for years. One of my Editors decided to update halfway through a project because they thought they might get better features (yes, he was stupid!). Na, all it's done is mess up the AAF import into Pro Tools and wasted me 2 days trying to work out a solution. Turn off auto update, then you get a project from another client, CC says you can't open project until you update CC. Update CC, Adobe says you can't open project unless you update your OS. Update OS, plugins don't work, bugs, errors, crashes, you get the picture.   

And fuck their subscription models, nobody needs a monthly subscription to their software unless hardware updates to a point where you have no choice. I've bought perpetual licences 10+yrs ago that I'm still using now. 

Davinci, only need to purchase once and can use for years. Can be a little clunky on time, but their user interface has vastly improved over the years and now it's my go-to software for picture.
I recently had to export an entire project to Resolve because Premiere - different versions on different computers - refused to export an AAF or OMF that was useable by my sound designer and mixer. It was a horrible week of trouble shooting and stressing and moving deliveries around. This is my livelihood and I was shook. Still sort of am.
The key really is just to just hate all of them.
waiting for the adobe staff verified accounts to come in here and smugly explain how youre using it wrong
DaVinci is taking the spot over PP  the same way China is taking over the  states in global economy: silently, in the background and just being better and more efficient
Just pulled the plug on Adobe after about 14 years, never going back.
Noped out of Adobe a little over a decade ago (and i used to work there a long time on web/video products), and haven't looked back. Affinity, Resolve, Reaper. Great software, and no subscriptions.
Could not agree with your assessment more. We are currently striking all of our licenses and switching to DaVinci for video. Surprisingly, canva for our quick one off designs is very robust and intuitive for folks in our shop to use.
I just had a font weight vanish from my computer overnight and now I’m wondering if it was caused by Adobe. I couldn’t find the font, thought I must be going crazy, but looked at some AE comps I had exported the day before and yep, they used that font. Now it’s nowhere to be found. Weirdest shit ever
pure truth no cap
Man, not trying to get into a war, but my experience with Adobe's tools over the last few years has really been pretty seamless (I started on the first release of Photoshop when it shipped on a pile of diskettes in 1990, I'm old as hell). But I read all these threads with Adobe rage (After Effects seems to take the most hits) and it hasn't happened to me (yet??)

I'm in AE sometimes ten hours a day, PS, AI, Premiere - my main complaints with Adobe is Premiere really should be viewing and rendering much faster (the current generation of FCP is just so smoking fast), and AI is getting some serious bloat. But going from Intel to a Studio was the best After Effects upgrade I've ever seen; I wonder how much of this is a Mac vs. PC issue. I'd love to see some data on that. 

Again, not wanting to get into *that* fight, but my tools just don't get in my way. And I'm full-time, editing, animation, VFX, motion graphics, maybe 1/3 of my work I actually shoot as well. I'm not doing anything special hardware-wise, plain old M2 studio (not an Ultra), the only thing I do differently than some users is *nothing* goes on my boot drive but OS, apps, email, personal docs. All of my cache/scratch/background tasks go to a dedicated NVME, my media's on an NVME RAID (which was like $300, no big deal). But I don't know any pro's that use their boot drives for media and project files. And I don't even own a laptop.

I do use Resolve for interviews - color grading and audio sweetening, Fairlight is just the SHIT. It's like ProTools without sussing out their mess of in/out issues - really almost a direct knockoff of ProTools. But that's just exported as ProRes HQ and dumped into FCP. FCP is still the fastest editing experience I've ever had. 

I wouldn't have a business without Adobe - if I stopped taking external projects, I'd lose half my income. I feel for ya OP, I hope my luck holds out!
I'm going to say it in a semi-curmudgeonly way.

They all suck. And if you think Apple, BMD, Avid or Adobe are actually great, you're lying to yourself. 

Each of the tools has had *royal shitshows* at different times. Much of why is that they add new features, some that work, some that are broke - many that work well in a demo and less good professionally. 

I've had every-single-one disappear. Just "gone".  Avid Error codes. I gave FCP (which has often been solid) a single file and it blew up it's memory. Much of Adobe pain is shitty formats. And you haven't lived until you keep missing a double deep menu in Resolve. Or something that exists on one page and has no existence on others (where it totally could.)

Much of it has to do with VFR and H264/5 media. ProRes is almost always bulletproof.

And FWIW, I'm having a personal shitshow with Adobe support right now…over Photoshop breaking and the actual Creative cloud app.
Audition is terrible. I may just go back to Garageband at this point.

Tell me more about this Reaper...
Quark Express forever
I've never had an issue. I have some serious survivorship bias with Adobe I guess.

But I definitely agree that they're scum. I don't like their tactics and I've seen them pulling their shady shit for a long time now.
Adobe Sucks. BMD please never change except for the better
I never looked back after switching from Premiere to Edius, some ten years ago. Even then it was a relief. DaVinci Resolve is ok, some things are faster/better, some are slower/harder than in Edius. I don't think it's my time to fully switch to Resolve.

Few months ago I installed Photoshop just to test the generative fill, as it was the base of their marketing - and found out that the AI 'thing' does not work at all, some legal issue... LOL.

I had some old tiny projects in Spark, and recently found out that Adobe made some free fonts not free anymore.

If I had to choose one thing I hate about Adobe the most, that wouldn't be anything people mention here and everywhere... I hate their SHORTCUTS!
I can think of a few companies worse then Adobe. Mostly companies producing biochemical weapons and such though.

In the media production software companies category though, Adobe definitely tops the list.
Some of us have to put up with Adobe’s shit because there are no other apps like After Effects on the market and they know it so they are being assholes and getting away with it.
It’s gotten bad for professionals. We just aren’t as big a market, nor does that larger market know enough to understand what’s required to produce great results. The AI tools are at best doing pretty good with the promise they will get better. Pretty good without the user having to pay the real cost yet, btw. 
So while Adobe is pretty bad, they are just one in a long line of those chasing growth through AI. From my experience Dow is still the worst company.
Don’t switch to Resolve!  Look what it did to my desk!  Definitely bloatware!

Question as I haven't used Davinci to edit yet - Do you have the same easy tools to play with graphics, easily keyframe shots etc? Or what are the main differences between Premiere and Davinci? (I know a quick google search or youtube videos can answer this, but would love the thoughts of an actual user like you).

I used to edit on FCP 7 back in the day and once apple ruinned  it, the jump to premiere was seamless compared to Avid - trying to add graphics on Avid or even just basic transform operations was annoying. So curious how the premiere workflow adapts to Davinci.
I just switched this month to Affinity Publisher/Designer/Photo and cancelled my Adobe account. I guess I will try out DaVinci next, I haven't done much video editing recently so I haven't needed to but I'm just glad to be rid of the monthly fee. 

No other problems with Adobe but I used to own CS6 years ago until it stopped working with my system updates, and I really felt bad paying a monthly fee for a program I already own. I don't do much high level work so I just needed the basics anyway.
I started with da vinci since I much prefer  one time payment model to a monthly sub model, im so glad I did 😅
Careful. I got FLAMED on this sub for mentioning the constant crashes and bad updates.
Sorry, I strongly disagree. I'm old. I've been using Photoshop since it was born, and basically every other Adobe product since they were released or acquired from another company. I defy anyone to show me a higher-value suite of continuously evolving products for $50 a month or less.

Take a step back. It's a fucking miracle that you and your computer can render out 4K clips of moving images while tossing back a cup of coffee and doom-scrolling Twitter. Does Premiere have bugs? Sure. Do FCP, AVID or DaVinci? Sure. But you know what? I'd offer anyone to go back and try editing 3/4" videotape or even better, cutting negative, compare that to Adobe's workflow then get back to me about how miserable their existence is. The integration between Adobe apps rocks. The continual evolution of their products rocks.  The price for the suite rocks. I could complain about the bugs but, seriously, the whole deal is a frigging miracle.
Davinci is great.
I never miss an opportunity to tell people to drop Adobe and get DaVinci. Hated them ever since they started ripping people off with the subscription model.

DaVinci is great (but if you're a motion graphics designer you're unfortunately stuck with AE for now, but for everything else, there's no excuse not to use DaVinci.)
I'd like to join in on this. FUCK adobe. Been using it since high school as well and the code is basically the same. A big time engineer friend of mine hard agrees. He said, "They basically make functional enough programs and then gift wrap it for subscription. Their code has not changed in ages and it's fucking garbage.".

They keep bloating it with more and more features for content creators and it's adding a lot of weight to the software with what feels like ZERO optimization, thorough tests, or deeper programming, which is part of the main reason why I'm about to move to Davinci myself and it's heartbreaking because I KNOW premiere so well and have basically created my own workflows and so many macros and shortcut keys. I'm about to move to Davinci because it utilizes tf out of the money I spent on my computer. absolutely using full bandwidth of my CPU and GPUs. Davinci exports 4K+ RAW footage with heavy color and effects LIKE BUTTER compared to Adobe premiere. Adobe doesn't utilize jack shit ESPECIALLY After Effects. Davinci can actually work as fast as you can.

Bottom line, ADOBE NEEDS TO COMPLETELY REPROGRAM AND RETHREAD THEIR SOFTWARE INSTEAD OF DISTRACTING US WITH BLOATING IN MORE NEW FEATURES. FIX THE REAL PROBLEM AT HAND. Cheap greedy sons of bitches. And Davinci is ONE FUCKING PAYMENT AND IT'S YOURS, AND IT SMOKES ADOBE IN PERFORMANCE. WHY?? HOW????

  
Fuck man.. thank you for the thread.
**TLDR: Final Cut Pro X is the shit. Not joking.** Look into it and you'll see why some veteran cutters are switching.

25+ year Emmy Award winning (non-humblebrag) Doc editor here. Mained Media Composer from the start of my career in 98. Grew into the occasional FCP 7 job back when it had massive inroads in the short form world. Once it changed to FCPX and the pro world dropped it completely I found my way to Premiere. Found it much easier to work with native media in Premiere but would still choose Avid for long form work due to its media management and collaborative workflow solutions. (As long as you took the time to render proxies.)

Dual used Media Composer and Premiere for the past decade, each have their strengths and weaknesses. Media composer is the devil I know and Avid is hysterically bad at keeping the codebase up with new OS and hardware releases. Adobe will have software available and tested for new updates almost immediately, but then Premiere will lose link to random pieces of media in your project after updating. That's a level of crazy making I have yet to match. 

A little over a year ago I stumbled on an article by a veteran editor explaining why he switched to FCPX and wasn't turning back. It was a great read and got me interested, so I downloaded the free trial and started playing around with FCPX. It's now my favorite NLE app by a mile. 

In short, they changed how editing works in the timeline. You no longer need to spend half your time arming and disarming tracks,  lassoing odd chunks, or opening gaps to insert new work while dancing around sync issues... the "trackless" workflow and magnetic timeline are the evolution of editing. You'll hate it for a day or so until it clicks, then you'll never want to go back. Every other editing app feels like stepping back in time now. 

There are still jobs that have to be Avid or Premiere based on client / shared workflow needs, and I still haven't tried cutting a multi-hour network doc in FCPX and I'm not sure how I would like it, but for short form work it's a dream. This last statement might hit home for some of you who have been at this for a while: FCPX made working in the timeline actually *fun* again. Fun. Imagine that! 

I'm babbling all of this because I'm so thankful to the guy who posted the article that intrigued me enough to try it out. If you're lucky enough to still have steady editing work, are Mac based and you can choose your editing platform, give FCPX a shot. You'll be surprised. (Just to say it, I'm not affiliated with apple or FCPX in any way other than being a user.) Worth mentioning that I bought a tutorial to learn the basics of FCPX and that was clutch. YouTubers can get you pretty far, but people who are experts at teaching make a big difference. Highly recommend RippleTrainings Final Cut Pro Core Training.

  
Last thought: OP, I can sense the unbridled rage in your post and want to share that I feel you. I've been there with Premiere a number of times, some of them cost me days of work and billable time. Their bugs cost me a good chunk of money. It's beyond crazy making. To stay current on hardware we can't stay stagnant on OS updates, which means not staying stagnant on software updates, which means rolling the dice on reliability.  Glad to hear you're in a happier place with Resolve. I still need to learn that one. It's just a matter of time until a project with its name on it comes calling. 

Here's the link to the site that hooked me: [https://nofilmschool.com/switched-final-cut-pro-x-after-25-years](https://nofilmschool.com/switched-final-cut-pro-x-after-25-years)

Cheers all, and stay positive out there. Hard to do while our industry is in semi-collapse, but things will eventually level out and we'll find a new normal. Until then, take care of your mental health as much as possible.  It's currently rough days, but good things are born from chaos. Man, this turned into work therapy for me. Sorry for the huge post.
Well said.
As a Colorist, Ive been pleading with all of you Adobe heads for ages. PLEASE listen to OP.
Best adobe app:

The one that removes all the adobe apps
https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/kb/cc-cleaner-tool-installation-problems.html
I spent over 10k on them...only for them to f me over. I haven't used FCP regularly since about 2015 after my last MBP died, as soon as they announced that skimming agreement I closed my account bought a Mac and FCP. ( I don't like Vegas or davinci)
I agree with you about Adobe. But what do I do about photoshop and Lightroom classic?
Problem is that every job post I see working with an editing team it's almost always Premiere.   
  
Only time I see Resolve in job posts is for color correction.
I am happy that Davinci is working for you. I had the opposite experience. I couldn’t get davinci to run without it constantly crashing on me.  It drove me back to Premiere.
I have been working with Adobe for 10 years now. Of course there are bugs and of course there are crashes but for me it never crashed often or on critical projects. Unless I work with weird footage premiere runs fine for me. But unlike others I stick to common codecs and don't update when I have a stable version.
Sorry to hear that you have been having trouble. 

Issues come up now and again, but Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Media Encoder all run pretty well on my workstations.
Once you know what it likes, Premiere is great.  And Resolve is great for color.  

In my experience editing in Resolve, I had a couple major issues with proxies and delivering an AAF to mix.  Therefore, I don’t trust it.
Yeah defo, but I can’t switch to anything cause I know how to use 22 to a T
Personally prefer Adobe's workflow for editing then switch to Resolve for grading, but fuck man the former keeps crashing on me.
>Recently, it has literally ruined my life to the point where I had to switch to DaVinci Resolve. And wow -- am I glad I did. It feels like the day I switched from Adobe Audition to REAPER.

Does Reaper have a spectral editor like Audition's which allows you to spot heal/remove certain frequencies to get rid of things like clicks and pops? I find that's the most useful part of Audition which keeps me there.
This made me ponder, the title not the body of text, but I’ve been using Adobe for atleast 6 years now and there’s things about it that definitely piss me off but over all it’s been a reliable software. My biggest gripe is paying $60 for CC when all I use are pp, ae and ps
I ditched adobe for other editors. Got sick and tired of their crap and the subscription model is not sustainable for someone like me who uses it mostly for fun.
I wish Adobe wasn't required in the professional world but unfortunately it's required for most professional related things 😭
I'd love to switch to DaVinci but I'm a bit stuck as I also use photoshop/aftereffects/illustrator extensively and I love how they all talk to each other. I've also been using them for a similar amount of time as OP (started using them at uni in 07) and apart from Maya+Blender, they are all I've known. 

God I hate adobe though.
Export times alone from Premier to Resolve are the key reasons why I switched.
I like premiere. It doesn’t crash for me. I edit on a MacBook and I have a proxy workflow.
I wish I could switch to DaVinci but my job uses premiere so I gotta deal with the BS. Premiere is the only one I got issues with though, PS, LR & AE work pretty good for me
I wholeheartedly agree. I really enjoy InDesign, Lightroom and Photoshop but the Video editing software by Adobe is just pure dogshit. It doesnt run well, it crashes too much, trouble replaying footage in preview and let alone starting After Effects or a Premiere Project takes ages even with a freshly set up M2 ssd (870 evo) and the cost is in comparison to Davinci just outrageous. Plus the new terms that they just can use your work. I‘d rather pay half of a yearly subscription for a Davinci license forever. Shit is just hitting the fan with this company.
Can someone resurrect Adobe Suite 5? - that was the last good copy.
But is there anything that realistically replace after effects?
I’m going to do this. I’m so sick of Adobe for all the reason above. Also been a user for 20 years and it’s just keeps getting worse and worse.

The other thing I hate about Adobe is something I found out recently that in the latest update the Terms and Conditions state that Adobe owns the copyright to anything you produce in its software, as a commercial media producer this is unacceptable 

Thank you for your post
Paul from Adobe here and I’m glad the OP switched and is happy but I don’t wish what has happened to him on my worst enemy. Personally I use Illustrator and Ps and don’t have crashes any more than any other software. And when I do I appreciate the “Recovered” file because I remember when I’d resign to just rebuilding my files from scratch. Also I’m on a Mac so I think that also helps. And I only use Pr about 10% of the time. But maybe it has a tendency to crash a lot? 

Anyway. Glad you’re happy. From one creative to another. Life is hard enough without having to deal with stupid tech issues.
FCPX for me.
Had the exact same experience, except that I bought a big FCP and other program bundle. One time payment, and no dumbass subcriptions or crashes.
You know what else works? Avid🤣🤣🤣
But seriously, if you can master the Media Composer workflow, you are golden. Resolve has come a long way, and if it continues to improve, it might actually replace Premiere. Time will tell.
You keep saying it’s ruined “your life” or the issues have been your “entire life”. I don’t love Adobe, and can’t say I’ve had the significant issues you’re having (Premiere editor for 15 years) but have you um…..been doing other things outside of working to improve the rest of your life? I get the annoyance, but work is just work my man. What else are you doing?
Adobe’s subscription model is a scam. Avoid giving them money whenever possible.
yeah they lost me when they started asking a monthly fee for their programs. i get it, a lot of people love it, but i don't want to have to be online when working, i have lived in a lot of rural areas where the internet can go out if someone coughs. And just monthly fees in general for every damn thing- over it.
If you haven't properly configured your equipment (mac or pc) for redundancy then that's on you. EVERY NLE has issues. But the first rule of video editing is and always has been redundancy.
I love DaVinci, I just wish that it had a lightroom/photoshop replacement. Would love to edit photos with nodes
I rarely have issues with Premiere or AE. I'm guess I'm just lucky. I work all day in AE with very little hiccups.
I really like PP, and I’m a confirmed Avid user.
Meh, I can't remember the last time I had issues to be honest.  Except when I was trying to use a Insta360 plugin about a year ago but I think that had more to do with the plugin.
Yeah, you can definitely say that again! TRY DaVinci Resolve 19 https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/ca/products/davinciresolve it’s FREE and has better features than adobe! I would rather use da Vinci resolve 19 instead of Adobe, even if it was the same price.
YES come to the dark side of Blackmagic. Fusion is underrated as well.
Switched to davinci 2 years ago. Hardly ever open adobe anymore
Thank God I'm a \*PIRATE\*
I went back to Premiere for a project not long ago and they still haven't fixed the bugs that I had encountered SEVEN YEARS ago.
Yeah, adobe as a company is terrible.

They also have near monopoly on the market, because outside of video editors, nothing else come close, especially when it comes to supporting ecosystem and AI features.

It's sad but there's little we can do.
Gentle disagree. Premiere’s biggest weakness is its biggest strength: it has a lot of tools and accepts a lot of codecs. This makes it really accessible to a wide range of editors, but also makes it easy to not maximize your workflow. 

I find if I’m following a “traditional”  workflow - transcode everything to ProRes before ingesting, working only on optimized machines from media on a fast server, and only use basic effects - it’s a very stable offline editor. When I inherit projects from editors who mix a million codecs, add a bunch of effects, and nest with wild abandon then… yeah. It starts to crash. 

There are definitely things I like better in Avid, but Premiere works for our pipeline and has been a solid tool.
I'm gonna get a lot of flack again by saying this but honestly Premiere is unrivalled when it comes to editing software
Have you tried deleting your caches? 99% of Adobe problems solved for me.
r/Reaper one of us one of us
I can get behind the statement that Adobe has much room for improvement with its business practices and product development decisions.

However as someone who has used Premiere Pro over the past 10 years, I do disagree with some of your points about Premiere being absolute trash. These are just my own experiences, and by no means am I invalidating yours.

Premiere became way more stable once I switched over to Mac, especially when Adobe made it run natively on Apple Silicon. I get that this solution isn't going to help PC users, but Premiere does seem to run better overall on Macs. I also saw performance improvements when I set up everything optimally:

* Premiere installed on fastest drive (same as OS)
* Project files and media on a separate drive
* Cache files on it's own drive

Most of the Premiere issues I ever had stemmed from one of three root causes:

1. Editing with VFR footage
2. Editing with a highly compressed codec like H.264
3. Corrupted cache files

For points 1 & 2, transcoding media is the best solution, and really doesn't slow down the workflow much. And for corrupted cache files, it's a simple fix by deleting the cache files from wherever they are stored.

I also have a license for DaVinci Resolve Studio, and there are quite a few things I much prefer within Resolve. However there are also some wonky things that keep me from switching to it as my NLE of choice.

I'm not a fan of the database structure for saving project files. You can literally delete entire projects and folders from the home screen of Resolve, and there are no confirmation prompts or safety checks to say "Do you really want to delete these files?" I accidentally discovered this by deleting a folder with all my work from this year in it, and although I restored the main database file, there are like 3-5 other smaller database files that all have to match. If one doesn't match, your projects don't appear in Resolve. This is a HUGE oversight in my opinion, especially not having any confirmation of a rather critical action.

The way Resolve caches is weird. In Premiere, even if I've bogged down my timeline with clips, effects, color adjustments, motion graphics, etc., I can render the timeline and then it plays back in real time. With Resolve, once my timeline gets a bit heavier than just clips, even after rendering it will still slow down and not play back in real time. I have no idea how to fix this and after researching it looks like there really isn't a fix at this time.

Lastly, Premiere is pretty easy to troubleshoot if there's an issue, as it throws an error code and will let you know what frame has an issue. It could be my lack of experience with Resolve, but I've never got a specific error  code. It just crashes or decides to stop working, and troubleshooting is more difficult.

If Resolve works better for you, great! Continue to use it and enjoy that Adobe subscription-free life. No NLE is perfect and each one will eventually have hiccups at some point. As for me, Premiere (23.0 and higher) is the most stable NLE on my M1 Mac Studio (compared to FCPX and Resolve.)

Fuck adobe. All my homies hate adobe
Been using gimp since 2010.also use Davinci for video, dark table for photo editing. Didn't have the money to justify creative cloud in college ten years ago definitely don't have it now.
If Adobe would just work it would be great.

I'd love to swap, but many of the cool plugins/scripts/libraries/templates etc that I use and save me ungodly amounts of time are all only in Premiere/After Effects sadly
I still get notifications from the Adobe User Voice forums where people are responding to posts I made years ago pointing out broken or missing features that are *still* not sorted. Occasionally there’s an update from an Adobe employee to say that something will be coming in the next update and all I can think is “Too late. I switched to Resolve years ago because it already has this feature.”

It’s so nice to have unshackled myself from that company and to be using software made by people who genuinely seem to understand what we need and who innovate in ways we couldn’t have imagined.
Maybe learn technical workflow. I have no problems.
Strongly disagree with this. Unfortunately every one of your problems is probably due to user error. As an expert level Adobe user across Premiere and After Effects, and plenty skilled in both Resolve and Avid, I can tell you without a doubt that Premiere is the most stable of all the applications I use. I've had Avid crash on me for simply pushing the play button.
Why I love Final Cut Pro X
Downvoted due to hyperbolic title.
How did it literally ruin your life? Did it delete an import project for a client or something?
I’ve honestly never experienced the whole “Premiere Pro always crashes” experience, but then again, I have a decently powerful laptop and started using Adobe products around 2021, so I’m sure most of the bugs have gotten weeded out by the time I started using their products. Adobe definitely does overprice their subscriptions, but my school has been paying for my Creative Cloud lately, so I haven’t had to deal with the price lately. The only reason I’m starting to switch from Premiere to DaVinci was for the color grading. Prior to that, I would edit in Premiere, export an XML, and color grade in DaVinci. I still use their photography programs, though.
I believe you're in the wrong place for this. Lots of more amateur editors can get by with Da Vinci or Reaper, but the pros need what the whole Adobe suite offers and I personally need the stability of Adobe stuff. I know you had trouble with crashes or whatever but I never have, and yet I have had issues when using the other company products

Yes the AI thing is particularly egregious, but that's not limited to just Adobe stuff, as Da Vinci is also advertising for upcoming AI additions, for example

To each their own
I love my Adobe subscription. it does everything I need and beyond. happy camper.
They're literally foaming at the mouths over AI. Forced it into everything imaginable. Went to an Adobe conference and every single chat or new tool was AI. Talk about not knowing your audience.
I will never understand them actively trying to destroy the industry they are meant to be supplying.
Global downturn in the economy much?
Agree with all your points.
Completely agree. I hate their subscription model and their predatory tactics, but the only issues I’ve encountered with their products are cause my pc is already considered old
Yea, it has some quirks but if you are using it correctly, with good workflow you will not have problems. Overwhelming majority of these problems is user error and bad media management.
I'm a bit younger than you and I've been using PageMaker and Freehand as well when it was Macromedia (after Aldous)

so are you telling us that you've NEVER been working in Photoshop for hours when it suddenly disappears from existence? and when you open it up again it acts like nothing happened?! of course you should remember the days when the software didn't even show a crash prompt. As a matter of fact I was working in Photoshop today, I switched to chrome to save an image and when I wanted to go back to Photoshop it was just GONE! I opened it up again and hope the "recovery" would bring back my file, but nope!

I don't know what you're on about, but the software has ALWAYS been buggy, is still buggy, and WILL remain buggy for a simple reason: they don't clean up old code. they just add more lines of code on top of existing ones because adding features and sales is their ONLY priority.
Part of Premiere's stability issues is it's ability to run on a very wide variety of hardware and its ability to work with a large number of video formats natively. A positive thing in most cases, but also dangerous.
Other editors like Avid MC made the environment more stable just by strictly controlling the requirements. Had to have specific hardware, had to transcode to their codecs, and so on.

I started editing on Premiere many years ago in its earlier form. Premiere wasn't taken seriously by the professional industry - it was FCP or Avid. Later a job required me to switch to Avid MC as that's what they were using in house. I struggled a bit learning a new way of working and adjusting to Avid's quirks.
Then Apple released FCPX and upended the industry. Soon Premiere became the thing. I held on to using Avid MC for as long as I could as I had become used to its speed and workflow. I would switch between the two when a project needed it. Eventually, everyone I was working with was working with Premiere. Work got enterprise licensing for CC so pretty much forced into using it.
Premiere still aggravates me. I don't usually have stability problems and crashing but just a lot of head scratching moments of why it does or doesn't do things. A lot of "why can't I just do this?" Lots and lots of little quirks.
I've used Davinci for many years. Primarily for color, but have used the editor as well for certain projects. It's fine but it also has its issues and quirks.
None of them are perfect. They all have their own issues.
Use whatever fits your budget, fits your needs, and fits the job.
I am actually a fan of the subscription model.

I once paid $1,200.00 for a Photoshop license. And that was useless after a few years due to OS and chip incompatibility, unless you want to give another $600.00 for the upgrade.

And that was for ONE piece of software.
That's funny...I was editing VR one minute without issue and then suddenly struggling in a completely normal project the next. Since switching to DaVinci -- none of that has happened with the same media. I hear this argument all the time and having to add five extra steps to the workflow is a pretty bad solution. No issues with DaVinci so far.
Bro said Aldus Freehand lol. Damn.....
Nailed it. Professionally been using PS since PS5. As a solo editor/developer that does a lot of different things, I like the subscription model at its current price. 

My biggest gripe about Adobe is that Lightroom is still an archaic app and they just hammered AI into it instead of actually developing the app.
I have been using for more than 20 years, image editing softwares, 3D editing softwares and 3D game engines. And I can tell you that software really crash, bad software crash a lot, even with clean powerful computer.  
Some versions of Photoshop and Premiere crashes, with bugs that are documented. Some versions of 3ds Max crashed by doing a combination of actions, or just using  "undo". Unreal Engine crash a lot! Nothing to do with mallware.
Yeah, business owners want DIY until they realize the smart money pay a professional to do the work like you’re supposed to and came up with much better results. They may have taken a loss upfront by paying an expert in the field of photography, videography or graphic design. always remember it takes money to make money.. Just because there’s AI out there doesn’t mean that art is like us are obsolete. There’s a reason why some people are artist but most not.
After effects users hard disagree lol
I use after effects for work, I go through about 8 crashes every single day (it's absolutely not my system) and 5% of the time I actually get a reason or error message for the crash. This is on top of other time losing bugs or quirks that will just introduce themselves randomly.

Sometimes the effects panel gets stuck to one specific comp. Sometimes playback will just turn black for no reason. Sometimes it won't playback more than 4 frames unless I close and re-open (clearing cache is not the solution, and I have 128gb ram) just to name a few.

It also lacks support for 32bit footage (industry standard) for basic and commonly used effects like grain or luma keying.

The only thing I can think of that AE does that another program can't do as well is Rotobrush (that I know of), and if I use that at full resolution I have a 70% chance of it crashing. Every day I just hope fusion becomes as versatile so I can switch to it already and cop the learning curve.
based
Valid point of view.
personally fcpx has disappointed me the least out of all of them, granted i have a soft spot for it since i’ve used it since high school
This is the way.
if davinci did that it prob had a good reason
Oh no. Looks like that other guy was right...DaVinci hate post incoming. 😉
Gotta be iMovie.
He said Davinci Resolve, not catturd2.
OP got a lot to learn about companies doing bad and what bad really means...
Technically correct, although completely irrelevant to the spirit and context of the post.
Not a fan of Acer either.
You should try calling Microsoft these days. Unbelievable.
162 billion dollars profit this year, and speaking to a human is like getting blood out of a stone.
Go post in r/water about nestle then. This post is about Adobe
Not much for nuance, huh? Also not that great of a comparison. 😂
Switched from FCP7 to Premiere probably a little over 10 years ago now. I don't really use other NLE's because my clients don't and alternatives would cause problems. 

I've made probably a million dollars on this software by now. It doesn't crash that often for me either. It's fine, I use it daily, it doesn't make me angry, and in context it's not really very expensive. Maybe It's an attitude thing?
Text based editing in premiere is currently years ahead of any other NLE and is saving me and my author so much time. And by that we are making double the money, no joke, because we work so fast, but the network still pays the same days as non text based editing would have caused. I can't be more thankful to Adobe tbh.
Yeah hard disagree with OP, as a Premiere user who has also been at it since high school. Resolve doesn't compete with the package of Premiere and After Effects.
Nothing will make me use adobe software as long as they have their predatory subscription model. Which they have increased by about 20% recently btw.
Well if 19 goes as good as 18 went then it won't be long. Or when they realize Blackmagic also doesn't care about what people have been asking to be added or fixed for the last 7 years.
If something better comes along then why not. This is stupid logic.
Never. I didn't like AVID's workflow because I was already used to Premiere (but at least it was stable). Premiere was first, AVID was a necessary evil in my industry and then Premiere slowly got worse. Any more stupid questions?

Edit: Shouldn't have said never. If they mess Resolve up -- I'll happily criticize it.
I won't shill for any software (except REAPER because it's just so great). Not saying that's what you were doing, BTW.  To each their own! I would have preferred to stay with what I cut my teeth on but had to make a change. Use whatever works for you.
You're Premiere agnostic and you don't recommend beginners use Premiere Pro Rush? Why?   

>but if you want to work at a professional level I don't see it ever competing.

I think unless you're in every post house at all times this is lofty speculation, I've had a decent amount of broadcast work where I was asked to cut in Resolve, some of those projects have won awards; but the thing is all of them ended up being purchased by actual broadcasters and had decent budgets. So, it's competing in my eyes and I usually have a great time editing in Resolve.
I feel this comment on a deep level. With you my friend
The current version of 24 is borderline not usable
The latest release is legit. Lots of features added and other features tightened up.
Oh and also, now they're basically given themselves licensing rights over your content and the permission use your PRIVATE content it to train their AI. Absolutely ludicrous. I say we pick a day, ban together and all cancel our subscriptions on that same day!
It's so bad. It's caused me so much unnecessary stress. I feel your pain.
Wouldn't know. Realized I wasn't even following this sub after I posted this.
I hope so. I can't stand what they've done (and haven't done) to software I used to love.
$300 for lifetime updates is hard to beat!
Not trying to convince you to leave something that works but if you ever need to leave -- I was in the same boat. I actually synched some Media Composer shortcuts with my Premiere and Reaper key shortcuts so it wouldn't be as confusing. Can easily port the same workflow into Resolve and make it what you want.
Oh it's already happening 😂
That's a great point that I feel deeply. Using DaVinci feels like the beginning of a great endeavor that is (so far) very promising. Premiere feels like a rut I can't get out of.
Go into Creative Cloud into Manage Fonts (or whatever they call the stupid thing they decided was better than just installing the font like every other font). That's definitely the issue.
Mac vs PC seems to be a big part of this equation after reading all these posts.
I agree with all of this. I'm sure I will run into issues with Resolve. It has just alleviated so many frustrations at once that it seems like it's heaven-sent. What's going on with you and the Creative Cloud app?
This is right.
😂
Yes -- key frames and everything are present. My favorite feature i didn't know I wanted is that everything from Effect Controls is called Inspector in Resolve but also includes Stabilization and many other settings in one panel. It is NOTHING like switching to AVID. I went from Premiere to AVID and it was really rough but I eventually figured it out. I got used to DaVinci within a day.
95% of Studio features (and maybe 100% that are relevant for you) are found in the Free version so no risk in trying it out!
Another old schooler agrees with you.
It rules.
This is essentially how it feels to me. Unoptimized sludge. You'll get super used to Resolve and quickly.

Edit: Also, no one really goes into how bad the Creative Cloud app is. If it needs an update, everything breaks in nonsensical ways. The ten processes it needs to run is also asinine. Why I ever accepted it is beyond me.
Appreciate the thoughtful response! I will look more into FCX even though I probably won't switch. I have an Android but zero allegiance to Google; Windows but zero allegiance to Microsoft, nothing from Apple but the same attitude. I don't think it's smart to pledge allegiance to any of these companies with the exception of the REAPER team because they ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEIR CUSTOMERS and collaborate with them. A little aside -- one of the REAPER devs once fixed a Pro Tools bug and sent Avid the fix. They voided his warranty. 😬
Thanks for posting this info and the link. This guy’s explanation on FCPX is very helpful. Thanks!
Thanks! Gonna need this soon.
Same thing with Media Composer and Pro Tools at one point. Didn't make them better.
iZotope RX does and works as a plugin in several NLE.
*Nonsensically Variable Export Times

And I swear to f*** -- if one person mentions rendering from previews...I know!!!
Hyperbole due to frustration*
Rarely had to use AE so can't speak to that. 🤷
This is summed up perfectly using the example of syncing audio in Premiere. On the Adobe website you can still find the original instructions on how to sync audio (using ‘merge clips’) from about 10/15 years ago. This method was slow and became infamous for causing all sorts of issues, so users found workarounds by using the multicam workflow to sync audio.

To this day, that shonky workaround with all of its flaws and compromises has become the recommended practice by Adobe. It blows my fucking mind that they haven’t just fixed and improved on the original, much neater, much better (in theory) way of doing it.

Compare that to Resolve (and Avid) where audio syncing by timecode is both instantaneous and flexible. Above all else it’s the reason I switched to Resolve.
You've got that right, but probably not in the way you're suggesting.  I had an unrivalled experience in Premiere once - I think it's the only time i've openly wept at work.
You'll only get flack if you leave the details of why at that incredibly vague endorsement.
Yes I've tried all the things. Tired of hunting for the next one.
🤘
I'm on Windows so I can't speak at all to what it's like on Mac. I know all the workarounds and dealing with cache. I was having to do it waaaay too often.
Fair enough! Just speaking to my own experience.
1000%
I'm genuinely happy for you. Not the case with me anymore.
Well I know it isn't but you're entitled to your opinion.
Awe shucks. Whatever shall I do.
😂😂😂 LOL to the REAPER comment. Go tell that to the entire video game industry.
Funny because I wasn't even talking about subscriptions you stupid bot.
> Talk about not knowing your audience.

Oh they know the audience, and it isnt you. Its actually replacing you- its the business owners who want to DIY their own content/media with automagical ai tools and dont want to hire people anymore

This audience blindly pays 29/month for adobe cc (usually part of their amex benefits) and is responsible for adobe's stock performance
Sadly it's about targeting a new audience
Imagine if they removed the toolbar and all menu items and just had an AI button?  I wouldn't be surprised
They want all the fun parts taken out. 🤷
yeah, every time I see a Premiere is unstable post my head automatically goes to a timeline filled with 4k mp4s from a drone. or Iphone VFR footage......
That happened occasionally to coworkers. It (almost) never happened to me. I purposefully run a VERY stable and clean system. 

I am not saying Adobe makes crash-proof apps. I am saying they have been no more or less stable than other apps in my experience.
Not going to hear me argue with this!
I'd say that the requirement to support a variety of hardware is a failing of the PC industry, not Adobe. Yes, I realize that I sound like an Adobe apologist. I assure you, I am not. I am just trying to make a point. 

When you require that software run smoothly on an unpredictable and constantly varying hardware mish-mash - well - it's just asking for trouble. (I won't go into detail about now crappy I think the Windows environment is). And most software companies (Adobe included) have performed admirably in the face of such adversity. I cannot imagine how daunting the task must be to "support" so many configurations.

That's not to say that PCs are bad. I get that the variety of options is exactly what makes the PC industry so amazing and powerful. But it is also inherently unstable. 

No judgement. Not trying to be judgy here...

That's why I moved to Macs. One platform, one OS, one interface, and no danger of a gazillion drivers/RAM types/motherboards/BIOS configurations/peripherals. It just works (well, it works 99.99% of the time). Sure, I can't swap my RAM, but I bought an M1 Macbook Pro with 64GB RAM and it outperforms my Core i9 128GB RAM Widows 10 box (3080) in every workflow except 3D. One OS, one interface, and almost completely no crashes or instability. 

There's something to be said for system stability. 

A lot of replies to my above comment lashed out at me saying that Adobe apps are unstable. I would argue my original point; they are as stable as any other package. It's the computer they are running on that makes the system unstable. It is far more likely that the system is causing the crashes, not one specific software package (that is on its 120th iteration from a large commercial vendor like Adobe who may not have a super quick bug-response time, but addresses stability issues because it affects their bottom line). 

I used Avid Media Composer when I worked at Intel (for a decade). We had a dedicated machine for it that was air-gapped from the network (because corporate or Windows updates would break Avid). It was powerful, but I found it to be awkward and way too much work. I never liked the interface and found it difficult to adopt. We had to sneaker-net (carry) assets from the graphics team on CDs/DVDs to the editing machine to add them to a timeline. It was miserable. But it was "Pro". 

I was the first to pioneer the use of FCP7 when it was released. I LOVED IT!!! Not just the cleanliness of the MacOS, but the ease of use, responsive updates, stability, and the fact that we could safely have Adobe's Creative Suite (CS2? CS3?) on the machine simultaneously. It sped up workflow and was a HUGE gain for the department - and for pennies on the dollar compared to our AVID contract. 

I'll never look back.
That's much better than DaVinci's price tag of $300 and lifetime free upgrades.
i may need to edit a project with 6k vr.. you'd recommend DaVinci? Does it have good corrected overlay support etc?
Well unfortunately that's the one I've least seen actually being used on real, well-paying gigs so I've never used it. I was a full-time FCP7 user back almost 15 years ago but we all know how that ended.
Ask any **Sonos** owner what a bad company is.

And I say 'owner' versus 'user' as too often they are not the same.
Every time someone shit talks Adobe there's people like "Welll aschkuallllllly..." in every thread, which makes me think Adobe spends more time botting comment threads saying their product sucks shit, (something that you can search for and find hundreds of this same kinda post in a million subreddits), than improving their crumbling terrible program infrastructure
The best kind of correct.
I thought this post was about the worst company ever. Its even in the title.
I mean you *did* say "worst company ever" not "worst editing software company ever"...
Nuance? You said "Worst. Company. Ever."
An editor …with an attitude ‽
Yeah we've been heavily using that feature
Resolve has it too, but I tend not to trust it. How is eith premiere? Does it allow a multicam sequence with that?
I don't really need After Effects so I can't speak to that part.
Five fusion a try. It’s not there yet, undoubtedly, but for the most part, for the social network edit or small doc, it’s there. And with the power bin I din’t even need to do some fancy preser for other people, I just send them a project eith all the asset
Resolve and after effects compete big time premiere and after effects tho
OK but for that fee, £50, I can make 8 grand a month?
To be fair 18.5 was an incredible stable version to me. Just upgraded to 19, let’s hope..
The entire post seems pretty shilly. Use what works. And it’s genuine, I do not know these “issues” and haven’t ran into them through multiple post houses. Just interested in what and why.
There's always a buncha shills whenever this post about Adobe is made, search any subreddit that uses Adobe and you'll find identical descriptions as yours as to why adobe sucks highly upvoted and then a comment thread full of dorks like "well i think theyre a flawless company and ive never even experienced a single crash and Ive been editing videos since before Adobe existed, Adobe made me the man I am and I owe them my life"
1) premieres great, rush isn’t
2) premiere costs money, davinci doesn’t

That’s why I recommend it to students beginners starting out, no financial barrier and it’s better than premieres own “light” version. But once they graduate or start looking to freelance, I generally suggest premiere and/or avid.

Davinci’s obviously used plenty for color, and I’m sure there are exceptions to the rule (eg I know one boutique post house that uses FCPX for their unscripted work),  but no overall the number of houses currently using avid or premiere still vastly outweighs it in LA, and I’ve yet to see any signs of that changing considerably. At the studio level nobody even wants to touch it. I had to help a friends indie film do audio turnovers from their davinci edit and it was a horrendous experience. More power to anyone using it though, you should know all three.
who cares about what you like and what you don't like.  You want to make a living in this industry ? You learn AVID Media Composer, you learn Adobe Premiere, you learn Davinci Resolve.   Bugs, issues, things don't work - WHO CARES - this is what you have to deal with - and what we have had to deal with since day one of AVID (and every other damn software program, including FCP, FCP X, CapCut, Vegas, and everything else).  There will ALWAYS be problems, there will always be bugs.  You don't think that Resolve has problems with Blackmagic Cloud RIGHT NOW ?  You don't think that Blackmagic has problems with Cloud Store RIGHT NOW ?    You love Resolve, right ?  Why are you not on the [forum.blackmagicdesign.com](http://forum.blackmagicdesign.com) user forums for Resolve, and Post Production ?  

Everyone is a big shot - all these programs have problems. That is what updates are for.  When will things "just work "   ?     NEVER. 

Bob
I hope I'll never ever have to touch the "Exposure" or any other slider in that software again. Deeply disappointed and I used to love after effects but I can't earn money with this software anymore, so it has to go. In the end I'll be using the software that gets the job done the best.
Exactly!
Yeah I’m actually using Resolve for any projects that doesn’t need special effects or quick turnaround
Just because Premiere users (and some veteran users at that) are explaining that they themselves have no issues, and that most issues with Premiere are the result of user error, that makes them smug Adobe verified accounts? I don't understand the logic here...
I'm still in mild shock over the M2 Studio. I had a complex AE scene that took 57 minutes to render on an Intel Mac Pro (cylinder, not the latest one) - 7 minutes on the studio. My Studio, NVME RAID and NVME scratch disc was all about $3k (and I got like $500 for my old Mac and RAID). I've never had such a freakishly crazy upgrade, and my first Mac was a Plus, around 1990. I just never have crashes or freezes. My wife can't seem to access the printer through her laptop, only issue I'm still having.
Photoshop just stopped out of nowhere. Regular & beta. Something to do with the current + premiere beta install.

Then it took 10 days to actually get it working (some 6 service calls, then two appointments blown off by Adobe.) 

Creative cloud: I still have the “if I go from wired to wireless” aka switch networks, it takes a reboot to get the “App page” to work. The rest of the pages fine. But any network switch seems to prevent the app page from loading. Means a reboot as I need to check beta compatibility and new features.

And I could totally lean into a clients enterprise support - and I have some deep contacts inside of adobe itself. But nope, I’m going to wait until they actually behave. What I’m sad about is that I stopped documenting tech support calls (across the board) - because…well, again, alll these companies suck.
That's great and makes me excited to know, gonna check it out. And prepping for online like EDL's and XML's / OMF's prob also easy?
Lol Sort of a "no good deed goes unpunished situation" for that Reaper dev. Agreed on staying platform agnostic: Whatever the best tool for the job is, that's the way to go.
Adobe currently dominates the market for collaborative editing teams, and I believe it will take a long time for the post-production industry to transition to a different platform.  
  
Many video editor job postings I see are for social content, which  it seems like they could shift away from Premiere sooner. However, the social editing teams likely stick with Adobe due to the dynamic link with After Effects
Yeah I figured I’d need to get that or SpectraLayers… It’s just really impressive what comes stock in Audition though.
I hate admitting this but I've done that too. Literally wept. It makes finishing projects NEVER feel like an accomplishment.
Well kudos for at least doing all the right troubleshooting steps! That makes me wonder how unoptimized Premiere still is for Windows. Clearly it's more difficult to optimize for Windows because of the all differences in hardware and software, but I suppose the hardware/software parity on Mac gives it a big advantage in terms of performance.  
  
On a side note, how long have you been rocking Resolve?
Ah so you woke up and decided "I wish to be an asshole to strangers on the internet today"
fastest report to reddit I have done in a while. lets keep it civil. you have an experience and want to be heard. the least one can do in that situation is to hear others;

I love my experience with Adobe. it has made my editing 1000x better.
been diying all my own content including original background music before ai came around, feels like a bit of a smack in the face but at least I know my shit has much more of a human aspect than current ai could create
This is the case I think
Yep.
Yep. I naively went to adobe max a few years ago and they kept revealing all these AI tools only for the audience to react with huge applause. I was looking around thinking someone in the crowd would be horrified knowing our very jobs were at risk, but nope.
Where is CC $29 a month?! 
Our suite is like $100/user
AI bros will throw money at stupid stuff so maybe it's worked out for them.
exactly, especially with heavily compressed .mp4's
But davinci can handle all that, which makes it better
Oh you youngsters don’t know the struggle of editing with premiere back in the 2000’s, even before iPhone or 4K footage was a thing, and getting “unknown exception has occurred” crashes for no good reason, and losing all your work, repeatedly.
So you're blaming the problems that cause Adobe crash on third party applications?! Lol

Basically what you're saying is in order to have a good experience with Adobe, you must use a dedicated "clean" system that only runs Adobe software on it and nothing else.
Yes. It's also just one tool. It is a great deal, but when you compare it to other software, like Cinema 4D, it's really not too bad.
Blackmagic is a hardware company.
No I'm sorry for the confusion -- I was doing it in Premiere years ago. Just was pointing out what it used to be able to handle. Have no experience with VR in Resolve.
FCP7 was goated!
ain’t that the truth. i use it when i need to throw something together quickly but yeah it’s a shame the professional world sticks with adobe and avid
the Sonos debacle... Now THAT is fucked up.
I often think these kind of posts are astroturfing guerilla PR stuff by BMD. Its what I'd do anyway.
True. Okay, yes -- Blackrock is much worse than Adobe. I guess I really have to spell things out...
I mean... This sub is called "editing". And by all means -- keep pretending to not understand that statements like that are pure emotion and not literal. Oh yes...I definitely think Adobe is worse than Raytheon.
Nuance Communications got bought by Microsoft
You’re fun at parties
You would think a hundred bad decisions had already been made in front of them leading to constant stress and overwork...
Yes. We have found a workflow that's perfect for long interviews. Create static transcripts within your multicam sequences. Edit with them on your sequence -> success, you have a dynamic transcript on your sequence.

Trust? Well, you still have ears and your normal tools to fine edit. For a raw edit it works perfectly.
It’s not about that. I got the money of course. It’s about continuously paying money for something that should be a one-time purchase.
I'm sure there are many people who don't experience issues. I'm not discounting that and was just agreeing with you. I really don't feel like listing ways Premiere has glitched out because it's been my whole life as of recent. Do a search. You'll be able to do lots of research.
It was more a cathartic exercise for me because Adobe managed to mess up something even after quitting all their software. That's all.
>but no overall the number of houses currently using avid or premiere still vastly outweighs it

Agree, this isn't a very substantial idea to arrive at though, that's like, bleedingly obvious.

> At the studio level nobody even wants to touch it.

Are you in contact with all the studios everywhere to confirm this exactly? This is kind of bubble/regional-speak and while I appreciate you're in a big production hub where Avid and Premiere are used almost exclusively, and I do agree to agree in the obvious sense, I still see resolve being a factor in the future.

Ive had many more horrendous turnovers in Premiere than I have Resolve. Let me preface all of this by saying there are things that really irk me about all big-3 NLE's, Im not fan-boying anything here and purely commenting off of experience.
Bob, I'm old enough to have seen your get off my lawn nonsense on creative cow for 20+ years. Give it a rest. 

"Who cares what you like"? 

Obviously this guy does, and I do too. 

Did you learn every software in the industry? No of course not. You picked which ones you LIKED. Getting all high and mighty over product choice and valid complaints?

If I recall you're in the business of setting up people with the tools to do the work, do you not have preferences on networking products? 

No, that would be INSANE to have a preference like using qnap nas. And which cards do you recommend? 

Obviously not one that you're comfortable with that has reliability! That would be beyond the pale!

We used to get physical disks to install MC, fcp, and after effects.  You really think this new nonsense about constant updates breaking everything is just the way it always was? 

I'm pretty sure avid and apple used to actually troubleshoot their software before going gold and selling piles of physical media. 

Someone getting fed up with a company that has more staff working on stock buybacks than for product development on something like ae is nothing to bark at. 

Cloud services charging us monthly forever, holding our work hostage, and I still can't type out text in after effects without it missing some keystrokes. Since ae 5.5.

But hey at least I can use trash ai generator in Photoshop.

Having watched you all over the net for decades tear into anyone with an opinion is just ridiculous. You think you're the only one who "knows how shit works".  

Its actually wild to see you still online, jumping down people's throats after all this time.

grow up already.
Also -- why would I be on Blackmagic forums trying to convince Resolve users to switch to Resolve? You're a dolt, sir.
Hahahaha wow dude.
I'm going to say "yes" because it will annoy you and -- as your not-so-veiled insult revealed -- you are one of the smug ones.
I'm going to say "yes" because it will annoy you and -- as your not-so-veiled insult revealed -- you are one of the smug ones.
💯
You also hit on something I rediscovered with Resolve -- having FUN editing again. Glad you are too!
Only a month. 😂 It got real bad with Premiere.
How so??? You just made a blanket statement about software you clearly don't know much about. It's used professionally everywhere. I didn't say you shouldn't use Premiere. I'm talking about my own frustrations.
I literally thought you were a bot. Still kind of do.
That's why it will ultimately fail. AI is just the corporate mindset perfected into an algorithm of s***.
same here, at this rate i might just pick up coding and diy my own editor
Same business model as canva. they removed the complexity and learning curve of AI/PS and dumbed it down into a web app that any small business owner or marketing dept can use to make content instantly. No more hiring graphic designers or video editors for hundreds of dollars a day/hour, or dealing with agencies, hiring a creative director, etc. Just drag and drop your logo, a picture, snap the text, and post it on instagram

media industry is cooked✌🏼 highly recommend you get into prestige narrative/arthouse stuff or go find a local government job. those are the only two places that AI and tech companies wont touch, because theyre philosophically incompatible
I fully agree. These days I use the full Adobe suite 2024 running on a 2022 Mac Studio for 8-10 hours a day 5-6 days a week, but I've been using it in general since about 2005. I get a crash maybe every couple months and I never lose more than 10 minutes of work because of auto-save. Anytime I've ever worked with another editor who complains about crashes they are loaded with malware or have a ton of 3rd party plugins installed. It's almost always the plugins that Adobe has nothing to do with then people complain that Adobe sucks. They definitely have their faults but stability isn't one of them.
This. I throw everything at Davinci and it never has an issue. I hate the idea of crashes and jumping through hoops when DR just removes that.
I do, that's why we all used FCP or Avid. It was only "Premiere" back then too
I was doing this, by the way. 😂 That's the sad part. I was reduced to that incredibly inconvenient requirement.

Edit: It was BorisFX by the way. Just heading off the people that will think I'm downloading plugins off Kazaa.
So bonus points?
...and?
Just for the UI silver color alone
I guess people wanna pretend they don’t understand hyperbole so they can feel superior/more intelligent on the internet
That's what they tell me.
I agree and think it's a very slippery modern technique to sneakily grab cash off people. Everything is subscription. It's a bigger debate why this has happened. Apple for example are making money from hardware, so FCP can be a one off price. But Apple hardware is often purchased through loans (not many people buy iphones outright). Adobe doesn't have that as its pure software. 

It's basically tool hire. A carpenter can also hire tools and on shoots we hire lenses and camera. 

It also let's semi pros try the game without paying eg £999 up front (FCP 7 cost). The reason Resolve is "free" is they are trying to undercut the competition (and its sort of working). Capcut used to be free but now they stripped nearly ALL the features out of the free version and you must pay £9.99 pm
Nahh. It’s only interesting when someone is on here complaining.
If it’s ’bleedingly obvious’ why are you debating me when that’s the primary point I was making in my initial comment? It’s not a competition, and they aren’t making serious moves into the professional space which is currently dominated by premiere and avid. And fwiw I actually do know either post sups or editors/AEs at all the major studios in LA, so, yes, I can confirm none of them are using or interested in transitioning to davinci. Frankly even going from avid to premiere is an uphill climb most of these places, WB animation only recently doubled down on Adobe.
Adds a lot of credibility to your op, really... Good for you mate *pat on back*
wife often blames me to be a bot. but mostly in bed.
More like AI is setting the standard for mediocre. Much like comparing a factory made food in the supermarket to a 3 star Michelin chef's dish.
I wouldn't necessarily say so. It has its use cases but I don't think it's very good or at least as workable as Illustrator. But for pumping out invites for the company Christmas dinner? Yeah it should be free and take 30 seconds to make.
Then you know Premiere was unstable even in normal workflows...?

It only improved within the last few years, I think when Apple Silicon forced them to rework core components.
Even so I doubt it helped with the frequent crashes. Back in the day my company had dedicated editing workstations that weren't even allowed to connect to the internet but still behaved poorly
Software sales is not Blackmagic's business model so comparing pricing models between the software that Blackmagic basically gives away for free to sell hardware to other software that has to be sold as a revenue stream to keep the business running is not an apples to apples comparison.

I pay about $600/year to Adobe to have access to 4 core tools that I use to make money. I have a lot of complaints about Adobe,  but their current pricing model isn't one of them.
Fair enough
I'm trying to have a *healthy* debate with you mainly because you said this

>if you want to work at a professional level I don't see it ever competing.

Lets define "professional level", in my world, if you pay taxes on your work, boom, you're professional.

Are you loosley insinuating that anything that isnt coming out of LA or isn't theatrical / commercial work with big brand clients / studios isn't professional? Because that's just wild.
That didn't even make sense 😂 Why am I conversing with a bot? Premiere has wasted enough of my time.
All the better for the great editors to stand out and charge a premium price for a premium product.
Of course not, but You keep questioning my credentials, so I keep reiterating I’m a studio editor, so that’s the experience I’m speaking to. As I am not an omniscient all-seeing superbeing capable of having presence at every table with a computer within the known & unknown universe (happy?), I can only speak to what me and my colleagues are seeing in post houses, networking events and post conventions within my immediate area which fwiw happens to be the post production capitol of the world. And my argument is when it comes broadcast, theatrical & commercial industries, yes I don’t see it ever being a dominant player in this space. There’s plenty of ways, locations and fields to make a living as an editor and be a working professional, I certainly have, and I think davinci is fine for freelance and short for work despite again still not being a relevant majority in this field either. But it’s simply not designed for long form projects, and their company is not making serious moves in these spaces to be otherwise. I’m going back to work now
I mean...the people/corpo that support AI art are the same people who don't want to pay creative for what they worth or lowball them.
I'm not questioning your credentials at all Andy, I've checked your website out. Nice work. Im taking you to task about claiming you cant work in resolve at a professional level, because its just not true. 

I don't see this continuing on in a positive fashion as you're downvoting every one of my replies and it seems to be getting a little emotional. Take it easy!
You keep asking who I know/how I know, and I told you. I have never said you "can't" work in resolve at a professional level., I'm saying the industry at large isn't going there and nothing I've seen is proving me otherwise, including all of your comments - none of which speak to an experience outside your own either fwiw?

Go with god, work in whatever you want! Like I said 12 comments ago you should know all three. But if you want the big-jobs, it's premiere/avid full-stop. Prove me wrong, kids. I only downvoted your initial comment I didnt touch anything else, but it looks like some of mine were downvoted to? I frankly don't care. Get back to work!
Are you editing your comments because you want to continue on the conversation, or?
I'm an editor, not a motion graphics artist.
This is something I have to explain to clients time and again. I'm an editor, not a motion graphics artist. Those are two different disciplines.

Yes - there are absolutely folks that can do both, just like there are folks that can play piano AND guitar. Yes - I could learn, I choose not to. I don't like motion graphics. I don't want to keyframe my life away. Yes - I have lost, and will continue to lose jobs, because I'm not a motion graphics artist. That's ok. I'm not an electrician either. 

I prefer story. I prefer mining great performances, creating emotional ups and downs, and restructuring scenes to find the best and most efficient way to generate some kind of emotional arc for the audience. I prefer clarity of story, continuity of shots, and concise scenes. I've spent my career focused on these elements, which is why from time to time I'm chosen to lead a team of editors, or sometimes I even get to be creative director/story producer. For me, story is  priority. Motion graphics aren't.  


So yes, dear client, I can absolutely cut your social campaign. But editing and motion graphics are two different things. And if you're disappointed, may I refer you to the 1/5 stars on my resume for "After Effects". 
When the average listing for "editing" positions also require you to shoot and produce for $25/hour
Despite being the producer, I do both. When I say I do both, they want me to shoot drone video, own the drone, and then build their website too. It never ends.
Don't forget clients expecting you to be a graphic designer and sound designer too.
Dammit Jim, I'm an editor, not an animator!
This sounds like an affirmation one says in a mirror.
Sign up for a month of Motion Array, tack the fee onto the invoice and boom you're one of the best motion graphic designers in the world!
I don’t know if straight up editing jobs exist anymore. I just got hired as a shooter, editor/line producer.  I resisted for a long, LONG time but frankly -  I don’t know what else to do!
"Yes - there are absolutely folks that can do both, just like there are folks that can play piano AND guitar. Yes - I could learn, I choose not to"

I play piano. At age 58 I learned how to play guitar.  I was a video engineer - I made cables, wired patch bays, switchers, routers. I learned CMX, Sony 9000, ISC, Grass Valley, Calaway.

And then the world changed. I learned EMC, AVID, FCP, Adobe Premiere, Davinci Resolve.

I learned about PostgreSQL databases.  I learned Apple Servers.  AVID Unity, AVID ISIS, AVID Nexis, EditShare, Facilis, Studio Network Solutions.  I learned 10G networking with Netgear.  Now I do QNAP and Synology  NAS systems and Ubiquiti networking.

I like staying employed. I like eating in nice restaurants.  And I like playing guitar.   NEVER STOP LEARNING.  In my first job in video at EUE Screen Gems in 1978, they had all these old guys that knew Ampex QUAD 2" VTR's, and when they Chryon and Vidifont got delivered, they all said "send that new kid for training, we don't want to do it".   That was me - I was the kid.  I knew nothing.  And I said to myself then "I WILL NEVER BE LIKE THOSE GUYS".

Bob

ps - I also build edit furniture, and I also throw out all the garbage boxes.
This might be unpopular here, but as technology advances you'll be expected to do everything; each individual thing is getting easier to do. "Editing" isn't a skill that can sustain itself alone, **outside** of film/tv.

Knowing the basics of coloring, editing, motion graphics, 3d, and even shooting, could be essential for our own survival down the line. That's not mentioning honing the post producer and pre-pro roles, which catapult the value of a simple "editor."

The one place I draw the line is graphic design, which I am simply not skilled enough at to create anything worthwhile.
Explaining this to a room of *connected* stiffs gets really old.
At least we don't get asked to design DVD covers anymore.
Are you staff? Or freelance?

In the past i would have agreed wholeheartedly. I've spent 15 years dead set on being a narrative editor (which is what I call it to differentiate it from general editing). But, i was forced to open up my services in 2020 due to the dumpster fire that is the market, and i've changed my mind about this.

My take: you are right, but clients dont really care how you define "editing", they just want to be done with this video. Im there to help them get there. I dont do color, sound, graphics, design or VFX, but I understand the process, way better than my EP at least. And i've interacted with the people who do do those things. I could probably brief them on the project better than anyone... *I know enough to be helpful.*

My current answer for when a client starts asking for stuff that wasnt agreed upon is: sure, lets talk. It will probably take more time and/or more money. It might involve calling someone else with specific expertise. Im happy to recommend someone from my own network, help negotiate a price, do some coordinating and supervising - *for a price.*

If its not something big/specific enough to call an expert (meaning im doing it myself), its coming out of our agreed upon timeframe. That means less time editing, more time doing whatever it is they need. If that requires more time than we agreed upon, then lets negotiate what that extra fee is going to be.

I do this only with stuff im comfortable in. Basically just postproduction. If a client needs me to so much as look at a camera, im outta there.
I have never seen a job listing that requests you do both jobs that paid as much as the jobs I take for just editing. These people are not people you would want to work for anyway.
I do both because I get more work and get paid more. If you choose to just cut pictures then that’s cool too, but you’ll have less work and get paid less. This is the reality of post production in 2024
I've used after effects for over 20 years and I probably only know 20% of the functions.  For the type of editing I do, this is more than enough.

After Effects is such a vast program that can handle so much, that anyone who says they use the program 100% has me raise an eyebrow.   Not saying they aren't good at what they do, but different people have different specialities.
It's 2024, the days of compartmentalizing editorial and *light* motion graphics duty are firmly in the rear-view. Story is obviously important, but we live in a new world where style is at least as important as substance. If you have 1/5 stars for AE on your resume, might be time to bone up on AE.
I'm pretty sure the only reason I am not homeless is because I can and will do literally ANYTHING in this space for a client. It's great and also really frustrating at times. It feels a bit unbalanced.
I do both. I rarely ever get paid for doing both, just one or the other.
Weirdly, as a motion graphics artist, I can't seem to get work unless I'm willing to edit as well...

Let's team up. Charge more and outsource! Aces in their places
I'm fully aware of the problem the OP and others have outlined but I just want to play devil's advocate for a moment. 

Now be completely honest, how many of us here have tried to consistently educate these people? 

I'm not trying to be condescending but I've been involved in many conversations like this over the years and had many rants myself, but now I'm questioning whether rather than us grumbling between ourselves, if collectively a concerted effort was made to always educate, who knows maybe there would have been a slight shift in expectations. 

I also think this is where our industry suffers from not having any formalised set of required qualifications. Whilst making it open to all, it also leaves the expected valuation bar thoroughly all over the place, especially from an outsiders perspective. 

Whilst my marginally OCD brain would love for there to be an official well designed little handbook that neatly outlines every job role which I could reference every time a situation like this occurs, here's a simpler approach. 

Get two videos: 

Video A to showcase fantastic editing & video B to showcase stellar motion graphics. 

Ask the person which they want.
 - If A, you're the person for the job.
 - If B, explain you're not the person for the job. 
 - If both, explain that they need to hire an additional person. 

If it all falls on deaf ears, fair enough but at least the education was attempted.
Basic motion graphics to impress clients ain't that hard. Probably causing yourself more stress by not spending a few days getting it down
Day 1: "I SWEAR we don't need ahy motion graphics."

Day 14: "This is great, but can we make the whole thing look like it's flying across the room?"
I support your rebellion
Yeah, that’s why I can’t find a remote job. I work as a film editor (mostly feature films) and this job has to be done with a director in person. I would love to quit film editing and start making some YouTube videos or commercials if I could make it remotely. But every time I look for a job on internet it is usually said in the description that they need an editor who can also make motion graphics (sometimes even 3D), color correction, sound design etc and I’m, like, wow, so you need a team, not just one person, right? And funny thing is that these jobs are always paid less than I make now.
Templates satisfy 9/10 of my clients.  The 10% that need something custom I just sub it out and bake it into the hours/cost.  Having a few After Effects wizards in your Rolodex is the way.
If you are dealing with clients that want motion graphics work you need to partner with a motion graphics artist and mark up their work to your clients, problem solved and you make a few bucks!
Don't know what to tell ya bud, you're not gonna have clients for much longer if you keep that attitude up. 

Unless you're doing purely narrative work that kind of separation is more and more a thing of the past.

It's ok to know your specialty and pick a lane, but refusing outright is closing most of the doors available and this industry is moving faster than ever.
As a graphic designer I can relate.  
  
I went from a computer graphic designer to a graphic designer/web designer/photographer/videographer/editor and I'm still getting pressured for being "not quick enough".
I'm a long-form documentary producer/editor/shooter. The way I present myself to clients is if I don't know how to do something, I know people that do and will work with them for the desired result. The customer doesn't need to know who's doing what. Just tell them if they want graphic arts and animation in a video, it will cost them accordingly, and then go out and freelance the person yourself. Same with shooting. I'm pretty good at shooting interviews and b-roll, but if I have to shoot hockey or football, I might hire a sports cameraman.  Same with drone operators. Businesses hire free-lancers all the time. Just make sure you add the cost of the freelancer to your invoice.
I upvoted this with such resolute that I’ve almost broke my phone screen
I get what you are saying, but I know in the city I am in that motion graphics expertise will either make or break you from getting a job. Yes, we all love making stories and we all prefer that, but in order to make a living here I will need to spend hours making something in AE. It sucks, but it's better than working at the agency I was at making a story edit for some horrible people.  There are some people that are just straight editors here but it seems like their work is few and far between and the constant struggle weighs on them. Best of luck and I hope you build that career without motion work!
I wish we all so overemplyed such that we could laugh it off… as a VFX guy, I get it as well.
With the explosion of content and overseas edit farms the expectations are high and rates are a race to the bottom.
This!!! Came across a new client once who wanted a 30 min explainer video. Sure, fine. I used their previous videos as a reference, and saw they utilized stock footage, some text here and there, and so that’s what I did. After I sent over V1 for notes, they said to scrap all the edits, and sent a link to a 1 minute YouTube short with heavy mographs and typography and told me to replicate that style for the entire 30 minutes. All for $250? I’ve never dropped a project so fast.
I say I can do it to “get in the room” and try to get the client to specify what they need motion graphics wise. Sometimes that “we need an all-star motion fx person with rockstar skills” just meant “we want lower thirds that fade in and out and our logo at the end”
You should see what’s happened to news editing. Now it’s all about MMJ’s who can produce, write, shoot, edit and present  news stories.
Motion graphics person here- would love to collab and jump in on those projects with you if the clients have the desire and budget :)
It's a silly focus too, because most graphic artists they end up hiring just rework off-the-shelf templates and bullshit their way past a boss who isn't familiar with Adobe stock.
Presets and templates are my best friend for any sort of motion graphic I need to use lol
I HATE seeing this on job postings. And they’re always paying GARBAGE. Like those are two very different skill sets. I’ll make temp placeholders but you need to hire a GFX person. Who gets paid to do that.
I’m the opposite. I’m a VFX artist and constantly have to tell people that I’m not an editor.
It's always been a choice between being very good at one thing but not know anything else, or being just okay in a lot of other stuff. I started out as a colorist, moved to online editing, then VFX compositing, then motion graphics and some basic 3D. I eventually gave up on CG stuff coz I didn't have to patience to model or animate 3d objects. My motion graphics skills are passable but I would use templates when necessary. But my bread and butter is editing and with those extra skills, I am able to stand out from the majority who only know editing. So should you learn motion graphics? Not really if you don't want to but having some knowledge of it helps your editing capabilities. I used to hate photoshop but forced myself to learn it since some jobs require retouching. I got pretty good eventually but it took time. So gradually learn motion graphics even if only the basic stuff. It'll pay off eventually.
I'm with you bro, I can't agree more on this.
Motion designers also have to be social media experts, keeping up with the latest trends, know all the social media platforms, be a graphic designer for print, know marketing, know cinema 4D, be an expert in premiere. I'm sure I'm missing 4 other entirely different careers that are usually in the job listings. 
This. I'm a cinematographer. Or a videographer if we're stretching.

I'm not an editor, although I'll do that if I must. Color and sound design, sure, that's not the worst thing in the world either. I can even do concepting that goes beyond the visual aspects of a production.

What I am most certainly not is a motion graphics artist, a storyboard artist, a scriptwriter/copyrighter, or a bloody legal consultant.

I'm so sick and tired of this "having to wear multiple hats". If they want me to do 5 jobs in 1, they should pay me 5 times as much. But of course that's never gonna happen, because we are in a very fast race to the bottom and to the cheapest and lowest possible quality of work possible.
>Yes - I have lost, and will continue to lose jobs, because I'm not a motion graphics artist.

Sounds like you're also a bad business man. I'm also not an animator but I know a couple of animators that I can call and give them work in case a client comes up that wants something.
Weird hill to die on! But you do you.
Motion graphics / designer artists and editor are two different carreers. Once I tried to learn After Effects, and it was hell. What a difficult software to use. Hats off to those who master it. Also, what a pain of work to create just a 3 second full-frame card.
It’s 2024… gotta be both bud, it sucks but yeahz
I like it.
Mograph was something I was really hesitant to do but as I've gone on I started to enjoy it more. Obviously, it's not for everyone and I make it very clear to my clients that unless you're gonna give me time what you see is what you get.
Thats why i decided to go the route of more professional audio and color work. Even if editors can do motion design it will just never as good as a motion designer that can do basic editing. On top of that i dont like animating
See I'm both for my job but I'm actually the other way around. I can edit and enjoy editing things like sizzle reels and hype videos but when it comes to interviews, I just hate doing it. I prefer motion graphics and as you said keyframing my life away. Unfortunately, the job I currently work at does more editing than motion graphics, so for the time being I'm more of an editor than a motion graphics artist.
I’ve mostly tried to avoid adobe. I can work in premiere if it’s necessary. But recently I’ve done a couple minor things in after effects. I took advantage of the Black Friday adobe suite special. It’s been handy for my current job. And I actually like it and plan to start diving into it. 

It is a different set of skills for sure.  I think it’s helpful when we don’t have to wait on another department or vendor to do something, do notes, send another version, repeat. It saves money, for sure, and I don’t see those savings directly. But my time is important and I love learning new things. 

I’d love to be able to do proper split screens and wire and equipment removal.
I feel really bad for this breakdown, I for sure am on the other end, and though it is a plus for me I often find myself on large video essay projects where because I'm known for my motion design, I have very little time to actually invest in motion design that can really flow cause we got 2 hours of real estate to cover
Welp 🤷‍♂️

🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
i can put some things together if they're vital for communicating the intent in a rough cut.... as soon as i start getting graphics notes on top of editorial notes though, i just cannot do both. i cannot be thinking about fonts and colors and animations and also be thinking about how to add all of the requested bytes without destroying the pacing
Ok, but can you do web design?
I always make sure they know the difference but when they want motion graphics it lets me command that much higher fee which pays off.
Dude. I feel so stupid that I don’t know photoshop and after effects. Like my brain doesn’t work that way. I don’t paint. I can’t draw. I’m not an artist. And I mean artist like Picasso and shit. Every job posting is like DO YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE ADOBE SUITE THAT WE OURSELVES DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND. No. No I don’t 
I love, respect, and feel EVERY word of this post man. Agree with all of it like you were rummaging around in my own brain. I also haven’t had work in years so take my accolades as valueless in today’s world. Good luck, friend. You’re fighting the good fight. I love the pianist/ guitarist analogy! Dead on.
Preach it
Thanks a lot. Sometimes when I see posts here I want to shout: that's not the fuking editing you are talking about. Jesus fuck, people don't understand difference between editing and video making. Finally somebody tells it out loud.
I’m both. I started as an editor, but I learned motion graphics as I went. I charge more when I have to do more than simple text and titles
How long have you been editing?
This is why I don’t use After Effects. If I wanted to be a VFX artist, I would go be a VFX artist.
Im the cinematographer, editor, graphic designer, and motion designer at my company…oh and a little bit of a front end web design too
 I totally agree with you! Editing and motion graphics are indeed separate skills. I've always felt this way too. In college, we had a class on After Effects and I found it incredibly boring to keyframe everything. It's just not my thing at all.
I had to drop a client this year because they started to refuse my rate and insist on a lower rate of their choosing, WHILE insisting I do the shooting, editing, motion graphics, VFX, casting, writing, and campaign management. It's sickening that this client isn't apparently the only one that works like that.
I think a big part of it is it that a whole generation who grew up messing around with easily accessible software for all these different aspects of post production have reached working age and while they may not excel in any one one area or know how to run a session with clients in an edit bay or gracefully address feedback while maintaining the creative integrity of the piece etc., they’re often good enough and they’re cheap!
I'm just leaning into it. Work has definitely been slower this last year, so I spend more time learning motion graphics.
lol it must be this type as to why I've worked with post producers absolutely shocked I know After Effects. I'm looking forward to the reactions of me learning Fusion last year.
I am today, a colourist. If you want me to edit your shots, you best have a tight script, and a large budget for the edit to run into overage x2. But do be prepared for a grade that is less than my best, due to frustration and exhaustion brought about by an edit that took forever. 

Give me a  correctly pre-conformed project, and source footage and just enough, but not too much guidance.  I will deliver, more than you expect and much less of what you do not want. If you demand more, then my invoice will be interesting, and my retirement sooner. 

I have my colourist craft. It took effort to learn it, to earn it! The biggest of all being, not allowing myself to be distracted by all of the other creative opportunities. You do not want my opinion on the cut, the audio, the pace, or the script, you want me to deliver tone, hue contrast and feel to match your intent -preferably not at odds with your DP’s interpretation (that costs extra). The more I have to correct the less of what you want will be delivered. That is the way of it. 
Any editor can fiddle with the knobs, sliders and curves but just as I can mangle superb audio, they can mangle a good image by doing far too much fiddling in the wrong areas of the image. 

I will and can do almost anything is a range of disciplines that would baffle most corporate Human resource managers (and has). I could teach a master class on survival beyond the limits in several contexts of life illustrated by scars and history. Routinely surviving “the impossible” to stand on the mountain to enjoy the view. 

But I have no significant interest, inspiration, or motivation beyond my colour grading craft. If you want to employ someone like me to do a job that doesn’t inspire, the results will be not especially inspiring, and the cost to your production value immeasurable. In the meantime, my survival is entirely sorted, I will not be going hungry, or homeless even if I have no paid work. I work because I choose to. If not I will continue playing with refining the grades on those pet projects I choose to keep me occupied. Maybe one of them is yours.  If so, be assured it’s in good hands.
Sounds like you refusing to adapt tbh.
My job title is video editor, I mostly do motion graphics and I also have to travel to film things. I think the video editor title pays the least so that's what I'm hired as.
![gif](giphy|l0GtwcDSNteWx2vfy|downsized)
Use motion graphics templates. Tons of good drag & drop .mogrts for Premiere nowadays
see also: I'm an editor, not a VFX artist.
“I’m not an electrician either”
I'm a full time multi media editor but the company I work for thinks I'm a motion graphics artist, a sound designer, a colorist, and a magician. 

I've been trying to learn after effects because I think I should develop the skill, but it's such a difficult program to self teach.
I can keyframe and model 3d shit all day long but I know I'm crap at editing and production. I still did that shit badly but that's why you hire more than one person. Glad I just do that shit as a hobby now. Paying for 3ds max is impossible to afford now which is sad.
True, but you're choosing yourself money by not asking a weapon to your arsenal. I do both pretty well, but I don't do sound or color. I don't understand sound and I'm color blind lol.
I’m quitting my commercial production in Tokyo for this reason. Yes they hired me knowing I’m a film editor who has been editing features and now they were surprised I couldn’t make 5 animated transitions in 30mins.
If you’re swimming in work and can afford to not invest in related skill set, then do what you want. I had to learn the basics of motion graphics plus pretty intermediate level sound and music editing to stay competitive in my market.
I learned a lot of motion graphics as an editor at the studio I was hired at 3 years ago. Over those 3 years I’ve learned motion graphics fairly well. Still I’m primarily an editor, Our motion graphics guy can also edit. So when there is over flow either way one of us picks up the slack. If I have to do some motion graphics I can, when he needs to edit he can. First year there was a lot of YouTube tutorials going on in my office, it’s still the case. Our DP does the color, but I’ve also gotten pretty good at that and learned DaVinci last year. The only guy that never really steps out of his lane is the sound engineer. My résumé is constantly growing it feels like.
“Looking for an editor” “hi I’m an editor” “great what camera do you own?” “… I own an expensive computer which I put money into to edit on… Not a camera” … “You don’t own a camera!? You’re not an editor!!!”
Ive had to explain this countless times... im a motion graphics artist, not an editor...
When I first came to nyc I interviewed at a big post house and the super laughed at the idea of hiring an editor who couldn't do motion graphics too.

I think it depends what you're cutting. 

Social media and ads? Ridiculous to be an editor in that space now without at least trying to learn after effects
Love this! And please stay like this! Clients need to change not us!
I usually try to get clarity from the client what they really need. Maybe their version of motion graphics is simple 2D key framing and some masking. If the job is something I can handle then I let them know I can do it, but I also let them know if they need anything beyond that then they will need to bring someone more specialized to handle those areas. And I have a few of those people ready to recommend. I missed out on a job recently because it was with a client I knew needed more of a motion/3D/compositing artist. The producer was new to the agency and didn't know the client well enough yet. It sucks to lose out to work, but it also sucks to fail to deliver or cost them more money than what they agreed to (bringing in a specialist after the fact). Always good to keep an open mind, but keep it within your wheelhouse.
Jobs that need that are LOW END. Who cares!
I've definitely had big clients who want me to design (and sometimes even come up with) copy in their video content. It's completely crazy. They will usually attached a zip with their brand guidelines in it and expect me to turn out perfectly on-brand artwork even though I have zero training in graphic design.

I either refuse to do it or slap something on there knowing they'll book one of their designers to do it properly. A lot of people are really stupid and don't see that videos are made of components. They just think the video guy is a self-contained polymath.
Yeah I get you. I've spent 5 years of my life working as a graphic designer. And to be honest, I never liked it. I love to tell stories when I'm editing videos, but almost all the jobs I get is to design stuff for social media. I get that the ultimate goal of marketing is to sell things. But I absolutely hate thinking the way marketing does. There's no artistry, no creative freedom. They always want to do the same as their business competitors. There's plenty of great marketing pieces out there, but all I get is clients that refuse to think outside the box. They demand that I have knowledge of all parts of the creative process. I can't focus on editing when I also need to learn motion graphics, sound design, visual effects, screenwriting... So I've decided that this year I will stop getting those jobs and starting pursuing a career of film editor, and try to focus only in that.
Bro is so full of himself, he had to make a post about it 😭
Same
Dude mograph has become so easy to learn, especially to someone coming from an editing background. But no, fuck having skills that make me a better creative! P.s. Mograph and story and editing and all these things you mention are not mutually exclusive.
This is when you pull out the "I have a guy for that though" and you both know each other well
Genuine question : how is this approach working out for you?
You mean to tell me you’re not a video editor, script writer, video gathering film maker who also does the voice over, sound design AND ACTING??? Cmon man, that’s what video editors are after all!
I have the opposite problem. I’m a terrible editor and just want to animate stuff.
Sometimes they really just want an influencer to do TikTok clips but claim it’s a video editor role
Did you write this on LinkedIn today? It's funny how there's a person on LI who posted an article to their legion of followers that sounds very close to yours. Even has some same lines and quotation marks in the same spots. Grinds my gears when someone takes from others without giving the credit.
I started in web development and now pretty much an everything role. Web dev / programming, database & server management, graphic design, printing, social media, copy editing, filmography, photography, video editor, motion graphics, analytics & metrics, event coordinator, email campaigns, and manager. But that's also why I made sure to ask for a high salary. Don't sell yourself short on the pay...
Hahahaha! They are soo different in terms of disciplines! And it’s massively time consuming with key framing and rendering. I remember these little bastards wanted me to do edit the light saber effect on a no budget project. Back then you had to manually track each frame 1 by 1. Never again 😂
I’m about to do freelance for editing, is this just how I get into the editing space…? By having to deal with dumbasses?
As a motion graphics artist and compositor I get triggered every time someone refers to a graphic as an edit.

Plug and play templates are muddying the waters. Editors can drop in some pretty slick graphics these days without needing a mograph goblin so it's perceived to be the same job in the majority of cases.
Gonna get left behind with that attitude.
You admitted your inadequacy, at least.
[deleted]
And own the gear, and do their marketing, and write the script, and and and...
$25 per hour??? Slow down there Mr. Rockefeller, this isn't Hollywood budgets you know.

Oh I’m glad it’s not just me who’s drastically underpaid as well. 
Once upon a time I was in an interview for an editor role, and the guy started to talk to me about my experience behind the camera (which I have), but it took me a while to pick up on the fact the guy didn’t want an editor - he wanted a production crew. I’m glad I didn’t get that job.
Oh I know.. we all feel this hard. I’m at the point where I just need someone else entirely to handle clients and the business end I hate it all so much. Just want to sit in the dark and do the damn work.
Yea and the job title is “Preditor” which is ironic because it’s usually the companies looking to exploit and pay the least for the most amount of work that are posting those positions.
Reading these replies is like every Monday ever
I feel that. I do sound as well. I'm not as good as a high end studio but I'm better than your average bear and can get you a pretty solid mix. No one ever seems to notice that part. 

Also - the website thing is way too real.
[deleted]
Wanting is the easy part
I do this too 

Pay is good at least
That's a pretty unrealistic expectation but with page builders making a basic websites about the same skill level as after effects.

Granted you won't be able to do extremely customized things like creating css or Javascript from scratch but I don't think most editors use many expressions in after effects and get by alright.
I think a lot of this is simply because clients don't understand that there's a separate breakdown of these roles and that to them, anyone who does this stuff is an *editor.*
This is the way.

&#x200B;

In ALL seriousness, having gone through film school now, it's depressing that most clients expect you to also do sound mixing. The worst experience I've had: taking SCRATCH audio and using it in the edit. They had me do 27 passes of audio before realizing that they should've just invested in a Lav mic or SOMETHING besides the camera smfh

I just ended up handing in the project and moving onto a different gig LOL
It is interesting because I actually can do 2D animation, VFX compositing, and sound design. I also am/can be a voice actor and I can shoot and I can write copy and come up with stories. But I still run into pikachu faces when I point out I am not a graphic designer so someone else needs to make the assets for me to animate and no I don’t know how to create 3D models and texturing.

No matter how many things you check off on your resume people will always want you to do more.

When people think VFX is actual "editing"
Lol. I probably have!
This is the way.
We have envato elements- roughly the same thing. Sell a few mediocre stock shots (it’s not as good as the big boys, but for the right situation or client…) and an AE template and it’s paid for itself for the year. Build in an add-on to ALL jobs since it’s a service that’s part of your kit now.
This is what I do
This works decently well until it doesnt
this is the way
Bob, from the top rope!
Yea a one trick pony freelancer is going to be very hungry in this generation.
I totally agree, but knowing all those things makes you more valuable. So we need to get paid more.
But that's the tendency across all industries. Workers are required to have more and more skills but payments are still the same as before. It's plain wrong.
Agreed — and tbh I don’t think it’ll survive on its own inside film/tv either. Imo the tech boom we’re seeing isn’t going to make jobs easier. The biggest change we’ll see is the type and amount of work that an individual is expected to do. The same thing happened in the 70s when “practical computing” came around.
My first job out of college was DVD authoring for an indie distributor. Most these films had like 50k budgets. OMG - the amount of times I had to design covers drove me absolutely insane. I had no idea DVD authoring meant "poster designer" as well.
Ok thats funny lol
Lucky you.
This is the most important point. While some people in this thread like u/Got_A_Turtle_Head are celebrating the race to the bottom, the fact is one person can't do the same quality of work as a team. Sure, they might be extraordinarily talented and can do a few things very well, but all the top editors or VFX people I've ever met in my career are specialists in their field. Bruce Lee said "I fear not the  who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." Same goes for editing. When they want someone who is an expert in two separate fields, they NEVER pay for that expertise. Which leads to a degradation of pay and quality, which quickly becomes the new norm, and the cycle continues.
These hybrid jobs pay more than 750-1200 a day? From what I’ve seen these types of jobs tend to pay PA rates.
That’s always been the case for me. I learned after effects very early in my career and now use cinema 4D as well.

I work in sports streaming and broadcasting and I have better job security than the regular editors, get paid more, and get the marquee assignments because I can take a project from concept to finished product.

I wouldn’t want to be limited to one small piece of video production. That sounds boring.
>but you’ll have less work and get paid less

I mean, if you exclusively work in social or marketing sure. But I mostly work in features. This social job is literally just a filler before I start a feature in April.
[deleted]
Yeah it’s understandable if you aren’t able to do a full blown flashy motion graphic explainer video or something but you should be able to do some basic text or lower third type motion graphics these days. It’s pretty simple. It’s usually just keyframing masks, scale, position etc.
Having a working knowledge of some things, perhaps. Like organic bottom third text or how to adjust templates, sure. 

But to actually build out a 2D or 3D motion graphic from at scratch is a silly standard. Not to mention, most of these graphics actually start in photoshop or illustrator which is even more of a cluster to have for an ask. Again, a working knowledge of things is fine, but they’re all very different areas of expertise, tool kits and hardware spec’s different.
I'll team up. I edit
should be the other way around, IMO. clients aren’t gonna have editors for much longer if they keep that attitude up. also OP already stated (and I agree with this too) that it’s ok that they’ve lost and will continue to lose out jobs. it sounds like OP knows how to maintain a manageable work relationship with their clients and avoid burnout.
Can't disagree more bub. You might have an attitude of "adapt or die", but I agree with his approach of being hyper focused specialized in a specific discipline, rather than being mediocre at many. 

It limits the opportunities for employment in the same way that I might live in a market where there's a MASSIVE demand for software developers, and I'm a chef.
I dunno, a lot of my work is in commercials and I've learnt a bit of basic stuff but I'm at a level if a client asks me for proper motion graphics it's better to be honest. For the most part I can't create animated titles that transform and interact with infographics to the level that is expected for TV commercials, why be dishonest and *really* burn that bridge for yourself?

I usually just say I know a great dedicated MG that I can put you in touch with or sort it out/brief my end and add the cost to the invoice.
Editing YouTube shorts is the worst. I hate how everything has to be snappy and in your face to keep viewer’s attention for more than 3 seconds
That was becoming a thing 15+ years ago when I left news. Are they finally getting better at it?🤣🤣🤣
I know how to story produce and often work as a creative director, what makes you think I don't know how to hire a team of people? Sometimes the gig doesn't have that kind of budget. In which case I don't take the job. If it's some small time gig that pays only 700/day, why would I sacrifice my paycheck hiring someone else just for the client's benefit? I'd rather just get a different job. If "pay more" is bad business then I guess I'm terrible lol.
As someone that does both, ive always loved seeing the difference in peoples' takes on mograph and the like. I know the huge push for me was just my ability to hyperfocus on it when I can barely focus on anything else without getting really anxious. I think my love for math and physics may, partly, have something to do with it as well.
Im actually shocked that if you are an editor you don't know After Effects
>Unfortunately, the job I currently work at does more editing than motion graphics

Keep your voice down! You're surrounded by editors, do you want to cause a stampede?
We duffers get pretty good mileage out of Pixelmator Pro, Apple Motion, and Final Cut -- and don't have to tithe the Adobe God.
i mean, i kind of see it like how i see it when someone asks if i can "crop" something out. you mean like cut the canvas smaller? no, they mean rotoscoping or masking lol.

it's like the "all game consoles are nintendos" issue but with editing.
If you need color grading in Resolve for NYC clients hit up- I have a suite with the advanced panels in Manhattan.  I do sound clean up as well in RX advanced
I'm one of the few editors working right now so I guess I'll cry about my inadequacy all the way to the bank.
This isn't the flex you think it is.
They also want someone who know SEO and how to read the metrics on digital campaigns.
Literally.
***$10***???? SWEET. That's a whole meal right there! All for a day's work!
What's sadder than that are the losers on that post unironically begging to take that pathetic offer.
On the sound mixing thing, they *do* notice, they just don’t realise they notice. Would be nice to get a pat on the back every now and again though, I agree!
Sound mixing is like editing, if they don’t notice, you’ve done your job well
Haha, that's not a bad way to keep expanding my education as well!

I'm actually hoping to get farther from production and deeper into Producer-ing rather than deeper and deeper into the expanding pool of responsibilities they want editors to have. As a result of all the previous asks I can edit, animate, do a little vfx, manage the flying text and graphics, handle our contractors, manage our swollen media library and am migrating it to a new media system I set up, and do posters and graphic design. All for peanuts, because it's a small place I work now, but it's a reliable daily job.

I've always drawn the line at code, websites, and the like. People always want HTML. I have a project management cert now, I just want to help plan projects and make cool things happen on budget, c'mon folks.
Is it??

I joke. I mean it could be worse. I work for a small place so it's not competitive, but I want to take my 5 years of Producer title experience and find a better gig.
I think it's more likely that they just want to pay one person instead of hiring several people. Which I kind of understand but also find insanely frustrating.
A lot of graphic designers don't do motion design. They bemoan the fact that they are asked to do tasks that they were not trained for.


I do motion graphics; most of what I do is moving text, which is not too difficult. I am not an animator though. Just a graphic production artist who learned Aftereffects 
In my opinion, sound mixing is a pretty crucial part of editing. I’m not saying you have to know how to master and do a mega pro level mix, but if you don’t know how to deliver a rough cut with balanced audio levels where things sound as close to the final product as you can make it, then you aren’t a very good editor, or you’re lazy and making another person have to do a lot more work later on, when most of this could have all been adjusted before you even started throwing clips in the timeline.

It always pissed me off when I’d receive work from other editors (if i was assembling a show or something) and they have certain clips where there’s only audio in the left channel, or levels are up and down so you have to keep raising and lowering the volume as you watch down.

Sound can have such a big impact on certain edits and I’ve always felt it’s very much a part of telling the story you want to tell. How can a producer get a sense of your vision for the edit if there are jarring audio levels and other things that take you out of the piece. You don’t want to remind people that it’s a rough cut unless it’s absolutely necessary.

It’s fine if people disagree, but every great editor I’ve worked with has had a pretty good sense of how to keep a decent mix going while they build everything out.
Yeah this is quite common nowadays especially clients looking for short social media content. I personally hate motion graphics and hate those that I have to make from scratch, but give me a mogrt that does it for me without crippling my pc and I'm happy to be your graphic designer.
This is the way.
I agree with you, and I can tell you from experience knowing how to do simple templated animations in and out for thirds and how to apply stock alpha'd graphics and create some simple wipes, etc in AE has increased my rates over time.  I think my freelancing has benefitted GREATLY by knowing how to do intermediate graphics work that bridges the gap and allows me to deliver more complex output than my rivals.
> These hybrid jobs pay more than 750-1200 a day?

Yes. Work direct for ad agencies or motion design shops and you can ask $1000-1500/day
[deleted]
Yeah true. I don’t work in features, I don’t have the patience for it and I’m not in LA
Yeah, same. Though that isn’t really a thing in my industry, any editor who cuts 30sec commercials and says they’re “crafting stories” is full of shit IMO 🤣
I'm not doing much 3D work but I probably spend an hour or two a day adding texture/drop shadows/bevels/light glints/etc. to 2D gfx in AE, in addition to the half day or so digging thru fonts and coming up with styleframe looks at the start of the project. It's a must for me every single day and I don't know any editors in my world who aren't *really* close to retirement age who can't get by on AE.
sadly every time i feel this way, i am shocked by the fact that clients will often just accept lower quality work rather than "learn something" from losing out on an expert. the blame is often passed down until it's far away from the people making these decisions and therefore they rarely change.
I work in commercials too and I'm not claiming to be as good as motion artists who are at the top of their game, a specialist would do that, of course. 

But for a lot of in-between work, I'm the guy who's expected to get the job done, I'm pretty decent and with enough time and a good reference I can do a seamless job. I've done basic motion for a lot of spots where it wasn't too fancy. 

As things become more enshitified and budgets shrink and responsibilities collapse, those who are flexible will be in demand.
You're Right
You're probably right. In my case, I have hyperfocus on things I like. This is an obvious affirmation but when I say this, I mean staying volutarily until dawn because it's something I'm enjoying to do. And it's not rare spend hours more than I should. But with mograph, as it's something I really did not like, I can't dedicate any attention to it. However, when I tried to learn it, it helped me to understand a minimum in order to know better about what a designer can do. At least it enriched my knowledge.
I've been an assistant editor for ten years and I've never worked for an editor who knew After Effects. But, my perspective is skewed since I only work on shows where an assistant exists. If production cannot afford an assistant, then maybe those editors all have to know After Effects, I'm not sure.
I had to learn the basics of it at some point just to update some letterings and schedules of TV shows, but every where I worked there were people just to work in AE. I know it's a reallity, but I get outraged that lots of companies require advanced AE knowledge from video editors. My opinion is that they want to save money by demanding two different skills from just one professional. As I said: they are two different careers.
Why is it shocking? I edit, I have no need to use AE.
Yes, yes I do, I want to see the world burn down around me while I light up a cigarette 🚬
Well I’m very very good at premiere pro. Starting to learn avid now and I fucking hate it 
What happened to the millions of teenagers who can cut video? "few editors" LOL
Yeah this is the one I’m seeing a lot now, and really confused as to why I would ever need to know this information to put a video together?
Preach!!!
I'm expected to do videography, photography, graphic design, web design, SEO, SEM, social media management, and email marketing, among a few other things. I own all my equipment and pay for Adobe. KMN
Don’t forget 5 years of proven experience leading marketing campaigns!!
I literally had to do all of the above (also social media campaigns) and they were offering 13.5 dollars an hour
Wow
And build their website.
also can you just create a simple website and embed the videos from social media there?
Woah woah woah there's still plenty of meat on that bone... You take that home, throw it in a pot, add some broth and potatoes.... Baby you've got a stew going!
I started out doing webdesign but unless you’re doing high level back end development which basically equates to computer programming there doesn’t seem like much opportunity in that field anymore. There’s so many build-your-own sites like Shopify these days, plus chat gpt providing more complex code.

Pretty much the only thing I *haven’t* done at this point is complex 3d modeling. Kinda dragging my heels on that hoping AI makes it easier.
Yeah I feel like when this industry and these kind of jobs were just starting to be a thing we could say they don't understand how different everything is. 

Now it's definitely just companies being as cheap as possible.
>o

Absolutely agreed! I always make sure to do a pass of sound design/mixing (at least based on a director or producer's notes) to see how it feels. And in terms of levelling audio, you never wanna blow out a speaker because you were lazy!

Mostly referring to clients who ask for completely polished sound. A lot of people seem to assume sound work is simple, but in reality, it takes a ***loooot*** of time
Very, incredibly rare from my experience
Right, and a smart editor would get that without having to do both jobs
So true, especially when there are a hundred CD's taking all of your creative control away anyway lmao
It sounds like you’re in a role where it’s already demanded. Like my role where I have to film, take photos, edit photos in lightroom and edit, virtually doing 4 roles on a day to day, similar to yours. So it’s really easy to say: “hey look what I can do! You must suck and have no ability to learn a program I’ve used for 5+ years” Well, great, you already have the skillset and implement them day to day. Where most video editors are just that. Maybe they shoot video, maybe dabble in photography, maybe know some of AE but they’re still completely different roles with different gear, hardware etc. 

Its still a good idea to have a working knowledge of other programs but companies are crazy looking for unicorns. It’s the same for a “social media manager” when looking for one who works in sponsorships, DE&I, content creation, legal, community management, presentation skills to CSuites with analytics background. Oh this is an entry level job with 5yrs experience, 45k.
The editors who know after effects are around. We just don’t generally advertise it. 

I do VFX editing a lot and prefer to do it in Avid so there isn’t any Temp Love.
I guess it depends on what software you use. I primarily use Premiere and doing anything with text in there is a nightmare, same for Davinci.
They want to hire someone who will produce the video for them and then shoot the metrics back to them, but they don't know what that person is called, so they put out one of those abomination of a job posting.

There's people who will be desperate enough to say they can do it, even if they have no idea, and these clients are too greedy and undiscerning to know they're walking into a disaster.
Because how metrics work will determine how you put the video together.
Location, Location, Location
Pretty common from mine. YMMV.
You should inventory your skills and your clients and figure out where the gap lies, either it's one or the other and easy to fix.  If your skills are solid, get better clients, if not, bone up on skills and THEN get better clients.

I'm doing this over 20 years, it certainly wasn't always like this but in order to get more opportunities on bigger/better projects it was necessary for me to widen my skillset and expertise. I did it after hours, taking courses in person and online, and putting in the effort.
I had a decent job lined up but I was honest about my experience with SEO/metrics. Haven’t heard back since. I should’ve just lied.
Worse, it will get done just fine, but poor quality. They either wont care, or will only look at the “returns” and say video is a dead end. To them it’s just pennies, to OUR industry it’s a death sentence
I believe they're looking for a video production swiss army knife and/or social media wizard/ninja/rockstar.
But that’s down to the Marketing team to know no? Or the Social Media Manager or even the Art/Creative Director?
They’re the ones who have created the idea that is the video and I’ve been hired to put it together for them under their direction.
I can see this being the case in smaller markets. Not really the norm in LA, things are still departmentalized, as they should be
I’m a picture editor. I have great clients, and great rates. Not sure what this is in reply to tbh
And I do, I just don’t have to do both jobs at the same time.
And I’m saying editors can get 1k+ a day without having to do both
It's depressing, yeah. I understand other tools--learning how to use a whole editing suite of tools is one thing, like color grading or effects layers and text and such, the sort of thing a lot of people want but call "motion graphics" and so on, sure. But the SEO/Metrics stuff is just frustrating, because it feels so obviously like they're asking for too much.

Thing is, if someone is asking a *video editor* to manage the SEO/Metrics/Marketing stuff then you need to reframe it in your mind. They aren't asking if you are a SEO professional, but if you can do what they think of as SEO/Metrics stuff, which basically means help them know if their video is getting traction and make sure it goes to the right places.

Whenever someone asks for some off-the-wall nonsense it's usually because they don't know what it is either. You can often bluff it back.

"Well, I know how to manage the SEO needs of a personal project, but for something like this for your company I'd need to be in contact with whoever manages your marketing front-end stuff." Which is true, you can't check the metrics if you don't have the dashboad or their account.

I've had people ask for stuff that they profoundly wouldn't want done, but sometimes you can't convince them, especially if they know a lot less than you. But you can always offer to help or collaborate with someone else on their team who does.
I went through that at my last job and honestly I think that’s a big part of why I was in the first round of lay offs. Didn’t know I needed to know metrics going in and they expected me to just know it and so no one helped me learn. What was crazy was we had people on the team who weren’t editors whose jobs were more focused on that and yet they still wanted the editors to be fluent in the metrics.
triggered…
You rang?
Alright, would you rather pay my ninja rate, my rockstar rate, or my wizard rate?
yeah, i do editing and Mograpg, but my motion is all text/bg type stuff. Think explainers with icon animations. I would not attempt a high end character animation piece, I know my limits, lol
This is the norm for the NYC commercial market, which is vastly bigger than LA’s.
You said the rates he mentioned were rare, unless I misread.  Common for my work too.  If you are happy with your rates my advice is not for you!
Well that’s why you’re not getting those rates then!
[deleted]
Honestly I wasn’t sure if I wanted the gig but after a couple weeks of seeing 10+ posts a day of lay offs and people unemployed as well as being incredibly depressed where I am, I wish I would’ve bluffed harder. I crushed the interview(s) but the last I heard was they had one more candidate who wasn’t able to schedule an interview yet. That was supposed to happen last week. The first time I spoke to them 6-7 weeks ago they expressed how quickly they wanted to move, and reiterated that at my in person interview 4 weeks ago. Now it’s been a month and they spent 3 weeks waiting for one other person to interview? Odds are they dicked around waiting for this last candidate and now can’t deal with the few weeks it’ll take for me to move. 

I don’t know why they even ask about SEO shit when they already have a marketing guy handling most of that, but it’s that typical “I’m the boss and I don’t understand anything you’ll be doing” bullshit. I think he asked me 3 times if I knew how to put music under dialogue.
Oh boy 26 days ago when I still had some hope of hearing back from said job. Now I’ve got an entirely new one that I’m currently giving up hope on!
Rare for combo jobs, the majority of jobs asking for combo work tend to be quite low and nightmare clients.
I’m getting those rates, my example range was the low end.
For sure. I cut for my studio during the day, and take on other edits during standby and off time. Yes, working more tends to make you more money.
In the same boat dude. Sent in a test edit the other day and hoping to hear back this week with good news at least getting me to the next stage.
Yeah that’s why part of my advice is once you inventory both and you detect your skills are cool, it’s the clients and you need to find better clients who understand the work and value the skill set and can afford to pay you what you deserve.  There’s a million crappy clients for all jobs but there’s enough good ones for the highly skilled to work with.
[deleted]
I had a great interview, immediately contacted to fill out some forms for the background check, guy I used to work for told me they contacted him the next week to ask about me. Now it’s just been silent for 2 weeks. Maybe it’s still a possibility but I’m very much on the side of businesses should have the deceny to tell you they aren’t giving you a job after a certain point. 3 interviews and I drive a total of 12 hours and get a hotel to meet with you? A simple status update and maybe a reason doesn’t seem like that big of an ask. And this one, what if there’s something wrong on my background check and they’re just ghosting me because of it? Shouldn’t you communicate to me if something came up? If something on my background check is preventing me from getting hired then that’s something I need to know. I can’t take it much longer I’ve spent the last 6 months straight being in hiring limbo and each job has fallen apart in a bullshit way.
I’m good, been at it for 20 years. I don’t deal with crappy clients anymore, which was the point of my reply.
Not really.
As a 23 year old editor, this sub is literally the most discouraging and depressing thing I've ever read.
That's it, that's the post.
Nah, check out r/FilmIndustryLA if you *really* want to get bummed out.
I come and go from interacting with this sub. The honest truth is this trade is very fragmented. In terms of what part of the industry you fall into, what region you’re in, and what success looks like to you. People often come here looking for answers but this business and your career are such a solo experience it is incredibly hard to find a gauge.
Have you tried fixing it in post?
Chin up- it ain’t us and it ain’t you, it’s the state of the entire industry.
I am a 30+ year veteran editor for television, and I lost my career in the last year. 
I didn’t lose a job, I lost my entire career as many others have as well. 
So yeah, the entire industry is depressing right now.
I'm a few years ahead of you. We're entering at a very turbulent time. Editing isn't going anywhere, but what that job means and looks like is changing rapidly, and the slimdown of the industry isn't helping!
![gif](giphy|l0MYGb1LuZ3n7dRnO|downsized)
Hmmmm…. Don’t wait for footage …. Make the footage and edit it. That’s the trick.
Welcome to editing!
I got so confused reading this thread, until I realized wait, this community is for FILM editors! I’m a copy editor and developmental editor. I’ll see myself out in a moment, but a lot of what I read here, the issues finding work now, etc., is similar to what I’ve seen in my Facebook communities for copy editors—incredible angst about the effect of clients and employers using AI for editing and writing services. Good luck to us all! Ironically, I recently stumbled into a niche that I think has potential. I’ve edited a couple of memoirs, and I’ve learned a lot about self publishing. Lately, I keep encountering people who want to write their memoirs and self-publish them. So, I’m starting to build my marketing for that, refine the services I can offer in that area. I could also facilitate workshops on it. 

One thing that has helped me a lot in the last few years is being part of a local professional networking organization for women in my county. One connection I made a couple of years ago at a happy hour provides several thousand dollars of revenues a year, and I just made a new connection at an event this week that I hope will have similar results.
That's the industry right now sadly.
Welcome to being an adult.
I went from working a shit job in signage and getting fired to teaching myself how to edit from YouTube video to now 10 years down the track been a freelance videographer/editor. I work on two Saturday afternoon commercial tv cooking shows and I have a retainer with a pharmaceutical company that pays 100k a year.

This career has enabled me to start a family and buy a house. I'm always busy and have never marketed myself. 

This sub is very depressing. A lot of people struggling to find work and generally miserable about their future in the industry. I had to stop reading it a few months back because it was giving me the illusion that the whole industry was dead. Step outside and touch grass.
Don't blame the Redditors. They're going through the same thing you are. 

If you have tons of great news, even personal accomplishments, to share, then please share.
I work on the video editing side of things (social media, marketing, youtube, business videos, talking heads, ads, etc). If you get into this area you will find plenty of work always, and can pay pretty well.

The film editing industry is not doing so well for what I can learn from this sub, but every person is different.
Editing is a savory job, some might say salty. Do not trust a sweet editor.
I don’t agree about this sub but you should try the Teachers sub. This sub is the Glee Club by comparison.
This sub feels a bit like product reviews on Google; you mainly see feedback from editors with complaints, while those who are happy with their jobs tend to stay quiet.

Since 2018 I have been employed in unscripted. I still get job offers every few weeks that I have to turn down and only take time off when I set my schedule aside for vacations.

It's not just reddit. In general, editors can be a negative bunch, probably because many of us are introverts who find it tough dealing with the sometimes ridiculous notes from producers. Although from the type that comment on Reddit, id imagine it's a an extra combination of negativey.

I've found that being positive, likable, and easy to get along with can do wonders for your career. At the end of the day, producers are the ones doing the rehiring, and they’d rather work with editors who are easygoing than those who come across as arrogant. Most editors can deliver a solid edit; it’s about being someone a producer wants to sit with for three months straight.

And hey, even on the bad days, there’s always the satisfaction of wiping away our tears with all that sweet, sweet cash.
I don’t do editing for a living, but have friends who do. Reddit is a bit of an echo chamber so all the negative thoughts and opinions bounce around and get amplified on every sub, whether slits editing, or toe nail clipping, it’s the nature of Reddit. You may see the odd successful editor on here, but they won’t be commenting every day because they are too busy editing. So the general views on here are biased. I’m bracing myself for the onslaught of downvotes and people telling me about the state of the industry.
Its not just this sub, its just how all of reddit is lately. Im sure ill get downvoted to hell but a lot of people who post regularly on reddit do so because they are unhappy and choose to spend their time interacting here instead of the real world.

Its a hard industry and burnout is real, this sub seems to be an echo chamber of that frustration.

That being said I quit my editing job 3 days ago and started a job marketing soooooooo……
Yeah, you're not wrong. As a 23 year old editor myself, there's definitely been a few times where the sub has made me consider a change in careers while I'm still young.

That being said you need to keep in mind why people post in the first place. People are much more likely to post "I lost everything my life sucks" than "things are pretty good right now, same old same old. i ate cereal this morning". People post when they have an incentive to post, whether that be something positive or negative. And with the industry bleeding the way it is right now, it just causes us to have a very concentrated dose of editors who got shafted by the current state of things.

Like yeah, we're not in a great spot right now, but that also depends a lot on what type of work you're doing exactly and where you're based. The industry isn't dying as a whole, it's just changing. The profession isn't going anywhere, and even narrative work will bounce back eventually and as long as you're willing to adapt and evolve with the profession, as well as maybe keep a backup plan in mind if you decide you don't want to deal with the stress and uncertainties anymore, you should be fine I think.

Or maybe I'm just yapping and have no idea what I'm talking about idk, I'm 23 and I cannot be trusted with adult responsibilities.
As an editor/videographer/producer for 23+ years, I love this sub. It’s like a dive bar where there’s always someone more miserable than you. I feel better about my job and I get to try and lift someone else up by telling them their job in film that isn’t going anywhere is not the end of the road.
Most of us who are currently working aren’t posting on here. Same as LinkedIn. Don’t take all the negativity as gospel.
I think a 23 year old editor armed with the word literally is more depressing
[deleted]
Light can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to sync lock all tracks.
I know people say, ignore the comments, it’s not reality but this is literally some end times going on and when ai hits full throttle, it’s gonna be worse.
Everyone has already shared their views here but it comes down to this. You are 23. You can acquire skills. Be as apt as you can; be smart and savvy. And then realize it comes down to finding your pocket. There’s niches of employment. Figure out how to be in one, and how to stay there.
Welcome!
For me editing is the worst part of the entire process I hate doing it and it’s boring and tedious. I only do it because I only trust my taste for what the client wants and it makes me more money.
It’s interesting to hear it’s the same in the US. I live in NZ, and studied Post production last year (Avid, grading etc), and we were constantly told post get the most jobs. Fast forward to this year and all of my CLA friends are pretty consistently getting work- Minecraft, new predator film etc but post is dead. My friend works for WB in the reality space and they’ve laid off the majority of their team. Not the best right now, but I am hearing that 2025 will be picking up. In the mean time I’m just keeping my skills fresh working on short films and some freelance stuff.
For the record, my career is going relatively well (knock on wood) and I still love it years later. People who are happy don’t have as much need to vocalize online. 
Things are tough out there yes but we are HARDLY the only industry suffering right now and far from the industry hit hardest by AI. 
Working is tough all around, and as you get older you sometimes think it should be easier because you’re so experienced— but you need to learn to pivot your skills according to what the industry needs. If you can do that, and you know you wanna be here, then be here.
I started as an editor decades ago. My first week a coworker told me this job is golden handcuffs and editor is a dying career. 

Thought he was wrong until they got rid of all the editors at my job a few years ago, saving only a few who are now writers.
I (23F) commenting to say it is possible and you don’t have to be in LA to do it. I’m in upstate NY. Yes not NYC
Editor going on 48 years (film, tape, NLE). Bubbles happen. Have faith it will come back. Keep your skills sharp. Edit on the side. Reach out to your network of people. Learn AI/ML. Don’t be scared of it; embrace it.
A lot of people here suck
U need to look at ur career as chess moves and leverage. Thinking 5-10 steps ahead of where u want to go in relation of where u see the industry going and how u become hard for an employer to let u go even in tough times… If ur just an “editor” u need to be incorporating others skills like visual effects, data management, AI skills.
Welcome to the suck
The industry is not doing well at the moment. During and after COVID, there were lots of cuts in staffing/personnel and budgets dried up. Because of this, unfortunately, you have a lot of editors who are depressed and desperate for work. So, yeah, you're going to see a lot of negative, discouraging posts.

Things may be picking up in some quarters, but it's certainly slow for a lot of people at the moment.
things are bad right now, worse then they have ever been. Ive been doing this for 35 years and it is discouraging. The opportunities I had coming up no longer exist.
If you're a 22 year old editor get off the internet and get editing.
I'm working in corporate and working steadily. I think there are a lot of people outside of Hollywood doing well or at least okay right now and they're probably not posting about it because they don't have a reason to or don't want to rub it in other's faces.
Bah. Editing is great. Any time you find a career with so many crotchety old people doing it, the fact is that they love it enough to stick with it for decades, and that it pays well enough that we made careers out of it.

Any time you see people complain about something a lot, that also means they CARE about it a lot.

You’ll be fine.
lol this thread is basically just people who’ve been editing so long that they don’t know anything else and are projecting their own fears about the future onto you. That being said, the industry is definitely changing a lot.

Can you put together masterpieces of editing/VFX? Maybe.

Do people actually give a shit about the quality of work anymore? Not so much.

Nowadays editing is more about pushing pixels around for a micromanaging egomaniac boss/client than it is about fine-tuning a well-planned production. And freelance always felt more like being a slave to every whim of the few clients I could scrape together towards the end. Left the industry, and I now realize just how much of myself I sacrificed for an art form which has been enshittified in every sense of the word. So many artists out there having their unique ideas squashed by incompetent bosses whose only qualification for owning a production company is that they have the money for it. Just my two cents don’t murder me
This sub is sadly mostly negative and elitist, but no worries, generally editing is a great job depending on your exact field. If you need any help, feel free to ask! You'll probably always get some answer
I’ve had a very successful post career I just don’t post here. Some of us made it don’t get discouraged.
The real world is much better than the cesspool online. Don't get discouraged. Work on your skills and be a good person and good things will happen for you.
Man don’t let the negativity get you. There are many successful editors getting great work and they don’t have the time to come nag about it here. 

It’s a great industry to be in. There is a ton of opportunity.
😂😂😂
Try my tax return!!!
You have a lot of years to grow. If the next forty go like the last there at least two boom cycles in there. Will you use this downturn to learn how to be resilient, live beneath your means and build your network so you will be ready when that boom happens? 
If you really like to edit, you might want to consider what happens.
There’s always the trades.
Check r/VFX
Seeing anything film or tv related, for sure. I went a slightly more secure line, I do freelance internal corporate, I budget what I need to make for the year and I track everything, I had a super slow 3 months over the summer, but I did the math and if I work 15 more days I’ll be covered for the rest of the year. Best part is, it’s the easiest work ever, most of the time I put in a few hours a day and everyone praises how good you are because they are used to absolute garbage, I love it
I’m 31 graduating and entering the field I do have another gig that will pay bills but I just wanna edit hate having to have another job
I think what I’m seeing is a general shift in the industry. As a 23 year old, you have some options to adjust- which is a good thing!

I think it’s becoming harder to do just one thing anymore. I live in a medium/low sized market (city under 1 million people) and I find it’s best to know a few things. In my case, editing and motion design. For you maybe it’s editing and colour grading, or being able to also do some camera op work. Diversify your skillset and you can diversify your income. Also budgets aren’t what they used to be so sometimes you might need to do more low budget corporate stuff to pay the bills.

But lots companies are producing content so there is work! Just lots of competition and lower budgets. Do great work, work on your skills, treat your clients well and you can still make a go of it.
I just come here for technical advice. Its still unmatched.
The biggest problem is supply and demand. Too many people willing to work bottom dollar for entry and too many excited replacements waiting in the wings to get used and abused. That pretty much tanked compensation aside from entities willing to use and abuse people’s ambitions. That is the main reason I went from broadcast to large scale private corporate meetings and ditched editing altogether for media server playback. It’s a great parallel pivot from editing that is timeline based and in demand, although very niche.
If it’s any consolation, market trends historically have had ebbs and flows. Media is largely having in an ebb moment right now. When I was your age, there was a writer’s strike and financial crisis that caused the industry to come to a grinding halt. Sound familiar? It should, but the year was 2008 that time. It was tough finding a gig in the industry as a fresh-faced film grad with little real world experience, so I worked in insurance for the first 3 years after college. It felt horrible at the time, like I failed and my career was doomed before it started. I eventually found work in the industry when the economy rebounded and market forces in the field shifted for the better. I’ve been laid off twice from jobs in the time since. Each time I just kept trudging ahead even if the future felt uncertain, the only reason being because I loved post and the craft. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else but I’d be lying if I said I did not want to give up in the face of such obstacles, every single time. 

Today, I’m a staff editor at a large creative agency, but I still keep my reel up to date. My point is, market forces are always going to be variable. My advice is when times are good, you should be prepared for when they’ll be bad; by the same token, when times are bad, you should stay prepared to seize any opportunities that may arise when times finally improve. I’d also recommend abstaining from reading too much of the gloom online - you’re already down about it, justifiably so, but there’s no need to put yourself through more discouragement. If you love the craft, keep cutting, even if it’s personal projects, online learning, or just for fun.
Check out subs for software coders/programmers.  Or probably any other sub for professionals right now. Economy sucks and there are no jobs anywhere other then min wage stuff
That’s life better get used to it. Theres always gonna be low periods. Same happened in 2008.
It’s pretty much every subreddit nowadays.
Some wisdom for interacting with the internet: people who are busy with work don’t have time to post. 

There are always exceptions with pros who also love to be a free resource but most people who are really active online aren’t as active in the field. 

That’s why, if you looked at sheer volume of posts over the decades, you’d assume that the industry standard platform was FCP or Premiere or now Resolve and that Avid was a rarity. People making money know that’s not been true. 
I’m making good money at a steady job in the communications department of a large university.  It has its ups and downs, but it’s a unicorn job in the video world.  There’s plenty of jobs out there.
 The world IS in a bad place right now, and reddit is an echo chamber for negativity. You have to limit your time on reddit and doomscrolling. Yes the industry is fucked and becoming an editor is a stupid, terrible idea- but if you wanna do it, you have to actually work on your skills, not doomscroll. 
It's the same feeling as when countless recording studios closed on the 2000s.
You are in the "don't look down" period of climbing the mountain. If you do, you'll slow your ascent for fear of falling, and even if you fell right now, you'd walk away with bruises most likely.

There are some bleak choices facing some older people with a lot to lose who haven't gained enough yet. Dead in the middle of the sandwich where none of the crumbs are going to escape. 

But you, right now, just need to do anything. Work, learn, grow. Some opportunities are better than others, but you'll grow doing almost anything at your level for a while. You have nothing to lose, and if you grow and change with the industry, you'll have a fulfilling career in whatever editing becomes.
I only recently started using Reddit again after a year long break. Since coming back I've unsubscribed from most 'creative' subreddits because of how depressing they've become. Reddit has always had a tendency to be on negative side of any argument, but it's gotten a bit ridiculous lately. It's understandable in the sense that we're currently in an economic downturn and there's alot of uncertainty in creative spaces because of AI, but the stereotype of the 'doom and gloom' Redditor is real.
Then contribute and make it better
I can share some positive energy. I work as an editor full time for an online educational company and got a 12% raise last year, and I’m on track for a promotion. Do I make the same as my friends in tech or sales? No, but I can provide pretty well for myself (in my middle class opinion) as a single woman in a large city and I enjoy my work. Maybe I’m naive or lucky but I feel optimistic about my skill set.
Hey me too. Things change in an instant and the internet can really distort things. Just keep putting in the work and get in front of new faces, the best opportunities go to the people they know. There’s still movies being made out there and they need editors!
Much like the news, the stories of success are usually less interesting than those of failure or struggle. So they get less views or never come up. This can lead to confirmation bais
Wait until you are 46.
Is a career in editing awesome? Yes! Is a career in editing also a total emotional rollercoaster? 1000% yes. I’ve been in trailer editing for 15 years and I still love editing every single day but there are extreme lows that will have you questioning why you got into this because every day you are putting yourself out there to be judged and there’s so little you have control over as to how that’s received. But I love the creativity is editors have in getting to solve problems and work magic. 

Now, the state of the industry right now is its own beast to deal with. Be smart, adaptable, and asses your own willingness for risk.
Ikr
It’s more like those who are happy wont post about it and those who are sad won’t stop posting about it.
Get off Reddit. I’m only here because Reddit recommended this post to me, and I couldn’t help replying. Reddit is filled with a LOT of resentful loser energy. Reddit has this network effect of attracting these certain personalities… Tune it out. Just keep creating and don’t get discouraged. I graduated during the last economic collapse and finding work in the industry felt unimaginable at the time and now I’m the senior editor at a successful creative agency in LA. You’ll figure it out. Just keep going.
Here’s the thing… people who come to Reddit are usually looking for answers. They need community/support. People who are perhaps more successful or out there working full time as editors aren’t really spending time on forums because, well, they don’t have that kind of need. So that creates a disparity. Just like if you go to a bar… you’re not going to find a ton of people from AA. I’m a full time filmmaker, I found a job as a video director with a business a year out of college, I’m mostly self taught, and I worked my way to start my own video business along with my wife. It’s a culmination of years of experience, failure, triumph, and imposter syndrome. I’m not in LA, I’m not doing the “Hollywood” thing, but I never really wanted to. I wanted to tell stories that matter to people, and now have that privilege to do as a career. 

I shoot wedding videos, testimonials for businesses, mini documentaries, and educational content. And unfortunately I don’t have a ton of time to browse Reddit because, well, I’m busy. lol 

Keep working hard, keep developing your craft, stay humble, and never stop learning. You got this.
i am a tv program editor who made SGD8.7k per season. (25min x 13 eps). Will I survive?
its literally filled with the most gatekeeping non supportive people alive
Editing should be your passion and if you don’t need it in your life there are tons of other ways to live your life.
Man, I feel you! It seems like all we see is negativity, and that can drag us down. But remember, every great editor has had their fair share of ‘oops’ moments before they nailed it
I find that being just an editor is bleak. I worked at a podcast studio and found myself excelling at producing and managing shows and now with my own business I do that. I still do a lot of editing but I’m more than just an editor now and that’s okay. Editing is a necessary skill to have but shouldn’t be all that you do
If it makes you feel any better, I’m a full time editor currently on vacation in Japan while still editing for my YouTube clients. I make a steady $4,100 a month from repeat clients and only need to edit about 4-8 hours a day. I’m not making any Netflix documentaries anytime soon, but I am a fast and reliable editor who’s found dream clients. Couple this with being married and splitting all my bills, and I consider myself very successful! If I wanted to work a little harder, I could probably bump it up to 5 or 6k a month but honestly, I’m happy with the work load and pay atm. 
Needless to say, I’m super happy I quit my medical job to pursue editing full time. It’s not all bad for everyone out there!
What I like about this sub is that, if there is a technical issue, you can post and eventually get a response. What I don’t like is the fragmentation that leads to negativity.
You should read more widely! There’s tons of material to depress and discourage out there in the world!
It's a weird industry and there is a lot of doom and gloom going on right now. I know a lot of older editors that aren't getting work at all and it's like the apocalypse for them. However, I've been with them for a good portion of their careers and know that they refused to learn any new skills, push past their comfort zone, and frankly never improved. So a decade later, those editors are obsolete. 

I'm 38 and started my career at 20, so 18 years in. I make anywhere from $95k - $150k per year. Working in Texas. I have a full-time job for a post house that does mostly TV ads and a lot of digital ads these days. Then, I supplement that by doing corporate stuff and a lot of education modules over the last few years because it pays well, theres seemingly infinite work and its super easy with low stress deadlines. From my perspective, the career is going just fine, and I'm still getting busier each year. The key is that the work has never stayed the same. If I had decided that I did this one thing, I'd be broke and probably working some retail job. 

My advice for anyone just starting is keep learning and improving. Don't lock yourself in with software, style, work.
As a 23 year old this is your turn  to turn away and find another career. 57 yo editor out of the business for 10 years. I tried.
I’m a Uk Broadcast editor based in Bristol. I entered the industry in 2006. I have about 12 editor friends of similar experience based between here and London….mostly working in Broadcast but also for streamers. 

We are ALL working and have done this past year. We ALL have work booked in for 2025.
The truth is that editing, just like any creative professional work, takes time to establish a career. What type of editor do you want to be? A film editor? Look for short film directors to gain experience. Commercial editor? Edit a spec commercial. Learn videography and film a commercial yourself or for a local business (even if it’s on your free time for little pay). The reality is that the best editors in the industry aren’t at risk of losing work, even now. They are still actively sought out. Same with writers, same with directors, and cinematographers, and so on. Focus on building a portfolio, even if it’s an hour a day while you take a day job. I’m getting paid work as a film editor working for a local director, but it took a few years of working a non-industry job and doing free editing work on the side before anything came of it. A lot of people in this sub, myself included, are still young and are learning and growing as editors. Just because you might not have editing work now doesn’t mean you can’t have a career in the future. Focus on your weaknesses, build a portfolio. We got this!
Miracles can happen. I'm currently editing for a marketing company based in Dubai, and THEY approached me out of no where lol. I think my website looks ok, but can probably be better. I'm only kicking myself at the moment because I could have probably charged them more with the current project I'm doing for them.

A bit of a side note - I don't know if this is my saving grace but having grown up with low self esteem and some "outsider" complex, I never believed I was able to break into the legacy entertainment industry in the UK, and never did thus far. However, always having that feeling it was a "closed shop" to me allowed me to have different expectations and broaden my horizon to different types of markets. 

For once I actually feel like things are headed in the right direction, and not expecting I would have a "sexy" career is actually kind of paying off for the time being.
As a 23 year old editor you are a tadpole and therefore don't know true pain yet.

Don't worry.  You will.

This sub is honestly not even bad.  LMAO.
By reading a lot of comments I can only come to the conclusion that:

- if an AI steals your job it probably means that you suck at it.

- in an era where video is king and you can’t fin work…well, I guess you suck at your job.

Improve, get better, be more interesting.
What exactly is the issue?
At this point that subreddit is 50% “which skills do I put on resume for non industry professions” and 50% “we just have to survive till 2025”
And r/vfx
Or /r/vfx - the vfx industry has totally imploded.
💯
Ya i unsubbed from it. It was so negative
😭😂😭😂
All of em are bad news. Check out the hopelessness over at r/vfx as well. 

Most commercial art will eventually be replaced by AI.
I like your term “what part you *fall into* “
Seems rather apt. Life and career can take you in directions.
Good advice. I work finance as a producer. Things get hard but it’s not the same as the majority of opinions here. I’m permanent, so salaries aren’t as high as some contract/freelance fees, but I have pvt medical & other benefits, if I get sacked I will get a severance package, and I’m always earning every month consistently.

Further to this, I got into production for the joy of it, almost accidentally as it was just an interest that grew. I liked making things. These days, if ever I get disillusioned or jaded because the work is boring, I’ll take on some portfolio work or enter an editing competition or something. Just flex to remember I enjoyed this for myself once and still do.

Industry is governed by corporate interests and untethered avarice. It takes a lot to be ensure this doesn’t affect how I feel about the craft. Also, gig economy practitioners have been living lavida loca, lavish. It’s no surprise that bubble burst.
I agree with this.
Well said. There's a massive disconnect between this sub and the actual path I'm on, I feel like most of us that are "real" editors have forged unique paths that no one else walks precisely the same. At the same time we're just one in a million, but still.
Roguelike huh? I like it
Even if I was going to be an editor I would have gone to business school.
As editor of 14 years I agree with this
Well put.
This is the correct response.
Exactly this.
Do we have better b-roll? 
Bahahahha. Brilliant. Thank you for the giggles. I’m in a room with two other editors reading this post and busted out laughing. Thank you. They thank you too.
This is what happens when you don't use a proxy workflow
I’d turn it off and back on again first
You need to have more fun with it
No
Pretty much the same boat. Sorry to hear it and good luck in the future.
So you can’t adapt right? The only thing you know is shitty television?
Honestly, this is not even bad.    
  
Try working in other industries.

As rocky as it is, at least we don't run the risk of death by injury or worse.  Poverty sucks, but at least it's temporary with our skill sets.
This ^^^
I'm trying to discern if it's editing or reddit specifically.
Really fascinating stuff, thank you for sharing! Hope you enjoyed your stay in the *other* editor subreddit
I can't tell you how many times I've had people ask what I do and when I respond, "I'm an editor" they think I'm a copy editor. I once got a free Kindle out of the misunderstanding.
But on the bright side(?), in the UK we’ve gone from 75% of the industry out of work last year to ONLY 54% out of work, so…
Amazing story. This is what we need to hear more of
So happy for you dude :)
This.

But most people really just suck or can’t find alternatives…in an era where video is everywhere.

Somehow it makes me laugh.
How did you get the pharmaceutical client and your other clients without marketing yourself? Especially when you’re first starting?
Fantastic! People on this sub sometimes just need to go outside and breathe. Get off Reddit
How do you market yourself? (Asking for advice for myself lmao ✋🏿😭)
As a staff editor, I have first hand knowledge that my employers don't give a shit if you're good or not. They keep giving more work to people they know and people they've worked with before.

Everyone should just stop complaining about NLE problems and focus on networking and being more likeable.
Oh yeah, tons of people are out of work because they're negative. Thanks for pointing this out.
Totally agree!
Touché
nah I think I'll stick with this
Solid advice right there!
Back in the day, I thought being just good at one thing would cut it. Then I ended up learning some visual effects and AI skills just to keep up—and because who doesn't like the idea of being indispensable? Think of it as creating your own superhero editor persona. Diversifying skills isn't just smart, it makes this whole ride more fun too!
[TheSuckZone_Twister_PhilipSeymourHoffman.gif](https://tenor.com/b12Hu.gif)
No, this thread is not elitist, it’s reflecting the state of the entertainment industry.
Sorry if you find that annoying.
So do the rest of us who have lost their careers.
I bet your pardon! This is not elitist. This is the way this sub and editing is right now. There is NOTHING ELITIST about not being able to pay bills and feed your kids when you've put your heart and soul into your craft, something you genuinely love to do, for 30 years and now your job goes to some fucking pipsqueak who's willing to do a gig for $100 because he's still living with Daddy. Nah... That not elitist.

Now for OP: You can ask questions here and get some really good answers. There's no lack of experience in these threads. Prolly some of the best real working editors in the business. But please understand that everybody here is ruined pretty raw by the current state of the edit world. Good luck going forward.
okay, as someone who tends to work in an area of editing most "elitists" would snub, it's also very hard. even "non elitist" spaces I've seen are hiring less than half the people they were before, at least from my reckoning. yes, it's not all doom and gloom, because someone somewhere is getting hired. but to dismiss the concerns of experienced people in the field as "elitist" without looking at the merits of it is its own kind of elitism.
Same, but for a healthcare company. Can get boring at times, but it's steady work with good benefits. Can't complain about that!
I like my job. Idk if I could do anything that isn't film/video related.
Do you mind me asking how do you find YouTube clients?
Suck d*€£s till ‘26.
I feel like all these subs are now just YouTube editors
Just curious…what’s gonna change in 2025? Lol
Tf is gonna happen in 2025?
Long time coming for that
Very much the truth.
Underrated advice.
Do we have one where she’s actually smiling?
The shots out of focus, can you do something about that
I turned my clips offline and online and nothing happened
Adapt to what?
When literally 90% of the folks running the networks have been terminated, and those same networks and platforms have drastically cut the amount of shows they are releasing per year, as well as the promotion for those shows, which was my industry here in NYC. 
And it’s not just me whining, all my friends who are editors and audio engineers and producer/writers are literally out of work- seemingly for good. 
A good friend of mine who worked at HBO is working retail in New Jersey right now. an executive producer friend who I have won awards with now works in her doctors office so she doesn’t lose her house.
I could go on, but it would sound like I’m exaggerating. 
And by the way, I’m not embellishing in the least. 
For every editor position announced on LinkedIn, they get over 200 applications and end up hiring the poor sap for a lower rate than they would have three years ago.
It's the worst time most of us have seen in our careers, it will rebound a little eventually but not before a lot of people lose everything.
Nope. It's editing.
Remember the first edit is for you. Every version after that is for the client/paycheck.
The editors who are still gainfully employed probably have less time to post on Reddit
Plenty of people are doing well, but don't want to peacock publicly because so many others are struggling. 

Editing, like pretty much any career in media and entertainment, is driven by hits and has extremely uneven outcomes. While a lot of people are getting wiped by the downturn, others are dong great. 

You're only 23, so go make a try of it. My biggest tip is the traditional ladders to building a career are broken because people aren't moving up or retiring. 

Side step that by immediately working as an editor and build relationships with rising filmmakers. The people "paying their dues" will end up working under you if your relationships build into a career.
It's definitely editing.  Congrats fuckbag, you get to sit in a chair and make so much money it'd make a homeless person cry while hating your life and enjoying your work. Now go make something pretty that only .05% of the population is capable of.
A little from track v1, and a little from v2.

The audio is already mixed in with the music track and we don't have the split masters anymore.
I've seen this trend in many different job related subs.
It's 70% Reddit lol this website is full of mostly miserable people who come online to complain and have their complaints validated. Don't read too much into it
1000% its reddit
Reddit :)
Where did you get this info?
If enough people leave the industry we can get a even lower percentage.
Just networking and word of mouth. I volunteered for some intern work at a sports academy with the idea that it would give projects to work on that I could then share to show case my abilities. 

After a few weeks of that I started doing paid work for various companies that sponsored the sport academy. Then a new sponsor came in that was also in talks with a production company that were starting a low budget tv show. Through networking I got friendly with the dop of the show and got a gig as an assistant editor. Later on I would go on full time with that production company shooting and editing.

The after a few years of that I decided that I needed to pivot and I started freelancing. Through networking again I got connected with a internal marketing manager at a pharmaceutical company. I understood what the opportunity meant as a way of earning good money so I bent over backwards to deliver a quality product. That was over 10 years ago. Some years I would get 1-2 months of work off them other years 4-6 months. 

I got connected with a few big agencies in Sydney that after only a few projects gave me 10-20+ new contacts. That lead to the two tv shows I now edit. 

Whenever I'm seeing a big gap in the calendar I simply start calling people out of the list of so many contacts that I have acquired over the years. I'm not calling to ask for work. I'm calling to genuinely connect and see how they are doing, chat about new trends and gear or to ask for a recommendation on something. There are lots of people in the industry and youre not relevant if your not constantly reminding people that you are there. And it works both ways. When I'm too busy I always have people that I have built a great working relationship, that I trust, that I can rely on.
All cool and all, unless your reality is much worse than what’s on Reddit. And that’s the case for many people. Downplaying their struggle is just wrong.
What kind of edits do you usually do? Do you have a typical client of client? Do you have a portfolio ?
> NLE problems and focus on networking and being more likeable

legitimately I've been working on this ever since I realised like 90% of the job posts list every major NLE anyway
I've seen people with jobs that imo have no business having, but because they're friendly and likeable they find work.
Get used to working with a bunch of cranky jaded curmudgeons! There MIGHT be some fun along the way
Definitely have a strong backup plan in place at least. Video work in 2024 is starting to feel like the music industry. Like yeah there’s still a few making good money at it, but for most it’s becoming a pipe dream.
Got laid off after seven years at the same company as the senior editor. I have been ghosted by every recruiter and interviewer this summer, it’s dire.  I still love editing, and have found passion in my solo content creation, but really trying to understand how I went from making six figures to potentially having to apply at McDonald’s. It’s scary for us older peeps right now. At least your the age of the people we’re all getting replaced with. Good luck 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
I hear you. When I decided I wanted to marry my girlfriend, now wife of 32 years, we sat down and figured out what I was good at. Everything pointed towards television. I dropped into editing for the sheer love of it. Editors were always the coolest guys. And it fit well with my personality and skill set. Now that I'm faced with needing to do something different for a living, nothing Else good. And shuffling shit around at Walmart doesn't even come close to paying bills.
I took a local acting class and found people in need. Lots of writers and performers with no editors in sight. Word of mouth basically. Online I’ve found 0 results, even with millions of views under my belt.
Time to work at 7-11 in '27
I’ve been saying “Eat a dick till 26”

Same thing. Hahaha.
5 bucks is 5 bucks
People will post about surviving till 2026
Nothing
I think Hale Bopp is gonna do a 180 so drink the koolade and remain cool.
We are loving the flow of it. Can we try a different music though?
Re-import? 🤷‍♂️
All of my "fucks given" have been offline for a while now.
To put it briefly, by adapt they really mean completely change careers: become a full on content specialist, or working for pennies on upwork and YouTube. 
careful now, you might spoil a 23 year old's buzz with all this gloomy reality chat. rainbows and unicorns please
Serious shortage in the UK of EVS/sport replay ops, if anyone wants an idea for retraining in a closely related job
People who don’t have the capacity to find a way won’t. People who are resourceful and can find a way don’t lose ‘everything’ - they learn to hold onto what matters.
I want to get this comment printed, framed, and put over my desk as a reminder.
This is the way
From BECTU, though it’s actually 52% not 54%:

https://bectu.org.uk/news/three-quarters-of-uk-film-and-tv-workers-currently-out-of-work-bectu-survey

https://bectu.org.uk/news/half-of-uk-screen-industry-workers-remain-out-of-work-bectu-research-finds
Ha, yeah, I did question that! Though in my experience, it really does seem to be picking up!
I'm not downplaying anyones struggle. All I'm saying is that this sub paints a different picture to what is possible.
>cranky jaded curmudgeons

We've turned into the soundtrack composers we always would complain about being cranky and jaded.
Stick wid it till twinty sixt
That’s how I got my start in the industry. I was an intern for the local NBA team and their in-arena production team just bought an EVS and needed people to learn how to use it. I was the main EVS guy for like 5 years after that. It really is editing on the fly, I would have 5-10 sequences of highlights going at anytime and manage content coming in nonstop.
How would one go about this…?
Yeah they're just losing their homes and careers, nothing important....
well yeah, many of them do it by doing not editing when times are hard, which is definitely resourceful, but.. this is an editing subreddit, so ... the doom and gloom is a little understandable.
Well if THAT's your attitude....you'll be fine. Welcome.
I mean, sure, but suffering and seeing no results is also possible. Reading up on someone’s success story when you can’t make anything work for months/years can be more depressing than motivating, while seeing others also have it hard can be validating. To each their own I guess, I just don’t like telling people to “get off reddit” as a magic pill solution
As with any part of this business, network. Befriend and shadow an EVS op. Find a local sport broadcaster/OB company and see if they have any wee jobs going. Try to get into live streaming/Vmix stuff which can also get you relevant experience
You don't lose your career because the way you thought is was going to go isn't happening. You lose your career because you stop pursuing it. The experience and contacts they have don't go away just because the current environment is bad. It's still possible to stay in contact, do some sort of work, even if they have to produce it themselves, while they find alternative incomes to bridge this time frame. 

Losing one's home is a matter of financial strategy. If you live off what you make, you aren't prepared for the vagaries of the business, whether you own or not. I was counseled to have one year's expenses in the bank before I started freelancing. I didn't wait that long, but I have always maintained as much 'say no to bad jobs' money as I could, and it served me very well especially when the tide went out.  When I got aged out and eventually sold the home I raised my kids in, it made me a lot of money, and paid for exploring the choices available to me. 

Identifying yourself by your employer, or your property, instead of your skills and your family is not conducive to a long arc of satisfaction nor peace of mind.  I am not suggesting these are trivial issues, but I am saying there is a constructive context in which to view current circumstances. Anyone who can figure out the complexities of constructing a documentary story from a bunch of random footage can construct a better narrative for themselves than this. 

I highly recommend looking at what is growing, how that sector uses moving pictures and tap that. THe money may not be as good, but it's an application of the editing skill. 

Among the things I did when work was slow- bought and sold sports cars- LA has a crop cheap every fall and lots of people looking for convertibles in the spring.  I also taught a class at the SMCC extension on how to buy a reliable used car. I rented out rooms in my house. It goes on like that. I never stopped checking in with my directors and producers regularly.   
Yes it's hard. No it's not the end of their careers unless they decide to quit.
Yes it is. And it’s not the only response possible.
Firstly reddit is a cesspool for negativity. Getting off it is a very easy task to improve your mental health and same goes for any other social media. 

Secondly you are going to suffer in life no matter what. The only difference between the ones that are content and those that are not is that the former choose something that they are going to suffer for something and over time all that voluntary suffering produces a career or business or home etc that has intense meaning and purpose.

If your suffering and not seeing any results you likely don't have clarity in your goals or maybe your just not cut out for it. If you can't make it work over months or years then it's likely your going to make it work. Brutal but true. 

I suffered a lot to get where I am. I had clear goals to achieve in my early career. I bent over backwards to please clients and had many all nighters to make things work. For 18 months I was terminally ill and had to try to salvage my entire life let alone my career. 

When things are slow share your work on social media. Reach out to people and tell them about what you do. Every single job on earth has a time when they make redundancies. Be better than the people who get made redundant.
Another reason to go outside and breathe and take a break from Reddit. Because it can be depressing, you’re right
Considering you haven't been part of the industry for years and left town a while ago maybe you aren't qualified to discuss the current state of things for la editors.
Well I’m still consulting and have contacts in the industry and my IP is in the market still, so I have current experience as well as having survived several downturns and disruptions as I developed, and the wisdom given me at those times was exactly what worked through those cycles. 
Quit if you like but consider your choices.
I'm working on a feature at one of the majors right now, im just aware how much luckier I am than most people.
It’s not just luck, although that certainly helps. Branch Rickey, who signed Jackie Robinson to the Dodgers, said “Luck is the residue of design”. 
May your good work and luck continue
I edited the Stunt Performers Tribute for last nights Oscar's...
...But they cut it down by almost a full minute the night before. A lot of people pitched in to make this something special (custom music, Ryan Gosling, etc...) and I thought the community might be interested to see the full, uncut version! Two months of work here, hit me with any questions! 💪

[https://vimeo.com/919444061](https://vimeo.com/919444061)
Excellent. I loved the motorcycle cuts
Looks great! While I've been an editor for many years myself, I'm not in the motion picture industry, so there were two things I was wondering about.

  
What does that mean "they cut it down by almost a full minute". If they needed a shorter version of your work - wouldn't you be the best person to create that. Or was it planned and you shared your project files with them? How does stuff like that happen?

Second thing is kinda trivial, but I was wondering how it works with the rights and licensing of those clips for the Oscars? Your tribute video featured many popular films. Would the Oscars need to secure the rights for all of them before that then - or do the Oscars have some universal rights with the companies behind the big movies? Or is it something else entirely.

  
Still, pretty good work! I'm not super interested in stunts but that is a really cool video!
Where did you source all the clips?
Hey! 

I really enjoyed the segment last night. Loved the editing, so its nice to hear from you. 

After seeing your inspiring edit, and them then saying how much the academy appreciated the stunt community, it seemed like we're going to announce a new award. And then it just hung awkwardly and they moved on. That sucked. 

"We love your work. We appreciate your skill. But not enough to dedicate an award to you." 

Did you get to source all the stunt yourself or were you given a list? 

I appreciated all the Bond stunts! Big fan?
That's so cool! Do you work for the Academy or were you hired as a contractor for this edit? This was one of my favorite unexpected bits of the show.

Love the selection of shots, I can't imagine it was easy to narrow down the history of stunts in film to a 1 minute highlight!
Loved it! So much matching, it flowed wonderfully and it all felt right.
Very cool! I thought to myself, I wonder who edited this it’s very well done.
Your tribute was beautiful, and I know it meant a lot to the stunt workers. I wish they would have kept your version, because it's very heartfelt.

Thank you for putting together their first recognition at the Oscars!

I was really excited when I saw it, and I was hoping that after the clip was over they were going to announce a new category for a Stunt Oscar. Sadly they did not, but maybe eventually they will get their full recognition. It has to start somewhere, and thank you for being a part of the catalyst!
Some really tremendous match edits in there. Very cool!
Stunt guy here, love this! They should have shown the whole clip! I mean what’s one more minute!
Great cut!
I really loved this segment! I thought the edit was really heartfelt
Excellent work, thanks for sharing! Did you do any color correcting to make it visually flow better?
Very nice work, didn't see the Oscars but they should have definitely went with your version ;)
So much fun! Great cut.
Was the goal originally to match cut through the video or something they wanted specifically?
So cool. What an amazing bunch of footage to work with!
Love it!!
Thanks for sharing, one of the highlights from the show for me 🙌 Awesome to see the full version, so sorry they cut it, alot of work
great edit man!! the shot selection and flow was on point! 👍🏼
![gif](giphy|l0ErFafpUCQTQFMSk)
Amazing work!  I’m sure there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen on this edit, and you still managed to keep it’s soul. Congrats.
Great job, man.  And thanks for providing the full version.  

I love the transition of various cars corkscrewing through the air to make a full jump out of 4 different sources.  Absolute gold.
This is awesome! Great work.
Really well done. Love the match edits, the pacing and energy. Sounds like you had fun cutting it too. Those are the best gigs!
Great job!
Nicely done!
Since you’re here, I would like to ask you a question. And please don’t take this the wrong way, I’m not criticizing your work here (which is fantastic), I would just like to hear more about what went into choosing the clips involved. Because one of the things we noticed during the broadcast was how few women stunt performers were featured. The cutdown had so few — one stunt from the Matrix with Trinity was featured for sure. This longer version has more and I was happy to see Zoe Bell in there (how she failed to make the broadcast cut is insane to me) but it’s still like 80/20 compared to the male stunt performers featured. I know men have probably done a larger share of the stunts in the industry but they still seem over-represented here. Were you told which movies and clips to pull from, or did you make those choices mostly on your own? I’m just curious.
This is really amazing and definitely love each and every cuts that's blends into the next action scenes almost flawlessly and while giving a story of the years and advancements of stunts from many major movies! Everyone definitely should watch this cut!
Interestingly, what aired is very different (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjlrNxbiyNA)

Curious to know how that was explained to ya, or if you had any input.
One of my favorite moments in the show. Great work!
Nice work
Loved it. This is such juicy editor material to work with its kind of montage porn. But not that kind of porn.
This was so cool! As a die-hard action fan, this was one of my favorite parts of the night! Appreciate you posting the full version - as someone who is leaning towards wanting to edit these kinds of spots/promos it's super cool to be able to analyze it!
Beautiful!
Very well cut. The three shots from Indiana doing the whip swing to the T-Rex coming through the roof is excellent. 
Nice work!!!
congrats homie
I know the Alien community was happy to see it included.
Fantastic tribute!
Excellent work! Sorry they cut the piece down. Folks really missed out on something.
Less Jimmy making bland jokes more stuff like this.
Can you explain your thought process on ending on the jet flyover shot? Even if it is a real jet, it reads more as a CGI jet rather than an actual stunt.  
Incredible cuts! Really loved the one of Indie flying through the air cutting the Jurassic Park, so well done. Congratulations!

Curious how did you find all these clips? Did you have an assistant searching movies or was it all you?
Very cool!
Love some of the match cuts on this one!!!
Could have used a Wilhelm Scream as an easter egg, just saying. Really cool job!  If you chose the clips how did you categorize your choices or go about picking without fear of missing important ones, talk to any stunt historians, etc?
![gif](giphy|11Un64tF2yX8JO)

Looooove it
[deleted]
Who was your contact that got in touch with you about cutting this?
This is amazing.. so the RRR sequence was added after u gave the final.. right.. ?
I just watched the official one and it’s only 20 seconds shorter
This is really cool about the history of stunts and The Fall Guy: [https://quillette.com/2024/05/17/a-history-of-stunts-the-fall-guy-ryan-gosling-emily-blunt/](https://quillette.com/2024/05/17/a-history-of-stunts-the-fall-guy-ryan-gosling-emily-blunt/)
Easy to see why they asked for it to be cut down... it really lags in the middle, and it's a bit strange we see so many wides when we're talking about the *people.*

Is the VO temp? Kinda surprised you don't have more final VO if this was the cut two days ago.
[deleted]
Thanks!
The motorcycle cuts were fire! Outstanding!
Same. The match cuts really stood out in that segment. Great work. And great gig!
Thanks for checking it out!

I handed over my entire project for 'finishing', and due to time constraints/creative direction, they had to rapidly rework it internally. A bummer for sure, but it happens.

Yes, the Academy has to license/clear all the footage used. I created a spreadsheet of every movie I used after we locked the cut, how long each clip was, and a screenshot. They have an amazing clearance team that gets it done somehow. Pretty much everyone wants to be featured in the Oscars, so its never an impasse.
This is live event broadcast. ALL cut-ins are built "fat" (so your limits were given to you with that minute overrun on purpose) for the rare occasion that segments run short. Most times (day before or the day of) a line producer will preview your piece and mark in cuts so your piece doesn't look "butchered". A luxury you want because I've been on shows where they just dump out mid-sentence to make time. While the segment is live ADs will have "back-timed" the whole show, the segment and the hard outs to cue talent. So the playback will either play the whole version or a cut version. This gives everyone else some timing options depending on what they think will run long later in the show. Congratulations, you made it to prime time - no small feat!
It’s the Oscars. I’m pretty sure it was provided either by an archive or the studios themselves.
I'm actually super interested in this myself!
I think its a step in the right direction, who knows what the future holds :)
Thanks so much! I was hired as a contractor by a stuntman friend who was collaborating with the Academy to put this together.
Thanks!! I always say that's sort of all you can hope for 💪
Thank you so much!  


I wish that as well, but I'm grateful to have been a part of it at all :) 

I think big things are coming, but I understand they can't just be adding multiple categories every year.
GO STUNTS! Thanks for watching!!
Thank you! Yeah it was a lot of people who really cared chipping in to make it happen
Thanks so much! I didn't re-color any shots, but I did flip/flopped a few so the matches and shot direction flowed a bit better.
Thank you!! It was a fun edit to flex my random action knowledge on 😆
I appreciate the kind words!!
I had zero input in what happened after I handed off my timelines a few days out from the show. I had two versions, one with a lot more Ryan VO and some BTS (like whats in the final cut) and a longer one like what you see here. They sort of smushed them together and pulled out a bunch of runtime, while adding those opening beats... I *personally* preferred the version I shared here :)

Sure! I was asked to 'absolutely unequivocally feature Top Gun: Maverick' in some capacity, and I thought it was one of the more 'grounded' moments in the whole movie as it features the literal ground in it (and jets next to real people, one of which is a stunt double for Ed Harris). It's an unbelievably expensive and complicated shot that wouldn't have been possible without the stunt community.

It also plays long (which is rare in action stuff) allowing me to fade out nicely, and has a great sense of finality to it. 

Also, the shot was achieved practically. While they definitely ***replaced*** the jet digitally, the plate and impact of the shot was all captured practically. You can see them doing practice runs here: [https://youtu.be/KMbBh2CxUOw?si=jtHkawTCvwjJFvyT&t=226](https://youtu.be/KMbBh2CxUOw?si=jtHkawTCvwjJFvyT&t=226)
Thank you!! Its crazy how many people like that SPECIFIC cut.

On the first day of the project, an assistant and I spent a day thinking of our favorite stunts/action scenes and creating a 2+ hour long string out.

I then spent the next two months culling them down, finding new ones, and trying different combinations.
And to answer your question directly, the video above is 100% my own editorial and producer work, created over two months working with the stunt community and the academy, with two notable academy members serving as quarterbacks.  I also worked with the insanely talented composer, Dom Lewis @ Formosa on the kick ass custom cue that makes the cut so great!

The gap between what went to air and the above cut is what I presume OR did. 
Ask HB who's project file, music, copy, VO, and all other finalized media he received last week, that ought to solve the mystery for you right quick :)
A freelance client of 10 years who is also an academy member.
Thank you! Correct.
Lol, Ryan doesn't do Temp VO. Thanks for checking it out!
bit rude there, pal.

besides— most stunts play out in a wide, fight scenes excepted.
Thanks for checking it out 🙏
This comment was sloppy and like an 80% fit as well.
Oh wow that's super cool! And yeah, it makes a lot of sense that a show like the Oscar's got an own team for that. Great job again!
Out of curiosity, where did you source all the footage?
Good post. The best solution is when the network agrees to "droppable content" in the commericla break. Like if they're willing to drop 60 seconds of promo content split over the last two breaks to make time. Its a challenge to coordinate between the on site mobile and master control, but it's all connected anyway.
You would be *shocked*. Guarantee that at least half of these were pirated or ripped from YouTube then rights acquired once the creatives involved confirmed they'd be used in the final cut.
I wouldn't be so quick to presume that
Just realised your username. Ha! That explains all the Bond stunts!
It's funny - watching the two cuts, I feel like I can hear the instructions the editor got to make the cuts and how they ended up where they got.
Thanks for the wonderful response!  Glad to get some insight into others' workflows.
Lol, don't have a dog in this fight but that fucking sucks. This town is the worst sometimes, and you're handling it well.
Lol I didn't even realize Gosling was the VO at first. I agree that it sounds like a temp VO I'd use on a rip reel pitch, but that's not on you. And shit, it's Ryan Gosling. Great edit though, I didn't think it dragged, and the shot selection and continuity edits were great. Of course there are a lot of wides... they're stunt performers, and "hiding" that it's not the actors themselves is part of movie making. Thanks for sharing!
Yeah lol, it's kinda the whole point of stunts, the spectacle. This was great dude, some real nice matches. I love that it's all straight cuts too, classy.
[deleted]
That was my question too.  Did a producer bring him a drive with a million clips and let him pick?
Ty. Too. Many. Years. On the receiving end of the RTS comm party line.
I worked as an AE at a place that worked on a lot of sizzle reels for studios and this is exactly what we did. Ripped a lot of Blu-Ray or downloaded the clips from YouTube.
Possibly for temp in early cuts, but we usually replace these before finishing.
I would presume exactly that. Why go begging when you can rip a YT clip in seconds
It honestly was hard to not make it 90% a Fast and Furious/Bond/Mission Impossible/John Wick tribute

Thanks dog, appreciate that 💪
> I agree that it sounds like a temp VO I'd use on a rip reel pitch

What about his VO sounds temp? Not challenging your opinion, just really curious on what stuck out to you so I can sharpen my own ear.
Not at all! I appreciate anyone who takes the time to watch my work and share a thought 
They probably had full length submission masters for each film
(how do you download clips from YT nowadays?)
Yep. We've done stuff for major networks where the network's show we were cutting stuff for had to be pirated because we couldn't wait for them to send their archived masters.
Nowhere near as often as you'd think.
You know the Xbox One Sylvester Stallone ads from 2014? I cut those and every clip was ripped from Youtube which I thought was hilarious.
Because of quality. I've worked on less known awards shows and part of the submission process is having a high quality broadcast ready clip available. Thats more for nominated films than special content. 

In the OPs case, they are licensing usage with the rights holders. This isn't a one day turn-around. There's absolutely time to get the better quality clips.
[deleted]
Yeah! What's your personal favourite? 

For me it's the tank driving through the statue in Goldeneye. And then the whole sequence after that. Was that in the cut? I can't remember?
To me, his read just doesn't match the energy of the cut. The shots are grandiose and action-packed and the music + sfx are epic, so I'd expect more of a movie trailer VO. Instead, the read sounds almost bored or somber.
JDownloader 2 baby
I’ve been using 4K Video Downloader
Shutter encoder has a video download function, for free without any resolution limits. Hasnt let me down in years.
Use OBS Studio to record the Youtube Window that's playing.
Not the Oscar’s of course but it’s embarrassing how many watermarks for free YouTube downloaders and “media pending” slates I’ve seen on national broadcast TV
We’ve done it both ways at my agency. When it’s a super cut for a brand like Amazon prime that wants to feature certain shows yes we get proxies of their online masters with audio splits. 

But when we are spitballing creative we rip YT all the time and if it makes the edit, request back for the source. 

Either way it’s fine for rough cuts until you uprez for finals
ofc YT is horrible quality we'd never use it in finals that's crazy. for RnD and creative rough cuts it's just fine. We do it all the time
Bond shots that were in the edit at some point in the process: 

Goldeneye: dam jump, tank-thru-building

Casino Royale: crane jump, Aston crash, jump from airplane stairs to fuel truck 

Skyfall: motorcycle off bridge in Istanbul

NTTD: SUV's and Motorcycles jumping off hill, Motorcycle Jump in Italy

The man with the golden gun: Corkscrew Car flip
I see what you mean now - you're talking about the direction and mood of the read, not the technical aspects of it.
thanks!
this is great to know...
awesome, thanks
Does that record the entire contents of the tab (like a screen recording software) or does it isolate the video stream? I've used OBS for recording Skype streams for video podcasts, but haven't tried it for something like this.
The original corkscrew car jump is so much better without the corny slide whistle sound effect. It made that jump such a throwaway.
It has different options, so it might have something just to get the stream, but I'm not sure. "Window" I believe gets the whole thing with tabs and all. I think there is a custom option to draw your own viewing window though.
Thanks - I might try and explore this next time instead of monosnap to see if it's any easier.
Do you ever feel weird or a bit creepy because of how intimately you know an actor's face from editing, even though they have no idea you exist?
It has happened to me a couple of times that I encounter an actor in public and feel like I want to say hi, then remember its all one sided and they have no idea I exist. (Obviously with non famous actors).

It's like, I know every muscle of their face. I analyze them for hours and hours. Zooming in, zooming out. Listening, paying attention.

I know this is not something deep or anything, but I think its still fun to discuss this with fellow editors :)

Do you ever feel weird about it? Any thoughts or interesting experiences? I'd love to hear from you!
Feels even weirder when you’re a documentary editor! Lot of vulnerable moments
Yeah film premieres can be odd. 

Actor: Hey you’re the editor? Great job! So glad to finally meet you!

Editor: Yeah you too! Hope you get that weird mole on your arm that you kept picking at checked out soon. Also how’s that foundation repair on your house going? You know the one you called and checked every break while you were still mic’d?
Face? I work in reality tv. Some shows I’ve worked on, I’ve seen the entire cast having sex. You just don’t mention it at the after party.
So story time.  I made trailers for the Tomb Raider 2013 video game starring the voice talent of Camilla Luddington. And we were leaning into this one scene where Lara Croft is ice climbing up a sheer cliff face and there’s an avalanche. 

So we are cutting the trailer and we realize we need effort sounds for Lara Croft whacking her ice axe in and getting battered about by the avalanche. 

So the studio sends me what must have been the entire library of Camilla Luddington grunting, softly crying, moaning and yelping. I’m talking 100 sound files. 

Just… me and Camilla, in the edit bay, making selects, looking for that perfect grunt.
Not actors, but I've met folks before after having edited hours and hours of footage of them. I always need to remind myself to reel back my sense of familiarity with them.

Sometimes, if they're especially savvy to the process, I'll tell them that I might seem overly familiar because I've edited footage of them, and they catch on just fine.
Yeah, sometimes I’ll see someone I edited in public and have to hold myself back from going “I edited a video with you in it!”

I also find myself making the same expressions as the talent lol, if they are laughing I will have a smile on my face.
I worked on a show where a producer guest starred in one episode. So not only were we cutting his scenes, he was sitting in the edit bay for hours on end, and naturally I was pretty familiar with the sound of his voice.  

Months later I was watching an old episode of the X-Files and a scene came on where a character is breathing heavily off screen. Just from his breathing sounds I recognized my producer, and before I knew it, there he was on screen, some 20 years younger. Super weird!  

From experience, people don't often take too well to hearing that you feel like you know them intimately because you spent hours editing them :')
I had a similar moment. I cut a couples wedding but didn't film the event. Saw them on the street and said hello and they were nice but it wasn't until I was walking away I realised they would have absolutely no idea who I was haha
Yeah, I edit a show about a baseball team. Finally met all the players and coaches in person about a year into the project. I knew all their hopes and dreams, their inside jokes, etc. It was very weird for them to introduce themselves since I felt like I already knew them.
I feel trusted, almost like a doctor,  but I am worried about the freaks out there. I have seen nudity on more than one occasion and know that I can be trusted with these images that the actors and actresses have trusted me with, but what if they were in someone else’s hands on their editing timeline? Those are usually the first thoughts that enter my mind. I love our craft and on occasion have reached out to actors I have never met before to say things like “you have no idea how easy you’ve made my job” - just to have some sort of connection to someone I’ve been so connected to through the job we do.
I actually had a very big name actor freak out and not want to talk to me because he knew I was editing his movie and he was insanely creeped out by it. 

He specifically avoided editors for the reasons you’re stating. 
100%! I’ve had so many moments where I instinctively think I’ve spotted a friend, and kind of give them a look of recognition, only to quickly wind it back as I realise I actually don’t know them at all. I must seem insane…
Lol this thread came right in time.. 

I just came across a bunch of stock footage in Artlist of a girl who was in MY first ever music video when I was a wannabe artist 12 years ago; as in she acted in the video (one epic part was she lay across a white grand piano while I played it lol).

Fast forward 12 years later and here I am finding stock footage of her jogging in parks, industrial estates and looking at panoramic views of cities. I wouldn't say it's creepy as such, but more of a Black Mirror type of vibe.. kind of like how we converged again after all these years but under different circumstances, where I can now download her likeness (for several pennies or however much the royalties pay out) without her ever knowing of me again.
Colorist who does beauty work - yes.  “Hi, I smoothed out every pore on your face for tens of hours and contributed to the impossible beauty standards women (and men) face in society because a creative director was certain you’d want look “younger””.    It’s a great opener lol. /s
I’ve cut shows with celebs but, as you say yourself, that is different.  

With the less famous presenters, if I work on something long-term, these not-very-famous-people-at-all loom increasingly larger in my mind, so that meeting them at WRAP parties etc can feel like meeting Taylor Swift or someone, lol!

Amusing anecdote; I worked on a big car scrapping series once, with a team of five other editors (we made 3 ‘hours’ each, or something).
Me and a couple of the guys were sitting in a line in a pub, at the closing party, when we found ourselves opposite one of the mechanics featured in the show. We all behaved so oddly, waving hi, and trying to attract his attention (we’d had a few by this time) that, in the end he just leaned over and said…

“You’re the *editors* on this, aren’t you?”
This gets brought up at every premiere or cast/crew screening.  

Recently, I was at a premiere party, and had to find an actress to tell her that it was such a pleasure to edit her scenes.  She was a true pro.  She said that was just about the best compliment she could get.  

It’s also weird seeing cast in another show, and feeling like you’re seeing an old friend.  Sometimes I wonder how they got a big role.  Then I remember, we make them look their best.
100%. The people I make videos about are not famous, but I still have to stop myself from saying hi to them because I forget we didn't actually work together.
This has happened to me MANY times.
I directed & edited a longish short film, which went to be included in an anthology feature. I took forever to assemble. Seeing my main actress, I’d worked with her for a couple of weekends on set, and 3 years on my screen. Incredibly odd parasocial relationship.
I relate, we have to stare at the same images over and over and it does get ingrained. I have never felt creepier than when I was in a Sephora in LA and an employee who’d been in their holiday campaign I had cut the year before came out of nowhere asking if I needed assistance. Instead of explaining this to the very beautiful woman, I just stood there not speaking and staring at her blankly with my mouth in a weird oh face till she smiled and said she’d let me enjoy browsing. Then my dumb ass followed her around the store awhile because I couldn’t believe it was her (all while never saying a thing because I was in shock)- she’d been our favorite in the ad because we couldn’t believe she was a real employee her performance was so good.
When I started my career I found work cutting wedding videos on the side. I remember one of them featured a singer, who appeared to be friends with the groom. He seemed to be an amateur, as in, he wasn't a singer by trade, but could sing. He sang a few numbers, all of which were cut into the longer video. There were a few angles, so I spent a decent amount of time on those segments.

I saw the dude a year later at an event. It was bizarre. It honestly shook me more than some actual celebrity sightings I've been privy to.
I worked on a piece of crap show for Fox Nation last year with some high profile older actors. One of the was a total asshole to the makeup crew. Never will I look at them in the same light again. That’s weird I suppose.
My problem is I become too familiar with their face and how their mouth moves frame by frame that I stare at their mouths when I meet them irl
Wow, i really love hearing all these stories, i work as an offline and online editor, whenever i see some talent/actor in real life it felt weird that i used to spend hours touching-up their skin or even replacing their teeth because the client didn’t like the way her teeth look when she smile.
At the wrap party:

"Hi, you don't know me but I sit in a dark room watching you for hours"
When I was editing my first feature, I ran into the lead actor outside a theater.  I greeted them enthusiastically, only remembering much later that they had no goddamn idea who I am.  In my defense, I was pretty high.
Yes it’s a very common experience when an editor meets a cast member after the editing process. Happened to me several times.
Yes it happens to me constantly especially when working on long interviews. I know wayyy to much about people who don't even know I exist lmfao
yes. I used to edit weddings and it was so weird spending a week with them, seeing their sisters-brothers-parents cry and seeing their first looks and just getting to know them through all these really intimate, vulnerable moments. And then when they physically came to get their USB or DVD I'd have to stop myself being like "Omg, hows your grandma?" when i wasn't even at the wedding and they have no idea who I am.
I haven’t noticed this with editing, but whenever I DP, I’m often flattering how the actors look. I usually start noticing the nuanced beauty in how actresses look since I’m staring at them on set through a monitor a lot of the time, making sure the light falls off their face the way that i want. I wouldn’t say that i feel creepy though, especially since I introduce myself to them and crack jokes on set that make everyone laugh. I’m just another person in the crowd
All artists are perverts of some sort or another, and all people are voyeurs -- that's why we like films in the first place. Embrace your odd side, it's good :)
When I see a person in real life that I’ve been editing, I usually get excited and think, “SWEET, I’m seeing new content that isn’t the same shots I’ve been looking at for weeks over and over again!!! This is great!” 

Seriously though, watching a persons details closely on a screen and noticing how they emphasize words, their mannerisms, and everything about them almost feels more intimate than sex.
I work in a restaurant. There was a regular at the bar who would come and chat with the bartender about this movie he had produced 10 years previous, but they never finished post. The bartender finally told him he could edit it. The guy took him up on the offer. The bartender asked me to help with some VFX and putting a trailer together. Near the end of this process one of the stars came in to eat. I initially wanted to run over to her and talk to her about her performance and her life and how exciting it was that this movie was finally going to be released. Luckily I caught myself and realized she doesn’t know me, I don’t actually know her, and she probably gave up on this terrible movie ever seeing the light of day years ago.

More recently I was editing a trailer for a short film with another regular who I know pretty well and have worked with on various things in the past. Even actually knowing him I had to remind myself that he hasn’t been hanging out with me as much as I’ve been hanging out with him.
I embarrassed myself on my first wrap show as assistant editor by getting a little razzled, spotting one of the talent and going “hey, I see you everyday”. They’d never met me, hadn’t known about me, and it just looked like I was the creepiest fan ever haha.
All the time. And then when you meet them it’s really awkward.
I was working on a docuseries that featured one cornerstone interview in every episode. Six months after it wrapped, I'm at a comic con with my kids, and I hear a familiar voice wafting through the convention hall. Turns out, he's on stage nearby, participating in a panel about the same exact topic I was editing. Very strange feeling.
In film theory there is an idea that filming is voyeuristic and predatory by nature. Hitchcock was a good example.
I think about this idea all the time. I was editing a movie my friend directed and acted in, but he lives in Hawaii so I only see him like twice a year. But in editing this, I felt like I was spending every day for like a month with him. 
As a band photographer, I have said this to a musician I have shot a bunch, but never actually met until I decided to tell him I feel like I know him from editing. He didn't seem to take it well. I'll keep those feelings to myself now.
yeeeeaaaah I might have gone up to an actor (or three) at an after party and started with the words "nice to see you again" only to realise instantly they have never met me before.... definitely adding to the creepy....
I’ve worked with Will Arnett so many times and he’s never seen my face. 😁
Oh yeah. I used to edit videos for Radio Disney. Really upped the creepy feeling because they were all teenage stars I watched grow up from my edit bay. Then I’d meet them in real life and feel this intimate connection to their lives, but they don’t know me at all. Very strange feeling.
I was at a screening for a short film I’d edited when I ran into the lead actress. I said hello and chatted for about half a minute before I realized we’d never met in person.
Yes! I have made the mistake of saying hi to some actors in the momentary belief I knew them from school or something (because I was so intimate with their faces for months.)
I cut a few episodes of a web show for BET, and felt like I knew the hosts after a while. 

Like over the course of a few months I see them getting set up for the interview and see how they are when they aren’t fully “on,” and learn their idiosyncrasies and how you’ll likely have to cut for them (one host always had interesting facial expressions that made for great reaction shots for example). I guess it’s natural to feel like you know them. 

It might be a little awkward to bring up in the wrong way, but it’d be cool to actually meet them at some point
I've said "Hi!" to people I've stared at for hundreds of hours and then am startled when they don't react like I'm a family member. Then I remember. I don't actually know them.
This happened to me once with a student film (but an older, non-student actor) and I actually greeted the actor as if I knew her before I realized she wouldn’t know me. She was so confused, but then was extremely flattered, because being not famous she never got recognized. I think it was a really nice moment for her.
Living in a town with a small film community, I would often run into actors I’d edited at parties and other friends’ premieres. Usually they were talking to someone I know so it wasn’t super awkward. But always had to remind myself we’d never met when I see the look of unfamiliarity in their eyes.

On a similar note, it was always interesting being at parties and realizing people who had both worked on many of the same projects had never met. Usually other people in post and actors or crew. I once introduced an actor and composer who had probably five shared credits.
I once worked on an extensive ad campaign where the majority of footage was a few actors doing improv that went way off script.  I got to know them so well through the many hours of (hilarious) riffing, and running footage. The next week, one of the actors was playing on my team in a night league (friend of a friend apparently). Anyway, I was talking to him like we were old acquaintances  the entire night, starting with “Hey good to see you again”.  Eventually it clicked where I knew him from, and that he guy never seen me before. I tried to explain my weirdness after I realized my error, but then it felt even more awkward.
all the time. but i never meet them in the real world. i also have Borderline personality disorder which complicates a lot of things
I have, but I mainly edit archive footage, so most of the time these people are either dead, or really old, meaning there's a very slim chance I'd ever meet them in person. But yeah, it is an awkward perspective to some degree.
As an editor going through a lonely period of their life, I find this one way intimacy pretty cruel. It’s not just actors, directors/writers too.
That's why when I meet them I make sure to get a good sniff in as well to complete the circle of being a sick fuck
I used to work on a weekly segment for a show, always with the same presenter and I mostly worked remotely. 


I was in studio once and saw the presenter and we just started chatting - I completely forgot that we'd never actually met and she was very confused. I had to sheepishly explain I edited that segment and forgot we'd never actually met. 
It was during the pandemic too, so she actually was one of the only few faces I actually saw in a week! 


We ended up getting on quite well though, so that was nice! 
Big time. Especially when you also interact with them on occasion.
Yes!!! My first gigs were weddings and more than once I would see a bride or groom out in the world and go “hey it’s insert name here!” But realize they had no idea who I was.
I'm an actor and an editor, I know I exist :)
Have you seen Michael Mann’s “Manhunter” based on the novel “Red Dragon” by Thomas Harris? 

Set in the age of 8mm film, the theme is something along the line you allude to. It includes the first appearance of a certain Hannibal Lecter.

You won’t feel any less weird 😏
Got onto a plane one time and the guy sitting next to me looked super familiar. We chatted for a few minutes and he mentioned that his band was playing the grand old Opry. ‘Oh, that’s why I know you. I just finished editing your set on a different music show.’ whipped out my MacBook and showed him the edit. It was a funny moment.
I spent a few months editing some weddings that a friend of mine shot. There was one couple who had ordered the full package—full videos of the ceremony, toasts, everything. This was my first and only time editing a wedding, so it took me forever. I spent weeks rewatching deeply vulnerable moments as well as occasions where they said and did things that were totally bizarre and, honestly, annoying (they were, y'know, rich kids.) 

My feelings about these people went through a whole evolution. At first they were cute, then they were irritating, and by the end I had spent so much time with them that they lodged themselves deep in my heart. If I ever saw them in person I would feel like an absolute creep. Like I had directed of their version of the Truman Show or something. I would feel like the Elephant Man. Look past my creepy exterior, you finance weirdos, and see how much love I have for you.
No lol. But you should just grab the bull by the horns and say hi I know every inch of your face.
I used to edit a music tv show and went to go see one of the acts that I had been editing. Got to meet the lead singer and told him, “I’ve been staring at your face all week.” He got a really weird look on his face, until I explained I worked for XYZ. Then we talked about the show for a bit and he said “Make me look good!”
Haha.. All the time. They think you are a weird fanboy type or a stalker when you are starstruck after meeting them IRL for the first time.
Yessss! And imagine a nerdy editor sitting behind a desk all day turning around to see that celebrity when I turn around as they were walking around the office for a meet and greet. 

👀 ummmm hiiii - keep me behind the desk in a dungeon and take my stapler.
I was editing a network Christmas special many years ago. Many big country artists singing Christmas standards. One artist decided she wanted to rerecord her entire vocal take as well as all the lead guitar parts. Lead guitar was completely different from the filmed version and the vocals were no where near the live track in terms of sync. Deadline was looming and it took a full day to Frankenstein a cut back together that looked as good as possible sync wise. 
I was internally seething at everyone involved that knew better than to “fix” audio this way so close to broadcast. Anyway wrapped up around 11:30 that night and had to rush to the Kroger before midnight closing to get my dog some food. Standing in line with a huge bag of dog chow and who is right in front of me? Miss celebrity who I was fuming at all day for retracking an entire song. (Phrases here and there both musically and vocally are normal to fix and audio department lets us know what they’ve messed with so we can address it in video. but not the whole friggin song) 
Anyway, I had the thousand mile stare from shifting frames all day, and my brain to mouth filter wasn’t working well. First thing out of my mouth was “you know, I’ve been watching you all day”. She was by herself, and I could see the flash of terror in her eyes before I realized how creepy that sounded. I quickly recovered and explained what I meant. She was cool about it. We talked about the show and my dog. But the odds of the one person I was looking at all day being right in front of me at the grocery store was pretty wild.
Oh, it happened to me many years ago. I was living in NY and had been editing a documentary about drag queens for months. One day, I am walking on the street and I see one of the subjects walking towards me. Without even thinking I go "Hey, (name)!!! How are you!". And immediately I realize he has no idea who I am. I had to explain what was happening and we had a good laugh.
Yes with docs in particular because it’s weird that they are real lol
Yes omg. There was this girl 20 years ago in a music video I was editing and I pretty much fell in love with her while editing the video. She was sultry AF. I would see her occasionally at bars or whatever and had to work really hard not to stare at her. Found a girlfriend and got serious and then engaged and only then learned that the girl in the video had a crush on me the whole time.
Oh yessir. I’ve cut a lot of high-budget shorts and some with big Scandinavian actors. After a couple of beers it’s nearly impossible to remember that they have no idea who I am at the screening haha. Luckily this is something most people understand.
YES. I was working on a project and started feeling like I was going crazy because I thought my neighbor was one of the main characters in my show. I would avoid him at all cost because I genuinely thought I was losing my mind. Turns out he actually is the actor from my show, I introduced myself and now we give each other Christmas gifts!
Yeah, the worst is at wrap parties when you meet them. They have no idea who you are and you know every detail of their facial expressions and mannerisms. 
I've also experienced this as a VFX Compositor.   
Up close removing wig lines, harnesses (many a crotch on screen for long periods) and doing retouching/blemish removal.
Always awkward at the wrap parties.
welcome to the aww nope do not say a thing but nice to meet you and keep up the good work, and thats from porno editors, yes did some special effects for them and i was bug eyed for too longgggg, will not do that again, it does something to you and how you look at that actress or wanna laugh at the actor like really your barking at what you got??? dud shorty at the gym has you beat, you see what  i mean, its a keep your mouth shut and do your best for them in your work edits, and next time they ask for special efffects? i am too busy ,but bubba can do it...
"Nice to meet you, I know every single detail of your life including what everyone is saying about you behind your back as well as all your verbal and facial ticks and I have diagnosed you with a few psychological conditions, nothing to really worry about though. it was a pleasure to edit this film"
I’m editing a doc right now that’s about a guy with a mental disability and I’ve spent months watching interviews with him and his family/friends…and I’ve thought about how weird it is that I know so much about their personal life and they don’t even know who I am. If I met them in-person it would feel like we’re already friends. 
Yup, for a while I didn't know how to approach them the first time I met them. But now I always ask the director to introduce me first, and that breaks the ice nicely for me.
THIS! Been working a doc for a year and I’m so excited to meet the subject bc I know so much about her. But I also know that doesn’t know me at all and will be way less excited to meet me than I am to meet her.
100%
💀
Honestly that’s on Sound for not cutting when called for.
Like one of those Love Island type shows? They just go at it knowing there's cameras everywhere ?
Wait... the entire cast together? Like a big orgy? Think of the ratings!!
Okay that’s pretty funny.
Yup that sounds about right 😂 I kinda bounce between being laughing at how silly it is and being focused/desensitized to it.
Animation can be that way too. We need a lot of random efforts since there is no on set action. 

One show I was on Paget Brewster had to record a ton of efforts for a fight scene. John DiMaggio was on deck to record once she was done & heard the whole thing. Once we got in the booth he told the engineer to record & did a whole Barry White impression ad libbed type song in response to what he just heard. Allegedly they were gonna play it for her at her next record session (she was a darn good sport) but I never heard of they did or not. It was a funny song but pretty awkward to hear after chopping up her efforts.
Oh man, I have done this so much, acting like I am super familiar with the person and watching the look of confusion and discomfort on their face as I realise WE HAVE NEVER MET EVEN ONCE.
This happens to me all the time.

And not just with like CEOs or athletes or documentary participants either. I’m talking the time I went to a wedding recently where like half of my high school graduating class, most of whom I’ve not seen in almost 20 years, was in attendance. I felt so weird because I knew a lot of the people’s wives and husbands from their faces on social media. 

I find the latter a little creepier because they are essentially nobody and I knew some of them on sight.
Def gonna use this one
That happened to me putting together a slideshow for a coworker's son's wedding rehearsal. The son and his fiancé were roughly the same age as me and all their pictures growing up looked *just* like those of me and my sister. 

By the time I got done, I felt like we'd grown up together and were friends... it was *really* weird meeting them in person for the first time and reminding myself that they didn't know me at all, even though it felt like I knew them inside out.
I do the smile thing all the time. I catch myself and feel weird.
Last year I worked on some promo for a group of podcasters. I went and shot some footage for about 1-2 hours and then edited a bunch of promo videos based on that. A few months later, their producer wanted to try some other type of video content and sent me a link to a folder. They forgot to give me access, so I sent a permission request.

I was then added to this email chain and one of the podcast hosts was the owner of the folder. I thought it would be an automatic approval since I worked with them before and we were all familiar with each other. Instead, the podcast host replies something like, “there’s this guy who wants to access our folder - who is he?” And then it hit me that I was just familiar with them because of how much time I spent looking at their faces and interactions on the edit, but they just met me for an hour or two a few months back. Weird feeling.
I sometimes think about The Jinx and how they found that bit of cinema gold from listening to him while he went to the bathroom….. I respectfully skip ahead when people are going to the bathroom with their lav on but I’m sure there’s plenty of editors that listen and goddamn did it pay off
Name names! He doesn’t want to talk to you anyway
ME TOO!!!! I’m actually writing a short film about this that’s why I wanted to hear y’alls opinions
Me too!! It feels so weird editing myself, I get to sick of myself haha
I'm usually up front with it, "So, I'm in this weird situation where I know too much about you, so sorry if I'm too familiar I don't mean to be"
Well hopefully it wasn't Toddlers in Tiaras.
I'm sure that those people start with a pretty voyeuristic expectation of what's to be seen. I mean if they're putting themselves on "Farmer wants a wife" or something like that they probably don't care much.
lmao I cant possibly imagine thats the case.... or is it?
Like that, yeah.
Believe it or not, the networks want to protect their image as wholesome and family friendly while also cultivating their own “stars” so they won’t show orgies.
I went to a home auction and the real estate agent of a video I edited was facilitating.
It is
I've worked on some reality and there was one sexual moment that made air. It was mostly just "cuddling" under a blanket the internet insisted someone was getting a hand job, and they all turned rabid against the girl (but didn't seem to say anything about the guy). I totally get why shows want to keep things clean.
Can I do jumpcuts while sitting down?
r/dadjokes didn't accept my post. :(
This is the best post I’ve seen on here in a long time
Yes. But don’t slip while standing.
I fear this joke will start a ripple effect
What does a gen z editor call an edit if it sucks? 

An L cut 

: (
Let me just check that. Sorry no. That’s illegal.
This joke was as 🔥as a match cut
yeah a lot of people don't know this but ...
*sighs*
If you can’t solve it, dissolve it
Do you have any more? Love to hear them.
Murch is always standing while editing, and I don’t think that he has never made a jump cut.  So there is that lol
To make a long story short, I became an editor.
You can match cut only when there’s a match on the tele.
This is funny but I’ve recently started a creative venture with someone and he’s so clueless that this actually feels like something he’d ask 😩
ha ha... ha?
You think you're reel funny, don't you?

I'm giving this an upvote, but in the most dad-joke downvote way possible.   :-)
hahahahahah
no
I do all my jump cuts sitting down
[removed]
[removed]
Lol. As if Dadjokes denied this. That's mildly infuriating. But also kinda funny that the best dad joke went over the heads of dad joke enthusiasts...
Great post! You get a Star wipe!
I do most of my editing sitting down.
Yikes:)
Only if you [remote in](https://jumpdesktop.com)
Name checks out
Yup, because then you’d slide.
Probably not, but it could wipe you out!
Fear? I hope! This sub is usually crickets. At least this will get people talking more. So who wants to share their demo reel?
It's W cuts only cuz we on that grind 😤
r/angryupvote
if in doubt, fade it out
As an editing teacher, this joke hurts my soul. ;)
I said that to my producer yesterday when he told me that we'll have to do some creative editing. I'm not sure he got the joke.
I need to put this one at the top of my resume
I need to put this one at the top of my resume
I need to put this one at the top of my resume
Watch out not to start a fire when doing match cuts.
I was asked by a fairly big time producer why I didn’t just hit the “update VFX” button so all the VfX shots that came in 1 minute precious were updated. 

He uses it all the time when changing names in scripts.

And the producer’s contribution to the creativity was…
Deciding that they needed more of it.
"Just have fun with it"
But change the music.
If you could have 5 "editing" reminders in your pocket all the time, what would they say?
Mine would be:

1. If scenes play well without music, they will often play better with music. Don’t use music as a crutch for a badly edited scene.

2. Only edit to the beat of the music if you want to draw attention to the cut point. It’s often best to sync action to music instead (more for sizzle / promo style editing).

3. Let shots breathe. Hold shots for as long as you need to describe the shot in your head. For doc work, it is often best to cut long rather than short.

4. Keep a bank of laughing/smiling moments when searching through interviews. These are great for injecting personality into an edit.

5. Every shot you cut to should have a purpose - be that adding to the story or revealing more information to the film.
Watch the export before sending off
Don’t get too attached to your edits. It makes it easier when the client demand that I edit their way
1 quote realistically 

2 don't start without a purchase order

3 push back on scope creep and charge change orders

4 invoice as soon as you finish 

5 chase accounts payable
1. There are no rules,
2. Except for whatever rules the client wants.
3. Trust yourself.
4. You know nothing.
5. Coffee.
Form me its allways been: Switch off the sound, is it clear whats happening?
1. Don’t be precious. This is a team sport.

2. Some people need to see it in order to realize they’re wrong, and if they still don’t realize it, see number 1.

3. It’s easier to cut than add. Let the rough cut be a little long.

4. Perfection is the enemy of staying perfect after you get notes.

5. Fight for the best story, not the prettiest edit.
If you’re stuck too long tryna fix something, tag the clip and move on first. get back to it later
1. Go back to cutting.
2. Seriously, get back to work.
3. Dude, you placed three clips. Get back on the horse. 
4. Your desk is over there. The edit is not in the *fucking refrigerator*. 
5. Ohmigod close the browser and go *BACK TO WORK!!!*
When you revise your edit several times, there's a tipping point when you stop improving it and start to destroy it. First symptom: you want to cut everything shorter. When this happens, take a long break.
On 2 - totally depends on genre. Beat cutting might work for some stuff like sizzles and promos, but not for music performance or drama.
Well, it's really different to edit for a short 25 sec reel than edit for a feature film. I would say that some tropes or general ideas of cinema editing do not apply to short form.
OP thanks for these, and others' contributions. Some great stuff in here.
I'll just say one: I worked in doc/journalism and knew the video would be published eventually with a short headline. I would often think of that headline ahead of time and reference it regularly during the edit. It becomes a shorthand for the theme or thesis of the video. Is this interview serving the thesis or no? Is this scene/section/b-roll/sound bite in some way pointing back to the headline, or are we off topic? Let these questions guide what gets included and what is cut. This is applicable outside of a news context if you can just articulate your video's theme or goal.
Good points. I hope some people post more of their tips.
1. Kill your babies. 

That's it.
Quote projects (hours estimate or money or both) so you won’t be pissed halfway through for not charging enough / allocating enough time. 

Use a guide for eyelines. 

Trick yourself into enjoying a shitty music track (literally tell yourself the music is awesome for a day or two) and you won’t want to rip your hair out at then end of an edit. 

Anticipate people’s needs if you have the time. A client will tell you to do something that you know is a bad call. Do it anyway, but also make a better version that you think works. Show them your version first and then their version second. Let them decide. 

Duplicate your sequences as you go in case you need to revert to another train of thought from a previous cut or the note as old as time, “Uh I actually liked how it was before”. 

Keep your head up, you’re only as good as your clients will let you. It’s not a reflection of your talent or your abilities! Find joy in the little bits here and there.
1. Always better to cut into a camera move and let it resolve than let it start and cut away.

2. When editing an interview, don't just pay attention to who's talking when, but where the thoughts change. People often blink when they have a new thought.

3. The right side of the screen has more visual weight than the left 

4. L-cuts make almost everything smoother, but you can also use this for b-roll and other things...when the subject mentions x, consider cutting to x a moment later rather right when they say it.

5. If you want to make the viewer feel subtly uncomfortable, decide when a cut would feel right, then move it ten frames.
These are so helpful!! Some of mine pertain more to story/dialogue than pure cutting per se but:

1) All the “almost there” soundbites in the world will never add up to one bite that says exactly what you mean.
2) The story they got in the field is the story you have.
3) No matter how sure you are it won’t work, if you have the time to try it, try it.
4) If it almost works, it doesn’t work.
5) At the end of the day, the film wins.
I’m not even a video editor and I’m going to save these tips.
Back up your first edit

Do the notes backward to keep any timecode in the notes relevant

Make sure You're not editing over your backup

Charge for changes, but any goofs on your part are gratis -always

Copy paste names and titles from client
If it sounds good, it’ll look good.
[removed]
1. If it don’t make dollars, it don’t make sense. Media is a business.

2. Creativity without focus is like a geyser coming from a busted water main. Nifty to look at for a minute, but a pain to fix in order to make things functional.

3. Don’t let perfect get in the way of finished.

4. Being a magician isn’t about having actual magical powers - it’s about smoke, mirrors, and distractions. Same goes for editors. 

5. Having a fresh set of eyes look at your work for 2 minutes will help make the edit better far more than you rewatching it over and over for an hour. They’ll see things you can’t… or refuse to.
1. It's not your film
2. It's their film
3. Learn to play well with others.
4. Listen
5. Religiously adhere to naming conventions
Hmmm...

1. Review every second of available footage. At least skim. Make stringouts of good stuff. 

2. If it's a tease, find the music first. 

3. If you add a marker, make sure you label it so you will understand even 2 weeks from now. I sometimes shorthand it wayyyyy too much. 

Not sure what 4 and 5 would. These are things I sometimes simply skip because turnaround times are so fast, and I feel like maybe I've transcended being 100% committed to them, but I always go back to them.
Become Dead Inside, it makes it easier in the end when dealing with the notes.
1) don't use production music
2) use plenty of natural sound
3) only use music that shows the source of the music in the video.
4) never use production music, because it's the easiest way to annoy an audience. 
5) when ignoring the production music ban because you are cool, make sure to mix poorly so that dialog isn't clear.
I only really have one rule.  Don't be a dick to the producer.  The rest is easy.
50% deposit before they're even on the calendar.
All deadlines are bullshit.
CMD+S
Save
1. Show emotion. Don’t tell emotion. 

2. If editing in a foreign language turn of subs once in a while to watch the scene without knowing what they say. 

3. If you can’t get a scene to ‘work’. Most of the times you should cut something instead of adding more.

4. Don’t watch your cut as a whole to often, most certainly in the first days/ weeks (depening on how long you work on something. Knowing it to well won’t let you experience the cut in full emotion.
1.A rough cut should be rough. Get through all the footage before getting granular with any of it.

2.Have your own editing thesis on how a story should be told. Cut to this thesis religiously and then when you have the whole clip done decide how your going to break away from your thesis to create something unique. 

3.When it all gets too hard disregard no.2 and rely on the basics. 

4. If the client is persistent on ruining your cut learn to pick your battles and move on. We can't win them all and if your still getting paid you're kind of still winning.

5. If part of the scripted story isn't quite working try removing the entire part. Often the story will work anyway and the viewer will never know what is missing.

(Bonus tip for cutting talking heads. Often people will start a sentence one way and then half way through the sentence begin to say it another more concise, intentional and direct way. You can make anyone seem like an authority on the subject matter by only using the latter parts of their lines)
“Have some more caffeine”
I always ask myself “what is the story?”
My favorite CEO story (videotape era) is, he didn’t move even in fast forward/rewind.
When I am spending way too much time trying to fix something or make something work and deadlines are wild: Let it get noted.
To better emotionally handle notes process: learn how to make love to a cut without getting married to it.
The only thing I would add as a reminder is that “it’s not my project”. I don’t mean this as a pejorative, but rather that someone hired me to work on the edit, and I ought to do my level best.
As a trailer editor:

Do not fall in love with your edit. 

Great sound design can save mediocre picture.
YUP. 

Unfortunately.
And watch that cut on different screens / sizes. It’s amazing how mistakes jump out on a different screen.
But it’s like …. Long… and I’m tired.  I’m sure it’s fine.
And add a 30 sec delay to sent emails.
[deleted]
“But I just watched it 59 times over the last three days, what could be wrong‽”
I wish I could upvote this infinity times
First time I got bigger project and sent it off late at night. I wake up in the morning with words in my head "re-check the videos you sent". I really didn't feel like it and thought they were fine, and wouldn't have re-checked if I didn't hear these words clearly in my head. Anyways, I check the videos and I see a lot of black cuts. Apparently I disabled some clips accidentally before exporting finals. Quickly replaced the videos in the drive with new versions and saved my face, thanks to Jesus.
Footage: 4 hours

Deliverable: 60 seconds

Version 1: immaculate pacing with breathtaking emotional impact

Client notes: "let's add 15 seconds of CEO intro followed by 10 seconds of graphics with the title of the video."
One for the reel and one for the meal.
When I hire an editor I always tell them, the first edit is for you.
Reeeeeaaaaalllll
Now a creative few:

1 Dictate shot length don't be afraid of time warps, slow down and speed ramp to make it fit the hole you want the shot in

2 Decide how big a shot needs to be. Just because it's shot a certain size doesnt mean it's that way in the master, zooms reframe even generative fill to make space for supers.

3 Decide how long dialogue lasts. If the conversation is dragging chop up the deliveries and tighten it. If a voice over is dull speed it up, commercials I'm always making a vo 115% speed and pitch shifting.

4 Make music work for you it never fits how you want, be bold and recut the track to do what you want.

5 Don't let yourself forget the big picture. Watch the whole thing every day at the start of the day before doing anything and again at the end of the day before stopping. Make notes both times.
Some great advice. I - despite being a veteran - am terrible at estimating for quotes, some are wildly under (having forgotten about subtitled versions for horizontal and vertical versions of edits) and some are wildly over (just worked too fast and was easier than I thought). I reckon it all balances out in the end.

I've learnt by bitter experience not to start without a PO unless it's a client who has multiple invoices paid on time. I really think there should be a *Running a Business 101 for Editors*.
I like #2. I have never experienced this before. It always occurs way after project is finished when end client is satisfied. Can you expand more about #2? Is this more corporate company? Seems unusual as an individual/freelancer.
These are the ones.
Nothing addictive should be a requirement if you want to be a well person. Being tired is a sign your interest isn’t sufficient for best decisions. Deadlines can be met on less than 16 hour days
I watch back in black and white too sometimes. I’m not a colorist by any means so it helps me not over analyze any temp color issues shot to shot.
Would you say this mainly applies to ads that will be on social, streamed, etc. or films and everything else?
This is great! I find working with no sound is good way to spot cuts that don’t flow well.
Great tips!
This is great! I like to annotate the tricky section with a title ‘broll of …’ and come back to it later. Helps to keep things moving
Omg where are the cameras 👀
Great point - and totally agree. Have tweaked OP
... and shot sizes. Big screens are... BIG
Same sentiment here. So many good pointers that are validating, or that I’ve never considered. Saving this post.
I’m definitely being obtuse here but use a guide for eyelines?
For 4, do you mean a J-cut? Just asking
Definitely the case! It’s important each cut is motivated by the story and what is happening on the screen
not when you work on a tv show that has a set air/taping time. then that deadline is VERY real. annoying, but VERY real.
Love these! Thanks so much for sharing
Great tips! Thanks for sharing

I legit think it will be the downfall of my career
My favorite has been, "we want this QR code to show at the end." QR code goes to a 404.
It's interesting how editing for commercials is so different to cutting long form docs.

If I did 1, 2 or 3 I'd have the online and dub going nuts at me, and I can't spare 2 hours a day to watch it!
what is PO
I'm a commercial editor but I work so closely with the production companies that book me that we literally wait for the end client to sign their purchase order before we lift a finger.
I'd say it applies to everything. A great way to see if you got the pacing right.

I also do this when doing b-roll selects to make sure the sound isn't throwing me off.
:)
I slug with titles too!
I always think of this when watching old 80's TV series. TV sets were much smaller then. When I see gray Morse's head over entire frame it looks a bit funny, right?
set a guide (a graphical line marker) to where you want to keep your eyelines and then roughly try to match that shot to shot, so your eyelines are consistent, to help the fluidity of the cut for the viewer. Essentially bc most people first look at eyes of someone on screen, position your shot so the eyelines stay consistent, thus your audience is already looking in the right spot. This should be considered in production relatively with good composition and coverage, but something to always keep in mind when cutting (editing) humans / faces.
Guessing that cocktailians is referring to both L-cut and J-cut. They are used almost interchangeably, though one means audio starting before the accompanying video and the other means continuing audio past the end of the video.
Well, yes, you don't wanna miss slot. But nearly every other project I work on where clients have *drop-dead* deadlines seems to have conveniently moving goalposts when they want to make last-minute changes...
Me exporting 60 X :30s spots: "Better watch them all"

Me exporting a 30 minute TV show: "Eh, it's probably fine"
A money jar where you have to put money every time you skip rewatching is I think a great way to secure yourself financially. Follow for more tips
*adds the 404 to the end*

"That's not what we wanted!"

"That's what you sent me. Pay me"
Purchase order- documented intent by client to pay for specified product or service. Critical to show judge etc
Yeah, I tend to just use the term interchangeably, but in this sense I was thinking of not doing it when there's an audio edit...just that if you very slightly delay bringing the B-roll in rather than right on the nose when a topic is mentioned, it can feel a little more natural and smoother...almost like a control room is rolling it out and it took a second to cue up.
Why are we like this lmao

double it down as a swear jar for every time you skip a rewatch and it fails and i'll be retiring next year!
The film I edited last year 'Your Lucky Day' just came out on netflix!
I edited and co-produced this (VERY INDIE) film with my best friend and Director Daniel Brown and our super talented friends and collaborators. It had originally come out last year to a limited audience and OnDemand, but there aren't a ton of eyes when there is not a lot of money behind the marketing. 

It stars the late Angus Cloud who sadly passed last year. And the rest of our cast brought so much passion and dedication to their roles, well beyond what the late nights and limited catering deserved. 

I've never cut anything as personal and in the mud as this. We learned a ton and I hope our efforts are apparent on the screen. If you have a chance, give it a watch. I would LOVE to discuss anything about it! The journey of independent film and getting on your first feature is a treacherous one and i'm happy to give my experience.
I saw this at Fantastic Fest and it absolutely rules. An absolute highlight of the fest. Congrats on the pickup and amazing job on the movie. I hope a much wider audience gets to take a peek at it because of this.

Big congrats Pezzhead!
Just watched it. Sad about one of the actors death, had to look it up
And he died from an accidental overdose, he looks like Mac miller too and they both left us in the same way :(
Amazing film! Just stayed up way too late to watch it. Well done.
We absolutely loved it! The editing made it for me, both sound and visual. Nearly flawless! Great work ☺️
That is so awesome! I will definitely give it a watch. Congratulations!! I'm proud of you, baybeeeee!
Congrats Homie.
I’ll watch it!
Damn just watched the trailer it looks really good! I’ll check it out
Woah, I remember watching the short film years ago!

I'll definitely have to check this out soon.
I’ve been a fan of yours and Dan’s for a long time. Congrats to you both and I can’t wait for Butcher’s Crossing. 
Congrats! Putting it on my Netflix list!

I JUST watched it (99% of my reasoning was Elliot Knight being a major role) I didn’t really know what to except but I ABSOLUTELY loved it. I loved all the acting, the editing, the story, definitely the best movie I’ve seen in a few years (though I watch few movies and are really picky with them too) it was really good everyone who worked on it did a really fantastic job
Just saw it! Such a good movie and great acting, but the story 🤯 amazing. A refreshing movie not predictable and so different from everything that’s out there. Definitely needs more attention than it’s getting!
Awesome movie
I’m watching this NOW and like all good films, I start googling the script and info on the project. I was telling someone it’s a brilliant concept - single location, minimal cast, probably made for about 250k. Am I right? Can you give some details on locations and how you raised money and got the project made?! I’m loving it thus far.
THIS was SUCH a great film! Nice job editing! The acting was good all the way around.  Love the Boxer at the end telling the officer something was amiss in that Mercedes.  

A shame about young talented Angus. May he rest in peace.  🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I just finished watching it. I thought it was great! The color pallet used was amazing. Great storytelling as well. It puts the viewers in the shoes of the actors. A great "What would I do..." 🤔 type of vibe. Dope❤️😊 Love to see what else you have!
just finished this movie, actually was great, kept me engaged the whole time. one of those situations where you randomly pick something and its really good
Just watched the movie. It was a thrilling watch through and through, and so beautiful yet daunting. I will definitely be following your future works this is AWESOME!
I just watched it me and my boyfriend loved it!
Very cool! Huge achievement
Just saw this movie, didn’t see much on Reddit yet, but damn it was good way better then other stuff out there, to see how much work y’all put into it with as much as a budget is freaking insane, it would be crazy to see a sequel, can’t wait to see more out of you!!. Cheers!!
I just watched it and I couldn't take a break cuz I didn't want to stop watching! It shows what a person will do when under stress/pressure/ fright! When the young pregnant woman started coming up with scenarios...I thought she was a hard criminal in her past life! LoL
Just watched the film. Great job! I loved all the twists and the pregnant waitress character.
Just finished it.  I loved it.  I noticed the editing was well done even before I found this thread.  Congrats!
I’m so excited to watch this movie! I’ve been waiting for it to hit streaming networks since I saw the commercial. I’m only a few minutes in and love it already. Congratulations!!
Congratulations... I played Dawn In The Morning....So blink and you miss me...great job editing ... it really moves and it's very dynamic. Be very proud:).
This was an amazing movie and let me tell you. I did not know this was an indie film or made on a budget. You fooled me. All of the actor and actresses were spot on with their acting. Everything was well directed and the story line was solid.

I'm happy to watch more.of what you two edit. I know editing isn't a easy task but boy did you guys piece this together exceptional well.

I also like the end with the car and the dog.
I did wonder what came to that!! 

Say, in the credits. What song is that??
Just watched. Good flick!
The best film I’ve watched this year!
This is by far, easily, the worst fucking movie I’ve ever seen in my life. I am absolutely fucking miserable right now. I will never again be able to live the life I lived 2 hours ago. I hate everything. This movie had the shittiest and corniest plot of any movie in existence. I am absolutely livid. The people who made this movie deserved to be punished and should never be allowed to make a movie for the rest of their lives. This movie has instantly given be depression.
I'll be watching it in the morning. I'll come back after I watch it.
I am watching this movie right now. I love it!
The editing was top shelf, you should be very proud of your accomplishment.

It's a real testament in your editing that such a poorly written movie is getting this much praise lol
Watching now… 10 mins in I’m excited to see how this all plays out. It’s in the top 10 for the day. I saw angus was in and hit play, not reading the synopsis
Just watched the movie and really loved it.
Just finished watching! It was sooooooo good!
Really great movie that kept me entertained. Can you tell me anything more about the end credits song? “Bells of Saint Mary’s by Nasaya and Maro”Specifically if it is available anywhere outside of the movie? I’m having trouble finding anything about it. Great movie and great song! Thanks!
Just finished the movie a couple minutes ago and found this thread. This was such an amazing movie. Such a tense movie and felt longer than an hour-and-a-half in the best way possible. You and the team who worked on this did some great work.
Just finished. Great watch all around. Was not expecting something’s to turn out the way they did; definitely built up the suspense. Just bittersweet to see Angus as his potential was so amazing.
I wanted to ask why the confusion on location, and where is the audience supposed to think it is?

There are dozens of different shots of California, but no indication of any specific PD precinct, city, cross streets..

And to make it more confusing, at 1:18:44 a uniformed officer comes in pointing his gun (he was shot earlier in the film, I’m avoiding spoilers) well, he’s clearly wearing a City Of Miami looking police uniform, it also looks like a one of many Miami corner stores..

However the Wikipedia page says it takes place in LA? 

So, where is it?

Edit: I just noticed at the end, the officer is being interviewed on a non existent tv show called “DAWN on MIAMI”
Just finished watching this movie; one of the best movies I’ve seen since waves by A24. I initially clicked on this movie cuz I saw Angus Cloud (REST UP) but stayed because of the way this movie was filmed and cut up (crazy I stumbled on the very person who edited it lol) the color grading and grittiness of the film is like no other brotha. My favorite shot is one early on in the film where the g wagon is parked outside while the store just glows in the night. The grain/grittiness and halation fr captures the feel of the movie ion even know how to explain it but I love it bro lol. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat till the end because of all the twists and turns! Wonder how it all played out after they found the bodies with the gun tho 


Also if you ever need music, especially west coast/LA for any background sounds, I’d love to shoot you some work (Full songs and beats)! 
Just watched it. It was so good! It was nice to see Angus again. I’m still heartbroken that he passed ☹️ I was looking forward to seeing him do more in the future. RIP homie.
I just saw this, and can I just say, bravo. 

Honestly didn’t think I’d still have movie twists catch me off guard but here we are.
Just watched it on Netflix tonight. Seemed very fatalistic, sort of a sad commentary about greed and the human condition. Good watch though. Well done.
Great work! This is my favorite movie of 2024. It has a strong existential themed story. Love it. 
Hi! Just watched this movie w my partner and we loved it and thought it was entertaining! Very cool that you edited and co-produced this with your best friend. There were times when I was thought “wow that scene is rly cool.” For example, I loved the cinematography during the scene where Abraham was fighting the security guard and you could only see bits of what was going on through the train. Please tell your team we thought you all did an amazing job!! I wouldn’t have guessed this was an indie film with a low budget and knowing this now I’m even more amazed.

Also I noticed there is a 2010 short of Your Lucky Day. Did you also edit/co-produce that one?
Yo just saw it, it was pretty good I wish the gas station owner survived :(
I’m so confused on everyone calling this a great film. Most if not all was so farfetched from the guy getting the ticket and thinking he can cash it even after their halfcocked plan. The cop being alive after bleeding out for multiple hours after getting shot in the neck. The cops dad and his friends being some rag tag group of mercenary bad cops lol. The girl getting shot in the gut only to still have the baby. Everything seems so forced in here it was laughable. Different folks I guess.
Awesome movie 🍿
Just saw it, I love the movie! There’s so many layers relating to money and greed to peel back and the editing and shots are awesome. You all did a fantastic job congratulations
just finished it! definelty a top 5 watched of the year so far, just incredible! do you have a title for the song played during the end credits?? i know its the song the couple sang in the movie but the mix is great!
Hey I saw it! Very interesting film. The premise was really good.
Just saw this, fantastic !
Just saw this last night I was really impressed. I was telling a friend if i was a producer or studio this is the kind of director i’d be keeping my eye on - he’s very talented with tons of potential. Hope you guys do more and will definitely follow your work! So sorry about Angus Cloud. Cheers and good luck.
just finished the movie and i think i may have seen your name in the credits! (pezz) great movie!!! fantastic editing!
Great movie man. I hope to direct something like this in the future. Do you know what camera and lens that was used?
Came to say congrats, it's #1 on Netflix
Loved this movie! Congrats! RIP Angus… he was def one of my all time favs.
Congrats! Netflix tells me it's "Coming Friday" so I'll check it out this weekend! Intriguing premise. What inspiration did you have in mind for the edit? Did you have a particular movie or style you tried to emulate?
[deleted]
Did you edit the trailer on Youtube also?
I just watched the movie and I thought it was amazing, just wondered if you could tell me what song(I know it is a form of The bells of St Marys but by who) is played in the credits, I was a big fan of the soundtrack as well.
Was that not a shit ton of work???? Also post your luts. Looks awesome.
Just watched it and loved it! I am searching for that song at the very end with the girl singing “The Bells of St Mary” and then I guess it goes into “A New Day”. Any help with who is singing that at the end and how I can find it? It’s not on the soundtrack for some reason
I wish i knew what happened in the end
It was really good😭 I cried at “For Angus”. >! It never really showed his body. I wonder if that was because of his passing? !<
He smashed this film! I enjoyed it from start to finish! What are you guys doing next?
Just watched it! Really enjoyed it, and thought it was very Safdie-esque.
Just watched it and had one question where I feel like I’m missing something.

***SPOILER***

Didn’t Amir start recording again after deleting the footage? I thought that he did and was thinking it would be hinted at or brought up at the end of the film. That or I’m just crazy and he didn’t start recording again lol. Great movie!

***END SPOILER***
Amazing movie. Loved it
I have a weird question. It seemed like Angus’s character died so suddenly in the film, is it because of his actual death? was there a different ending supposed to be for the movie?
Would be cool is you shared a screenshot of the timeline.
Can anyone for the love of god help find the track ID for the closing credits
Can you explain more in depth as to why the cop steps on Ana's hand and goes to kick her belly? Is it pure cruelty and making sure she's dead or is it also backed by racism?
I couldn't watch this movie after the first ten minutes. I don't know what happened at the end..But there's no way the robber could cash that ticket. I would given him the ticket immediately because I know he couldn't cash it in. The guy had witnesses and he scanned the ticket and the store owner checked it. Maybe it was figured out at the end. But that bothered me to much to continue.
Great movie! I was wondering how you went about casting your protagonist and antagonist characters?
Good movie, until the part where a pregnant woman with one hand manages to out smart and out maneuver 3 highly trained swat officers, but it was great until then
It was an entertaining movie! I’m just wondering how the baby survived. Did I miss a scene where she put something under her dress to protect the baby?
What did you film it on?
amazing movie! what song did you use for the credits? i can’t find that version anywhere!
I didn’t enjoy it at all, the ending was such trash 
such a great film! just watched it. excellent work!
Let me tell you is one of the best film I watched lately. Congrats and let me know if you guys have another to see
Just curious, are there any plans for a sequel where we get to see the fallout of what happens once the car is discovered?
Sorry if this has been asked already but I’m watching the film now (loving it) and trying to understand why Abraham gets out of the car and starts asking for help at the train stop? It seemed like he was all for the plan and then the train scared him? I don’t understand why he started panicking though.
Just watched this tonight. Very well done. Great edits. Nicely filmed. A bit grainy but overall fantastic film, IMO. Truly hope you guys get to make another with a heavy bigger. Do good things, lad! Be very proud of this one. Super raw and stays on the rails!
Just watched on Netflix and must say, Bravo! 👏 
Very well written, made & directed, edited, acted, etc.etc!! Wow. Played it on a whim, like, let me check this out.. and totally enjoyed tf out of it!!! Can't get over how well EVERYONE performed! Just excellent, really. Great job!
Anyway, just wanted to give props! Everyone knew what they were doing in this one!😊
Hi, great work on the film, it was a very enjoyable ride (stressful rather haha)!

I actually stumbled upon your post while searching for the end credits song. Shazam doesn't find it and the tune is not on the OST... So I'm wondering if you'd know what the track is? Thank you :)
I just finished the movie and I loved it! Was super curious on what the last song was that was used in the end credits? I can’t seem to find it anywhere online
Looks like it's removed now :/
Just watched it. It was really good except (I'm sure you had little to do with this) the part where the unborn baby's father steps out the car at the railroad?! I felt like I couldn't breathe throughout the movie - it was captivating and the characters actually were intelligent and three dimensional except for that part, which made me yell at the screen lol

Great job!
I shut it off within the first 10 mins. Lots of anti-white, stereotypical rhetoric. This is what keeps people divided. Could have been a fun movie without the propaganda
I just turned this movie off after 22 minutes. I'm not here to blame the editing alone, because the acting was terrible, and the story was stupidly unbelievable even in such a short time. It opened decently, but as soon as you introduced the store characters it was over. The more the characters spoke the more the dialogue seemed like chat gpt wrote 5 stereotypes. Interracial pregnant couple, immigrant store owner, racist rich white guy. Add in the protagonist who's the least scary gangster you've ever seen, he acts like 1. 1/2 mile Eminem ...  I had to turn it off after they started dragging a dead cop around the store as a pregnant woman mopped blood ... Followed by 6 mm minutes of more terrible dialogue, who are you, what do you do for a living? And the guys brother shows up at midnight for a shift that he doesn't need to be there for 🤦🤦🤦🤦 No one on the street heard gunfire? The cops never check in on an officer that's been unresponsive on break for an hour ? Or how many bullets does the kid have left in his 6 shooter after the gunfight ... He also never picks up the officer's weapon, it's right there for the black pianist to grab...

Ridiculous. All around.
The song during the ending credits is amazing. Would be willing to share?
Will there be a sequel? The pit at the end staring at the Benz left me hanging.
Which NLE you guys used ? 
Congratulations! The storyline is so bad the writers should be jailed and it’s one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen by the way but u should still be proud , found it from Netflix
![gif](giphy|3o7TKqFZJpwL8Giz2E)

Man thank you so much for the kind words! FF was amazing. I had never been but can't wait to go back. Has to be my fav festival experience.

not a euphoria fan i guess- i have one real question about this movie i just watched and i’m thinking it's a spoiler so i can't ask it- damnit

also to op i am noticing comments about it being a low budget film and for what its worth i literally never thought that while watching it- usually i always pick up on that kind of thing and i never thought about it once- so tell your team great job
He was attached to play Mac in the movie, BLUE SLIDE PARK, which still hasn’t been made
Much appreciated! Hope you got some sleep!
That’s awesome! Thank you for taking the time!! 

Ok so seriously NEARLY flawless you say… what did I fuck up??? 🫣😅 I’m kidding.
Wow! Yeah the old short to feature story has taken a bit longer than planned. Haha. We made the short in 2011 and this was shot in 2021 so just 10 short years between them.
Thank you! The love is felt.
awesome! the beauty of the queue

Thank you!
What is the credit song? I’ve been trying to find it
This means so much. I’ll share your kind words with the team. Many many thanks!!
Thank you! That was the hope! For this little film any attention at all was kinda a long shot. There are 1000's of films made every year that never get seen. So for us the fact that we are on netflix now is like a crazy dream come true.
You're sooooo close to our budget number its just sad.... haha 

Let me just give you the the abridged bullet points cause the story behind the story is pretty fun; 

\- The director and I made the short film its based on 13 or so years ago.... 

\- In 2021 he had an opportunity to direct a different film which ended up falling apart at the last moment. He had quit his job and was ready to make his first feature. 

\- He decides in LATE October 2021 to instead try to make Your Lucky Day the feature which he had been writing over the last several years, never thinking it would be a real thing.

\- He got the casting agent from the film that fell apart to read the script. She liked it and came on board. She connected him with the cast he would eventually work with BUT they were only available before the end of the year. 

\- So by Mid November he had scraped together some funds from family and friends and small investors to make it happen and fist day of shooting was Dec. 1st 2021

\- The schedule was 15 1/2 days, mostly nights and all cold and hard. Minimum of 7 pages a day. We were cruising. 

\- Everyone brought their A game, the cast was amazing and were on board for the crazy schedule. The crew were all dedicated and sacrificed a lot to make it happen. 

\- I should also note it was shot in East LA, by city of commerce at an old Weed warehouse. The directors brother and the production designer did the build out during November for what you see on screen. NONE of the store was a store before they shot this movie. 

\- And once they wrapped we spent about the next 3 months really focussing on the edit and then had to break for other jobs and would intermittently come back to it and make changes until early 2023. The benefit of time allowing us to make it the best it could be. Not to mention the director did over 300 VFX shots himself of that time as well. All things you'd never see, extensions, paint outs, all the gunfire and blood, the train, the ferry.... too much. There were a couple other friend/vfx artists involved that really helped out but most of the work was on his back because of our small budget in post. 

So thats basically the film in a nutshell... many more stories in between the lines but very glad people are watching it and engaging. The director and I have been working in advertising for about 10+ years and there is never any REAL engagement or conversation being had with the people watching the work. I'm glad we could rip the bandaid off and make this and now on to the next projects whatever they may be! 

Cheers!

That was my dog "Stormy" :)
Great film. What would you imagine happened when those bodies are found with the officers weapon in that Mercedes??
Thank you! We can't wait to see what we do next as well haha 

As for color you can thank [Justin Henning](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4103850/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr) the DP and [Paulo Américo](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6639340/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr) the colorist!
Aww a perfect date night. 🙏🏼🫶🏼🔨😅
Dawn!!! I hope you liked the end result. Your scene was such a fun one to cut. Emulating daytime tv is never easy. Haha but you killed it!
That means a lot! Thank you. The artist for the song is Nasaya & Maro. I don’t think it’s released yet.
I found this thread but searching for the credit song!
Agreed. Stupidest plot ever. Like why would a criminal with a winning ticket not just split the joint after all that but wants to share it with a bunch of strangers? LOL and how are they going to cash it when that ticket is tied to that store and associated crimes?
I’m really sorry. [Maybe this can help?](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=X1tdsY7gUW52wNiE)
I agree 
So dope!!
Very glad you had fun with it! We are really blown away by the response.
🙏🏼That means a lot. I’ll pass your compliments along to the director and DP!
Yeah we all feel the same way. He was one of a kind.
Just here to keep you on your toes!
They did
We have noticed a lot of dynamically different experiences from people watching the film. Some people are on the ride and some people are not. Kinda crazy to see from a purely anthropologic level. Not sure why there are such drastic differences for the same story. But I will say as filmmakers and editors especially I am super interested because the experience of the movie is part of the job. Like for you you’re into the details and believability therein. We don’t explicitly explain every detail and choice to death, especially for all the lottery system inner workings, and some people are ok with that and some are not. I will say that it is a movie and a bit of a fable at that. It’s totally far fetched but that’s part of the fun for us.
Thank you! I’ll pass this on to the Director!
Alexa was the cam. And every shot was on the 35 Prime
Also thank you and I hope you do your own film someday! It’s daunting and scary but worth it every minute 🙌🏼🙌🏼
No way! Which country? Thanks for letting me know!
Hmmmm.... style... haha. No real style per se other than what was already baked into how any give scene or shot was filmed.  Dan has lots of style in all his work including this film. And as editor I definitely played into moments and leaned into his filmmaking where I could, but I wasn't thinking too hard about any overt editing style.  

One overall theme we were keeping in mind was 90s action films like Die Hard. Violence and christmas are kinda hand in hand with our film as well. And then of course just keeping it moving. We knew a movie like this would be on borrowed time with an audience because of its fairly unknown cast and budget constraints so making sure that the pacing and scenes played as tight and with as much tension as possible was always important.  Hope you dig it!
Luke is the best. And it’s super cliché, but without anyone on the team for this film, it wouldn’t have been the same. Everyone brought their best work and not always in the easiest of conditions. But that’s what makes the magic happen.
I did not. Whoever did absolutely killed it! I love the trailer.
That’s so great to hear. Really means a lot. That end credit song was something we were toying with for a while. Dan knew he wanted The Bells of St Mary but the version we had in the film for a very long time ended up being too expensive so he reached out to Nasaya & Maro to do a cover which ended up having the perfect blend of upbeat energy but with a bit of melancholy and uncertainness that we really liked. Really glad you liked it too! All the music elevated the film so much.
I came to reddit for this comment lol. I couldn't find it on Shazam
unreleased rendition of The bells of st Marys by Nasaya & Maro. Here's a link https://on.soundcloud.com/HLi4mDtDvL7UFigp6
I’ll try to post. Justin Henning the DP developed the look before shooting. Shot all on one lens - 35mm Prime. Then grained up and finessed in color. Glad you liked it!!
I will def put a request into the team to see if and when it will be released :) It might be a band question though. Their name is Nasaya & Maro
Here's a link to the song on soundcloud. They haven't officially released this version yet, but it's the audio straight from the end credits. https://soundcloud.com/blonde-hills/nasaya-maro-the-bells-of-st-marys-your-lucky-day?si=c5a7b778502f45a898f5e95957537dbd&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing
Capitalism wins.
Yeah, Angus. So heartbreaking. He was the genuine real deal and could have had a big future.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*SPOILERS \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

>!We had an alternate moment edited for his death that was a very clear death, and didn't leave anything to the imagination, but after he passed we just didn't feel it was in good taste anymore. I'm sure the audience wouldn't have known anything but for us it made a difference. And we do show his body, both in the security cam and at the end when Ana crawls over to him for the ticket. But thats it....!<

Thanks for watching it! RIP Angus ❤️
Was it a body double? Why wouldn’t they show his body?
We’ve gotten that comparison a lot. They’ve done a great job of cornering the ‘nervously uncomfortable’ market 😅. But honestly it’s a huge compliment, their films are great!
That’s a good question. But if you watch that part again you’ll see he ‘stops’ the recording. Not starts it.
Thank you!
That moment was always meant to be a pretty hard stop. Take your breath away and make you lean in. There was an alternate edit, which I talked about in another comment, for that scene that adjusted after he passed in real life. But his character was always supposed to depart when he does.

This work?
You need to bug the artist! They have not released it yet I don’t think.
Anything that might be going on in a characters head that isn’t explained explicitly in the film is just meant to be interpreted by each individual. For this specific instance there was no clear motivation other than to make sure she was dead, as to why he is so cruel… I always thought it was payback for what they all did to his son… but that was me. Maybe he just hates hands??
I hate to break it to you but everything you didn’t watch would answer most of the questions you bring up with the lottery plot. And 99% of lottery transactions are still done in cash so it’s not really traceable other than having a ticket and what store you got the ticket from. But thanks for giving it a chance!
Quickly. The director Daniel Brown started the casting process in the beginning of November 2021 and first day of shooting was December 1st. Thankfully he had Jessica Sherman, the casting director, who liked to the script enough to help him. Angus was great as we all know but unproven as a lead at that point. This was before season 2 of euphoria so there was a question on how he would do with a really limited and fast production schedule. That said we all recognized how special he was and it was clear very quickly he was the guy. And then Jessica Garza was another amazing find. And her performance speaks for itself. She absolutely kills 🔨🫣  And as for the rest of the cast it came down to Dan and Jessica having really good instincts and taste. I will say I pushed for Jason O’Mara. I had seen him in tv shows before and really liked him. I think he really nailed the unhinged coldness that his character needed.
Don’t underestimate pregnant ladies. If this movie has taught you anything. 😂🔨
Yeah she was no normal pregnant woman she came up with the whole story herself and her bf and the robber were impressed. Something tells me she’s been in this situation before
My answer is, the baby survived in the script.

I went on a hunt for it after watching it a few months back. The best I could find is this rip on YouTube and a cleaner cut version on SoundCloud that's since been removed:



["The Bells of St.Mary's" – Nasaya and Maro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd91POT_NOU)

  
I have a few other previously saved songs from Nasaya that I like that vary quite a bit from the style of the one above:

What about the ending?
Thank you! 🙏🏼
Many many many thanks!! Really appreciate it!
Oh damn! From your Reddit comment to some studio execs eyes. 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼

BUT… that said. I don’t know if it needs it. Some stories are just good with an open ending. Makes room for the imagination
I think he gets out because he sees an opportunity to be a good guy and a hero. When he leaves Ana Marlene he’s definitely not 100% confident.

Did you ever find out? I'm in that same boat now and coming up empty lol
It’s still up. Depends on your country tho
You could have finished it with as long as it took you to write this novel of a review. Also the movie answers most of your questions after the first 22. Sorry the movie sucks though. We will do better. Or maybe not. But I’m glad we gave you something to hate, otherwise it would be hard to know what you really love. So we gave you some perspective.

I cut this in avid
Your comment had as many plot twists as our movie! So thank you and congrats!
Can you dm me the question lol
WELL since you asked (only because my fiance’s a sound editor and appreciates feedback 🤣😉☺️ )

Only thing that comes to mind: I’m personally sensitive when dialogue volume changes during conversation. I noticed once the volume abruptly jumped between characters. But I’m honestly sure if I watched it again I wouldn’t even notice though haha

I love it’s technically a Christmas movie. And that you saved the baby (miracle as it may have been.)
rendition of the bells of st. mary's by Nasaya & Maro https://on.soundcloud.com/HLi4mDtDvL7UFigp6
Thanks for the background!  Great flic!  Simple, effective , and characters making rational choices throughout. You all crushed it!
I just want to revive this old thread and commend you on such an amazing script. I'm a DP/Dir based in Australia, and movies like this give me hope that one day I can pull on board as many favours and collaborators as possible to get a feature film made. well done! Looking forward to seeing both of your next collaboration in due time
Best movie I’ve seen in a long time. Great acting, and the over all quality of the movie was very good. Great work! 
You're amazing. Thanks for the reply.
Sometimes I have to sit down and tell myself, you guys are normal people too. I just see people like you just on a different category, but again, you guys are normal people too. So actually it's really cool to be able to talk to you/get a reply from someone like you. Had a conversation at work about this movie today, no lie, with my coworkers and each of then loved the film. I told them it was actually made on a budget and they couldn't tell either. You've been praised for it before, but, I'll echo it in. The editing. Flipping amazing!

Question just popped in my head though. You don't have to answer—did you go to school to learn how to edit or was this something you picked up/fell in love with and just got really good at it?

I think for someone to be able to go to work and do a job that they love. Is amazing. I'm in IT and I feel almost that way. 😅

If you made youtube blogs. Man I can only imagine what those would look like with your skills.
Hey, great minds think alike.
Alright let’s dive in. If he had just grabbed the ticket and split then there would be a bunch of witnesses that saw him steal it if he tried to cash it. And the ticket is not TIED to the store. 99% of lotto tickets are paid for in cash. So there is a high possibility there is no record of it being sold. And the rest of the associated crimes are talked about and worked out by the characters to cover up what happened.
It’s kinda wild that the movie answers all of these questions yet you’re saying it’s horrendous
At least Rick was part of a better production than the monstrosity I watched 🤷
It’s honestly specifically the writing somebody should’ve challenged the writer directly (maybe even you) to make a lot of the decisions more believable. Maybe with less cliché tropes as well skipping the Dad and his friends gearing up like it was John Wick three would’ve done a lot to the believability of the story as well. At the end of the day these guys are just deadbeat cops, why do they have enough artillery to go to war?
Angus not willing to shot people threatening his life and belongings only to shoot and kill a cop and threaten to kill others was an inconsistency in character as well. The filming and editing was decent I feel like the set captured the mood well personally. Casting was good too although I think angus looks too much like Mac Miller to focus on the movie not being about Mac killing a dude to get more rich. 

      All in all I think you guys did good with the resources had available, the tone was set for the movie well. It had a bit of a budget Tarantino feel to it just couldn’t deliver that hard on the twist. I feel as if it could have benefited if the story made more sense from the get go. Explain some about the cop on patrol and who his family is and further the wrong place wrong time trope that was hit but for the whole film. The final scene would have been more powerful IMO as well this way.
I completely agree, the music really set each scene into their own, Matt Hutchinson was a great choice. I was curious if you ever released the cover of the song anywhere? I already have the entire playlist for the movie on Spotify but I could not find the cover anywhere, so was it never publicly released?
Thanks! At least I have the name of the band now! That’s helpful :)
Edited my post with a spoiler tag. Forgot this wasn’t a spoiler discussion! But you’re right! You all did a great job.
Hi! Just curious as to what the ending was with the dog looking at that car? Thank you!
thank you! You must be proud of your baby!
unreleased rendition of the song The Bells of St. Mary's by Nasaya & Maro. Here's a soundcloud link: https://on.soundcloud.com/HLi4mDtDvL7UFigp6
And pregnant bellys? Lol. Thank you for your reply. I was very thankful the movie ended with the baby alive. It was interesting how they went in there already assuming that the hostages had been compromised but I do think in the real world there's a chance someone could be locked in a room somewhere and not be told anything other than hearing the gunshots and still be innocent so to me it shows farther cruelty that they would just come in there knowing they are going to kill everyone without giving them a chance to explain.
You are right, I should have watched the whole thing. Thanks maybe I'll actually watch it 😂
I just watched and it was great. Sorry Im a itdot 
They didn’t deserve that money 
No I never did, seems like it’s still unreleased
i seriously can't remember what my question was- i have to try to think of it and then i will message you
Damn it where were you when we were mixing?? Haha 
The feedback is more than welcome. 

It's funny and not funny cause we are lucky for the sound to be even as good as it is. Lucky by way of the mixer Roland Vajs. We spend only two weeks with him mixing the entire film. And that is not enough time.
I'm sure you can imagine. The only reason it's as good as it is now is because we were clear about what we wanted and Roland is as pro as it gets.

And as for the Christmas baby. Trust me that wasn’t by chance. 🎅🏼👶🏽
Cheers mate! You should join reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue
TY. 🙏🏻😀
All your notes are great... BUT, the movie is already out in the world. We made peace with it all and are moving on to what ever we can do next, with all that we learned during the process. And a PERFECT film is a hard target, but doesn't stop us from trying. It seems like you're into filmmaking or maybe a filmmaker yourself. Put some of that story brain into your own script and if you have already send it to me! I'd love to read it. All we can do is make and keep moving. Gotta make that living too and hopefully no ONE project will be the aggregate of your career.
I know Matt (who is amazing) released the OST but I don't know if some of the licensed tracks got released unless by the artists separately.... thats a good question

Personally I took that “assumption” as more of a justification for going in there guns a blazing. Kinda like a “hey let’s just tell ourselves this so we don’t feel bad” 

OP, this was an amazing movie with amazing editing! Especially for one I randomly picked on Netflix tonight ha. Did a great job of making you empathize with each character and think about how small injustices really add up
I thought the same thing at first, they’l catch him when he goes to cash it but then saw the rest of the film and actually liked it
Well that sucks lol. I thought it was weird that two different apps couldn't figure out the song.
Two weeks is all to mix?? Hella props to Roland Vajs and the whole team!! You ALL deserve a standing applause 👏☺️ Thanks for helping make it so we can enjoy it!
If I could give you a Reddit gold for that reply I would.
Won a 50k grant for my organization with an edit I did.
I don’t have many to share this news with, but I am beyond belief. 

I work for a grant-funded nonprofit in marketing. A department within my org needed a video to convey our need for a work van. 

It felt really basic but also impactful. I used Adobe Premiere with a driving time-lapse and interviews. I have no professional video editing experience but have access to Adobe products. 

As it turns out, we were selected to win out of over 200 other submissions from across the world. Securing $50,000 for us to purchase a new van. What a way to end 2023. 

I feel like I still have much to learn.I love editing, even though it was tough to grasp at first. Premiere was daunting. I hope to continue my work in video editing in to the future.

Thanks for reading!
Congrats! 

Video has a strange power to make people feel something, to change hearts and minds. Keep cutting, sounds like you are doing great.
Congrats and nice job! Don’t sell yourself short, most of the best editing is “basic”. Flashy graphics and effects can be cool but editing is about story telling. You must have picked the best bits from the interviews and strung them together to tell a good story. Add some music and nice pacing and you have a good piece.
Heartland Emmy Awards: *Hold my beer.*
Congrats! Would love to see your hard work, feel free to DM!
Congratulations
Awesome job!  Congrats!
Many many congratulations
Well done, be proud, happy cutting
Congrats. I'd love to see the video if you're comfortable sharing.
Nice!
BASED! Congrats man. Probably felt amazing! Love seeing positivity on this sub.
Congratulations! That is some awesome news for your org! Try to find other ways to use your skills an try to improve. Good Luck!
This is so awesome!! CONGRATS!
Brilliant! Congrats to you and your organization.
Way to go. Congrats on your achievement.
Congrats! That feeling of landing new gigs feels amazing!! Keep them coming.
Thats so awesome, anyway we can see your edit?
Congrats!
Congrats! Love to hear this good news.
Wow, very cool! Congratulations! 🎉
I'm not even into editing but Reddit sent me an email for this post so I wanted to say congratulations!!   
Happy New Year everyone. Have a nice day.
 Congratulations!  That's awesome
Thank you! I will!
😅
Hey I have a couple of those lol. Didn't pay for the ripoff statue tho
Same here! Would love to see it
Thank you!
Thanks!

How many editors does it take to change a light bulb?
Why do you want to change it?
If we change the light bulb, we have to change everything else.
We can change it, but you won't like it
I think that's a change we can push back on
I like the lightbulb, I do.  Great beginning lightbulb.  Just wondering if there is a more anthemic lightbulb we could try.
Editor: *Doesn't change the lightbulb*--Here's the new lightbulb!


Client: Looks great!
Okay in my contract it says you will have three changes for free. But that doesn't cover for the lightbulb tho.
If you really want, we can do Lightbulb_v17, but it’ll be another overage charge. And I still think v2 was the strongest.
This is the fifth time you've asked me to change the lightbulb, and you do not like any of my replacement lightbulbs. If you can not articulate what type of lightbulb you want, I can't do my job.

You are now out of revisions as per the contract, and future revisions will be charged at $100 per hour.

OH, you wanna go back to the original lightbulb? Sure thing...
Can we please just present the light bulb to the client as is and not proactively auto-censor ourselves all the time? Maybe then our output wouldn't always be shitty by committee.
You want to change the music too?
Did you use the best lightbulbs?
Editor: sure we can change the light bulb. What bulb do you want?

Producer/Client: What do you mean?

Ed:  What color temp, how bright, where should I place it in the room, want a dimmer switch, on/off or always on?

Prod: can you make it look... magical?
Can we change it more dynamically?
I actually tried changing it. but put it back because it didn’t really fit the narrative and I figured you’d not like it. We can try again if you’d like but dark is pretty zeitgeisty right now. Oh, what did you want for lunch? I feel like sushi or tacos.
We work in the dark. There’s a light?
None.

It’s the post managers duty to find a suitable workforce for that. 

He wouldn’t want to deal with the union…
All these replies are cracking me up and raising my blood pressure at the same time 😆
Its not my job, either so it in online, or hire a VFX specialist to do it.
That’s damn funny…!!! 🤣
There is only one editor good enough to change final_final_final_pleasegod_makeitstop.prpro (recovery)
The lighting would be inconsistent, we would have had to change all the light bulbs a week ago.
Me - “rotates the lightbulb slightly” 
Client - now it’s perfect!
1 editor can change the lightbulb, and the homeowner’s cousin’s wife’s friend’s daughter who “works in the industry” can provide some valuable insight along the way.
That’s actually a really industry-standard piece of knowledge, you should be posting this question in r/videoediting
Is there a better lightbulb?
1, whilst 99 executives argue about how best to do it
How many producers does it take to change a light bulb?

Can we make it a flashlight instead?
I changed it already, you didn't even notice.
"None, it's fine the way it is"
Never mind, my nephew is going to bring in his own light bulb and do it better than you could and cheaper too.
The whole show is edited to the color of the lightbulb. If we change the bulb, we have to start all over. Please sign this change order. Plus, it's your responsibility to get clearance of the lightbulb's color, in writing.
Is this the best lightbulb?
This whole thread is cracking me up
You need to get me the lightbulb that you want in there
“Actually, can you just give me the lamp and teach me how to change the lightbulb in case I need to change it again in the future?”
None, that's what AEs are for.
What’s wrong with cutting to black? It’s a creative choice
Any way to make this lightbulb more cinematic?
I put that lightbulb in the scene that needed to be changed so they wouldn't ask to change the music.
I think it’s fine the way it is, but we can try the change if you want.
Depends on if the bulb has been transcoded.
Editors don’t need lightbulbs, we work in the dark
One but everyone will tell them to try it 100 different ways
The lightbulb provided is not compatible and does not work. I can make a suggestion that presents similar results but incompatible. Again, my suggestion isn’t because I don’t like your lightbulb, it’s because it does not work. Dont like it? So THATS why you want another editor to change the bulb? Be my guest, they will say something similar
It depends on the finishing schedule
That’s the assistant editors job
Yes, but only with the latest update installed
So by new lightbulb you mean adjust the brightness?
I love it, but can we make the lightbulb just a little more blue?
It’s giving brightness but the luminescence is lacking
Pond 5 only has so many lightbulb change clips I'm going to have to ask the AE to change it
Ehhhh I don’t really do that stuff (I absolutely could though) - but I know a great vfx guy we can call.
It only takes one editor, but that editors has to be the one who gets the rest of the room to say yes at the same time.
2. One to run around screaming & the other to shag the electrician.
Updating....
Depends on how dynamic you want the lightbulb to be.
My nephew who just graduated high school can change that... He's pretty good in FCP.
"We like the light, but can we change the color?"
Well ackhually 🤓☝️
Client: this is a good start on changing the light bulb but we will need to change it. 

Editor: sure what light bulb do you want to see?

Client: I’m not sure but we will know when we see it
Ya know what? Just sent me the glass and the wires, my cousin who started Tik Toky College 101 will put the light bulb together
How many Creative Directors does it take to change a lightbulb?

🤷‍♂️ Does it _have_ to be a lightbulb??!!
How many Script Supervisors does it take to change a lightbulb?

“_The lightbulb can’t change!!!”_
What if we take two frames out of the lightbulb?
Could we just look at the box of second unit lightbulbs again?  Maybe we missed something the last 6 times we looked at them.
The lightbulb is working really well now but client has some new music options.
Three. First brings the chair, second stands on it and third kicks the chair out from under the second
Extra charge if you watch the editor over the shoulder or give him advise😂
Just fix it in post!
Can we just fix the lightbulb in post?
I first heard this joke as:
Q- How many online editors does it take to change a light bulb?
A- Only one, but are you sure you really want to change it?
That's thebone I've always heard
You also felt it lacked energy and a certain pop?
I think the lightbulb can be more rustic and modern.
We just really need this to be a high end lightbulb
💀😂
Or the opposite - I’ve changed the lightbulb and adjusted the dimmer, and went ahead and opened the curtains as well to let even more light in.

Client: it still looks the same to me. Can we try a different, brighter bulb?
Trim In - 0 - Enter
After you’ve been through all the lightbulbs please change it back to the original lightbulb
oh my god I am triggered
This is the best response.
i am laughing my ass off thank you :))))
I think he meant to make it "viral"
(if they really insist on changing the light bulb this close to lunch...) It's Sushi!!!
LOL stressful
Editing teacher here. The (recovery) at the end makes my eye twitch.
This one 🤣🤣🤣
I thought it was supposed to be fake answers only!?
How's many art directors does it take....... 
.... Who said it has to be a light bulb???
Same
I wouldn't mind if the bulb had a little.....pop.
Damn.... You beat me to this!!!
>:)

:)
😅😅
This made me shoot milk out of my nose.... Funny thing is,  I'm not drinking milk right now🤔
haha thank you!
I think we should warm it up a little bit.

Boss thinks 80+ videos a week is possible due to AI...
Title says it all. I am an in house video editor and boss man came down to say he wants 80 YT shorts a week because he thinks it's plug and play and will work perfectly. I immedythought this was completely unrealistic, but I wanted to post and ask if maybe there is something I'm missing out there that could make this possible before I pull him into a meeting to tell him his idea is bonkers? 
well - in your bosses fantasy world, by next year, he won't even need you. He will say "hey AI, hey ChatGPT, make me 80 different videos based on this concept. 

He is in dream land.  Listen - I speak to countless companies that say "why do we need local storage - why can we just pay for a cloud site and have the editors edit off of that" - and I tell them - YOU CAN - just pay for Lucid Link.  But they all think that if they get a DropBox account, everyone is editing in real time for very little money.  I run into this at least once a week. 

Bob
40 hours in a full-time week.  That's 1 video every half-hour.

It really depends on what you need for quality.  I can shit you out any sort of video in a few minutes if you don't care.
If he’s such an expert have him show you.
All bosses over estimate, so they can gauge the workload. If you bust your ass and make it work, they’ll expect that every time.
I mean, you can throw footage and keywords into the CapCut AI system and it will shoot out random edits that don't make sense. I did it for fun recently with some phone footage at an arcade / bar. It picked the wrong clips, missed the central movements, and the AI script it wrote sometimes picked up on a couple of keywords, other times was literally random and unrelated entirely.

AI will continue to refine. You cannot use it currently to make actual edits. Honestly I'd recommend giving that Capcut one a try and showing it to your boss. You could just export a few, or you could literally do it in front of them and show how ridiculous it it.
Your boss is a moron.

Quit.
I can't even promise to _watch_ 80 short Youtube videos a week.  Even if it was all ChatGPT magic that doesn't exist yet, I can't even promise to think of 80 decent titles for videos every week to type into the AI generator prompt.  If you managed to churn out that much crap, it would be the most worthless garbage tier crap that nobody will actually watch anyway so what would be the point of making it?  Even if it was possible, why pay for a dollar of GPU time to automagically make a video that has so few views that it can't bring in a cent of ad revenue?
Ask your boss how he came to that number, because hes a fucking idiot
Im curious why you need 80 shorts a week. Is this across like 10-20 channels? Otherwise this is over posting by a lot
Yes, 80+ videos per week is possible, definitely!  
Just don't ask about the quality, mkay ? 🤡
Sure. They will be complete garbage. But there will be 80+ of them.
Uncreative people will never understand how we work 
Boss man seems to think content is a silver bullet to getting rich 

Boss man seems to think that AI will fix everything 

Both ideas are horse shit 

Trash content with viral retention style editing might hold on to views, but those viewers won’t be the sharpest bunch and they won’t remember any of what you actually have to say. Do you even have 80 things to say?

Your boss doesn’t know a thing about how this stuff works. Ask him what his favorite online videos were and then explain how long it probably took to make each of them 

Then again, he might not even look at social media that much and his mindset is all CONTENT  CONTENTXONTENT CONTENT and there isn’t shit you can do about that
I have little knowledge on this,  but checking out klap,  I just dropped in one of our news stories into the system and it was scary fast and honestly pretty decent for a shitty little 1-minute facebook reel. A 60-second reel like that would probably take me at least an hour or 2 to create and klap did 10 versions  in under 90 seconds.

So if you're talking about taking the stuff you already cut and dropping it into this system 80 a week is doable if they're OK with those quality of versions without you needing to tweak things.
Maybe think of an exit strategy. His idea will fail. He make throw you out, because it won't work. Maybe after burning the third editir, he might realize his wrong impressions of AI output. However you will be gone.

I hope you are not that unlucky, but better be prepared.
Even if you could what would be the point?  AI’s storytelling is for shit at the moment and it’s going to take as much time iterating through generative results and correcting them as it would be having a lowly humon edit 20.  It’s also not just about editing them it takes time and $ to review, post, organize, and store all that shit.   

One up him and generate 120 absolutely garbage videos with AI and make him sort through them 😂.
Whenever I work with wonderfully ignorant people thinking they can undercut very important processes, I simply remind them that there are entire sub-industries within our industry for a reason:

“Why can’t I just hold the camera really steady? Why do I need a tripod for a locked off VFX shot?”

“Woah! Congrats. You’ve just put every tripod manufacturer out of business!”

—————————————————————————————


“This LUT pack says it’s modeled after David Fincher…why do I need to hire a DP to get that Fincher look?”

“Hold the phone! Somebody call David…we’re gonna save him so much money on his next project.”
I mean, yea it is, but they're going to be fuck awful.

If he cares nothing about quality and is OK with churning out total garbage with zero originality then it's a great idea! Why would people hire your company to make garbage when they could do it themselves?
You can try? But as a person that takes in any content if it's a.i I pass up on it, especially if it's an a.i voice or pictures, maybe the majority of people are ok with it or don't care but it's an automatic downvote from me.
Ask him to show you how.
80 videos is a lot, even just crapping them out without much quality control. However, have you tried Opus Clips? If you're taking videos that you've already done and making one minute selects and or just chopping out the fat and clipping down to 1min social length, Opus Clips is kind of perfect.

 It's preset heavy, but you can take 1920x1080 clips, drop in the the program, and it will spit out 1080x1920 clips with subs (you choose the style of animation, position, and look), and it will even split two shots into top and bottom of the frame like so many of these YouTube shorts do. 

If you're doing social content, this is actually a real secret weapon for speed. If you've already cut down your rough on the NLE, just export the QT and dump it in OPUS and 90% of the work is done. It spits it out, Meta tags, and will even write a headline based on the transcript it makes. Good luck. Hope that helps.
use Opus Clip or [Captions.ai](http://Captions.ai) to auto-generate crap edits and charge the company card for all the costs. After 2 weeks they'll switch back to doing it manually and let you take your time
Even if it was feasible, quality over quantity. If it's only for one brand where it's subclipping a podcast, is he really trying to annoy people with 80 video posts? Maybe it's more brands, it will still require back end support to organize and distribute across multiple brands to support 80 videos.

He sounds like a moron.
Tell him you'll run a test to see how many you can do in a half day, and that you can discuss his goal after that.  Let him down easy by telling him that 80 in a week leaves zero room for quality control, which I would imagine is important to him.  

I'm sure he wants these with animated captions too right?
Don't tell him he's a moron.

Hey boss: AI doesn't provide anything better than you emailing everything through chat GPT. It gives you something, but everyone can smell it's not right. 

*But…I want you to know I hear your desire.*

AI right now, shortens a certain part of the path - but *good emails get better*, not more emails.

Here's more details:: 

* The field isn't like that. There aren't tools that will "auto edit."
* I'm happy to explore any tools you like. I frequently search and actively stay up to date in communities like r/editors on Reddit. But if you think you can find a tool, please sign us up for it. I'm happy to churn things through it. The 125k pros on reddit are doing the same thing I am.
* When I use whatever tool you like, would you like me to post them via Frame or just give you access? You tell me which ones are good enough.

I'm happy to churn out 80 of them. I'm sure they'd be on the same par of quality as ChatGPT is for writing convincing copy.
at best 4 a day for 5 days (40 hours of work) is 20 shorts.
Is he going to review 80 videos a week? Christ even if you were just clipping out 60 second clips from an 80 minute timeline in linear order, exporting for socials, putting a title, and QCing, we're already at days of work, I feel like.

How long would it take him to decide which 80 videos he wanted?

Maybe point this out to him: we've been using "ai" in video for years. It helps transcribe video, helps sync clips, attempts to streamline or automate a lot of sound and color editing, theres tools like Avid's Phrase Find. From where I'm sitting, things are moving fast but at a pretty linear pace, and I haven't seen anything in the last two years that makes video editing more than marginally faster, like it is year after year.


What's his vision for these ai generated shorts? Is there a specific tool he's thinking of using? Does he want to use ai generated voices to narrate preexisting clips, and rehash a bunch of already existing content (for example?) Because you are, and already have been, leveraging ai to streamline your workflow. Unless he has a specific application to suggest, better to let you keep on keeping on, staying current with the latest technology as you always do.
I think this is a boss that needs a demonstration/ wake-up call lol.

If keeping this job is worth it, I say try his method and record every step/ hiccup you face. If he can do it better, have him show you how. If he just throws empty claims at you like, "I bet another editor can figure it out", then that sounds like a toxic environment and you should leave.
It's possible but depends on the type of content that you need to create, If you need 80 faceless type of video shorts then for example you can use [cliptalk.pro](http://cliptalk.pro) to turn scripts to video. it work by converting your text script into video shorts that has captions voice actors and visuals.  
use it but don't show it to your boss, he might replace you with that AI.
Sounds like his golf buddies planted some seeds he's trying to cash in on. Maybe he should consult with Ai before he brings this to the table next time.
What is the subject matter? Does it even merit that much content? How.much can be said about it to warrant that flood of content? And does he want quality content or just mass-produced trash?
Best I can do is 15.
Actually impossible. Even with dirt poor standards (minimal tweaking), that is unsustainable.
I said a while back after being asked my concerns over AI. the corporations and their ignorant CEOs and greed. They will do anything and everything to increase the bottom line.
Just make 4 medium/long boring videos and cut each one into 20 short ones.  “Follow to see what happens.”
He’s an idiot. He’s responsible for garbage existing in the world. You know that big island of floating garbage in the Pacific Ocean? Your boss made that. Now he wants you to grow it. So he can build a little throne on top of a big pile of garbage. On a serious note there’s no point in smashing out tons of low grade content. It’s not an effective strategy in the long term. It will provide some short term gains, but the easier the content is to produce the more it gets lost in the ocean of garbage and it dissipates because it was worthless to begin with. So do you want to have some short term visibility in a sea of garbage or do you want memorable long term equity?
Hard to say without knowing what the videos entail and how many editors are on that team. Is that 80 per person? Are these 20 second repurposed clippings? Etc Etc. 

You are probably right though haha. 80 is a lot.
I don't know any of the details around the creative or production of each video but I'm going to take a huge, scary, totally blind chance here to go out on a limb and say nooooooooooooo.
Tell your boss he’s a moron maybe
You tell your boss that while there maybe AI technology out there that will allow the creation of this number of videos each week, you would advise against it due to concerns about the quality of those videos. He then has the choice to take your advice and not move forward with the idea, or ignore your advice and move forward with it.

Trust me on this, I have had bosses like this and clients like this in my years in this business. Best you can do is lead that horse to an oasis with cool refreshing water. If it decides it would rather run out into the dessert instead, you already told them they were gonna die of thirst.
It probably is, they're just all gonna suck ass.
If your boss was a doctor, he'd think that 9 women could make a baby in 1 month.
It depends on your definition of “show” — I personally believe that my company could put out around 150 shorts per week to a social media channel of your choice. But those “shorts” are quite short and their quality would be good but not refined.
Take a day to experiment with it.  Then sit down with your boss to look over the results.  Decide together if the technology is ready for prime time, then decide what a realistic pace is.
80 a week for social media? why? thats over 11 videos a day

fuck no
Please lmk what company you work for so I can NEVER apply
Clueless motherfuckers like this.....

(the boss)
Cut 80 one-second progressive clips of a single video and release it as a series 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Throw the long form videos into opus and show him what it spits out. It will give you about 8-10 short form pieces of content but like 2-3 are somewhat useable lol. In short your boss is trippin’!
If mine asked me that I would have had a hard time not spontaneously bursting into laughter.
It’s possible if he can accept certain quality standards. 
Use Opus clips, submagic, heygen 
Having a studio helps, but heygen on its own will make it possible, or if long form shoots cuz with opus clips
It’s a bosses job to overestimate productivity. AI is just the latest tech to apply. Back when all the NLE systems were clunky tape based using 286 processors, plenty of producers thought this meant schedules would automatically shorten. Actually managing people into keeping a schedule wasn’t a consideration since directors and editors had been so good about keeping the work print based ones. 
But lo and behold, people actually used these tools to explore more possibilities and the political demands of choosing which of those to use sucked up huge amounts of time and energy. If you let more people in the rooms (which often had couches and food just down the hall, all kinds of rabbit holes opened up.
What is the niche for your videos? History/motivation niche may be possible as there are many auto generated tools which can spit out a short within 5 minutes (no need to edit as your boss had already tried to mass produce the shorts and didn't care about the quality, you can just grab the video and upload to YouTube) and YouTube can allow more than 12 shorts per day (80/7 < 12). Other niches are impossible.
I frequently have to deal with my boss giving me unreasonable requests based on his misunderstanding of AI. My approach is usually to try creating a proof of concept for what he wants and document how much time it took. When I’m done, I explain the benefits, the drawbacks, and let him view the output for himself. I usually present it as, “this is the output you can expect within the parameters you gave me. I dont think the result is perfect, but it is ultimately your decision”. He usually backs off when he sees reality
Opus clip. Quantity vs quality tradeoff
Yeah you're missing the beat to get the hell out of there, he knows nothing about it, he should be consulting you, not setting unrealistic demands, and you are not missing anything, if that's the kind of thing he wants, he just doesnt care about quality
80 posts is definitely doable if all you care about is how many "videos" were posted. 

There's AI apps that will take a long video and give you 10 cut out videos, so if boss man can record a 20-30 minute podcast everyday the AI bot can chop down 10 of them in a few minutes. It'll add text and everything. It's pretty slick. 


Now the question of - Is it any good? Eh. I'd say you get 2-3 that are ~almost~ usable right out of the can. Then you get 2-3 that could be moved around a bit and you can get something and then you get the rest which are just complete dogshit BUT will give you an idea for a native short you COULD make if you were willing to press record and riff on it's notes. 

Again though, that relies on boss man making long form content everyday to feed the AI engine or for you to have a massive backlog. If you were making this shit from scratch? Fuck no.
lol what a clown. Honestly I’m glad I picked this career path because I highly doubt AI could get close to actually editing hours of material and multiple multimedia down into a comprehensive video

There’s just way too much stuff to tinker with to accomplish such a thing

Maybe tho lol but anyways I’m rambling

For 80 shorts a week they better be paying you good.
It's possible, I make at least 84 videos a week, plus shorts, but the niche is really important here.  I can do what I do because my niche is designed for bulk uploading and simple to record and edit, and all the Mario levels I show were handmade and highly rated so there's an audience there.  I think for a lot of other niches people are going to get tired of seeing that many videos, and if you're not careful you'll repeat similar titles, thumbnails, and concepts to where nothing stands out.  A.I. can be fun but I don't think I trust the quality over that many videos without a whole lot of human intervention, and that could be quite time consuming so that 80+ goal is unrealistic.
So instead of paying you an editors rate he wants to pay for an AI specialists salary?
How much would it cost him to send you to a training course to learn how to use some AI tools that will enable you to squeeze-out loads of shit for him?
If I encountered 80yt shorts from the same channel a week, I would block that channel. That is spam. Tell him that.
Ask your boss what he's snorting and can we have some?
Ya'll need to stay far, far away from News if you think this is some impossible task no one could ever do. 20 SOT/VO or VO reels a day is pretty normal for a News editor. I cut my teeth doing this shit 15 years ago, and then jumped on the teleprompter for the broadcast.
I think you need to do one and then time how long it takes and then multiply that by 80 or whatever. Then add some padded time on top of that. To show him what’s realistic.
I don't think your boss has thought this through.

Suppose we have a magic wand which gives us an AI that can produce really great YT shorts. It's perfect and is nailing it.

We still need to find the footage it should use. We still need to prompt it such that it will know what to make. We still need to come up with a configuration. If it produces 160 YT shorts, we have to pick the best ones.

Everyone else would have access to the same AI, unless we can keep it to ourselves. I don't think we can keep it to ourselves for long in the thought experiment we are doing.

The internet would be *flooded* with crap YT shorts. This means the YT algorithm would begin selecting among all of that trash we dump onto the plate. It'll start rejecting more based on post rate, with a preference for channels which post less.

The crux is this: 80 YT shorts a week relies on a fundamental assumption that *more is good*. That is, the more you post, the higher your KPIs will be. My immediate intuition would be that this assumption is wrong. Any kind of recommender algorithm will track post cadence and use it. If your stuff gets rejected by viewers, it won't be shown to other viewers who fit the same profile. The only way to beat a recommender algorithm is to make stuff people like to view.
I’m also in Marketing and can tell you creating five social media posts per week’s already stupid, even if they’re just pics since that’s already too much content for your viewers to consume, within that short time. 

Imagine what shoving 80 videos into their faces will do…

They might not even watch one since they’ll get sick of your content, as well as think you’re crazy.

Tell your boss these points, as well as what a waste of previous time it is.

Doing so also becomes “Quantity over Quality”, meaning they’ll just be videos, not content.
So, I’ll take the other side of this argument. This is possible, I’ve been doing it for clients, and it can be incredibly lucrative but requires you to completely disregard the way true post-production works and rethink of yourself as a software enabled robot. Which I 1000% understand most people would not want to participate in. But there is a business need for it, and I don’t think it’s a great use of human energy to mindlessly edit throwaway edits. So, I’ve set about trying to solve it for my clients. 

I use tools like Airtable, zapier and frame.io and write automations for everything. 

It starts with a longer “hero” video that’s edited traditionally and then you can cut it up and/resize it with software. 

Sometimes we run an automation that makes a transcript, then sends transcript to chat gpt with a prompt to pull short highlights, then an editor uses that output and premiere transcription to relink. 

This can also be used to generate blog articles, and twitter post images (which people also want)

For some clients we made custom descript templates, with backgrounds we made in after effects, then custom caption style. If we go to a conference we’ll live edit snippets from feed with captions to post onto social minutes later. 

I have found that there is incredible money in operational excellency selling these content packages to B2B clients. It’s tripled my income as a freelancer. But if I was an employee not paid for output… never would have set that system up for someone.
Sure, with AI and very low standards, one could make 80 pretty terrible YouTube videos in a day 30 min each.

Whatever he’s pay isn’t worth the corrosion to your soul the effort would require.
my question would be what would 80 shit AI videos accomplish that 10 high quality videos wont?
Check out HeyGen.ai URL to UCG feature
Run, don’t walk away.
I think I know this guy. I survived 3 weeks.

If long term employment with this kind of personality is important to you, ask him to send you the information he has about "80 video per week AI video production" so you can do the necessary research...

The problem is, people like this are looking for reasons to not need people like you, and that should be all you need to start exploring other horizons.

Sorry 😞
Well your boss clearly knows something you don't, maybe he should do a demo instead of talking out his ass
Very easy doing interview based stuff with opus. Anything else not really
I'm a photographer and I've been training faces with SD and generating photos of my clients pro-photoshoot style for a couple years now. 

People don't realize that what I do (at the level of quality that I do it) takes the same amount of time as a real irl photoshoot. The magic is that I can do it remotely for anyone in the world, and there are zero limits to the clients appearance, environment/location, wardrobe, background, pose, expressions, weather, camera/lens, etc. 

Ai in a professional setting should not be about speed, but about the opportunities it opens.
Hell, they had me doing this way back in 2009. I edited so much, a giant thing formed on my wrist from joint fluid.  
I don't condone any kind of mass editing, but certainly the ai tools will streamline the process once you come up with a couple formulas or patterns, and learn the limitations of said ai.
Tell your boss he’s a dumbass
Just the logistics of processing 80 YouTube videos, not even creating them, is a monumental task
Warms my heart knowing people can fail upwards in this industry.

Seriously though, have him walk you through the process if he’s so sure about it. He’ll probably drop it pretty quickly.
So, 30 minutes per video.  I guess it depends on what you’re doing, there is no indication in the original post.
How is he in charge of a post production operation?
I’ve build an app that does our editing. It can be done! Automated.
Sounds good! You get paid by the video, right?
80 videos of what exactly? This is absolutely batshit unless it’s like ai generated Tik toks about random facts or something but still unless it’s really interesting what’s the point?
Try it.
>they all think that if they get a DropBox account, everyone is editing in real time for very little money…


I love this detail.    It explains Bob’s drunken rage posts.
Thank you for your perspective. I feel your frustration and empathize a great deal
Keep fighting the good fight ✊🏼
This is the worst, but I can relate. My company tried this, during Covid   It was so bad, and I felt sorry for our IT team.
These people are so horny to replace workers with AI and don't even understand how llms work lol
He wants us to take videos we have made in standard format and plug them into Klap or Descript and thinks it will shit out a perfectly formatted video for socials. Having tried the trial versions of both of those I feel confident in saying even in the BEST case scenario still has us having to trim and make adjustments
This is the real advice. I started out in Real Estate editing my first day I busted out like 8 house videos, all with music graphics (it was all cookie cutter but definitely took time) My co-worker next to me basically told me to slow the fuck down and that was the best advice I could ever get. The company was perfectly happy with me getting 5 videos done a day, some days even less
Remember Scotty's Law. 

If it will take an hour, say it will take 2, so when you finish in 1 its a miracle. Otherwise you have padding to fix shit and still come out on time. 

This is how I never missed a deadline.
Yes absolutely do it in front of them
Nah, ride it out. 

Get fired. 

Collect unemployment. 

Open up freelance at 10x current salary.

 Offer services to Boss. 

Profit and win.
Took the words right out of my mouth lol
☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻 This!
I checked some other YT channels just to get some context, and ones that post most frequently post MAYBE 4 a day, but it's usually like podcasts that offer more opportunities to do that.
I wonder how many views these shorts even get on the channel, I’m imagining this I some corporate YouTube channel that gets 17 views per short especially with that many uploads
*Delivers 9000 astronauts looking away at changing skies, cuts to the same AI chick, then a furry overly cute animal with changing texture and sound styles*
I think he really only cares about views, not so much retention. But we've been posting one video a day for about a month and our  channel has grown by about 500% in terms of views, and if I had to guess he just thinks more videos means that number will skyrocket
Maybe. I own 60,000 AI images that I generated in 8 weeks manually.  That’s a one man effort.

That’s a slice of what AI assets I own.
I tried it as well, and it gave me 5 videos 3 of them were essentially the same video. If I could just shrink the video down into the frame and add the blurred background it wouldn't take very long, and we have a davinci plug in for captions. I think if the number was way lower the quality would be better, but it would drop drastically if he is hard set on 80. Thank you for taking the time to try it out and offer your feedback, much appreciated!
I just tried Opus and it spit out four videos that look exactly the same, only with captions now. It didn’t even edit out the chair creaking.
I will definitely look into this. Even if I can bring him down from 80 videos, anything that might help speed up the process regardless will be a good asset to have. Thank you!
I'm positive he wants the captions
This is a very thoughtful response and approach. I am more or less going to use this method. But to your point about the quality of chatgpt emails, he actually writes some emails using it and doesn't seem to think anyone can tell the difference, so I'm not sure how it will be received.
Not bad at all if you ask me. But what do I know, since apparently 80 is an option 🤷🏼‍♂️
Two editors on the team. These 80 would be on top of the other standard format videos we create each week. He wants to take our finished videos and plug them into Descript or Klap and thinks they push out perfectly formatted videos.
I guess I could use AI to help me figure out a way to say that as professionally as possible
Brilliant! 🤣
I don't want to get too specific about what kind of videos so as to not give away any details, but let's just say it's manufacturing. We make marketing videos that utilize footage we've filmed ourselves plus stock footage and custom motion graphics/text animations. Some videos are 2-3 mins, some are longer. In my opinion, not a topic that warrants 80 videos a week
Whether or not my pay is good is probably up for debate 🤣
Karma bump for the reality bump.
Someone quoted me high assuming I couldn’t afford their service. They used their work with Kanye West as their premier marketing tool. That didn’t age so well 18 months later.
Yes, apart from all the other practical comments here, the prime beef is, as you say, gathering adequate CONTENT. THAT takes time, as does VIEWING it, and making judgements as to what is actually usable.  But I was a TV trailer-maker, always looking for "moments" in two-hour films, so probably a million miles from what is being discussed here.  The briefs demanded and described here make me shudder!
This is very interesting. Thanks for your perspective and for sharing your method and experience. I do agree that if we're selling this as a freelancer it could be very lucrative, but as an hourly employee I definitely don't want to go the "software robot" route, as you put it. But I will definitely be looking into some of the methods and tools you mentioned. Thanks again!

This is probably worth asking on my end

I am "Bob's drunken Dropbox rage."
You must be young. They aren’t rage posts. Just the honest thoughts from someone with experience who very much knows WTF they’re doing and is forced to interact with ignoramuses.
I don't feel bad at all. I not only tried this, but my clients got RANSOMWARE during this process during Covid.  I WAS THE IDIOT.  But like I always say - if you don't FAIL, then you don't learn anything.  And I learned - I learned about Tailscale, Zerotier, Jump Desktop, Parsec, and Teradici. 

But with all of that said (and now with the wonderful addition of LucidLink to our toolbox) - that is not CHEAP enough to company owners, who say " wait - why can't I just spend $100, and have free storage forever, and have all my remote editors, edit FOR FREE on the cloud". 

These are the people that I want to kill.   Because all that matters - is that they can buy their daughter that is graduating from high school a new BMW - not run their business, not give you a raise.  And I have NO PROBLEM if they want to buy themselves a new Maserati - they run the company - they deserve it - they employ you - but when it's THEIR CHILDREN, and they feel that THEIR CHILDREN deserve a new BMW, instead of giving you a $25,000 raise - well, they only deserve this - go freelance, or get a new job, and STEAL THEIR CLIENTS - the only thing I want to hear when I am dying is "daddy - all my friends have nice cars - why can't you buy me a nice car ?" - THEN I WILL DIE HAPPY.

Wtf is Klap?  Sounds like something grandpa got overseas in a war.
Minvo has worked pretty well.  If you have it output 10 videos from a 15 minute edited video a few will be decent.  

[https://minvo.pro](https://minvo.pro)

  
If you have a huge backlog of content you might be able to get out 80 clips a week by just uploading a few long form videos on Friday before you leave for the day, then on Monday download everything and pull out anything remotly good and load those into your social scheduling upload program.

  
If I were your boss I would ask myself "Does anyone want to see 80 clips from me or my company a week"

  
That's 11.4 clips per day if you include the weekend.  I think people are probably just going to ignore content from that uploader if they're pumping out that much.
I mean, if it really is just reframing 16x9 to 9x16 in 60 second bursts, it's mind numbing but not really out of the question.  If you have to subtitle as well, could get quite a bit slower.
If you're leveraging content you have already made, and just need to flip the aspect ratio and make it short format. By memory ffmpeg can do this for you.
what about like premiere auto reframe
How long were these videos? Man, 8 videos sounds like a lot if each video is around 6-8 minutes long
Or in case boss has already failed and had to close down shop, hire boss and fire boss for not being productive enough.
This guy gets it
If he can’t work hard enough to deliver, why would someone like me line his pockets? Owning your own business isn’t twice as easy, it’s four times harder. Telling editors to kick rocks is a hobby. 

The only editor I met this week that I’d hire is deeply vested in his own struggle as an entertainment producer. I deflected him, but even so, he’s the only candidate in the back of my mind. We’re going into business on another thing. Once I have cash flow on my new thing, he is green lit to assume my previous promo load for close to the money he would have asked for. The people I sent away will probably have pivoted 2 or 3 times in the meanwhile or given up without success.
Yeah, I literally cannot imagine why you’d want to make that many shorts regardless. You’ll get unsubscribes for blowing up peoples notifications
Then maybe ask him what he wants to achieve with 80 videos a week and fix that problem instead?
Yeah the story I dropped in was just under 3-minutes long, 10 versions, all were similar since 10 1-minute videos coming from the same 3-minute source. 60/100 Virality score, rest were 20 or under, whatever that means. Like I said if they're just looking to flood the system I think 80 is possible depending on how much you currently put out. And that would be without having to do much tweaking, but if they're going to nitpick every video, definitely not realistic. Makes me REAL happy we got AI generated content protections in our union contract this last negotiation.
What a douche canoe.
Tell him about his toupee…gently. Yes, we can tell his ChatGPT responses if he doesn't rewrite them.

Do what he says and show him the results
I'm pretty sure you can tell AI to do that and have it done in minutes!

Sometimes Bob is the only light in my darkness. Whenever I'm reading a reply and think "this guy gets it" half way through, it always turns out to be Bob.
lol.  It was not meant as a criticism.   Just a bit of ribbing.  Not all his posts are about technical issues.  Some are hilarious drunken rants.

Also, not young.
Definitely not the best product name if you ask me haha
It's slang for crabs where I live lol
Sensational!
You nailed it. Video content this dumpy is ignored by humans. Sure the social platforms say "video out performs" but when its shit... it's shit.
Minvo is the way to go. But if you think you'll just download the output you're crazy. I cut my podcast from 1 hour to 5 clips in about 2-3 hours. (Rendering before export takes a lot of time, and the quality isn't that crisp. I also add an overlay and resizing images in Minvo isn't straightforward.) Captioning is pretty simple in Minvo. The interface is browser based so it isn't the snappiest and scrolling on the timeline is cumbersome. AppSumo has a lifetime deal for.minvo for like 60 bucks. Minvo is the piece you're missing. You can get 80 clips out but some may be redundant. Another tool I use is AutoPod. It's a premiere extension that  takes horizontal video and auto reframes it to vertical. It still takes trimming and editing but these are two ways to maybe get close to that number.
Oh... If it really is just one graphic....  If it really is just lowering the audio.... If it really is just adding a fade at the head and tail off each clip....  If it really is that you don't have the budget this time, but next week when you land that multi million dollar project you're going to hire my company to do the whole thing and it's going to be magnification!!!! 

Should I continue???
I did video commercials from now until December with no sound in one day. Same with digital print ads and physical print ads. I used a template that I built ground up, altered the event date and I’m using different music for each week in a a carousel.

 It really depends. Honestly, men these days are doing what was considered ladies work when I was born, but to them it’s normalized and normal. I carried a pistol for work and collected money in Detroit for years, so to me editing a lot of videos is easy. My grandfather was a wildcatter, and was wielding a 4 foot chainsaw into his 60s in the Ozark mountains. He was a 1% and didn’t have to do that. But like Sinatra, he did it his way.
They averaged around 3 to 4 minutes. It was mostly just pan left pan right add music, proper branding and do minor color correction when needed. We had higher end videos for more expensive properties that would take more time. These were for your average run of the mill homes.
Gets what? Fired?
Hey could you give me the link to your hustle culture advice and vague inspirational bullshit TikTok again
Actually with the way YouTube works I think that you still wouldn't get any
This is the only real answer.
[removed]
So spot on lol
Fair enough. Every now and then I also find myself thinking Bob is a crotchety old man, and almost without variation I get a call the next day that reinforces all his points and makes me feel like Danny Glover in every Lethal Weapon.

The more time passes, the more I see wisdom in the cautionary comments of those with more experience than I have.
Where everyone lives
Posting that much is kind of the equivalent of junk mail.
I think the Minvo app sumo deal is gone.
Are you some sort of wierd copypasta troll account?
I do real estate videos and I'll tell you now, 3-4 mins is LONG. The attention span of someone even getting to the end is probably slim to none. I do 1:00-1:30 with aerials and even having the realtor Mic'd up and in the video. 



You could seriously trim those down and the fact that you were doing 8 or even 5 in a day is kind of insane.
Not interested

Uh I love bob as much as the next editor but no, the man is frankly insane, he believes life is nothing but a battle to learn enough to beat out the others to make big money so he can take his wife to nice dinner and any pain or sorrow from such a brutal and shallow life is to be buried in alchohol or drugs. I mean, he's completely right but uh
Nope, Crabs and the Clap are two different ailments..... And I'm going to just shut up now and fall back on the 5th amendment....
Exactly. Its spam.. and not the salty, tasty kind
Shame. Shouldn't matter anyway OPs boss sounds like he thinks these tools would be free anyway.
It’s to the point that whoever is paying for your services is a working man or woman who bled to be able to hire you. Juxtapose that with a black turtle neck, French press coffee maker and a $50 haircut that they’re paying for. 

It’s not too much to ask if someone is dropping $2,000-$5,000 per month on services. Work is hard, sometimes impossible. They want to get what they’re paying for. Even if they ask a lot, it’s likely reasonable. 

Plenty of people have asked me to pay them for cake jobs. That’s not being a troll, that’s being someone who can afford to actually pay you. And, I’ve been teaching myself editing to get exactly what I want.
Why, because I’m a working man?
Can I dm you?
Ha! I read the first part of that and was like "and...?"
I'm kinda having the same impression of a guy. Don't mean you can't learn from him tho :)
Whoops I got my stds mixed up
No, not because you are a working man. Because in a single comment about video editing you talking abot your grandpa wildcatting and carrying a pistol for work. And Sinatra. Its fine to mention those things but they were all so out of left field for a comment on r/editors that it seems like a troll comment.

If i was on a wildcatting subreddit and a comment mentioed video editing, icecream trucks and the matrix movie i would ALSO be suspicious the commenter was trolling.
Hahahahahah
Sure
Ooooooooofff!!! Don't do that.
It’s called having a personality. It’s unfortunate it brought up your insecurities and caused some form of distress.
I used free packs, free fonts and $40 worth of adobe.  The music I licensed cost the most. And, it wasn’t that much. Of course I’ve invested some months of time to be able to do that.
Kind of speaks to the state of the world.  He saw someone who actually works for a living and thought I was some kind of alien. Instead of picking up on the fact I could spin up an event in 10 days and handle the years video and print promos myself, instead of the $2,000+ bids that would not be delivered yet.
DM sent, thank you
Lowest paying clients ask for the MOST
I'm an experienced freelance editor. I work 100% remote and this past year I've found a wide-variety of new clients -- many who found me via the internet somehow. One of these new clients booked me on a flat project fee (my preferred method... if the fee is high. It's a slippery slope, but if you play it JUST right everyone is usually happy. You knock it out of the park quickly, you feel amazing you got paid a high hourly. Project drags on and on... well at least the fee is high and maybe you charge more next time or never work with that client again). However this new client's project fee was SUPER low. I took it on thinking this would be quick and easy project and maybe just a good way to start a recurring client relationship. And now we're in that not-good place of them asking for A LOT MORE than my highest paying clients. Graphics, endless revisions, meetings, etc. I should have set more boundaries when we made the deal -- you live and you learn. Just came here to vent. The lowest paying clients will always ask for the most. High paying clients asking for more shit.... well in the words of Don Draper "that's what the money is for!"
This has been my exact experience in the 20 years that I’ve been editing with a few exceptions like doing work for friends of mine (at a bargain) that actually respect the fact that they are getting what they pay for (or better since we are friends). But yeah, aside from those few instances, every client I’ve had that is low paying expects the world, and the project always drags on and on and on and on with endless revisions. When things are slow I’ve had people ask me “why don’t you just pick up small jobs here and there? There’s gotta be some local places that need some video work done”. And I always respond saying that the time I put into those projects always outweighs what I get paid by a large margin so I’m basically losing money, especially if those projects that I commit to get in the way of better work that comes along. It sounds crazy, but when things are slow sometimes I’ll just quit working entirely and pursue other things like working on my car or house or doing an inexpensive hobby until work picks up again. Of course if things get really rough and it looks like I won’t be able to pay the bills then I’ll start picking up cheaper work even though I don’t want to.
I never do flat fee. BBBUUUTTT if I did, you'd bet that I would have a limited number of revisions. 
“No,” is a complete sentence. And we’ve all forgotten to use it with clients before. After 5 years as a freelancer, I’m starting to learn the difference between a cheap client and a respectful low-budget client. The cheap client will never be happy and always complaining about how much it costs, and it’s never worth working for them.

But I have found a few low-budget clients that are worth working with, because they respect me and my time.

But even with them, I clearly outline the scope and time requirements before I start work. I’ve been through enough situations like yours to get some form of contract for every gig, because it makes a good weapon against the cheap clients.
Usually my projects include 2 rounds of revisions in the flat fee then go to a HIGH hourly rate for changes beyond that which discourages indecision and asking for changes they aren't sure about, or not compiling all changes at once when asking for a revision.
This is why you need to set up a contract with a clear definition of your deliverables

IMO if a new client doesn't have a lot of money, then you need to be dominant with them. "Oh, this is all you can afford? Then let me explain what you can get for that" And then stick to that plan
Yup. This is 100% on you, but we’ve all made that mistake.  Now you’ve learned, and won’t make it again.  If you’re going to do flat rate jobs, you need very clearly defined terms and expectations.
It's often solo-preneurs with low budgets who are spending their own limited budget who are going to nitpick and work to get as close to exactly what they think they want.  It's a lot more impactful/personal for them when it comes out of their money that, even if coming from a business account, is basically 1 to 1 money they could personally have had for food, vacation, videogames, etc.  It's going to cost $400 more?  "I could have bought a PS5 with that money!"  

Whereas someone in a larger org just makes sure it fits inside a maximum budget alotted, and if so, they spend it.  Means very little difference to them.  It's not their money.  It's also more work for them to nitpick.
👏👏👏👏This is the edit that never ends👏👏👏👏
Cheap clients cause 80% of the headache and make up 20% of the revenue
I’ve heard the expression that you’re lowest price is someone’s highest budget

so to them and their budget they’re paying a lot so they expect a lot. 

It sucks because you want to help everyone but it’s just not worth helping people who barley have the money to afford help.  
Wait til that friend making the zero budget indie asks you to do it for free
Exactly why I always charge by the hour.
Yep. The clients with a lot of money to throw around aren't going to scoff at a high fee. The ones who need to nickel & dime are going to squeeze as much value as they can out of every penny.
Of course. On unprofessional jobs, as the the pay diminishes the amount of work increases by the inverse square.
Remember, clients are paying for your experience, not your time. 

And yes, lowest paying and even pro bono are absolutely our least efficient jobs. Our $75k+ jobs will usually get approved on the first pass. They tend to defer to us on creative and really only care about the content.
The low paying clients (usually) are paying low because that's all the money they can spend, which means they feel like they need to get the most out of their investment. If you think from their perspective they feel like they're really maxing themselves out to get this project so they are very critical with how it turns out. It's a mindset that to us doesn't make sense because we see it as low paying... but to them they're stretching themselves. 

But, sounds like you learned the lesson. Define a scope of work up front. Lay out something like 3 revision rounds etc etc.
To add to that: Every time I had a potential client ask me to come visit their facilities and meet them and tour the place, I would go. Not one time did those meetings result in work. Just a waste of my time and gas. If I could go back I would never ever go visit a potential client. Maybe they met me and thought I was a jerk, who knows.
That's the case for so many businesses/industries. 
I believe it was 4 HOUR WORK WEEK that suggested it's okay to fire problematic clients; and the customer is not always right.
The premise is that 20% of your clients bring in 80% of your revenues when you average out for time spent on their projects. 
So, firing your client is actually helping your business.
This is a great thread. Composers go through *exactly* the same issues. More and more I've leaned towards flat fee with limited number of revisions.
This is slightly topic divergent, but I think this can have bearing on how to deal with clients, whether it's the "cheap"  or the "Those that try and Cheap Out" on us. That and it's just good solid advice for those that are Freelance! 

 https://youtu.be/jVkLVRt6c1U?si=4a1a5cNenI5p_lvi
So true very true.
The people willing to pay more usually have a better idea of what they want and what's required to accomplish that.  The also realize the value of getting out of the way of the professionals they hire instead of meddling too much undermining their efforts.
"That is not within the scope of the current budget"

😀

Its hard man but just cos you did a buy out (as we sometimes call it), doesn't mean sell out !

"That's beyond reasonable scope for this type of project". Bit harsher but oh well
One hundred perfect truth
Yep. I found this out a few years ago, and it's not always about the money. The most untalented actor or singer will have the most demands and will be the hardest to work for/with. Returning to money, I even understood the logic behind the problem. The high paying customer has money and thinks that if he pays enough you know your job and what you have to do and he's not stressed about the money. The low paying customer pays so low because he actually can't afford it. Those money are all he has so he is desperate to make the most of it. I won't work with this kind anymore. I prefer to do nothing or exercise than to have a headache.
Sorry to hear your ordeal, but Freelance editing is unfortunately not a respected profession since people think it’s as easy as clicking a clips here and there to get Steven Spielberg quality. 

Plus, 90% of clients are egoistic small business owners only wanting to pay $10(or even nothing) for $100 quality work. 

I’ve been freelance for sometime and almost every inquirer ask if I can charge less than $30 for professional work, lol. 

Worst one was a musician who tried tricking me into editing his music video for free, as he always ignored my reminders to pay a depot fee for starting his project. 

He just bragged about his hundreds of YouTube subscribers whenever I asked, like saying I can just work for an achievement of working for a “big” YouTuber.

But, he eventually ghosted me since I didn’t stop asking for my fee. 😂
I’ve worked for a non-profit before and because I have experience in the media industry, my role required me to be the liaison for media vendors, such as editors. 

Unfortunately I realised very early on that my non-profit always expected so much from the editor even though we paid very little.  

The reason was because for a non-profit, that very tiny amount is actually A LOT of money for us. And when we decide to spend that money on services such as video production, we are essentially investing in something that we hope to be a huge return in value and therefore we’re overly anxious about it.

It wasn’t a good position for me because I understand how shitty it is for the editor, but I also empathised with how much that little money means to my company.

In the context of outputting a social media video for example, for a bigger paying client, this is probably just 5% of their campaign budget and is one of the many outputs they have lined up.

For the smaller companies, they’re probably stretching it to 70% of their overall campaign budget and it’s that same social media video is their main campaign item so the expectations is very different. 

This doesn’t make things any less shittier for editors such as yourself, but that experience definitely made me understand why clients can act this way.
Haha.  When I started in post 24 years ago that's exactly what my boss told me: "The less money they have, they bigger pain in the ass they are."   And it's SO true.    

When the big budgets come in, those are usually seasoned clients who have been put in charge, and things tend to go much easier.  They know what they want, what it will take, and how to budget for it.
If the project balloons on you because the client starts asking for more and more, it’s time to say, “This isn’t the project I originally agreed to. We need to start over and negotiate a new deal.” I learned this one the hard way. Also, if a client wants to bargain you down from your normal rate, you can always offer fewer services in return - fewer revisions, simpler graphics, stock instead of original, whatever. This respects your rate, so you’re not just doing everything you normally do, but for less money. (If they want to / have to pay less, they’ll get less.) Last, consider putting together a standard “bargain package” to offer low-budget clients. Defined limits to TRT, editing time, graphics and animation, and a hard deadline for delivery. Just some ideas.
I can't see how a flat rate could ever be beneficial. Please switch to day rates, charging overtime after 10 hours and double on weekends. Stop working for free.

For projects you can complete quickly, slow down and take your time, even if it doesn't actually take that long. If you work too fast, you'll be taken advantage of. Your top speed will become the expectation, and anything less may be seen as disappointing. You don't want to be working at 100% everyday.
Couldn’t agree more. Small budgets aren’t worth the time, although there are plenty of exceptions to this rule. Small projects typically come through people who have little experience hiring out video production, and a lot of the inefficiency comes from this. 

This exact idea has me thinking about a small 2nd stream of income that can be easily turned on or off in between projects. Something that has nothing to do with sitting in front of a computer.
Low flat fee = 1 round of revisions.... I always look at the experience level of the client and the back end, where the revisions hit the fan! 🤣
That's because to the client, their spend is a lot of money, so they're super high touch. Think about it on their end and you'll understand the behavior. But please realize I'm not excusing it - merely explaining it.
I recently went tbrough the exact same story as OP's, but it was the respectful type you mention. At some point I mentioned that the project has gone a bit beyond the original scope (a hyperbole) and if it's OK, I will ask for an additional amount. They not only agreed, but were so appreciative that they even added a bonus on top of that when it came time to pay 
Usually doesn’t stop them from asking for more though. But it _does_ mean you have something to point to when you decline to do it, without charging more.
I mean, that’s the old model when an agency or production company is paying you. That’s not the YouTube/Riktok model.
Funny, I just said the same thing before scrolling down. I agree. Think about where they're coming from.
I feel the same way about most meetings. 
So much of the stuff you could cover in a quick zoom call or an email.
Actually, I prefer in person meetings or anything where I could talk to them face-to-face or via telephone. I feel it’s easier to relate to people this way, plus visiting their facilities gives you a good idea of their own level of experience, expectations of quality, etc. Before a meeting, I’ve had prospective clients and colleagues take me for a tour of their facilities, and they’ve introduced me to other people working for them. Try to make a good impression and this gives you even more contacts if you want to pursue work with the prospective client.
This 100%. They are paying for your experience, not time and materials. 

Similar to a plumber who charges you $250 for something that took 15 minutes. It’s all about knowing what valve to turn.
This take is highly dependent on what market you work in. I do a lot of indies because that's what's available where I live. Most producers will only deal in flat rates. Set boundaries and stick to them. I quietly track time as if I'm being paid hourly and I have asked for overages before, although I am careful to tie it to changes in the scope of the project. On some projects I've worked slightly cheaper than I'd like, but on others I've made more than the market day rate. When I do work on a day rate, it's almost always based on a time estimate which is in practice very similar to working on a flat rate.
>I can't see how a flat rate could ever be beneficial. 

This reallllyyyy depends. 

What a flat rate ultimately does is shift complexity AND risk away from your client and on to you. Effectively, that turns you into a post producer, not an editor. 

If you don't want to handle that, certainly don't try. And it takes a lot of experience to accurately quantify the risk and read the client correctly. 

BUT it can be extremely lucrative if you know what you are doing with it. So many clients would much rather not have the complexity OR take the risk. Let's say you are doing a monthly sales video for a large client, you are a really fast cutter, have their style down pat and 11 times a year it takes you 2 days, there's essentially one revision, it goes smoothly. But about once a year their CMO decides to get involved and blows up a video and it takes you a week. 

One way to do it would be to just charge whatever time you have into it... but it essentially penalizes you for being fast, and the sales team doesn't know really how to budget that expense for the year. The other way to do it is to flat rate them at like 4x your day rate. You will be making double what you would have on 11 videos a year, and perhaps coming out a little behind on that 1 video a year, but that's why you charge what you charge on the other 11. 

This sounds like what u/DD_Editor is doing with most of their work. This was just a play that didn't work out for them. Super frustrating, but that's the deal when working with flat rates. I think their point was more that low rate clients regardless of pay type can be the most pain in the ass. Which, ya know, preach.
Whenever I give anyone a bargain rate, because I like the project or it’s a new director I’m working with I’ll make a typical estimate in full price and add a discount to make it within their budget for 3 rounds of revisions. I explain that if it goes beyond the revisions quoted I have to charge my full day rate for any additional rounds. 

One, they see that they are getting a deal and you are helping them not the other way around. Two, if they truly don’t have the money they will damn well make sure it’s locked by round three
That's great advice. I'm just now getting into editing for people other than myself. 
I'm working with a team of partners right now and they're driving me crazy with edits.
I understand that explanation just fine. But I think that the neediness has nothing to do with how much money is being spent. It’s about them wanting to feel ownership over every aspect of their lives, and needing to have power over people they hire. I’ve watched people in $250k cars complain to me about costing them “$1 a minute!” also berate a cashier over not having enough onion on their $5 fast food burger.

Counterpoint, when I bought my house I wasn’t as needy with my realtor as cheap clients are with me. I didn’t check in every hour to see whether the HOA had approved us yet. I was told it could take 5 days, and I waited for my realtor to tell me it was all good. She’s the professional, I’m paying her to worry about it so I don’t have to.
Yeah, I’ve got a few clients like that. One will give me projects with budgets as small as $100. It’s easy stuff I can turn super fast, and he knows I’m doing it between other jobs. He’s just thankful to have someone who can get it done quickly instead of fumbling through it himself. And if I ever tell him I’m too busy, it’s not an issue.

That’s why I’ve started separating them in my thinking. Low-budget means they don’t have much money. They’re willing to spend what it costs, but their reality doesn’t allow them to do that. So they spend what they can and are thankful to have professional help.

Then there’s cheap. The ones who probably could afford real rates, but want to haggle just to exert power. And then complain about everything every step of the way. And then dominate your time like giving you a rate for a day means they own you for the whole month. I don’t work with cheap clients. And the couple times I thought someone was low budget and turned out to cheap, I left the project as quickly as I could.
Exactly

It's normal for a client to ask for more. That isn't a bad thing, that's how you make a good product. Sometimes you get the perfect idea partway through the project. The problem is when they don't respect your time and effort

Good clients ask for new things all the time, they just don't complain if it costs more and/or requires a delivery extension
Like  I said, it’s probably me. But I work for an institution now doing video and I don’t have to worry about that stuff anymore.
I've had those sessions... Editing by committee never ends well. The only real one way I've ever heard of, to stop it dead in its tracks.... Find the Boss, or figure out who is in charge of this edit. Trust me, it will come down to falling in one person's lap if the project goes down the shitter.... Find that person and corner them for the answers you need to get the job done. This is a last ditch effort to get ahold of your runaway train so to speak of. Good luck and hold on tight. I've had to actually lock them in the room with me alone and everyone else outside.
Agreed about the neediness. 
It permeates their entire lives.
Well there are Karen clients too...
I've been stuck in the past with recurring work for a cheap client as my only source of income, so I know the type all too well. Not. Fun.
Yes, I understand.  When I was on staff I never had to deal directly with meeting prospective clients myself.  Only maybe sometimes after the business relationship was already established by the sales team and/or business development people.
My first feature film edit is going to theaters
Yeah, it’s a short run in only 4 states but I never thought I would see this happen. The film is a rom-com (not my usual genre) but I’m proud of my work on it.

Now I’m not posting this to try and brag or anything. I’m on this sub every day and there is a lot of doom and gloom about how there aren’t jobs out there and it’s getting harder and harder to find work. A sentiment that I often share.

I was laid off from my agency editing job just over a year ago. My intention was to find more full time work, and I applied for everything. And the calls never came. I couldn’t figure out why, I had never had a problem before.

So I started looking for freelance work, I had to work on my networking skills (I had none) and slowly the work started to show up. Just here and there at first, and then as I started working with more people, I started to get referred more often… and now this weekend I’m editing for The Hollywood Reporter up at Sundance. 

So I guess what I’m saying to other editors that are at the same level of the game as me, keep going, do good work, make friends at every gig you get and it can happen. I thought my editing career was over and now I’m hitting life goals. It feels like things are going to keep going up from here.

As a treat, here’s the trailer for the film, which I also edited.

https://youtu.be/KRzUaSQUMpU?si=PJRfoShLdwUx5fhr

edit: just changed some language

Update: Remember what I said about networking and making friends at every gig? By the time I left the THR job today the VP of video, who I’m working for, was already asking me if I would be available for more work.
This is not a brag it’s inspirational. I def wanna be where you are some day! I can feel my work picking up and my skills getting sharper. Nice job man. Only way from here is up.

Also rom coms are the best! Haha it looks cute
Dude. Don't publically disparage any project you worked on. What if your producer or studio (etc., yadayada) saw this post?  Keep your work opinions amongst friends and peers you trust.  Just some advice from a vet.
Nice job! I have edited several low-budget features and it's my favorite kind of work. It's always exciting when they are being seen!

Congratulations!
Congrats!
Congrats, mate. Hope you live someplace where you can go see it on the big screen! 

If you don't mind, tell us a little more about the project. How did you get involved with this one? Your experience (with details!) might help some of these younger folks on how to get started. 

It looks like a lower budget, but by all means not micro, feature. Good choice by the filmmaker to keep the locations way way down. Smart. Reminds me (in approach) to Reservoir Dogs. If you are creative with your locations, you can pack a lot of value into a small budget.
Congratulations! Thats awesome!
I appreciate this. Congrats and thanks for posting!
Congrats!  I had my first big screen credit this summer & am currently working on my next. As lame as it was, I still posed & pointed at my name as it passed in the theatre for a photo that my mom put in the Christmas letter & I wouldn’t have it any other way.
Good job keep it up!
Congrats that’s great ! You’re motivating us all !
Congratulations!
Congratulations! Good to know good things are happening out there!
Looks interesting, congrats!
This looks cute OP, good on ya!
Awwwwww! I loved the trailer. Esp the water balloon sync with the high hat. Nice work!!! And congrats. Your journey is super inspirational too.

This is insanely american bravo
Congratulations! What a cool turn of events. Any big takeaways from your first?
   
I cut and colored my first feature (a romcom), finally it released theatrically, and ended up going to #19 at the US box office… sure it was *June 2020*… But I won’t let the details ruin it :)
Congrats! If you haven’t experienced it yet, seeing your work on the big screen is both the most thrilling and humbling thing. I hope this leads to more work for you!
Congratulations.
Congrats and thank you for sharing.
Congratulations brother, always celebrate this types of wins!!
Amazing!! Congratulations!
Congratulations!! I’m very happy for you
Congrats on the film, but also thank you for the ray of hope. I've been pretty depressed about my career so far (stuck in a small dead-end situation editing low-budget commercial work).

It's inspiring to see someone head off back into the freelance world and find success, I'm always daydreaming about this but I can never get myself to pull the trigger because I'm afraid of losing my 9-5 and the stability that comes with it.
Heck yeah! There’s just nothing like seeing your name up on the big screen. And when it’s just your name up there, you’ve done yourself proud. 

Congratulations.
This is so awesome! Congratulations.
Great post, thank you and congratulations!!!
Great job and great advice!
Wow! I watched the trailer and it was so cool. I cannot wait for the day when my editing skills will be at this level for my YouTube channel
That looks adorable!

And I was also laid off a year ago and have had trouble finding work. Never had trouble before. This job market is the worst.
This Is amazing, I'm so happy for you!
Did he edit it out? As of now he’s says nothing bad about it at all
I totally will give some more details but I have to get through this job this weekend first. Long days and hard work!
Ahhh. That’s so cool! Congratulations!
Aw thank you. I appreciate that! I actually got to direct a couple scenes and the water balloon fight is one of them. And now I also have a 2nd unit director credit.
Insanely American is the best description. Thats so funny.
Congratulations to you too! Thats awesome! Celebrate the wins! Not many people can say they’ve done the thing you did!
Thank you! I sure hope so too. Making movies is all I’ve wanted to do since I was 6.
It makes me so happy that my words have managed to do that for you. It’s hard out there for sure. And by no means am I out of the woods. The money still isn’t even close to what I was making at my 9-5 and I’m not as young as I used to be. Freelance is stressful and hard. I’m still not even sure that I’m cut out for it. But I’m riding this wave and it’s working.
I did. He was right.
That's fantastic! I'm happy for you! =D

Talitha Hanks rawks! She singlehandedly lifts the whole trailer - brings some sort of X factor in.
Hey Mac Users! No, you should NOT upgrade to OSX 15 Sequoia
Yeah, it should go without saying…but I'm counting the days before someone posts Avid/Adobe/Whatever has stopped working because they upgraded the OS.

Wait. *Wait some more*.

Wait until *at very least* Apple has released at 15.0.1 **and** (whatever tool you use) has done a dot release.

Taking your working system and making it *"not working"* just to have the latest OS…is nearly always a mistake. Let someone else make this mistake.

And if you can stand it… Please go into your Mac's settings and turn OFF Auto Update.
no. i want to run a beta on a beta and then complain why nothing works. and you can't stop me!
Gives me bad flashbacks to when Microsoft pushed an update that forced my remaining windows computers to "upgrade" to windows 11 even though autoupdate was disabled. 

Waking up to that was an Invasion of the Body Snatchers moment.
It should be standard practice to just look at the [Media Composer Version Matrix](https://avidtech.my.salesforce-sites.com/pkb/articles/en_US/compatibility/en267087) and stick to that.
This is excellent advice.

That said, I tried Avid Media Composer on Sequoia and it works just fine.

Adobe Creative Cloud seems to be a little finicky, however.
I never allow work machines to update to anything but seemingly finally versions.

When Apple finally releases MacOS 16, that’s when I’ll be updating from the last update of 14 to the last update of 15. I do the very same with Adobe. I avoid the vast majority of bugs, and waiting a single year for new features just isn’t that big of a deal.

This also means that I’m usually only updating once a year instead of every couple of weeks.
Can’t wait. I work for a massive company and their computers are all managed. They’ll stop working if I don’t upgrade. So I’ll see what happens and report back
I usually update Mac OS about 8–9 months after it first comes out. Unfortunately it takes at least that long for all my software to update for it.
I updated
LoL, I’m on 13.6.1 with no plans to upgrade anytime soon.
Wut? you mean the update wont allow me to put 6hrs of 4K .mp4s in a timeline and have it play in RT?
lol I still have an old MacBook running SNOW LEOPARD so I can still author the odd DVD, I never update UNLESS I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. My new MBP works great with whatever is just before this latest OS update, and will stay that way for a while. Wise words, OP. Let someone else break their workflow, this guy’s got bills to pay.
I’m on 15 as currently didn’t have any active projects going, went smooth. Using davinci and everything is working. The upgrade is so basic this year, don’t think they have even changed anything much under the hood. At least my Mac Studio M1 Max feels a bit snappier now. Just don’t use their new dynamic wallpaper, I was seeing about 600mb of ram usage with those
My standard practice has always been to stay one version behind. New OS comes out, upgrade to the previous one. If I have to break that rule, then I'll do a complete system backup on a separate drive and then run the update, just in case it breaks anything critical. It's just not worth the gamble. Is that shiny new update reaaallly necessary? (It's not.)
Always stay 1 macOS version behind, and/or only upgrade if they force you because you bought new hardware that requires it

macOS has been hot trash since 10.7. they prioritize new features and bloat over bug fixes and optimization, because of shareholders who demand constant growth
Eh I'm a sucker for a new OS on release day. I've done it for as long as I can remember and I've never lost so much as a render file.

Yeah I know it's not the super professional thing to do but fuck it I'm a freelancer, no one can stop me 😃
Corporate editor here. I’m doing the upgrade as we speak. Then if nothing works, I get to use that as an excuse to be lazy for a week. But if everything goes well, then I can report back. 👍
We're using the release of Sequoia as an excuse to put off updating from Monterey.... No point going to Sonoma now, right? We might as well wait until Sequoia is stable....
Work says I have to!
I'm still on ventura and pretty happy lol
Yeah.  Never update the OS or any application on your work computer for a long time after it's released and you've searched for issues. **EVER.** Every time someone does this they get screwed...

On my personal laptop, on a different system: sure if you've waited a few days and looked around.
wow this is quite the public service announcement!
100% I wait like 6 months after a major OS upgrade.
Constant battle between a new Mac OS release, other software like Blackmagic desktop and the premier/avid bugs. Never ends But we do see some interesting quirks.
I upgrade on a non mission critical machine as a way to test compatibility with different apps, drivers, hardware, etc, in order to catch problems before upgrading the rest of my computers.
Personally I’m still rocking MacOS 12 to be honest. I could go newer and it would work fine but I don’t like messing with what works. There’s really no groundbreaking features in MacOS releases that I tend to care about at the professional level enough to upgrade. At home sure but not on my work machine.
I’m running Final cut 7 on Mac OS XvTiger. No problems here
Installing OS X! Aqua chic.
I never update anything until minimum 6 months after for bugs to be fixed, that includes the editing software
Weird then that I've already switched and have encountered exactly zero issues with Adobe or anything else
It always happens and I almost fell for it this time again but then I got reminded ;)
I'm glad you finally understand how macs work; now you just have to realize how mac users work..😂
I dad it, and now I has regerts. Safari is in the corner rocking back and forth from the trauma, and display manager is fussy. Even duck duck go flew south. Chrome surprisingly did not break. And now I have a glorified mac waiting on for it's fix like the junkie it is.
I still have PTSD from Avid XpressDV and a Windows “hotfix” circa 2002 that broke exporting or something. 

I’d get every system back-revved only to have the “chief technical officer” come through a few days later and turn auto-updates back on. One time I heard him yelling at a newer editor about “who keeps turning auto-updates off?” and I ran to the suite he was in and I, probably not so politely, explained why we shouldn’t auto-update. He flustered about trying to tell me about viruses and all that and I told him that we could either leave the systems set the way they were (working) or he and I could have a meeting with the owner and he could explain why none of our projects were getting exported.
I installed it and Premiere works just fine.
fuck it we ball
The problem is that Adobe and Final Cut users have been complaining about 14.6.1 since its release.   The real question is, did Apple walk back the change in Sonoma that created so many issues or is Sequoia going to make it worse?
Thank you for this. I am new to using macs (Only got one for FCP.)
The geniuses at the genius bar upgraded by system and now my $3000 Adobe licensed Creative Suite software doesn't work. Nothing I can do. I am super pissed.
Rule #1 as an editor: Never update your system in the middle of a project.  

When I decide to update Avid i run a dual boot. I create a new volume on my Mac. Then I check the avid version matrix for a Mac osx version and the version of avid that is compatible. For the .dmg files I go here as they have the individual point releases. 

https://mrmacintosh.com/

Once I’ve got my volume set up I launch the installer from my current osx and point it to the new volume that I created on my system drive. Once it installs you can open settings and type “start up disk” and it will allow you to choose which osx you boot into. That way if the new osx and avid are not behaving I can revert to my working set up.  You don’t have to do this in premiere because it keeps the previous versions of the software installed so you could just launch the last known working version if there’s an issue. Hopefully this helps someone out there.
One of my mac's on 13.6.9. 

Any way to upgrade to 14.x instead of 15?
There is a workaround with Mac OS Sequoia if you are having a WiFi and or vpn issues.
I made a huge mistake and I upgraded from Sonoma to Sequoia yesterday, because it popped up on me in notification. All day I say to myself: you idot, why? Today a repaired it about 16 hours (back to Catalina, all upgrades back to Sonoma — don't know why, but nothing went as it should have), because computer didn't boot, stuck in bootloop with black screen and some white text. It was destroyed, I had to much work and couldn't do it all day, it was big problem in my job. Uff, Apple is worse than windows now, many dirty words I said per day.
I’m still waiting. I need 15.0.3 or 15.1.
i need to run xcode but it require higher os ehat should i do
Damn
I still wish I never upgraded to Sonoma. KILLED my battery :|
Can anyone help with a WiFi fix for sequoia , unfortunately updated in the hopes of using logic pro X now I can't even see available WiFi connections
Hello everyone! Can I have your advice? I’m really tech excluded. 
The last update I made to my (very beloved) MacBook Pro (13 inch Mid 2012) was to Mojave, version 10.14.6. 
I really need my computer as I have everything for my PhD here and can’t afford to have it stop working. A few years ago my computer was becoming extremely slow, so “I” (lol) replaced the CD reader with a second memory disk/thing and the performance improved extremely. I’m sorry if this is useless information and also sorry that I don’t know the proper names for these things!

I see on your post that I shouldn’t upgrade to OSX 15 Sequoia. So my question is, should I have upgraded earlier to one of the versions after the one I have at the moment? Will my Mac become obsolete and will everything stop working soon? I’m stressed!! Thank you in advance
To those of you relying on Firewire for Audio or Video, be careful before upgrading.  Firewire for audio has already been phased out, and there's no telling when Apple will remove support for video as well.  I am currently with Sonoma 14.7.1 and I don't plan to upgrade to Sequoia.
It's macOS, it was OSX almost 10 years ago.
never update a production machine
This kind of thing is the exact reason I switched to windows. I hated upgrading to the new OS and losing functionality on my apps, then having to wait or pay for newer versions of them. I recently upgraded from windows 10 to 11 and literally everything still works perfectly.
The bleeding edge is the only edge I want to live on!
What I do to avoid any auto updates is make all of my internet sources "metered connections" then set the update settings to "Never on a metered connection." Since doing that, I have had zero auto updates.
This is why I run Windows Update Blocker. Can't force an update if the service is disabled
Avid 2018.12 and MacOS 10.14.6 is the latest combination I'd fully trust there, and I'm presently working with Avid 2023.12 on MacOS 13.5.
Can you give me a TLDR (too long didn't research) of what Avidtech/the media composer version matrix is?
I think finicky is Adobe-speak for "normal."
The person who reminded me of this advise - Chris Bové - meant it for Avid (amongst other tools.)
Yeah but the second it’s not fine and you go to acid they’ll just point at the “not qualified” sign and say it’s your own fault.”
You might loose on the major security updates though which could’ve not been fixed on the version you’re in though it’s the latest patch of a major version?
That's very sensible but you might be overdoing it.

I'm from the opposite end of the spectrum in that I run public betas of OS's and Apps and tbh I've never lost anything because of it. Might get the odd plugin playing up but other than that it's been plain sailing.

Everything is backed up, Time Machine, Backblaze, Nightly HD cloning. If the worst does happen I can be up and running again in no time.
Do you usually have problems??? I mean if you have no control. How do they enforce this? It just seems like IT people would have a clue about things like this.
did it work?
12.6 babyyyy
Same here fam. I forgot you could update your OS beyond security updates.
Tell me you have FCP “classic” installed and I’ll have people send you projects for XML conversion.
I haven't "upgraded" yet. I looked at all the improvements they bragged about, and thought, There isn't ONE of them, I'm going to use. Also, I've been burned on automatically upgrading and finding out a bunch of my programs will not work. So I'm waiting for everyone to figure out what runs, what's buggy, what is SOL.
![gif](giphy|gVoBC0SuaHStq|downsized)

Welcome to the men's group. We live dangerously. Currently downloading update.
Reporting back. I haven’t had any breaking issues resulting from the upgrade. Permissions are getting on my nerves though because I haven’t to give premiere permissions every time I open it. There’s probably a setting I haven’t found yet for that.
Same I am worried to update my Mac Pro M1 to this update tbh
That's great. We've seen multiple version upgrades of software and system software completely screw up everything - especially in the first days of a major change…you don't hear about the problems until the first week is out.

Still, it pays to be conservative about upgrades.
+10 for Xpress DV.  Sigh. Along with Avid3D (part of their suite at the time.)
I've been fine on 14.6.1…and so have the various people I deal with who are using the four major tools. None of it has been linked to the OS so far.
Between the smugness of Apple Store managers and increasing number of employees who aren't equipped to handle basic issues, the "Genius Bar" needs to be renamed.
Thanks to /u/Weenyhand - https://mrmacintosh.com/

Shouldn't there be a sarcasm flag here? /s
Take my upvote to even out the down vote. 

I run mac and pc clients and PC updates are a pain when they happen  unexpected, but rarely break things.

Granted I had a number PCs with Mojo / Nitris DX boxes loose their shit because of a windows update once.
Unironically me
Now the term "the bleeding edge" makes sense to me! This is the edge of the version spectrum where you bleed...
This is why I stop using Windows all together. I hate it when the OS shoves the updates and rapes my computer.
I’m working on 14.5.1 and MC 2024.6 and haven’t run into any issues out of the norm.
Seems the latest version do not have support for macOS 15 yet what I can see...
[removed]
I think Adobe is normal-speak for finicky.
Well, given that my current (long) gig is remote using a production company’s Avid, I have the opportunity to experiment with updating my own Mac and seeing if Avid works.  (And it does.)

Obviously, if I were working on a project locally right now, I wouldn’t dream of updating until the project was finished.
That’s not an issue on any popular OS in recent memory. Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc., they all push security updates to older versions of their operating systems even after they’ve moved on to newer ones.

Apple just released a new security update in July for Monterey for example, and that’s 2 versions prior to the current version at the time, Sonoma.
>That's very sensible but you might be overdoing it.

If companies like Apple and Adobe weren't on pretty standard yearly product cycles... I could see why you'd feel that way... but since they are? I don't see it as overdoing it in the slightest.

There are *tons* of people in our industry that regularly use software that's several years, sometimes even over a decade old. People still use many years old versions of AVID, for instance. I'm talking about using software that is 12-13 months old, at most. That's still quite current.

>I'm from the opposite end of the spectrum in that I run public betas of OS's and Apps and tbh I've never lost anything because of it. Might get the odd plugin playing up but other than that it's been plain sailing.

In my personal life, I'm right there with you. I have everything on auto-update. Software, hardware... everything. And it's pretty much never an issue.

But work? Hell no. I don't have time for that.

>Everything is backed up, Time Machine, Backblaze, Nightly HD cloning. If the worst does happen I can be up and running again in no time.

Data loss isn't the concern here. Loss of time is the bigger concern. When you say "up and running again in no time" just isn't the case... it does take time, and we don't have time for that.
Well the issue is they are deploying computers and software across like, 90,000 people. So to keep things secure, they need to limit the number of OS versions they have to support. It is what it is in big corporate. 

I very rarely have significant issues. I’m always faster than the computer I’m cutting on anyway. I’m always waiting for something, so that’s not new. I’ve had a couple things with Premiere and resolve that made me scratch my head, but nothing that can’t be mitigated.

The biggest thing to do is to remember, any old projects opened in the new version, may act funny. Even if they upgrade to the new version. So best practice is to create new blank projects, and import your old one into that. Solves some issues.

Also delete like everything in your cache. Dive down into the system files and get it all there. Restart a few times.
Monterrey team here up and running as well!
I updated from monterey a couple days ago to sonoma and regret it so much 😭
Team Monterey 🤙
It’s running FCP 6, but I don’t want to use it for anything other than emergency stuff. XML file conversion? Now THAT takes me back!
I still have it! lol

I get the impression from Windows, especially Windows 11, that it's a gamer OS and that I should probably run it with a joystick or something... This is very ironic for me since I'm using Windows at work and macOS at home... though, I'm not a gamer, not even at work, so maybe I'm totally wrong... :)
But you don't really have a functional title tool, and that's an issue.

That’s fair.

Generally unless it’s the scale of Catalina that removed 32 bit support avid actually will run pretty stable on new versions; it’s just that they don’t get advanced builds so they make no guarantees which I guess is also fair.

I will say given how much of their user base is MacOS based and the fact that you can’t roll a Mac back further than its release version you’d think they would get in the beta program to start testing things in advance so that people don’t have to wait 6 months to use their new Mac but avid is still sadly a pretty small team.
Aight then you’ve made total sense there
Yep. A few months ago I checked an iPhone 6 Plus and it was still getting iOS 12 security patches (the current iOS version is 18).
No I do get it, your approach is absolutely the more sensible option and I’ve worked with many folks who are operating on years old software, whatever gets the job done works.

I’ve never really seen a work stopping bug happen after 3 months of a new OS or app tho. Doesn’t mean they don’t exist but they are a rarity.

As for the time thing I totally get that. But last year I had the nightmare scenario of my Mac just flat out dying (not as a result of software updates), but thanks to Time Machine and a cloned hard drive it meant that I had lost at most 30mins of work in progress and was up and running again on a replacement computer within 3hrs.

Yes in an ideal world we’d never lose the time but it can happen and I think as long as your backup process is robust and continually updating then you can minimise that time lost to almost nothing. Tho it does help if you’re 10 minutes drive from the nearest Apple Store 😄

I don’t really use title tool a ton for what I do so doesn’t bother me.
I’ve learned to use after effects as well but I’m not happy about avid no longer being a complete editorial suite.
Sora
there is such emotion on Sora.  I have spent some time looking for training videos on Sora - its all preliminary - I am sorry that I am not part of the beta tester group. 

Many people feel this is the end of the world.  I feel like this is opportunity. I have seen this over and over again over the decades - with true "artists" - and CMX, EMC, AVID, Premiere, Resolve, FCP, FCP-X, iMovie, CoSa After Effects, Cinema4D, Quantel PaintBox, Photoshop, etc, etc. etc.  I CANNOT WAIT to learn Sora - I cannot wait to learn any new technology.  There will be those people that take advantage of this opportunity (Because some suit and tie guy at an agency is not going to be creating anything) - and then there will be the people that take advantage of this, and make it their career. I can bore you (as I usually bore you) with examples like Unreal Engine - and I can discuss other related industries like audio with multi track analog recording vs. Pro Tools - and modern day production techniques like

Film vs. RED/Arri digital - SDI video vs. NDI, analog audio vs. Dante, etc,etc. etc.  - but all these people say "it's the end of the world. I am older than your grandfather, and I embrace Sora, or any other piece of crap that comes out - because THIS IS MY LIFE - all that matters is NEW STUFF, and the OLD BAGS (you know - people 10 years younger than me) - just DIE OFF.   I guess I feel this way about music. All these boomer stupid old people keep saying "oh, music was not as good as it used to be" - there is GREAT MUSIC TODAY - open your FUCKING EARS and just listen to all the artists out there in every genre - and you will hear great music. If anyone plays another Tom Petty song, I will just kill them. 

Bob

&#x200B;
Never change, Bob.
This is just another type of stock footage as far as I'm concerned. It's close enough to what you need for your cut, but it'll never be perfect. If you want perfection (like many brands and agencies need), then you have to film or create the content yourself from the ground up.
the false equivalence between a software like photoshop and sora is absurd. one of those two softwares ripped millions of pieces of art down from the internet (without the creators' permission) and trained itself to mimic them, the other is closer to a digital recreation of a notepad
>because some suit and tie guy at an agency is not going to be creating anything.

That is exactly what’s going to happen. If you hate the corporates trying to do your job, worse than you, for you, you should hate this.
You seem to be making quite a few mistakes.

For one, this is not the same as learning to use photoshop instead of a darkroom, or avid instead of a steenbeck and so on. This is a phase shift in the way videos can be made, possibly replacing entire aspects of production. I don't find it plausible that you will just  'learn sora' and magically be paid top dollar as an editor whilst the cost  and skill of making decent quality video plummets to nearly zero.

Further, I have experience working in photography and I've seen how that career is slowly becoming unviable, and now further damaged by AI. That could be a foreshadowing of what is going to happen to film jobs like an editor, in my opinion: maybe not disappearing but becoming less and less viable as a career. 

I don't think all forms of film production will be affected by this in the same way, but dismissing it as you are as just a matter or technophobia doesn't seem to add up.
The tech optimism/pessimism extremes here make me chuckle.

This tool came out _yesterday_ and suddenly everyone is an expert on how it will change their industry.

It's not a full blown AI editor that saves 20 hours, it's just one incremental piece of the puzzle. I think it'll be a decade before we see any real progress, and that assumes Microsoft and OpenAI don't completely screw it up and go proprietary. Knowing the history of Microsoft, I'm not holding my breath. This stuff isn't free, it takes massive datacenters to train and inference off of.

For every "idiot" that didn't learn new tools, I assure you there are 10 who did, and still failed. You should see what generative AI has been doing to code quality in the programming industry in general. It's quite alarming and points to greater issues that aren't being addressed with the technology.

I've only seen software create more problems than it ever solved, been that way since the 90's when we started obsessing over "better" ways to solve problems with software.

Sit tight, focus on foundation, and don't give too much attention to fashion or fear. If you're good at your craft, generative AI is just another paintbrush to pull out in certain situations. If you depend solely on any one paintbrush, you will eventually be a dull artist.
Hoping this tool will be able to give me some specific shots I’m looking for that stock sites cant quite deliver.  I’ll also be curious if it winds up allowed for commercial use.  Either way it’s exciting new tech for sure!
Beyond our careers being disrupted by AI I’m far more concerned about the broader social implications. How can we trust that video evidence in court hasn’t been falsified? How do we protect women and children from being harassed or blackmailed with fake p*rnographic videos? What about propaganda disseminated by foreign governments to interfere with elections? The ways this technology can be used with malicious intent will far outweigh any positives I can fathom. I wish this were a benign tool but it simply isn’t.
Go local. Folks are going to start hating on this stuff. Local markets are going to get a boost - small news stations, local ads, etc.
I mean we all love to make art, sure, but the problem is that it IS those “stock footage-y”, corporate videos and those kinds of gig that pay the bills for a lot of people, and then enable them to make art or just more creative, fulfilling projects once their rent is covered. 

It’d be great if we could all get paid to make art, but that’s not quite the system we live in unfortunately. 

It’s also never “just” a tool, any tool carries with it a certain baggage and way to view the world, and the relationships between creators, consumers and the material of our work. And AI is a lot less neutral than most tools.
1. Your comparisons are not the most genuine. Comparing AI to the advent of software like Photoshop and Cinema4D is not the same thing. AI, especially generative AI, encompasses a broader scope. It's not just a new tool or piece of software but a technology capable of learning and creating across multiple domains. Its versatility allows it to impact nearly every creative field, not just by offering new tools but by introducing the ability to automate aspects of the creative process itself, potentially learning and adapting to create in ways that mirror human authenticity.
2. People really seem to forget the decades upon decades upon decades of recorded history we have of how corporations and companies behave in a capitalistic society, of which we live. Profit maximization > ethics. So when something like this is introduced, what do you think the name of the game becomes? Because we're talking about profit margins that will make the industrial revolution look like peanuts.
3. Why would a creative studio need 75 creatives in-house when they could have 25 utilizing AI creative apps? Why would a VFX house need to bring on hundreds of roto artists when they could bring on a much smaller team utilizing AI? I could keep going, but you get the idea. This is the whole idea of AI. Automate as much human work as possible because humans require salaries, 401ks, vacation time, time to eat, time to sleep, etc.

You're quite literally talking about the most lucrative notion in all of human history, for so many industries across the planet. There will be pain, there will be fun, there will be amazing things, there will be very scary things, but you can make no god damn mistake that the ability to pay for a roof over your head doing creative work is going to get a lot tighter because many employment opportunities will be shadowed out as AI is able to learn and automate more and more tasks people base their livelihoods off of.

I really wish people would show a little more respect for the grand picture of what this technology aims to do, not just over the next 5-10 years, but the next 100 years.

I don't think end times are around the corner, but this isn't like the invention of the camera or the unreal engine. This is something on another level, and while I think the technology itself is obviously incredible, I really think we're forgetting about the whole, "how humans behave in a capitalistic society" thing.

And remember, we're just talking about gen AI. There will be so many other forms of AI than just generative. This is just a sliver of what's to come.
Sora still has a long way to go, and it has to get through copyright battles. All doable. 

But the first industries that will get hit are stock footage, advertising, and creators on social media. Then once it’s proven itself we’ll have the first animated film, then feature films. 

I’ve been using AI for copyrighting, and it still has a way to go as well just for text, but it enabled me to do 100x the work for a small business than I ever could have without it. 

There’s still plenty of time in the next 5 years before it’s really capable and used. But tbh, the idea of jobs as “prompt writers” is hilarious to me. ChatGPT can program itself through natural language already, soon they’ll get past the stupid prompts that are needed for image generation. It’ll be really simple sliders and adjustments that will be much more intuitive, just like effects and transitions have become drag and drop. 

The writing (in the future) is on the wall that a huge swath of our jobs will disappear as we know them today. Whether that means every small business gets world class content from a single creator, or there’s a race for the biggest, craziest content ever, there will still be jobs. But we’ll look back on large production teams and laugh at how absurd it was they convinced us to work the hours and sit behind computers in dark rooms. 

So there’s always good and bad… but it’s all hype for the next 5 years, and totally not ready.
Shoulda known it was Bob. Lowkey incoherent
![gif](giphy|sFTWiBKYYWKVa)
Shhhhh
This is stupid. People who talk about AI being "just another tool" are completely missing the point. The reason these things are being developed isn't to give writers, editors, filmmakers and creatives another tool to use but to replace the need for those individuals all together.

When a new camera technology drops, who gets excited about it? Filmmakers, videographers, creative type individuals.

Who gets excited when this new AI shit comes out? Venture Capitalists, Tech Bro CEOs, studio executives. Why? Not because they think it will make the jobs of the creatives easier but because they think it will eventually replace those jobs all together.

They aren't shy about it. They talk openly about it. Do you think the David Zaslavs of the world look at this and think "boy, can't wait to see how the writers and editors use this" no they are thinking, "sweet fire all those people now, we don't need them anymore."
Sora looks like ass. I'm sure it'll improve,  but it has no soul, like all ai. Off putting and bizarre.
bob needs to take his meds
It's cool but has anyone seen how long those videos take to generate?

Havent seen any numbers.
What's the sources for Sora? There's no way they have trained it without violating copyrights and licenses. They want everyone to be woo'ed so they can pull in the money because this shit is expensive AF to make -but they want to hook people and "disrupt" while ignoring the real costs and meanwhile jobs will be lost. Who is going to make them show a full accounting of their sources and prove they own the copyrights? Big names need to start screaming. As soon as they get deepfaked they probably will.
This is going to massively change things whether you want to believe it or not. You can do nothing and worry or prepare 🤷‍♂️
Who hurt you, Bob
Man, people are misunderstanding this whole AI replacing creatives thing. There's always been 2 massive sectors of the market, one where the customer creates and one where a professional creates. It's the same thing that's happened time and time again with web-based tools. Graphic designers were scared of Canva, but really what it did was give the people who wouldn't hire a designer anyway the ability to make better designs. I know a few editors were scared of CapCut, but all it ended up being was a better tool for that customer sector. Nobody's hiring us to edit their random video for their internal boardroom presentation. This is a tool. Nobody is going to have AI make their wedding video/photos because AI *wasn't there.*
Why do we give this alcoholic lunatic the time of day on this sub?
I hope soon the models behind Sora become open-source so that you can use it too.  I tried to make a quick summary of how Sora AI works, e.g., the models behind it, etc in this video if it interests you in any way: [https://youtu.be/9ZIB4no9WDE](https://youtu.be/9ZIB4no9WDE)

Don’t think I’ve seen bob swear before, maybe I’m wrong though 🤔
Always had you down as a gritty realist, Bob, but this is the kind of optimistic motivational stuff I can get behind.

GO BOB.
Anyone that says we won't all be obsolete in the near future isn't paying attention.  Sora stuff looks great.  It's not perfect but the stuff I've seen is 100% usuable in most projects unless you have a high end Hollywood budget.  The difference is quality in one year is amazing.  Maybe they hit a wall of what's possible but if not then in 5 years AI will be making stuff that will look as good as an Marvel movie side by side.  And it's all leading to 100% personalized content, personalized video games etc.  At some point we'll be able to give some prompts and have  a new Batman movie with whatver actors we want and whatever story elements we want and probably have the full movie ready to watch in 5 minutes.  There will be die hards who want art made by humans that has a soul but that will be a niche that won't support the industry in the way it exists today.  They'll be some jobs for us humans but they'll be different jobs then what we're doing now.  It's happening in every industry.  I'll just roll with whatever changes come
Hell yeah.
This is the take I needed today. Thank you Bob
Holy shit, I was here for Bob’s cake day. What a joy this is — fuck yeah bob.
Heck yeah, Bob! Stay uncomfortable. Keep progressing. Learn more. Create more. Express more. At the end of the day these things are only tools and tools are only as good as the craftspeople using them.
Admittedly, I agree with how one must keep learning, albeit for AI I tend to take it a bit pessimistically. The world is evolving, and I don't plan to fall behind.
I think the reality really will be tough conversations had with producers who have an end goal of hiring-less, and walking away from the show with more cash in their jeans once all is said and done.
This guy gets it
Bob's just running down a dream
Awesome. Nicely said, Bob.
[deleted]
Bob has spoken. This is the way.
What is your name?
How do I use it? What is the best way to start creating video using sora?
I am thinking that a significant concern comes down to how does someone being able to generate a 22 episode season of their favorite genre show with a text prompt (not currently possible, but not far off) coexist with someone watching show as they are created now.  The former leaves us with no work while the latter keeps a roof over out heads and food on the table.
hashtag StandWithBob
It’s a goddam tool, learn how to use it and stop whining
Yup. Just another gadget to add to the tool belt. Hopefully not next the shark-repellent-bat-spray though.
Bob you are a legend
Bob I’ve always loved your posts and advice here. I need to know… what is your favorite music? And why the Tom Petty hate?
this is year 2 of generated AI video. In the past year we also now have access to generated speech, music, stories. How many more years until we can generated fully finished videos, movies, ads, with just a text script input> Personally I can't wait for this.

At the start it will be like, "yeah but you will still need editors to fix stuff" but AI can learn from it's mistakes. It can learn why certain changes were needed and it can learn from every highly rated video, music video, ad, film out there. Some will say it has already learnt human emotions and won't be long until it can manipulate it. The improvements we are seeing are growing exponential.
This levels the playing field of what is possible. Now it comes down to the best ideas and execution. Yes some low level jobs may be lost but this tech allows creatives to create whatever they want in a new way. Goin against this new reality is the wrong move.  People who embrace it will be game changers.

Not sure about editors but stock photo models/photographers/videographers are definitely screwed.
It's friday guys! 

Let Bob be Bob on Fridays.
With you on everything but the Tom Petty dig
Happy cake day, Bob.
I mean, if you're working video I wouldn't even call it an option from this point forward not to learn these tools. It would be akin to keep working on paper while everyone else runs Photoshop. Yeah we're all gonna have to get in on it or get forgotten. It is what it is, better try and see the positive if there is any.
I work a lot with stock footage so for me it cant get fast enough so I got loads more stuff to work with.
I saw you at NAB last year Bob, and to my dismay didn’t say hello and thank you for all your online advice over the years. After reading this I plan on rectifying that this year. And possibly an unsolicited hug too. Never, ever change.
Bob, I like the cut of your jib.
Ur post too long lol, i just assumed u talking sora AI create those odd movements stick vid  but trust me, the aesthetic and technical edit, Ai cannot match the human enthusiasm, they may create what we want but the feelings and emotional is what human do better
It’s foolish to think AI is going to be a job replacer OR a new tool to be used in the creative process. It will be both, and it already is. To Bob’s point, like any other advancement in our field, you MUST embrace it, learn it, and figure out how to best use it or be left behind.
Im confused what Sora has to do with editing specifically. Isn't Sora for generating footage? 

That footage still needs to be edited, shouldn't it be the videographer (like me) who are worried?
Can't wait to be too lazy and apathetic to learn this cutting edge technology and miss out on all the income that the David Goggins sucking cutting-edge grindbros are gonna be making off of it
When Quantel replaced the corded Paintbox  styluses with cordless pens, the operators worried the $100 pens would get lost.
I was very comforted by [northernlions take](https://youtu.be/wfEHYdnl5E4)
I hope this brings production costs down, reducing the need for expensive reshoots and revisions.
Editing is a skill that transcends any tool or technique. Developing your skills makes it easy to learn the next tool because someone is hiring you for your skill. If they are hiring you because they want a tool user, you want to raise the quality of your employers
N1 bob / robert
Hey guys, i ve started YT channel. Will be posting Sora videos on daily basis [https://www.youtube.com/@dailydoseofsora](https://www.youtube.com/@dailydoseofsora)
when I change - I will be dead (which won't be long) - but I will keep LEARNNG until the day that I die - unlike so many of the losers here "oh, I just learned Premiere and Resolve - why do I have to learn something else - you know, I have a LIFE besides video stuff".

I liked one of the comments from another recent post that said "who is this guy - I don't  even see anything about him on IMDB" - because I guess he has not learned how to use Google yet. 

bob
Team Bob fo LYFE
I think it'll open the door to using stills as the source for footage. So a client might have an amazing image library, then you can use any specific image + a prompt to get the shot you need.
This is exactly it. For now. I see no emotion in those shots, but I *do* see [a generic corporate video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YBtspm8j8M). If priced decently, I could see this type of service making the corporate video editors' lives much easier. 

The people who should be immediately terrified are the people shooting bland content of specific places. The drone shot looks great, for example. But then again, drone shots are SO 2015. When I started editing corporate videos helicopter shots were rare because they were so expensive. When drones became affordable we were flooded with those shots and they were the hot shit for about a year or so. Nowadays CDs will say "no, I don't want another boring drone shot of the corporate head office", because it's been seen a thousand times. 

So how we use this AI will be like that... for a year or two, we'll see people making crazy AI compositions like "let's have a three-headed horse run through times square bathed in disco lights!", and then people will just be *over* it, and maybe we'll go back to films showing [actual emotion](https://youtu.be/wL02YRs1cCg?t=1587) again.
I saw comparisons between some prompts and videos from the stock libraries they're training on. A lot of it really just is stock, re-painted by an algorithm.
This 👆🏼
bro this tech is like one year old. give it 10 years
This is the worst it'll ever be. Compare it to where we were just a year ago.
Not the mention, AI is constantly learning. Not that far from now Sora and other AI models will not need any more human prompts. It WILL get to the point where it will be able to prompt itself and create things on its own, it’s just a matter of time. People are gravely underestimating this technology. People far more intellectual than you or I have been warning against the use of AI. We act like it’s the end of the world because it could very well lead to that.
Whenever someone compares AI to just another software or tool, you know they're delusional or just plain stupid.
all my friends at NBC in NY called Adobe Photoshop "Phototoy" - because they all had Quantel Paintboxes for $250,000 each.  And now where are they now ?  DEAD.   Stop learning, stop studying, and you will be dead too (unless you go into HVAC, or plumbing, or auto repair). 

bob
Yeah it’s hard to compare things to this when it’s pretty unprecedented times. Like we had stepping stones then ai was a mountain
I'm pretty sure everyone gave persmission as soon as they uploaded their art onto the internet even if they didn't know it.  Nobody reads the EULA
I agree with you - but you must admit that the old people that were photographers that knew darkroom techniques were offended by Photoshop.  Artists that could paint by hand and do amazing canvas work did not consider this true art.  Well - where are these artists now (with rare exception).   Photography was difficult, and today, most people are more than happy with their iPhone photos.  Certainly, there was a huge corporate video business where a convention would take place at a resort hotel, and a huge video crew would show up to do that show  - and today, people whip out their iPhones, and shoot video, and some poor schmo back at corporate headquarters had to do something with that footage.  BUT THAT DOES NOT APPLY to the HUGE BUDGET high profile corporate videos that are done at BIG MONEY corporate conventions, where huge budgets (bigger than any major TV commerical) are spent.  

I saw in one of the comebacks to my posts that the printing business was over and done.  Well, I have friends that are STILL in the printing business that are making a LOT of money, because they had the client base for direct advertising, and they STILL DO IT - (hard to believe) - but people STILL PAY FOR THIS CRAP - but it's not a wide spread market. 

Doesn't this apply to audio recording - anyone can use Logic or Garage Band to make music - and certainly most of the recording studios have disappeared, but there are STILL RECORDING STUDIOS- after all - Pro Tools - the #1 income source of AVID - is still making crazy money today.  So when we say "the audio recording industry is dead" - well, not it's not. 

  
Same with Photography - anyone can use their iPhone to take great pictures (I do ) - but does a corporation, that needs photos of the coporate execs ?  Or high end models ?  They pay the BIG BUCKS for the guys that can do the high end work. 

I can only say one thing for sure, as I have been dealing with "producers" for my entire life. I don't care if Sora, or any program could do the most amazing things. When that producer, who is financed with tons of money, says into [https://open.ai](https://open.ai)  "make me a hit action movie" - that is NOT going to happen.  He will HIRE someone to do it.  And when Sora (or whatever) makes the movie , and Mr. Exec. says "that is horrible, that is not what I was thinking of" - well, then you have to go back and FIX IT - and that is what WE do for a living. 

Bob
Yeah it seems like everyone thinks it's gonna be free to use
Exactly. This stuff is already degenerative. All these “don’t get lost in the dust” arguments have me replying with “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because when this bubble pops, it’ll pop hard.
>  I think it'll be a decade before we see any real progress

THAT makes me chuckle. That level of naiveness is truly adorable.
Yeah that's the part I'm pumped about. Sometimes you just need a dumb stock shot and you trawl through the main sites looking for something but none of them quite do it. Just let me type the thing in and move on to the next task!
If stock sites don't cut it yet, you're likely not gonna be able to prompt it for a while. Most of the data the AI is trained on is to my knowledge stock.         
           
Of course it can mash stuff together, but I doubt it's gonna be good enough at this stage
man this skynet thing looks pretty cool, can't wait to see how it'll help me do my job better
Exactly, I am very concerned about this in particular.
There will have to be some kind of simple way to check metadata or origin. Something super quick and easily accessible. Don’t know what that’ll be but it will absolutely be necessary. 

We will need to create a new standard of verifying media (that will be the very tough part). I think it’s totally doable but getting nearly everyone on earth on board is another story.
that's an interesting possibility. Would be a nice outcome, although I unsure if it's likely.
Agree with everything noted in here. It certainly won't be a dull 5 to 10 years, that's for sure. I'm just trying to position/prepare  myself for various eventualities.
finally someone sees the truth lol
And who are you again?
oh, you mean like when STG Group purchased AVID - because we all know how much a financial investment firm cares about Media Composer, Pro Tools, and our careers. 

STG Group will look out for all of us !

This is the worst this technology will be.
You should have seen the video quality of the first Avid system.   There wasn't enough resolution to see lipsync in 1989.   By 1994 Avid media was basically broadcast quality.  By 2005 you could edit in HD.

Get ready.  These initial anomilies in generative AI visuals will disapear before you know it.
Completely disagree. That puppy video made my heart think I was watching a real puppy scramble around. And this is just V1.
Probably cost them several million per video.
Yep, and just remember, they are selective about what they are showing, and not a single thing they showed holds up to scrutiny past the first glance….
who hurt me ?  Everyone that said I sucked. Every employer that fired me.  Everyone that said AVID sucked.  AVID when they said "any AVID that Bob Zelin touches is out of warranty" once they became a public company.  The only job for me is to squash those people. All the linear post houses that would not hire me. Bart Koulis at AVID that wanted to ruin my life, and made sure I would never work again.  All I wanted to do is learn, work hard and do a good job. And there were roadblocks (people) every step of the way.  My only real job now is to run them over.   I just did a job TODAY for a company, and their "IT guy" would not give me their admin login so I could complete my job.  I did a factory reset on their system, and now I got in, and now this "IT guy" can't get in until he contacts me.  This is the game - people want their jobs, and they don't want to share them. 

Bob

Anyone who thinks this stuff is game changing has never really worked with clients. Go ahead and try to iterate with this based on client feedback.. the truth is it will be a tool, a piece of the puzzle. A piece that is built off, or into other components, which will take a whole team to perfect. Mapping it onto 3D models, cleaning it up, manipulating it, etc.
>At the end of the day these things are only tools and tools are only as good as the craftspeople using them.

how many scribes and weavers do you know? Sometimes jobs become outmoded by new tech. We aren't there yet, but these are signs of erosion on the industry.
I think a more apt comparison is the fact that photography definitely killed the profession of portrait painting.  Sure, a camera is also just a tool, but it makes something that originally took a long time take substantially less time and for less money.  It was a paradigm shift similar to this new ever-improving AI tech. There were definitely people back then who refused to get a portrait photograph because they thought it was "anti-art".  


I'm not entirely against AI, but we should at least make fair comparisons. Thinking that "true artist's" careers won't be on the chopping block eventually if it becomes a suitable and cheaper alternative is a bit naive. AI and automation in general would be a lot more exciting to me if paying for rent, food, and medical care didn't benefit greatly from technology standing still and never threatening your income.
I don't hate Tom Petty.  I hate old people that refuse to listen to any current music.  I just used that as an example.  "oh, no one was as good as Clapton" - you know what I call that person ?  AN IDIOT.

This is the worst it'll ever be. Compare it to where we were just a year ago.
>comparisons between some prompts and videos from the stock libraries

Sounds like you saw the video-to-video feature, not a comparison to training data.
I’d love to see my clients prompt it with the notes they give me
Alternatively, people who refuse to see that and refuse to learn the new tools WILL be the ones who suffer.

It's not going to be 3 company executives and no other employees while they ask AI to do something. There will still be people whose job it is to create X based on Y business retirement. That's what you do now, that's what you will do in the future.

Like the mechanisation of farming and then industry, more work will be done by fewer people for sure. But just like that transformation, different types of jobs will appear as people have to spend less time on manual tasks and can focus on creative decision making ie service jobs.

In some ways mechanisation created more jobs, in different areas. For example the mechanised loom destroyed jobs for thousands of cottage industry workers, but created thousands of jobs in the carpet industry which couldn't exist before.
Quantel folks got amazing at building worlds with the paint tool. Most everyone I know who came from there went on to do really great work with other tools.
there are plenty of things to learn that aren't prompt-based AI generators - don't presume that I'm not learning anything.
You can find the original videos of all the sora example videos on shutterstock. It’s not going to be as useful tool of a tool because it’s based off of everyone already has made, but with less control. It seems crazy now because the companies are trying to sell it, actually try to use it practically and it sucks

Paintbox was so much fun to use!
Happy Cake Day Bob!
Good points, Bob.

But have you seen cars lately? Not sure if an old school mechanic can fix a new electric car.
That's not how that works.
I'm taking a birds eye view of the industry as a whole, whereas you are taking a more narrow view of individuals getting paid for a skillset. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just wondering where the money is coming in your scenario if the mechanisms that brought in cash before are eroded massively.

I think this can play out in any variety of ways, it's pretty unpredictable, but it's hard to imagine producers paying top dollar to  someone to make a 'hit action movie' in their bedroom with AI. Ignoring that that implies not needing huge amounts of crew, we are really talking about the relative end of scarcity of the skillset of filmmaking due to industrialisation of the product. We aren't near that point yet but the trend isn't looking good. I don't know of any other industries where an end in scarcity is a boon for it's workers.
You say it's naive, but so far AI has not been able to truly create anything truly new.  If you listen or read AI researchers they will tell you how Chat GPT and Dall-e etc are all creating new "interpolations" between existing human-created data.

One researcher put it something like this, "If you give ChatGPT all the data from before 1910 it will never generate a Hemmingway novel."

I wouldn't be so bold to predict it will be 10 years before Sora can replace human acquisition/animation.  But, I also think it's important to understand the current limits of "AI".  OpenAI seems to be claiming they are sort of 'holding it back', so maybe there is some leap that has occurred that isn't available to the public yet.   It's hard to know for sure, but so far all the "AI" I've seen hardly deserves the monicker of "intelligent".
I left LA a few months ago for greener passages and found a job at a local news station. I make a lot less - but there's lots of potential for growth. Editors like that aren't going anywhere because it's community oriented and they're always going to want a human touch. My wife and I are both in production and we have countless of friends who were doing really well for a long, long time and now things are drying up quickly. I don't know what the future holds - but it's pretty bleak out there right now.
Not Bob which makes his comment infinitely more valuable.
That's exactly the point, Bob. These people aren't investing in this stuff because they care about our careers. They care about their bottom line. And what better way to increase that than to stop paying the creatives.
Their paws are funky, same as when ai does human hands. It also looks fake, like optical flow mushing frames incorrectly. It's been like this for years, and Sora is the same

Not at all, usually ignored the twat. But since I’ve become a new parent and seen this idiot say you’re a loser if you spend time with your children I’m gonna call this drunk out.
I’ve got one for you Bob https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lR_qUyWqi-0TUUOsK_KZX5fxV0TyST_FM
You'll need some people but much less then we need now.  And most of the people can be minimum wage workers with little education/experience and a senior person to manage it. This is what is happening in software development right now.  They have built tools that are easy enough that anyone off the stree can be trained to drag and drop pre built code and have one senior programmer to QC and do fixes.
the biggest proponents I’ve come across for these tools are people who aren’t creative in their own right and have failed in their creative prospects. ML models skips the grunt work of understanding the scope of building something interesting and they gleam and their prompt generated result as if they were its brain child. 

However i agree, instead of ML models solving real-world problems and heightening efficiency in life-or-death sectors, we are reducing creativity and the arts to a point and click redundancy. 

v strange
Thanks Bob. I agree.
When the pen got lost - my art director would always joke: Oh that grey pen, it didn't write so I threw it away!. Very much a Dad joke.
you spoke like a wise old man (ahem, person) - so i googled your username. it checked out. and i love that you built the max zelin system. lol

I think that the fact that Taylor Swift uses "programmers" instead of musicians is unethical.  And what does that mean, after 1 billion dollars in sales for her - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. 

I am a loser musician - who cares - no one will ever hire me, and even if you are good, programming is where it's at in 2024. 

Bob
Hahahahaha this was moneyyyy. Can’t wait for the next one to drop
While I understand the sentiment that those who "refuse to learn will be the ones who suffer", unfortunately AI will make even those who do learn suffer as well. I think the idea of "learn to use the tool" and it will give you an edge, is a paradigm that may no longer apply to generative AI tools. These tools are so accessible, everyone will know how to use them and no one will have an edge.
Again, you cannot compare generative AI to just another tool to be learned. Our jobs will be reduced to a small task that can be done by any non-creative. Companies will pop up offering courses/seminars on how to prompt to get the best result (if they don't already exist). Why would a company keep a trained professional on for any significant amount of money when they could have some intern or media relations person get the exact same result and save a full salary? 

It's amazing to me how many creatives are taking the "hey horse and buggy/car, we gotta learn it and then we'll never be replaced" sentiment, which is honestly just laughable. All we're doing by embracing it is training in our replacement.
Right and how hard is it to use a text prompt? Good luck on part time minimum wage.
This is not a tool, today it might seem, but in 2, 5, 19 years it will have learned from you and millions others and will replace you.
oh, please excuse me now - I have to deal with my "balanced life" - it's 7:25pm on the east coast, and my wife wants me to take her grocery shopping now (I did TWO jobs today - one in Orlando, and one in Los Angeles remote) - and tomorrow, I have to take her to the Macy's at the Mall so she can get some stupid birthday presents for someone.  SEE - I have a "balanced life".  Thank God for alcohol.   

I don't give a damn about what I have to learn - I am now an "expert" on Ubiquiti UniFi network systems - do you think that I actually wanted to learn that crap - but it's become so wildly popular, that if I intend to stay employed with these video companies, I have to know this crap, and I did a new install today (complete with wiring in the ceiling) so they could have remote access for their editors.  What does this have to do with video - NOTHING - but I learned it, and I got good at it. 

KEEP LEARNING.   Even if you hate it.  (or become a plumber).   

bob
How's that?  If it's in EULA that google or facebook or whoever owns the rights to use your material when you upload it and you upload it without reading or understanding that then they own it.  They can train their machine learning on it or sell your data to other compaies.  Everyone signs away the rights to their personal data the every time they click OK to sign up for Facebook, Twitter, TikTok etc
> but so far AI has not been able to truly create anything truly new. 

It's also advancing at an EXPONENTIAL rate.

I saw a graphic designer make a thread about how AI wouldn't replace him, and he produced an image he generated with AI that he had to spend an hour retouching in Photoshop to get perfectly the way he wanted. Generate AI got him 90% of the way there, but according to this fellow his employer could never get rid of him because it was inconceivable that AI would be able to get 100% there. And to me that's just laughably naive.

I will shout it from the roof tops - creatives need to reject AI as legitimate art and fight back. Those who embrace it and try to sell other creatives on it are essentially training their replacements.
It was only a year ago that the will smith eating spaghetti monstrosity came out. And now we have sora. You underestimate the rate at which technology advances especially considering people are investing BILLIONS of dollars into AI and machine learning.
it doesnt need to be perfect and capable of "replacing" everything for it to have a major impact, not only on industries but on the media we consume
>My wife and I are both in production and we have countless of friends who were doing really well for a long, long time and now things are drying up quickly

same with me and my gf. She and her film friends have had work dry up very rapidly. The industry seems to be in a race to the bottom with dysfunctional profit models and devaluation of work from things like AI. I don't know, I just don't feel rosy about it.

>I left LA a few months ago for greener passages and found a job at a local news station. I make a lot less - but there's lots of potential for growth. 

That's an interesting decision you've made, I respect it. I keep weighing up my options as of late too. I just can't shake the feeling that I should change now rather than later.
I don't think Sora is the end or anything, but I really think its more impactful than the usual technological revolution.
Lmao wtf 😬
Francis - do you know where I can get some coke ?  I haven't had any in 40 years !  DM me, and I will buy from you !

Lighten up, Francis.
So, you're "too cool" to post on the sub because youre "working with software all day", but you'll spend time...calling Bob out?

Waste of time imo. If you're not part of the group of people who feel the sub finally made it to "primetime" once Bob started posting here...well, my only advice is to enjoy looking stupid in front of everyone.
This is a misconception. It’s not the same in creative fields.

thats right bob captialism doesnt care about ethics so might as well say fuck it and get the bag while the world burns.
People need to remember the reason why these things are being developed. It's not to give us another tool to use, it's to replace the workers as the tool
We’ve already seen this happening as the state of this industry has shifted. I’ve seen countless non editing jobs asking for editing skills with low pay. Everyone’s an editor now.
take a deep breath, Bob
People won’t be replaced by AI, they will be replaced by people who use AI.
> creatives need to reject AI as legitimate art and fight back

Oh yeah, rejecting technology has always worked out well.
Who's incredibly naive now?
Sora certainly looks much better than Will Smith eating spaghetti.  But I'm still not sure if Sora can take direction.   Like the mammoth clip that has been released.  Can I tell Sora "make that shot twice as long and start the mammoth's further back" ?    I think it might make a totally different shot - I don't really know.  The way Dall-E and ChatGPT have worked so far is small changes in the request can create big differences.

The "Bling Zoo" clip was the most impressive to me.  It had different shots and cuts.  But still it's unclear to me if Sora is anywhere near being able to adjust the shots.

I will say that Sora certainly seems to have the potential to destroy simple b-roll/stock footage sites.   Like if I need  only one "drone shot of a cliffside home", it could be very useful if it's cheaper than stock sites.

As I said, I'm not sure when "AI" will break out from being a rather amazing yet simple tool to something more complex - a true creative assistant or "assister" perhaps should be the word.    It could happen soon, or it might take longer than expected.
Ok
We moved after a year or so of waiting for one of us to get something going. For the last 20 years - we have never had to worry about work and all of a sudden - I'm busting my ass for a $100 for a job I got on upwork. Especially my wife. She's never had any issues going from job to job and all of a sudden - nothing. LA is starting to lose its luster too.
Agreed
Nah I’m gonna call out this old fart who calls people who spend time with their children losers. Fuck him, he’s everything that’s wrong with this industry.
Yeah I’ll call him out on a Friday night big guy, I’ve got the time. A subreddit made it to prime time? Wtf does that even mean and who the hell cares. Jog on.
Then why is AI the single most imporant issue for IATSE negoations like it was for writers and actors?  Are they all misconcieving the threat?
get that bag! get that bag! get that bag! get that bag!\*

\*nightmare.nightmare.nightmare.nightmare.nightmare.
As much as replacing labor is a very real problem, this thinking that it’s the reason for creating AI/ML is reductive. These tools are enabling things that we literally can’t do as humans like finding patterns in thousands of chemical structures and spitting out brand new drugs that would have taken decades or longer to discover and test. Nothing is black and white.
Sad imo! If the industry is on life support for technicians, surely AI will be the hand pulling the plug!
I would argue the people who view AI as just another technology are the ones who are naive. This isnt another software for us to learn that helps us. This helps non creative bean counters who want to rid the books of our salaries.
Even if all that was destroyed was stock footage sites, that’s a lot of people that are now suddenly out of a job. Why would we pay a drone pilot when we can just generate this shot for us, etc? 

And again, I think we are grossly underestimating the implications of this and the speed at which the technology will evolve. But honestly, I’m more worried about the existential threat this poses for society overall, not just the state of this industry.
👍
Fair enough tbh. Not everyone is perfect though
cope seethe
You inspire me.
SAG already capitulated, in a way that does directly harm them, and in particular background talent. I’m not saying there won’t be destruction with gAI there absolutely will be, I’m saying it can’t “push a button to create a movie” and never will.
money is my god. trying for a better world is futile. embrace materialism. eat meat
It doesn't matter how you view AI, if it can do your job then that's what will happen.    Can you think of an example where "you can't do that cheaper more efficient" thing has ever worked?   

From looms to shipping containers, to outsourcing, to data entry to a cutting room full of film assistants -- cheaper more efficient always wins.   Why would I want to waste my time sitting in front of a computer all day if the computer can do it without me?
People always claim doom and gloom when things change.   It's true, I'm not as impressed as you with "AI", but I do see the potential for drastic change. 

Nothing stops change.  Not really.  Certainly not in the world we live in.   It seems a waste of time to worry about it, unless you're in government or something.  

What are you going to do about it if "AI" changes everything?    Is there some course of action you feel you should be taking to prevent your imminent obsolei?
EAT MEAT EAT MEAT EAT MEAT WE ARE ONE
Bro I hate to break it to you but if the computer can do it without you, you need to find a new line of work. I think that’s what you and a lot of people are missing out on - this is not a piece of technology we learn to be more efficient, this is a piece of technology studios/non creatives/clients learn so they don’t have to pay us. That’s the end game to all this. But hey, I hope you’re right. I hope you’ll always have someone paying you a living wage to type a prompt into a computer.
Oh I mean agree, nothing stops change. And I have never we could stop technological advancement. Cat is out of the bag now. It’s not a matter of if ai will change things just a matter of when. We are likely going to be in for a rough time. But hey, I hope I eat my words and that I am extremely wrong.
Hey "bro", I agree. That's just what I said.  If the computer can do it, I'd rather be doing something else.   You keep seeming to argue some point I am not arguing.
That's great, because you WILL be doing something else to earn money to live. If you're cool with that, we're in total agreement here.
I work in the documentary/news business so this Sora crap doesn't really interest me. Call me when this AI shit can make my penis bigger and keep it harder longer so I can stop popping these Blue Chews like they're M&Ms.
Just hit version 100 of a 30 second edit
Anybody else ever make it to the century club of revisions ?
Oh you must be the person my former client hired. Good luck!
99 once, we let that client go shortly after
138 is my record. It was a non-scripted testimonial spot for a bank with a cast of 10. There was another partner company involved so with 2 clients and an agency who all liked options got us to that magical number.
I hope you got paid extra for versions 4 - 100.
"please stop with your passive aggressive naming conventions." OMG IS THIS THE FINAL 80?
I edited a trailer that was V36A thru M, thirteen different music alts. 

Every tweak had to be replicated across all 13 alts. 
 
Let me tell you, I’ll take a v100 any day over that shit. 
Why?
V_100_2_29_2024
Yes. I had 107 revisions on a 6 second sting. I reported the AP to his manager.
135 here. For Super Bowl. Granted it was a trailer style edit working from a more long-form video to direct people to go see. The long-form we had nailed in maybe 12 versions ironically.
The highest was V12 and the funny insane part was that we returned to back to V1 with some tweaks, lol.
What creative agency are you working with? 😂
[STOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZzlPGnKdU&ab_channel=CrackerJack06)
In commercials it would be incredibly uncommon to not have 100 variations of the first edit. It just depends on if you dupe your sequence every time a small change is made.
Its when the versions start getting A,B,C suffixes when you know you are deep in it.
I wouldn’t even be mad at that point. Just impressed with their incompetence.
i need your contact details cause it seems you provide free work :)
I think v56 was my max…
I got 99 problems and they're all one client.
Thoughts & Prayers.
So obnoxious. Clearly an example of a client who is flailing around.
I routinely get up to 30-40 versions of promo spots these days. I just start pushing buttons after about 20 versions 😆 I can’t imagine 100+
Kinda cheating but I think I might have hit over 300. 

The caveat being it was 6 maybe 8 individual edits, but each had to be delivered in 16x9, 4x5, 1x1 & 9x16. Each "edit" had copy which kept on changing, then later down the line the copy started changing between the aspect ratios too. 

Absolute nightmare, and I later found out that the client decided not to use anything as they hated how everything had been captured, dim low-key lighting as opposed to the high-key commercial look.
Weird flex.
The most I’ve done I had someone do is 12. He hated me but he was phoning it in and realized a few weeks after. 

The most I’ve done is 30 - because the client was changing verbage & text nonstop. I’ve never been closer to quitting everything.

100 is absolutely insane
i’ll pray for you
I would've quit by 20
Who has the budget for 100 versions?!
I'll do one no problem, provided it doesn't counter what was agreed-upon.  If you want seconds, you better come with something that I failed on.  If I have to do a third, I'll question my life choices.  5? 10?  No way.  Unless you're paying a lot PER HOUR.  In that case I'll wash your car while I'm at it.
How does this even happen?
lmfao
At least you have work....
Are you working for Intuit?
But how many laps? Like how many times in that 100 have you presented virtually the same edit as v1 and had someone say "now that's feeling much better"
Never! I've been pretty lucky, even back in my agency days I never went higher than like version 8.

Now that I'm freelance I typically charge hourly, so I dream of 100 revisios. Gimme those billables!
Version 100? no. Usually by that time my versioning becomes something like Clientname\_30SecondSpot\_v35\_final\_final\_final\_Ifuckinghatethisclient\_rev3\_final\_final.mov

Good on you for maintaining consistency.
![gif](giphy|YmQLj2KxaNz58g7Ofg)
What kind of nutjob sends you back to the editing bay 100 times for a 30-second spot? No, what I want to know more is, what you’ve been taken to task for. Like, are they catching things in the editing that they want to de-emphasize, and others that they want stronger? Are they too vague to put into words, but they have you over a barrel, so you feel compelled to dig in again and grind out another edit?
V30 is my max now….
Yikes! I thought V12 was a lot
I hit 50 versions of a short documentary once. I think that's my personal record.
Never broke 3 digits but I feel your pain & am sending you final approval vibes.
It’s when I see half these comments like “that’s insane” and “my max is 12” that I question my sanity for going into trailers
That sounds fun as hell.
Wow, think low teens was my highest.
Oof, never been that high, but I can feel that frustration in my bone just reading that.

There have been a few …_final_v014_final_copy06»s innmy time
Not so much with an edit - but I've seen version 100+ for the schedule quite a few times.
I work with one creative that routinely hits between V30 and V40 before presenting to the account team. It's always funny to overhear the account manager saying the version number under his breath in a snarky manner, "version 36 huh?"

By the time we do client comments we get into the 50s and 60s. I'm not positive, but I bet if you include rounds of music options I've been really close to 100. Not sure I've passed it, but been close.

Then I have clients that barely break 4 versions...pretty stark contrast.
I personally haven’t but my friend who cut a Spider-Man trailer finished it on V.63rev which was really around version 100+
Good God, man.  My condolences.
Just wait for the cutdown. 😂
Are you working in-house or why/how is this even a thing?

I cap it at a few revisions and start charging for subsequent revisions. I've never come close to 100.
99 edits none of these ~~ain't~~ are the 1 HIT ME

edit: mangling of the reference / english at once
Not even close honestly. Maybe somewhere in the 40s.
Sheesh
Sounds like the client and producers didn’t quite know what they had in mind or a well developed plan and punted it for you to figure out. That or they like to leave it to you alone and then nitpick afterwards.

I know sitting in with the client or producers can suck, but I think it can mitigate these issues. Less back and forth.
Finished at v117 Rev on a trailer.
Oh man, hope you're not on a flat fee haha
suggestion...using 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc. you could still be on version 1.001 ! or maybe version 2.01
I’m currently on 46 of a BTS edit
You don't have a post manager or producer to lay the hammer down with "let's wrap this up!"

Still have fond memories of my old one ripping into the client when I was doing a toy ad 2 years back and the revisions made us go 2 weeks past deadline and it was affecting other projects in the pipeline.
So yes, but I at a job where I worked with a lot of animation/motion graphics and we versioned up every time we had a tiny change internally. Copy change, new 3D comp, legal changes, etc. So there where one or two spots where those type of little changes were coupled with a complicated edit (tons of unboarded live action elements) and really added up. Probaly only a dozen actual "edit" changes in terms of actual pacing/content, though. Just subtle iterations that got that version number up.
I Hope you’re hourly
As long as it’s billable hours at full rate, I say keep the revisions coming.
I don't do shoots I work from stock so once in a blue moon if I can sense a client might be like that I bail on it. Its a really tough call to make. But I have minimal losses because I don't have a crew. Had a guy come back with 17 change requests right off the bat once. And they were all so finickity. And it was a terrible project. I just thought this is gonna be one of those and I cut my losses. I had a guy once that was requesting so many changes and each change was like can you move the subtitles a couple of frames this way and that way. We went through every subtitle line and with 100 percent precision it had to line up with the syllable. I said to the guy I said you know I don't think anyones ever going to notice this. And he sighed because his business partner was making him do it. So he's giving me all these change requests and he's sharing in my pain. We had a mutual understanding of it. He's like i'm really sorry about this but can we just move the word "and" just a frame earlier. For the 20th time or what ever lol. He's basically just trying to appease his OCD business partner who's going through it frame frame with a tooth comb. Ridiculous.
This says everything.
Yikes. Were there revisions as little as "have that cut appear 5 frames later". New version.

And then, "no no, bring it back to the way it was". New version.

That sort of thing? I mean, how do you get to 138?!
I wonder how much time went into exporting. Or maybe one shouldn't dwell too much on that...
FINAL_rev2_USE_THIS_ONE_v4 😂
In my department people will frequently hide the "V" number or not increase it when duping as to avoid displaying higher version numbers when going through approvals.  I get it, but I don't like it.
"And can we get that tomorrow?"
V1 alt 

V1 alt a 

V1 alt why? 

V1 alt stop  

V1 alt go home already
Why not
There’s not supposed to be over half as many revisions as there are frames in the video! I’ll admit I get more irritated about excessive revisions than I should; but damn I don’t know how I would handle that. I’d be losing my mind at 20.
Ahh yes validation tea is cold, but it's good tea
Love when that happens. But not really
Exactly. A v1 for the client could easily be a v10 in my sequences.

Lololol
Gonna put “Killed my Kj5” on my headstone.
In a surprise coincidence I think 56 is my max too.
Naw, we've been there. Post should be tagged "support"
Same.
…you can’t be doing agency or scripted work. Right?
I’ve had clients that would seemingly pick out one thing they wanted to change at a time, ask for a revision, then find something else. Like they would just stop as soon as they saw something they wanted changed and then continue watching instead of asking for all of their changes at once. Couple that with clients that have *multiple* people that seemingly have the authority to ask for revisions, sometimes contradicting each other, and those revisions could run up quick. 

Often it was pretty obvious some people would ask for something to be changed just so it looks like they’re contributing. I’ve even been asked to “shorten it by half a frame” once.

I’ve never had as many revisions as OP, but I can imagine how shit like this would happen lol
Either too many cooks or someone on top is deeply incompetent.
People who are highly critical yet wildly non-specific, and unable to communicate what they want.
Layers of approval. Supervisors, producers, directors, distribution company, streaming company, all with numerous members and priorities. Oh yeah, and the most powerful approver, lawyers.
Ver 2: You must the person my former client hired. Good Chuck!
It wasn’t anything too nitpicky about length. It was more about crafting an unscripted story in 30 seconds where 10 people all talk about the same features. Everything was like dominos. Swap person A with person B saying a line, of wait now we need more diversity, oh we love Person C saying this line but we need to now connect them with Person D and so on and so on. The best was when one of the clients removed a talent all together and trying to rebuild the edits with the people left.
There is a reason I date my timelines/project files/exports with y/m/d, avoids that mess
ProjectName_02-28-23_v26_ISwearToGodIfYouDontUseThisOne_v666
Idk, I’m paid by the project, not by the hour. I would never do 100 revisions on anything. Wtf.
My revisions came in so thick and fast that I could barely render a new example before the next change.

Tbf with this guy I did it deliberately. We'd worked together before on some other stuff and I could tell he was delusional so I left him to his own devices, lost a day in edit and fed that back to his boss so he could sort him out. To be fair it worked and that producer is way better now overall.
Yeah no client would ever get to 100 revisions if they're paying for it so I just assumed it's a flat fee.
Generally I can’t imagine going for a flat fee unless we’d already agreed upon how many days/weeks/etc. I’d be working on the project
Also many don't
“Half a frame” is literally the anus of asks
I've been a part of that entire list and still can't comprehend how any cut gets this many revisions!
V16 still super rough cut
Holy f that's brutal. By version 20 you probably already know the whole thing by heart and the way it SHOULD be edited. And by version 50 you probably don't even care anymore. 

Anyways this one is for my nightmares...thanks for sharing!
How do you do when you do different versions on the same day? Like 20240229v1 or? Just curious cause I do the same with the project but not with exports. I always prefer just v1, v2, etc. if one is radically different I go A_v1, B_v1. But would love to hear other people’s thoughts on this
Well yeah that makes sense. I'm paid by the day so if they wanna make 1000 versions let it rain. Most versions I've ever done would be in the 90s
And thats why you try to get paid more for revisions.
[deleted]
I just worked on a superbowl spot that got to over 250 versions. We're all getting day rates over here and they paid for it.
I give 1, sometimes 2, revisions for the quoted price and charges apply for anything after that. Maybe OP doesn’t charge until 99?
Some of us are staff editors. The boss gets unlimited revisions. 

Not as bad as flat fee, but I’d much prefer to move on to a new project.
[deleted]
“This is a great start.  I just have a few thoughts”
I am happy to share! Oh and one last thing that helped inflate the numbers is when we did get a revision we would have to present 4-8 different options on how to address that revision.
Oh I do a time stamp as well! Like today I called my timeline “Pilot_Name_Of_Show_24_2_29_11.30_AM”. This works really well cause, with the use of AM/PM it still remains alphabetical!

I use the same format for exports, and once we get to close to picture lock I start including picture lock in the name.
Yeah I just do numbers and then letters if things start branching; but I don't know that I could handle more than two layers of branching.  There must be enterprise version control for this stuff.
I name same-day versions as A, B, C, etc.

Client_Project_240301_A

It's very rare for me to have more than 4-5 of them per day.
I do [YYYY_MM_DD]_[TITLE]_[VERSIONNUMBER] regardless of what day I export it.

e.g. "2024_03_01_HatersPodcastEp21_v01"

Then if I make a new version same day it's "2024_03_01_HatersPodcastEp21_v02"

And if I make a new version the next day it's

"2024_03_02_HatersPodcastEp21_v03"

EDIT: Btw, reddit formatting messes up my file name at the top of my comment. Examples are accurate though
I use letters.  I'm not in advertising, so I don't know if it's possible to run out!

So today is march 1st, so my seqs will be 0301a, 0301b, 0301c, etc.
[deleted]
I mean, if I’m paid by the hour, I don’t care either way. I just happen to never work like that
In that case I need contact details to your clients :D
superbowl spot is an entirely different category
Two is my standard thing.
Yeah
Version 127:

"This is looking great! I'm so excited! Now we can show it to the board and ask for their notes."
This is a great start. Now i'm going to take a big shit all over your work.
That… that hurts my brain. Ow.
24 hour time makes so much sense. Imagine using 24 hour time and someone saying nah, we’re going to make the day two 12 hour segments and we’ll flip over at the middle of the day. Also AM and PM change an hour away from the flip, because screw you. Sorry, soap box topic.
Hourly with minimum hrs is better
Initial deliverable scoped at a set price, revisions quoted hourly. I recommend trying that sometime, you might like it! It makes revisions much more enjoyable, haha.
Board: “I don’t love the music”
No I totally agree, it’s just I have to convert from 24 hour to 12 hour, so it’s just not worth it for me.
naw it’s better for them to buy your whole day. some days you’ll get paid a full rate to swap out a graphic.
[deleted]
I don’t have that option
Can we maybe see the beginning of 16 along with the ending of 64...Oh, and maybe replace the actor in the middle - we can do that with AI right?
It's also less likely to be intuitive for clients. But it would be more straightforward. Thank you for humoring me.
That’s what hourly with minimum hrs is. You get paid based on 8hrs whether you work the full 8 or 1hr, but you also get overtime
OT starts after 8, oftentimes it’s just built into the day rates, but you are still getting OT after 8. At least in California and NY https://dol.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/03/overtime-frequently-asked-questions_0.pdf
O i see what you mean. That’s not bad at all. Assistants have this in a way. Half day up to 5hrs, full 10 after that.

Don’t think you’ll get an 8 hr day or OT in commercials though.
Most editors I know have this, myself included. The only half days I ever allow is having to log on for a meeting or review on a weekend, doesn’t matter if it’s only 15m, we bill for 4hrs.
Switching from Adobe Premiere pro to DaVinci made me realise how bad Adobe products are.
Adobe used to be good but let's be honest they haven't done anything good since 2010 to improve. Their software must be built on spaghetti code by now it's quite embarrassing how bad and overly complicated it is.

DaVinci for me is more smooth user experience and faster software. With Adobe I thought maybe I have to upgrade my PC (RTX 3080) because it would be laggy and buggy. All these problems are gone with DaVinci. 

Wish they also made Photoshop and LR Alternatives - would switch in a heartbeat.
I mean... okay. I like Resolve too, but there's still no alternative to After Effects. And dynamic link + copying and pasting clips between Premiere and AE is a pretty neat trick. 

Right tool for the right job.
For me, I use a lot of masking tools. And da Vinci resolve does not allow me to quickly copy and paste those in the same way premier pro does, which makes editing YouTube content a lot easier on premier Pro.
Wait.  2010?  I understand this post is primarily hyperbole, but maybe shoot for 2020 as a comparison or something to be have your opinion taken seriously.

Both tools have advantages.  Utilize them to the max.  To have strict loyalty to one over the other is a poor professional decision.
I rather like Premier Pro, though.
Watch out, the Adobe defenders will come for you. In all seriousness, it's good to have experience with both. For my full time job, I have to use the Adobe Suite but for Freelance and personal projects, DaVinci all the way. I prefer DaVinci simply because I actually own my software and everything I need is under one roof. If you are looking for alternatives to Photoshop and Lightroom, Affinity Photo is essentially a stripped down photoshop and it's a one time fee for the version. Darktable is a Lightroom alternative that I really haven't played much with but it's free. Have fun with DaVinci!
Do you even edit with proxies tho?
What about for all you after effects stuff? I don’t have a single project I don’t use both?
I just like how modular premiere windows are. I always keep moving them for different purposes.
Can we stop with these posts? There is zero value in them.
I think it’s more that hobbyists find DaVinci a better fit for their needs whereas professionals who are used to the post-prod process get better use out of Premiere as a whole, even with all the hiccups you have to deal with. There is no such thing as a perfect fit for every single person and even more so today with casual users dipping into editing as ~creators~ who have a whole different world of demands from their editing software.
But photoshop audition after effects is more better from dr fairlight or fusion difficult win adobe ecosystem is huge
Premiere editor here who recently picked up editing on Resolve - I use either depending on the workflow. If the spot starts and finishes with me and has a fast turnaround (like YouTube/Social, etc) I’m in Resolve. If I’m working on a spot with a wider team, more media, and a longer post timeline, Premiere and After Effects. Since every workflow is different, it all depends on what the project needs :)
U know what? i use both of them and many others. Each software for where it shine.
Well I still prefer to use premiere because of dynamic link
I do not do Video editing, but have been using Adobe products for 20 years and it been a pleasure to use Figma for a couple of years now, going back to PS, Il, seem like going back to an old application that I do not want to use anymore.
I wish I could get off Adobe forever but the way I edit is so well fitted to how premiere and after effects work that I can never leave. Almost every project I get involves both and I can’t imagine giving up dynamic link. 

Maybe if I were to give up editing/animation as a career I could be free, but until then I’m Adobe’s prisoner.
Same boat as you. Davinci is way ahead
There are a few things keeping me from switching but by far the biggest factor is dynamic link. As someone who works with motion graphics a lot or in general just has a lot of reasons to pop open After Effects and sometimes Photoshop and Audition for something quick it's invaluable and saves insane amounts of time. I do color in Davinci and I hate needing to switch back and forth for that but it's necessary for me to be productive long term.

It's unfortunate but they just have that monopoly in offering a one stop shop for everything and everything being integrated into each other. It runs like shit and dynamic link is everything but perfect but it's better than the alternative.
Da Vinci learned me how bad their built in H264/5 encoders are compared to ffmpeg, main concept or codecs implemented in hardware encoding boxes.

General da vinci users thinking on this issue is - "its made for pro users, they do not render to H264 so quality is irrelevant, render to DNxHR"

Using external encoder is one more step you need to do.
I teach editing at a university and recommend to all my students to use Da Vinci, the free version is amazing for students. Adobe’s bullshit punitive measures when you try to cancel a membership is enough to never recommend to my cash strapped students to use it. 
Clambering for the day something feature-rich and as easy to use as after effects, but not slow as fuck, eventually comes out
Hate me for it but I switched to fcpx and never looked at premier pro lol I may get roasted but idc it’s easier workflow for me since i have an apple eco system and plus the one time payment va the monthly shit is a big factor also. yet all the employers insist that you know premier pro lol
I switched to Resolve because I don’t like Adobe’s subscription model, but Premiere has improved the last few years. It was a lot more stable toward the end of my using it.
LR Alternative ? Capture One Pro. Hands down. Same feeling from PR to DR. Adobe is in the past.
There is a free, open-source Photoshop alternative called Gimp.
It's interesting since DaVinci itself is based on old software as well, and they also stuck two other code bases into is (Fusion and Fairlight) which created some weird things like different shortcuts between the color and fusion pages or features that get introduced in the color page and aren't available in Fusion even though you want them there as well. 

This isn't just about complexity and age of the software. It might be more about the goals of each company. BlackMagic is just a much more customer first company while Adobe is a shareholders first company.
Still haven’t seen a professional job that required Davinci though. Everything is still mostly Avid with premiere being second.
I am currently in a state where I think all NLEs suck. Bigtime.

Premiere is schizophrenic and lags and has trivial issues.

Resolve doesn’t do all the stuff Premiere and MediaComposer do.

MediaComposer is buggy and less flexible. Editing a big TV show in anything else is suicide. Editing socials in MC is hell.

For instance synchronizing footage is a pain in Premiere or Resolve. MC is perfect for this. And no, I don’t wanna buy another software for this (Pluraleyes).

I need After Effects anyways, Media Encoder helps a lot too. Thus I have to pay for the whole CC suite.

Fusion (or Motion) have only a small amount of the features AE has… I could replace Photoshop with Afinity, but again - I have to pay for the CC suite already…

I am so tired of this, I might stop editing at all…1/4 of the time is troubleshooting why something doesn’t work. Sure, in a big post house you have people for that. I am not a big post house.
👍 cool story bro
What sort of work do you do primarily? Been thinking about making the switch for my next feature cause I’m getting a little tired of all of Adobe’s quirks…
I want for davanci to soar— so, so badly. Premiere really is a joke in 2024 built on early 2000’s code that legit bottlenecks the entire software. 

Sadly there’s still no good full replacement for after effects, much less Premiere. Especially 2D animation/mograph. Some small projects are lifting off the ground, but i’ll be the first one to fully jump ship when some other app gets 85% of AE/Premiere’s capability.
I’m glad you like Davinci! I tried it, genuinely, but after a year of use I still just didn’t like it as much as premiere. So now I sail the high seas and use premiere again lol
Affinity Photo and Capture one are some Photoshop and LR alternatives that work well.
Recently ( just 2hrs before ) Adobe released their video generative ai for premier pro, just like for Photoshop. Damn it's good, but after a while I think it can get better. It also has Sora integrated into it . 

I think Adobe has got the monopoly with content creation using AI
Is there a pros and cons list of both softwares that someone has posted here? Just would be interesting to see as someone who only does very basic editing and has no in-depth knowledge on the software.
I tried resolve this week and was also impressed, really thinkink about switching.
I tend to jump back and forth between the programs. Adobe Premiere is good if you can wield all the interconnected softwares (AI, AE, PSD...) and workaround the cons (some effects are absolute bonkers once you apply , nest on nest on est). Davinci I specifically use for tracking and painting / anything that needs to stick on moving motion - my launch missile option if AE fails to track lol. Proxy and master media processing really great on Davinci as well. If you can wield both Adobe and Davinci softwares, you walking on water
>Wish they also made Photoshop and LR Alternatives - would switch in a heartbeat.

I hope they don't do that. Part of the reason Adobe is so screwed up is the mentality that you need keep adding features , adding new products .... nah son , just make what you have work flawlessly

They should, literally, create a new version of Premiere from scratch, and let users use the old versions. The main problem with Premiere and After Effects is that a lot of plugins and workflows are just not compatible with other software.
I use after effects a lot because it’s amazing for specific use cases. as for completing and arranging big projects Adobe is a steaming pile of goat stuff
Agreed - the playback difference is unreal! I also love the ease with color correction.

I almost feel bad for whoever's working on Premiere - it's essentially Howl's Moving Castle.
So, how long it will take you for avid?
I also switched back then, ended up using both but client projects always lean towards premiere, ae etc.
The workflow is just superior when it comes to that. I feel like people who can fully enjoy davinci are people working on cinematic stuff like feature films etc.
I have switched to Luminar Neo from Lightroom! It's so much better!
I love all Adobe softwares.
This thread: My shit NLE is better than your shit NLE.
I mean yeah resolve is amazing but I'm curious what workflows in AE requires a beefy GPU for you. Im pretty sure only some handful of plug ins and effects use the GPU and most every task is delegated to the CPU. Maybe that's the issue. Resolve uses the GPU for most of its tasks. Apples and oranges. Personally I like to use whatever tool is right for the job.
Ive heard the reason the programs are so large is that they don’t redo code, they just keep stacking it and leaving last years. Something like that 😄
Damn, I mean, premiere is definitely a poorly optimized piece of software, but was it really that buggy and laggy for you? I’ve managed to run it pretty well on 2019 iMacs.
In 2024 you can’t install adobe programs in any folder/partition other than the system one. A problem known from like 2010. This says it all. I had to pay ease us to merge my partitions cause of adobe.
I’d switch in a heartbeat if Davinci would add “move playhead to cursor” without me having to write code to make it happen
I think their AI integration in Photoshop is pretty amazing
I was working on a feature in Avid off an external HDD without issue, but I couldn't cut a short in Premiere off an internal NVMe SSD without incredible lag or crashes.

And yes, I "cleared my Media Cache."
Agreed
Resolve is shit, but Adobe is far worse these days

I’m starting a job on Premiere today and dreading it so much!! I’ve been trying to figure out if I can just work in DaVinci and then use export my final sequence back to the premiere project for the other editor to finish it there?? It’s a multicam shoot with lots of media, so I’m not sure if it could work that easy?? But either way, I agree OP
[deleted]
Kind of agree RE dynamic link but it’s also an absolute mess management wise. Adobe doesn’t want to help the user in that department, which is what devalues the company the most imo. If they helped with the cumbersome task of daily management just a little, I might take them more seriously. Right now they just want splashy marketing BS improvements that mean little to nothing.
Dynamic link is so finicky that it's just as easy for me to export from Resolve and back than it was to do it through Adobe products specifically
Is this true? I was talking to an old client and they said they’ve switched to davinci. I said I’d miss the dynamic link and after effects, and he said there’s no need because davinci can do more or less everything you’d need in after effects. Although I guess it depends on what you use after effects for.
Have you tried Fusion?
Dynamic link is a gimmick for solo freelancers who need to do a shot or two here and there. If you're doing VFX or mograph work at scale, it's woeful.
Have you tried doing it through the Fusion panel, theres a lot of masking tools and every bode is easily replicable.
It’s ridiculous there’s no quick garbage mask tool or something like that in resolve.
It's a pretty huge piece of software.  I imagine if you had access to a git diff of Premiere, most of the code from 2010 is still there, pretty much unchanged.  Stuff has been added.  Bugs have been fixed.  Dependencies have been updated.  But I really can't imagine they went in and rewrote vast swathes of it under the hood since 2010.

I'd genuinely be surprised if that's hyperbole at all.  OTOH, the same is true of Resolve.  The underlying Resolve/Fusion/Fairlight code won't have changed that much either.  If you had a cryogenically frozen Digital Fusion developer from 1997, you could probably unthaw them today and start assigning them bugs to fix without too much trouble.
I actually think 2010 is right on the mark. Premiere CS5 (2010) was the last groundbreaking release from Adobe IMO. Since then the improvements have been a lot less substantial.
Ok 2010, or 2020... I threw a random year, but what new things did they actually do or UI improvements did they add since then, with all that Adobe money?

They boast:
GPU acceleration, seems like deaccelaration to me tbh.
Enhanced colour correction (lol...)
Improved audio edition (double lol)
Support for new formats...
Ok they added text to speech! Wow! Mobile apps have that.
But it's basically exactly the same clunk as it was in CS5 times, just use all the plug-in other people make to make it workable.
Yeah Resolve is very powerful for certain things but every time I try to edit in it, it just feels so much more clunky. I don’t know what it is but I just don’t like the “feeling” of editing in Resolve as much. I probably just need to get used to it but I can move so much quicker in Premiere.
> Affinity Photo is essentially a stripped down photoshop

True. But now it’s owned by Canva. And I think it’s uncertain if it will sustain development investment or if it will plateau and stagnate. 


I’m rooting for it, but mergers and acquisitions usually aren’t great for the software that got bought. 
Affinity is rad but I'm finding the AI stuff in Photoshop really cool for fixing stuff in real estate photo work. And Lightroom is good. At least the Photoshop/Lightroom tier subscription is reasonably priced so I can get rid of the full suite sub.
Only with 4k and up clips
Typically, I’d kill anything like this fairly early. NAB has me looking at /r/editors less than normal. So, stuff is more likely to get through. Once something has quite a bit of traction it’s generally easier to leave live.  Know that if two people flag a post it gets pulled until a Mod can see it.
This is an editors sub and OP is discussing the software choices for editing…this seems like exactly the type of post that should be here.
Sorry for your time loss
Also-- pros generally don't decide the software and post supes are (rightly) very conservative
Pre-2011 everyone said this about Premiere lol
I have the same experience using figma and came back to photoshop
I don’t use premiere because I like it. I use it because it’s expected of me by producers.
I agree with you on a philosophical level (and I love Resolve too), but Premiere is a lot more widely used than Resolve. Is it really the best advice to give students to recommend they avoid the most widely used editing software? They’re more employable by learning both (along with Avid).
Fellow editing teacher here. I personally prefer teaching Premiere at the intro level because of how easy project file management is, and how consistent the interface is. That being said, you’re not wrong about the yearly-subscription-paid-monthly model: it’s confusing for first-time users, and there should be a way for school/enterprise plans to grant offsite licenses to students so they don’t have to get their own at home (or maybe that’s just an issue with my school?).

As to Resolve, I like it a lot, but the free version doesn’t support the codec used by our cameras (without transcoding), and Fusion is harder to both use and teach IMO than After Effects. I still tell students to use it if they want a free editing program at home, though.

I know you said you don't want to pay for another program for syncing but I just wanna throw it out there that Syncaila is awesome for syncing. It's as fast as it takes for it to read the files- the time it spends syncing is not even noticeable, and the only mistakes I've seen it make are when I was trying to use it to organize and sync extremely vague waveforms over 12 hours of footage with unhelpful metadata. It's a one time payment and has a free trial.
Thanks bro 👍
I had been using Resolve as my long form NLE and then Ae for all of my Motion/ text stuff. Recently I didn't have access to Ae do to work and was forced to learn to do everything I was doing with Ae in Resolve Fusion and I could replicate a lot in Fusion.
Been using Darktable a free alternative to LR. It’s really good
What about Resolve is so shit? Have you checked out the latest release? It’s still in beta but it’s pretty damn impressive, IMO.
XMLs will get you in and out
RTX 3080 I think that's 12GB of VRAM and I have 16gb of RAM. 

I work with the latest studio drivers too. I have the same problem with Lightroom crashing constantly.
Basically my pc can run everything else, including new games at high 4k settings, but Adobe programs are choking every time.

I really don't get it.
I mean, productions, text editing, auto transcripts, enhance audio... these aren't nothing. 

Do I wish they'd double down on the basics, work more on stability and system efficiency? 100%. But there have been plenty of nifty features they've added over the past handful of years I use every day. 

And I worry a bit about being seen as some type of Adobe fanboy. I'm realllyyy not. They have PLENTY of issues and things I wish they'd do better on. I just like a world where Adobe and Resolve both exist. Options are good. Competition is good.
Ain’t nothing wrong with that workflow either.
Hard agree.
You can still use After Effects, it has no bearing on which NLE you use. Just import your AE exports to Resolve, no big deal and no need to use Fusion. The 3.2 seconds you save by using dynamic link is _nothing_ compared to the time you save doing edit/colour/sound in Resolve.
You can do a lot with Fusion, but it’s just not set up for 2D mograph work, especially when you are working with an art director in illustrator or wherever. Fusion is a compositor at heart. 

If you are just doing lower thirds and an end card, sure, you may get away with it. But the minute you need to do a complex rig, it gets pretty difficult.
Yep. Love Fusion... for compositing. 

But art directors and designers work in paths and they work in layers, not nodes. It's just not designed for 2D mograph work. Can you do a lot with it? Absolutely. But I don't know any dedicated mograph artists who will choose Fusion over AE. 

The combo of illustrator, AE and Premiere is pretty damn powerful.
Copying clips from Premiere and pasting them into a comp in AE with the timecode intact and all laid out is pretty great. Doesn't seem like a gimmick at all.
I haven’t, no. Granted, I tried resolve a while ago, and after a weekish I went back to Premier Pro. So it’s possible at the time there weren’t any YouTube tutorials showing the tools I needed, or an update for that wasn’t out at the moment. Or, could’ve been that my googling skills weren’t up to speed.

Either way, that’s what kept me away from in the past, and now I use Lightroom and Photoshop so often as well it just makes sense to stay in the ecosystem. Thanks for the comment!
There is if you do it in the color page (with alpha outputs). It's stupid to tab over to a different page to do it, but it works. But yeah agree Adobe masking in the edit pages is miles better.
Pro compositor or no compositor is Resolve's motto.
There literally is though. Colour tab. You don't have to use the software but don't throw shade at it because you didn't learn how to use it properly. It's significantly more powerful than Premiere at almost every editing task, but you do need to invest some time to learn how it works, which in some cases is a little different to Premiere. They all have quirks, but when you've used a program for many years, those quirks start to feel "normal" to us, and we forget that we have in fact just adapted to one particular software's way of doing things.
They did a UI change a few years back, which didn't really change much except for a more "streamlined" workflow. Wouldn't say it was groundbreaking, but that's the last time they actually changed things in a significant way iirc.

Aside from that I fully agree with you.
Yes, still the same 'buggy' copy paste behaviour since 2010... that we had in FCP7 before.
Have you used their new transcription plugin?

It's fucking incredible.
Same, I'm not going to speculate what will happen. I'm gonna use it until they give me a reason not to
If you resubscribe during their Black Friday sale window, the entire suite is cheaper than Premiere + After Effects.
There was a time when even television shows shot at 1080 and up were "proxied" and cut at 720. 

Workflows matter more than tools.
It's a topic that's been done to death. It's practically a weekly post at this point. Does this post bring anything new to the table that any of the others didn't?

At the end of the day, both NLEs have their strengths and weaknesses. Use the best tool for the job at hand.
It's not discussing the software choices - it's a rant with no substance. All noise, no signal. Which isn't useful in a sub for professional editors.
I remember! I was firmly a FCP7 head
This.
I went to school on FCP and within a year of graduating FCX launched. I went on to spend over 10 years in video. Going through that rug pull taught me that learning new software is part of the job. The more time school can spend on what end viewers see, the better. What sets good editors apart isn’t the tools they use, but the results they deliver. I think your point about Premiere making students more employable is valid, but I’m also against schools focusing on the tools too much. It made more sense when tools were more difficult to use, but today they’re super easy*. (Avid is still Avid.) So I’m a bit conflicted, but I think this adds to the conversation.
We teach premiere at our uni, but it’s looking like we’ll swap over to Da Vinci, the issue is access, it’s so expensive the students can’t get Premiere outside of class. Cost of living crisis is bad, but it’s even worse for students. Re: codec. We’ve had that issue too with the free version, but Handbrake is also free, and if you’re a student with no OEM version available on Premiere, DaVinci / handbrake is really the only choice.
But here is the issue - all NLEs have a sort of automatic synching. In Premiere you can select the clips that are supposed to be synched and it'll do it without problems.

I just wanna select 3 bins (2 cameras, 1 audio) and let it do it's thing. I know it can do it, because if I select the approriate clips in one slate, it will do it. But Adobe says noooooooooooooooooo, god forbid I select a few bins and it'll do by itself.

At Adobe they do not care about the users, they do not even care about features. We are getteing "generative fill", but the basic stuff does not work!
I want to love fusion! Can’t imagine the team has the resources to build it out to eventually compete 1:1 with AE but I can dream
basic functions are broken for several versions, some for more than a decade. Basics, that Avid and premiere did get right back in the 90s (like source patching, growing files, clip switching, syncing, merge clips, etc...). I assume the people who downvote me didn't use Resolve in a professional environment yet where new features a nice but a working and reliable software is much much more important and I've had instances where Resolve failed us greatly requiring us to resort to porting an ongoing project to another NLE. 
Other professionals agree, it's always the beginners who are flashed by Resolve's feature set, but in the end none of that counts if you can't work with it reliably.
16GB of RAM is the problem imo
Your CPU might be the bottleneck, Light room and most Adobe products are more CPU heavy than GPU, GPU is only worth investing in if you do 3D work. Video Editing and photography is not the same as playing a game at high in 4K, like all our workstations use Quadro M2000 with 3gb vram, 32GB ram but we use high end intel Xeon processors (film & TV).
Yeah as someone who just switched from Adobe to DaVinci I really miss the Capture Noise Print on Adobe Audition. Literally the only reason I used that program.
I think text/transcribing is good addition but the implementation of it is complete trash and almost makes it unusable in my experience.  Productions is fine.  Outside of that, I feel like things have either been flashy marketing garbage while the core functionality of the program has regressed.  I am glad some have had a brighter outlook but I'm honestly just happy if its a stable release, which never really happens until just before the next major release.  



Adobe is such a mid company otherwise.  BUT, its a million times better then MC!!
True. But to update ae projects and have it automatically update in premiere is super sweet. But I guess not a huge deal. I don’t even use after effects super heavy anyway so I should just move to resolve. I still hate that I can’t seem to have multi screen and a modular workspace like in premiere tho?
I have discovered this in the past few days. Fusion is REALLY not designed for doing motion graphics particularly anything related to text layout.
Agree copy paste is more useful; I was talking particularly about dynamic link, which creates a data management nightmare for data flow, shot versioning etc
I do recommend giving it a play if you get time (you can do a lot of trial and error in the free version), to be honest finding the right tutorials to replicate what you want is super difficult, I built out a 12min long text animated video (with callouts, video masking, highlighting) and almost every step of the way had to figure out how to do things myself. It only took a few weeks and I can do a lot of what I was doing in Ae in Fusion.

Though if you are enjoying the Adobe ecosystem have a look at incorporating Ae and dynamic linking give yourself a few more tools to build out quick and complex masks.
This is totally it. The masking in the color page is actually super easy to work with as soon as you figure out where it’s hiding lol.
The only change was instead of having an export popup you just get an export tab with identical UI
The 2022 GUI changes pissed a lot of long time Premiere editors off & now you'll find a lot less goodwill coming from the people who've paid Adobe monthly since 2014 since since they feel not listened to & unappreciated.

The people who make decisions for Premiere's product should give high priority to long time user feedback, rather than polling & catering social media editors who've taught themselves Premiere over the last couple of years & don't even know the breadth of the tools in Premiere(at least that is what it appears they've been doing)

I agree CS 5 was the last big change, but going to 64bit & standard GPU acceleration to enable real-time editing with HD & AVC codecs natively was all of the industry's last big change.  No, they haven't justified monthly payments for an evolving app after that. Change has been very incremental and changes often adding no net gain, sometimes upgrading modules with inferior replacements.  Even going back to CS6, removing the playback shuttle tool was a bad idea, especially coupled with the option of choosing your transport tools added at the same time. You can't let the editor make the choice of what to devote the minuscule bit of gui real estate to? "No. We're Adobe. We've made the choice. We're moving forward. Next Question!"

Then like PP22's redesign, changes over later releases really just affected the default steps they built into starting and exporting projects, were just a pia to editors who already had a good workflow or knew what they were doing.

Bad habit of shitting up the software trying to make it stupid-proof goes way way back. Replacing Audition with Soundbooth in pre-creative cloud Adobe Production Packages was emblematic.

So my opinion definitely doesn't match much r/premiere or r/premierepro attitudes, but is likely more relatable to r/editors , in that it's exactly because Premiere is reliable & quick that I find it indispensable right now. If Resolve ever gets me to the same productivity I have no issues dropping Adobe.
For sure. I do kinda suspect that development will squash bugs, make the software *very* stable - and then set it on autopilot.  


  
All while we start to see the same features begin to bubble up in Canva.   


As much as I would like Canva to keep developing Affinity as a "Pro" line for Canva....I'm too cynical at this point. I'd be pretty surprised to see that kind of good software stewardship.  


But yeah. Legit Adobe alternative (mostly). I'd hate to see it stagnate. Adobe needs competition.
Cool. I canceled and they gave me a good deal for another year!
If only they had Davinci
[removed]
I never changed my mind about Premiere being the worst. I was trying to point out the parallels between what you’re saying now and that’s exactly what everyone use to say about FCP7 compared to Premiere. If you used Premiere, you weren’t “professional.” Premiere didn’t suddenly improve overnight, Apple just misstepped so hard that everyone fled to it and it turns out it was “Post production ready” the whole time.

People like to use “not ready for prime time” as a way to describe various NLEs and I’ve never understood why. Resolve has a lot of newer features, but it is a 30 year old piece of software that proved its capabilities a long time ago. People seem to think of THEIR tool to be the one that professionals use. FCPX, Resolve, Premiere, and Avid are all great and viable tools. Using one or the other doesn’t make someone less of a professional.
This is what they said about Avid ten years ago. 
I guess I’d argue that having proper training on all 3 (even if students are eventually allowed to pick their favourite) is better than learning just one and then having to self-learn another NLE to actually land a job.

Also, it’s definitely easier to learn a third NLE than it is to learn a second one, if that makes sense. When learning a second you’re constantly up against questions of “how do I make it be like the thing I’m used to?” whereas by the time you’re learning a *third* NLE you can understand all of them much better because you appreciate how and why software might behave differently.

I do also totally take your point that learning the ‘art of editing’ is more valuable than just becoming competent with software. I guess the question comes down to how you view education: some people want something vocational that is more directly applicable to their entry into the world of work whereas others value a more intellectual/theoretical education.
That's pretty cool of media composer to do that straight from the bins actually, but it's not just syncing camera angles, it's also putting tons of footage in chronological order of when it was shot over the course of hours, which is what I usually use it for. Though it does involve a little more work than 2 clicks lol
It’s true that I’ve not used it in a professional setting yet, however all the features you’re mentioning *do* work now.  
Personally I think Avid is still the only sensible choice for most professional projects, but DaVinci _does_ seem to be the best next choice (over Premiere). I’m just starting a professional Premiere project this week and it’s quite frustrating to use. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Probably you're right.  I thought so too that 16gb is on a low side... I will upgrade soon.

But my point is why is it not a problem for DaVinci then...
I have intel i7 12th gen 2.1ghz
Out of curiosity, what makes the text/transcribing almost unusable in your case?
Respectfully, MC is a niche product. No apples to oranges comparison there.
Multi screen you absolutely can have! The modular workspace no. The idea is that everything stays in the same place, so your muscle memory builds up fast and you become insanely rapid at tasks since stuff doesn't move to different points on the screen all the time.
I agree it's a jarring change at first because you're coming at it from a standpoint of "I should have maximum flexibility" (I felt the same), but give it a try - you may learn to love it!
IMO you kinda gotta be careful about using words like ‘gimmick’. There are plenty of real respectable editors/mograph designers at real post houses doing real high value commercial work using dynamic link. 

For example if you are doing a supervised session with a client working the edit and the graphics at the same time, and there’s lots of alphas going on, dynamic link is a hell of a tool. And you can do things like nesting comps in AE to give some version control. 

Is it the right tool for a full VFX pipeline? No. Are some of those things you mentioned real potential issues especially on larger projects? Absolutely. But are there real pros using dynamic link on real work even at very high levels? Yup.
yeah but i agree i wish it was in the edit page

DaVinci Resolve is def not ready for prime time but yeh all are great in their own little ways.
AutoSequence!!!! One feature that would cost a dev mayber 2h of work! And Adobe isn't able to do that in YEARS!!!!!!
I've read this so many times and in the end they never worked. I'm gonna try the new version once I finish a few projects but I'm pretty certain they didn't fix those. At least I didn't find notes about that in the changelog.


btw Avid: It has gotten worse too. TBH I feel there's no good NLE out there right now. All of them feel broken but resolve to me is the most usable one. 
It’s just not a problem yet lol. What CPU do you have?
Maybe a bug in my version but when I have the TEXT window open, Premiere erratically bounces my playhead all around the timeline.  So I lose the spot I was at, then I have to find it again, it's frustrating.  I've spent way too much time trying to figure out a fix or solution and the only thing that makes it stop is to close the TEXT window.  Real bummer b/c its great for cutting loads of VO.  Also, the TEXT box crashes all the time.  I realize you can just close and reopen but...
For what I do, MC is far and away an inferior product.
All fair points! Yes I concede perhaps gimmick was maybe a bit far, I do still think it's somewhat of a half baked implementation, but for sure those are eminently reasonable cases for its value.
My point is: why do I have to proxy with my power rig pc on premier when DaVinci runs smoothly without? Is it not a software issue?
What is it premiere can do that resolve can’t?
12th gen Intel i7-12700 2.1ghz
Understand. That’s what I was saying by niche product. Best of luck in your career!
Because some codecs aren’t built to edit with (h264/h265). You probably FEEL resolve running better because it automatically generates optimized media by default which is basically making proxies for you as you work.
You should probably google "optimized media" for resolve before you keep talking your big game
You should always use 720p or 1080p proxies (or even lower), with any NLE, doesnt matter if your pc can handle it. Not doing this just screams amateur and almost unprofessional to some extent imo. It's a good practice to abide by.
You know the answer to that and so does the whole industry, hence Resolve still not being a go to for prime time
One of the systems I use is very similar to yours with more RAM (12700k, 3070, 64gb RAM) and personally, Premiere runs great with only hiccups on larger projects. It might just be the RAM holding you back - granted you probably only need 32gb.
I'm pretty sure resolve does not generate optimized media by default. I have never encountered this.
I’m genuinely asking because I don’t know. I’ve been working exclusively in Resolve with a team since 2021 and we haven’t run into anything that makes us say “we can’t use this”
Leaving the industry...
After 20 years of editing shows, I have to leave. This last year has just been godawful...I've barely worked at all, and it seems that there's no ending in sight.  My savings are gone. I can't sleep at night.  I can't even treat my wife to dinner anymore.

I'm trying to figure out where else to go and wanted to see what everyone else is doing?
I feel this. My lease here is up in September and I’m seriously considering leaving town, doing a whole different career
[deleted]
I feel this and I'm not even at that level. I dunno if you know Blue Collar Post Collective but they're doing a conversation/stream kinda thing tomorrow at 4p ET called "Diversifying Income for Post Production Freelancers." [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdRYGPcaxdM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdRYGPcaxdM) I intend to tune in, might be helpful or not to others. I'm working every angle I can to land some editing work but I'd be lying if I'm not looking at spending some of my evenings learning to code or something. Maybe that's on its way out, too. The future's so dim, I gotta take off my shades!
My wife and I have this convo daily about what else would I do. So far it's been fruitless. This shit has been brutal and I'm just furious all the time. I like what I do, I'm good at it, I have a great resume and tons of contacts but I just can't actually DO it.
I don't blame you. I've managed to work but I'm honestly not comfortable staying in this business anymore. I feel like I already have 1 foot out the door. I've done a lot of research. If you can go back to school than id suggest healthcare. There is a shortage of healthcare workers. Government work isnt lurcrative but its stable, has great benefits, generous time off and a pension. Sales is lucrative, don't need a degree, but kind of crazy. Theres also a shortage in trades, you get paid to train thing is it can be pretty hard on the body but it's definitely not a job that AI can replace anytime soon.
I work in the ad space and it's bad for us too. 

My only advice I have is, if your looking for extra income and you have a college degree it can be anything get into sub teaching. Here in Arizona there so much demand for them that you can pick one district and pretty much work full time or pick what days you want to work the night before
I just started working at an agency and we've booked like hell for the next 6 months. I gave up freelancing for a while, having a salary is a blast.
Basically same as gwmckeon, been editing in social media advertising while waiting for TV and film to open back up but they seem very dead end right now. Nobody I know has work aside from like one AE fresh out of school and a Disney plant who’s PAing for Lucasfilms. Strongly considering using my marketing and advertising experience to get an MBA in marketing and doing that
Lot of my editor friends went to the "dark side" and started producing and directing. With your editing skills, it immediately pays off by showing clients you know what you're doing. A wise person said "content is king".
Government. Work is steady, boring, but steady.
Sorry man. Strike hit everyone hard as shit….its gonna bounce back. 🤙🏼 Stuff is trickling in. 🙏🏼
Got two months left before I move back in with family and pursue a career change.
I've been unemployed since January of last year, feeling super hopeless especially since my unemployment funds have run out/can't reapply until May & there are murmurs of more strikes with Editors guild and IATSE... like, damn, will this hell ever end? What a horrible time to be an editor. 

I've turned to teaching myself how to code in Swift & Xcode, since I have some ideas for apps and games I want to make. It's a steep learning curve, and sometimes it feels like I'm trying to teach myself how to read and write in Chinese, but I'm not giving it up - it may be a long time till work ever comes back again, so may as well use the time to learn something new.

I really really really want to avoid having to work retail, but if things get more desperate, I'll work at the local grocery store as a bagging person :( I'm so mad at our industry....
I had to drain a 401k account to pay bills. I finally landed an editor position at a game company but that was thanks to knowing people who worked there. If they didn't hook me up I'd be a data analyst now.
I’m right there with you, brother. Been in the game for 15 years and this last year and a half has decimated me and my bank account… But being so skilled in one section of life and having to start fresh in a new one feels so frustrating… It’s a tough pill to swallow.
What scares the shit out of me are the "other industries" id be qualified to work in..... like advertising. Shudders!
Editorial will be the last thing to come back. 2024 will be lean and I’m sure 2025 will be busy again if you’re in features/tv. 

I can’t imagine that reality won’t pickup super quickly.
I feel you, I’m in the same boat. I reluctantly started a new career path about 7 months ago and I’m still mentally struggling with making less money and my identity. I still am picking up small gigs on the side but I’m having a hard time with life right now.
I feel your pain. I haven’t worked since last September and just finally booked something for April and another project for June. Maybe don’t give up just yet cause it feels like the work is coming back. You gotta really push those contacts (without being too annoying) to get something.
30 year editor here and my time has run out too. Laid off due to AI last July. Hardly anything available apart from social media nonsense. So I’m going into the finance sector. It sucks but I gotta do what I gotta do. Good luck to everyone else who is changing industries too.
Dang social media, the internet, streaming, and hollywood really have killed every creative industry in visual media..
I've not worked in TV for a year, so now I'm working various corporate and internet gigs. Nothing union, unfortunately, but I'm working and thankful for it. I apparently did a great job of having a diverse group of industry friends, so when film and TV went down, some of them are still working and hiring. Just referred another TV friend to one of my clients and they'll be starting with them soon.   


I've gone down some very dark paths this last year, and very much have been exploring putting more energy into working outside the industry...but it's not dead yet. It might be easy for me to say, since I live alone, but keep your chin up and just do what you can to expand your network. If you are strict about your comfort zone and can't wait until this summer (when things SHOULD pick up), maybe it is time to move on.

&#x200B;

Just don't go into real estate.
Aviation needs maintenance mechanics, I did a campaign for one.
Commercial/ad work not doing too hot either. Slow last year, even slower this year. I'm salaried, but I think we might run out of runway soon.
I’m out. Already got a software certification & working on 2 other certs I’m studying for now. After 12 years, I’m going back into construction.  I was an adjunct professor to help close the gap because I just never made much money as a post guy, & I shot too. Selling all my gear and saying good bye. Too bad, I really enjoyed the work when it was happening.
Edit commercials instead then? Or music videos? Or films?
Good luck homie.
Well what else do you do? And what are your other skills you’ve forgotten about? What could you do for another 20 years? How is your wrist? lol. For me I do video, photo, editing, graphic design, and some website maintenance. It has been great to know these things. I also sell my art on the side. A jack of all. Only a master of the ones I really enjoy. Perhaps you can take a freelance route and start doing various things you are skilled at for income.
As someone who graduated film school last year and just started editing professionally, this sub is literally one of the most depressing things I've ever seen
I moved from LA to a small town on the East Coast. Got a job at a local tv station doing photography and editing. Doesn't pay much - but I feel like I'm at least going somewhere with this and the benefits are great. Plus  - it's also cheaper. A LOT cheaper.
I had to pivot hard, thankfully found a preditor job off indeed that’s about 150 miles out of town but it’s full time and the pay and benefits are pretty decent. Good luck to you OP I hope it turns around for you and your family very soon, like latest tonight!
I'm still working (docuementaries), just wrapped a show and started another. I know it is really hard out there for folks so consider myself hella fortunate. If I were to leave i would work in a kitchen.
100% right with you. Fucking brutal.
Get in touch with the SBA and ask for a small bridge loan to get you through to the next better thing. As an independent contractor, you are a business.
I’m giving instacart a try.
Don't do data science, it's full of similar idiots trying to find jobs but they have more work experience in more relevant roles and industries.
The one corner of the industry that seems to have a ton of jobs right now is tv news
Hey, thanks a lot. 

I sometimes come here to post advice to new editors because I don’t want them to make the same mistakes that i made. Many of us didn’t have mentors or *any* pathways to follow. The road to advancing had many gate keepers, and it was pretty expensive to be an editor once upon a time. Those factors created exclusivity. A lot has changed. 

There’s certainly a future for the art of video editing. It’s just that the way these stories are told will be very different. Sometimes, when i think about my time in Los Angeles between 2000-2020, I’m dumbstruck by the speed of technological growth.  The floodgate opened with more distribution outlets,  cheaper access to more powerful tools, and the once voracious appetite of digital platforms to fill space with anything for people to consume becoming standard.

 It’s arguable that as movies and TV have moved from away from art, and into the realm of product and commodity, where we’ve landed with AI and industry constriction was an inevitability.  

I’m not saying this as some sort of foo-foo indictment of commerce over artistry. Just a statement of fact. I think the tools are amazing. I only wished that the infrastructure supporting this industry that makes the wonderful things we watch had a pipeline that trickled down.  That didn’t feel like a scam or house of cards at every new production. 

I’m only sad that I never had a ‘career’.  I came into this industry in ignorance, and that’s my own fault. I’ve been reaching back and having 1 on 1 conversations with as many recent transplants as I can.  My old undergrad, isn’t equipping these kids with the right tools to thrive.  Skill certainly matters in this town, but social matters a whole lot more. 

I was a nerd that kept my nose clean, stayed out of trouble, stayed ambitious, treated people kindly, payed it forward as often as I could, and really REALLY loved storytelling. The world changed and, unfortunately, i didn’t change rapidly enough with it. That’s on me. 

My job is to make sure that isn’t on the NEXT person.
If any of you guys see this: do you worry at all about AI eventually taking up jobs in the industry?
I’m trying to build up skills in editing and vfx but it seems like a valid concern. 
I’d be very interested to hear others’ thoughts on how the industry is going too
it been almost 3 years working in the production and media content industry, any fatherly advice for youngsters? lol
I’ve looked into court reporting. It’s quite fascinating, pays well and there’s major shortage in that industry. Training takes less than a year, but you do have to increase your words per minute, which is a skill that takes time to develop. Although I do wonder how long will it take till AI takes over that as well :/
Lean into CGI. I did and I’m SWAMPED.
I feel the pain in this post, OP. Plenty of creators - big creators - looking for editors. Unfortunately, there's no good way to connect with them. But if you're repped, maybe some intros are possible.

I'm always looking for editors to supplement my in-house team. I usually find them through referrals, but I've hired based on nothing but a good reel and a kind email. 

There is more editing work now than ever before - just not in Hollywood. Hollywood was on life support, then covid pulled the plug. The entertainment economy is now online. Good luck and hang in there. I've been there.
I've started day trading in between gigs.

You sit in front of giant monitors looking at timelines and clicking your mouse a lot.

Your day ends at 4pm eastern and if a good gig comes along, you can just stop and pick it up again when you're ready. I was surprised how editing and motion graphics skills like visual acuity and having a feel for timing and flow are relevant to the type of trading I prefer. 

But pretty please don't do this if you're in any way risk averse. And if money is tight, learn with paper trades or tiny disposable amounts of money until you get a feel and an understanding of how easy it is to blow up your account. Then start doing the things that don't blow it up.
sorry to hear that.  

I had a camera op friend who had a couple years of minimal camera work, he took up a side gig with an electrical company, going out and taking meter readings. 

Since then the work has picked back up and he no longer needs those side gigs.  

You could always go into something else but keep your lines open.  Honestly one of those delivery apps could do the trick for a bit and you could work and stop work as you please
I got up and left the city I was working in. Trying to become an electrician.
Amazon warehouses are always hiring. It’s physical labor, but I did it during the pandemic.
I haven't made it to scripted other than a couple shorts. Unscripted stories allowed me to survive for many years. Never thrived. Treading water too long.

Been using AI lately. Recoded and modernized my site. Don't know why. The resume does look more like a resume now with the assistance of AI in order to expand my career possibilities. Not saying AI is any sort of issue here other than helpful.

Certainly not going to ask it "how can you employ me as an advocate for you so I'm not subjugated when the rise of the AI machines happens?"
I'm actually prepping to stick my toe back in.  This is not the news I wanted to here. But since of my work will be for myself, I'll just have to deal.
I think I'll become an electrician. It was pretty fun doing my own solar installation (cos I'm poor now)
You’d do well to participate in this discussion tomorrow about diversifying your income sources, held by Blue Collar Post Collective: [https://facebook.com/events/s/diversifying-income-for-post-p/1464606194448453/?mibextid=RQdjqZ](https://facebook.com/events/s/diversifying-income-for-post-p/1464606194448453/?mibextid=RQdjqZ)
Sorry man. Why did they stop hiring you?
It might be worth considering moving out of LA to a lower cost-of-living city where your caliber of skills is less common/less competition.

We made the move about 2 years ago and honestly, this is the happiest we have ever been.
My friend did that about 6 months ago.
I will say that the infosec field is extremely saturated right now. And there’s not really any entry level infosec jobs, especially without a degree. Not saying it’s impossible, but something to consider.
Where.could one find these certification courses?
Im going to that but this isnt a situation where we need "diverse income" and side hustles, we need our careers back or completely new ones. Plus ive seen one of the three people running that yell at out of work editors to "GET A JOB!" when they talk about how hard this is on them so im not expecting much.
The future of coding doesn’t look that good either
Amazing resource. Thank you . 

I am recently laid off from a corporation and am struggling to navigate the freelance route even at a project basis. This might ease my mind if things aren’t looking up.
Thanks for this. I follow BCP, and had missed this
Did anyone tune in to this? Ngl it's bumming me the fuck out lol
Yeah, it really really sucks right now.  I want to be optimistic, but the strikes really seem to destroy the industry.
Here's the [actual link to anyone interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRaXvAhDqc4).
It's sad but life is random and cruel. This moment right now feels like a fleet of manufacturing jobs leaving the rust belt, or like a once stable country breaking out into civil war and we're just the refugees. Absolutely awful situation to be in but we gotta adapt to survive.
Same.
Yup, I feel exactly the same.  My wife is awesome, but she knows how worried I am.
This is great advice. I'm turning 50 this year so I've got a harder road, but if you're young and able to transition in the fields you mentioned, that's smart. There's definitely ageism in post production. But yes, everything you said about trades and the industry to invest in that AI cannot replace? 100%.
wow so im fron the IT world.  Just came on this subreddit to see how people were perceiving the new Sora AI news. and im shocked to see this industry is suffering as well.  If you were to go into the IT related subreddits you will see that everyone there is struggling as well.  about 400,000 layoffs in IT since 2022.  And everyone is talking about the trades too.    


Theres going to be an influx of people migrating to nursing, healthcare & the trades.  Alot of people in the IT subreddits are saying they're doing the same.  


These are crazy times.
When I found out what dental hygienists in Los Angeles make per hour I bookmarked it as a possible alternate career if I ever needed to pivot. It's a shorter day than a typical editorial day, plus there's some amount of science knowledge to keep things interesting, and if you're a people person that'd be a plus.

Maybe one day they'll be replaced with AI piloting precision SCARA robots sporting automated tools to do the work and a Furby strapped to the side to provide emotional connection, but that's probably a ways off.
I just got a government job (videographer for a department coms team) after getting laid off from the marketing agency I was working at last year. Is it flashy or going to be stuff I put on a portfolio reel? No. Do I now make more money, eligible for overtime, part of a union, have insane health insurance ($250 deductable for $50 a pay), 14% pension match to my 10%, and this thing called "work life balance"? Yes. Also, the work I'm doing in the department is really meaningful and very mission focused (we focus on developmental disabilties) and it WAY more fulfilling than sizzle reels about sponsorship bullshit.

I don't regret my last 10 years of working at production houses (and to a lesser degree the agency I spent the last two years with), but after the mental anguish of working in agency life and getting into my 30's wanting some more stability, I'm extremely thankful for the opportunity I have now. AND, with my network I've built, I've opened myself up to freelancing occasionally for projects as a added bonus.
I bet the speed at which robots can do most everything is going to be mind blowing.

Once we've got agi then the companies doing innovation are probably going to switch to robotics as that'll be the last frontier.
How does one find a job at an agency?
What agency?
I've only ever done either freelance or in house agency and we are loaded with work. I think a lot of the OG editors will look down on this type of work but the hours are great and I actually have a life outside of the office.
hear, hear. recently I've felt grateful having my teeth kicked in from the 2007 WGA strike followed by the recession. Been doing Government for 4+ years now. Decent pay, good security, and everyone thinks I'm a wizard.
I feel like Government work would be a good base and you can prob side hustle some low impact editing gigs.
What do you do?
until there is a shutdown that happens every now and then. one lasted 3 months a few years ago and all the military families were at the food pantries.
Yeah but every gig I see get posted is absolutely slammed with hundreds of applicants.
If I get laid off I'm probably going to the post office. At least they get a pension.
May I ask what your go to for learning swift is besides YouTube-U?
I wanna learn swift so bad but when I try I can’t help but think it’s more convoluted and complicated than it has to be
Oh awesome.
I work in advertising now. 4 day work weeks and an 80k salary plus benefits. The irony is that now I actually have time to be creative.

What are you doing now?
Man, that fucking sucks. I’m sorry. If you don’t mind me asking, what was the exact way AI put you out? Are they doing like, fully AI editing now? Or are they cutting assistant work?
im surprised to hear a video editor getting laid off due to AI.  Would you be okay telling me what happened?  I thought my industry was one of the few that got affected.  Didnt think AI was screwing videographers and editors like this wow.
What are you going to do in finance?
How exactly are you pivoting to finance? Are you going back to school to learn new skills or…?
lol why not real estate?
How did you find your corporate gigs? Want to look for that, but don't know where to start
Trust me, I'm open to them.  Would love to. The opportunities are just not out there right now.
Thanks dude.
Its the most depressing year in most of our careers
I hate negativity generally.  I know there's always times when the industry is slow.  But this last year has been absolutely devastating in terms of work.  Everyone I know is feeling it.
So, do you commute 300 miles a day? Or hybrid?
I see a lot of hiring jobs at NewsMax but I don't think my soul could handle it.
> people kindly, *paid* it forward

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*
IMO, new technologies have emerged throughout history and the same concerns and conversations about it “taking our jobs” arise. It will make a lot of career paths obsolete, but it also creates new career paths while others evolve. AI isn’t fully automated, best analogy I can think of is how automation on a factory floor still needs humans to operate and oversee production. 

The genie is out of the bottle and the best one can do is adapt and embrace those technologies. Learning how to use AI in your craft and keeping up with it as it progresses is paramount to stay current in the market. I use it for almost everything in the edit room, from generating AI VO or sound bites for a sizzle, to script cutting long interviews. Something that used to take a full day can now be done in a matter of minutes. What the future will look like is uncertain, so my approach is to continue to learn how to integrate those tools to my workflow and take it from there with my fingers crossed.
I think AI is going to take over a LOT of industries, from photography, video game making, newspaper writing...hell there are self driving cars on the road now.  Imagine in 10 years from now when the driving technology is perfected...everyone who drives a car, from uber driver to truck driver will be out of a job.
I wish I had a solution.  But everything is just so dark right now.  Someone else posted that this year there's 30% of the production work there was last year.

I've been trying to be patient, but I've barely worked this last year and neither have most of my friends in the industry.

I know it WILL come back...people will want to watch shit.  But when and how is a mystery to us all. This is the worst I've ever seen it in my entire career.
And this is the dilemma, you either pick a whole new career with a year of training that might go away soon anyway or you do nothing and just go broke because other jobs dont want people who will leave if the industry comes back.
How so?
How did you learn CGI?
Thanks man! Yeah I'm in NYC right now and we're feeling the crunch hard.  And yeah I'm repped but my agent hasn't really gotten me much lately.  I've gotten a few interviews and referrals this week so hopefully things are turning around.

Are you cool if I DM you my website?
> I've started day trading in between gigs.

haha you're gonna lose so much money. have fun dude
Neat.
Hes been working 20 years.....this isnt a just get a side hustle solution.
I actually just checked after reading this and they are not currently hiring in Los Angeles. The closest job is delivery station customer service in Torrance.
Good luck. It's absolutely brutal out there.
Oh the irony. I quit that god awful career path to become an editor.
Yeah I already replied to that. But I’m no super hopeful.
[deleted]
The industry kind of imploded last year with the strike.  It still hasn't recovered yet.
I don't live in LA (NYC) but I see your point.

My wife and I own a place and she has a full time job in advertising (how we met) so we're not looking to move.
What new career did they choose and how is it working out for them?
I've checked out [https://coursecareers.com](https://coursecareers.com) before and it seems legit.  I haven't decided if I want to pursue one yet though
If you don’t have a [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/landing/cissp-2024?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GBL-exam-peace-of-mind-protection-promo&utm_term=search&utm_content=GBL-exam-peace-of-mind-protection-promo&msclkid=7a5be32486341e40eefd86c403005436), your prospects are very slim.
I dont get it, why do the people who speak for the board seem to hate the membership so much?
It doesn’t. I’m in IT now after leaving editing last year and while it’s providing stability and money I’m fully expecting this not to last either. My only hope is that those skills can somehow shift into something that will be relevant then (if anything).
The future period doesn’t look good. AI is gonna take over everything.
The coding gold rush is over- way too crowded now. You got indians on fiverr doing it for pennies. Everybody piled in because they saw google engineers making 800k/year. If you learned to code in 2013 though you'd be a multimillionare now
I have to assume they planned this before the strikes because they forgot to touch upon ways we could actually do anything now. "Live with a relative for free" "invest in the stock market" and "turn your second home into an airbnb" werent really relevant and helpful right now for most people. The fact someone had to actually ask them to discuss ways to make money and they REFUSED because there was a thread from last week made me think they didnt even know the topic of the  stream.

Their main advice seemed to be "find something you love and make money off it" which is great but thats what editing is for me.
I found it to be pretty useless.  A lot of their advice is really outdated.
"Live with a relative for free.  Sublet your apartment and live out of your car."

This is fucking insanity.
Not to be pedantic but the strikes are in reaction to the industry being ruined, they're not the source of the ruin.
I would look at the consolidation rather than strikes as the reason for lack of new production.
>  I want to be optimistic, but the strikes really seem to destroy the industry.

IATSE is next, just to kick you when youre down lol

I know a few cinematographers that are taking a break from the industry and will come back when all the dust settles. It's bleak out there right now.
Nobody should bother, its a giant waste of time that never deals with the issue at hand.
If you're willing to get your hands dirty some trades will prob take you.
Is there really ageism in post?  The way I see it most creative leads or senior producer/ director roles are held by veterans with experience
Curious how you landed that gig.  Can I PM you?
They'll never take away government jobs. Inefficiency is too baked into it.
Bit of a fun story, I was homeless, traveling and trying to survive by writing poems in the streets. I just applied to the job on Indeed. I still have no idea what I'm doing but I kinda know how to edit films.. We mainly do commercials for luxury arty brands.
Most near me poach, never advertise the actual job
French video production agency, we're 10 in total, 2 editors. We do mainly commercials for luxury brands. I can't say I'm all in for it but since it's luxury, the films/videos are very high quality.
Nobody is looking down on anything right now, they just cant find anything that will hire them.
What do you do?
The meaning of being a big fish in a small pond 😆
Edit and produce for a local government
Local government. We don’t have the problems federal government has with asshats who don’t do their jobs to ensure their employees get paid, ie Congress. 

However, I wouldn’t mind a sweet CSPAN gig
Mate, Ive been an editor for 30 years in LA and only gotten like maybe 5 actuals jobs from posts that want to pay a good rate. Tons for minimal/no pay, or “backend”😑 I will sometimes take the ones that are lower if I have the bandwidth or dig the project for a multitude of reasons. 

The real way is true networking, and I don’t mean forums/FB groups, etc. Im not sure where you live, but you gotta find out where the decisions makers hang. You get like 5 people, you can always pivot around. If they trust you, then you’re on their list. Shits always being made, especially in the feature world. 🤙🏼. 

BUT, AND I MEAN A BIG FUCKING BUT….the last strike was insane, that backlogged so many projects. This itself caused post to push back months, fuck some years. I have close friends on huge shows/films who were twiddling their thumbs….fuck, I had three films pushed till I don’t know when….  

Things are/will hopefully right itself. As I said they are trickling in.
Sorry to possibly disappoint, but I have mostly been learning from YouTube - Swiftful Thinking has been the easiest way to comprehend things and following along Nick's directions in Xcode [https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftfulThinking)

And using the Apple App Playgrounds has been helpful in learning the basics. There are a bunch of different level courses, some of them can be enjoyable like playing a game. Good luck!
Can I ask how the transition was? Did you just "move in with an existing client" or did you have to apply cold?
Where do you work?
What is your role? Are you still an editor/motion designer? How did your skills translate?
Most of the editors working now were booked pre strike. I wouldn’t expect new projects to be staffed for a bit. This is what all my friends in tv/film have experienced. Don’t know any reality people. 

Nothing I’m on has really picked up anyone new since strike.
It sucks and it’s bleak now but ya it’s going to return.
If you had contacts and regular work before you will again.
Personal training. I actually really love it but I'm not making enough money to pay my bills yet and will probably never make as much as I could in the film industry. It's actually a much more meaningful profession for me and you can make over $100k/yr once you have built your client base but I'm struggling with accepting where I am in life at the moment.
Fully AI editing does not exist except for the most menial tasks (deleting air between dialogue for example)
Honestly I think they were looking for excuses to get someone they could pay less. The official word was they eliminated my position due to AI, but the reality was they hired someone for a lot less money and invested the rest in AI.
Take some calls, take some tests and see where it takes me. Lol. I should pass my tests in anywhere from 7 weeks to 6 months. Then I can see what I like to do and try to get transferred up the ladder.
Starting in customer service so they will pay for my training, studying and tests. I’ve also spent the last 7 years editing thought leadership videos in the financial services vertical so I’ve learned a little along the way. After a couple years when I’m accredited I should be back to making the same as my editing gig. 

Thinking about it today wondering if it was worth it. I’ve dealt with some nasty, nasty people in my time. I don’t need that shit any more.
the current interest rate environment means nobody wants to sell (because they locked in a 3% mortgage) and nobody wants to buy because they're either waiting for rates to come down (sep 24 at earliest) or there's just not enough inventory. prices are also extremely high making housing largely unaffordable without a six figure salary/dual income. 
its a feedback loop causing gridlock in the industry.

on top of that, being a landlord isnt that profitable anymore because insurance costs, home services/maintenance labor costs, and property taxes have skyrocketed in recent years as everybody wants a piece of the pie

commercial RE is basically destroyed by WFH. retail and medical is strong but also subject to the above, and the barrier to entry on investment for that is insanely high. 

whats remaining is developing raw land, which is very hard now because city govs are NIMBY and actively discourage new building to keep the supply low and prices high (they're all landlords shhhh)
I started out with a combination of corporate gigs and television.  I would say what helped me get corporate gigs was the ability to create motion graphics as well.  So you can search for people/corps looking for motion graphics and video editing gigs, also shooting.
I hate to say this, but 99% of my jobs I've ever gotten was by word of mouth. My work certainly speaks for itself, but I would not have gotten in the door if I had not known someone on the inside to refer me. The industry is saturated with people trying to break in and it's extremely difficult to weed through those with ability and those trying to learn it. Especially with youtube: there are thousands of people who downloaded the free version of Resolve and think they can edit a story.   


I've been on the hiring side; if I know someone, they are 99.9% more likely to be hired. Go meet people doing what you want to do.
You're not rong.
Yeah I would’ve bought a self driving car if they were reliable and could afford one lol but sadly I just moved for now.
You'd be a literal traitor to democracy.
Hi, i'm still working through an AV production degree and after stumbling across this board and specifically this thread i'm starting to question some of my life choices.  >\_>  

Thats not the reason for this specific response though, I was just curious, what kind of AI tools are you currently learning which help you work that efficiently?  Reducing "a full day to minutes"...  I don't even know what things are out there (specific to video editing I mean, as opposed to those text to image generators and such) but I figure i'd better learn quickly what i'm NOT being taught in my college courses.  Either I will have to self-learn to use it myself, or know what i'm competing against that is a risk to my future job.
I self taught myself over the years; but really dived deep over the pandemic. I went from DP/Director at my work, to then mostly editing, and now just CGI. Most editors on our team have a little bit experience in CGI. I would start with Blender or Unreal to start.  But yea....I always thought it looked so cool, so made it a mission to start getting into it a long time ago. There's so much control and neat things you can do, it's really addicting; once it starts to flow and feel comfortable in understanding how it works.
What do you suggest? I think during the down times it’s reasonable.  Or collect unemployment or something 🤷‍♂️
Omg for real?! That is bad.
does seem tough.. u ever get electrocuted?
Indeed, a vacuous brainstorm session with people who didn’t even have any groundbreaking ideas.
They left La and moved back to Denver. Last I checked he was working in photography.
I’ve bought course careers and it’s good. I never got through all of it cause I got hired a week after I bought it.
Coding or Cyber security was also my plan b, but they seem as bad as video editing now even young people with experience. Idk what is going on here. It’s like only media, marketing tech and video games are getting directly targeted. I find it interesting that the sectors who were fighting for unions, more remote work, and etc are the ones getting killed the most.
No clue. Im guessing its because they know that things have only gotten worse for years and years now and since they cant actually help the membership they might as well try to demand they shut up and get in line. But thats not working either because people can see that theyre just being mean and downright abusive to members in need while they gaslight them and tell them things arent that bad. 

They had to browbeaten into telling us the survey results and even then they barely told us anything at all. Even the CAT leaders dont know whats going on with the negotiations that start in a few days, they wont even tell us who is on the local committee yet! They tried to set up a financial aid system but its not anonymous so you have to personally beg a board member for money and justify your needs to them and then it turns out nobody is in a position to help you anyway.

If its not obvious im ready for the entire board to be replaced. Alan and Cathy included.
What about IT security? Seems like that would have a prosperous future.
AI will supplement everything. You still need human operators. People are fear-mongering AI way too much.
sublet your room and couchsurf! i have a fuckin newborn man lol

but the takeaway for me was "get what you can and also pivot," which is what i figured. perfect time to figure out how to begin some new career tracks 💀
The strikes shut down everything for 7 months.  That's not nothing.

I'm glad they got what they want, but it also greatly hurt the industry in a lot of ways.
I don't entirely disagree...
I'm all ears. I just filled out a Costco application this morning. The Industry's ups and downs have taken it's toll.  I was telling my wife that I've been an 'editor' for 15+ years. My only daughter is 9 (I'm 49), and I waited as long as we could for my career to kick in before we finally had children. It never did, and we stopped waiting. We finally moved out of Los Angeles to Vegas during pandemic, and while her business career is as solid as one can hope,  mine (and most editors I know) are DOA. The wives are literally the primary incomes now. 

So yeah, I'm definitely open to different options. But like I mentioned, at 50, I'm just hoping for something that isn't so physically grueling that  I won't be able to enjoy my daughter's 15th birthday in 6 years!   


Editing is wild. It's the only industry where you can make 300-800 dollars a day for a month, then nothing for a whole year. My last solid gig was 2016.  Insane.
Def. My experience is in commercial and scripted, the young fresh voices will def look on old folks as stuck in their ways etc. I've come across showrunners who actually look at industry experience as a negative. It's both crazy and refreshing in my opinion, ha. I'm mid-40s and haven't experienced it (that I'm aware of), but have watched it happen.
Haha... it's the literal definition of bureaucracy
inefficiency is part of the culture.
That’s an insane story and I’m very glad to hear you’ve got your feet under you. I see the company is French, are you in Paris? I’m just curious because you don’t hear that kind of story every day.
homeless guy writing poems on the street to survive, applies to agency job on indeed and gets it. would you be willing to provide the cheat codes brother? haha
I always wondered what happened to the dude from Before Sunrise who sold the poem to Jesse and Celine.
This can’t be true. I’ve been working in the ad space for almost a decade with some of the largest agencies in the world. Ever since Covid I lost most of my clients and apply to all sorts of jobs with a ton of the smaller boutique agencies and get ghosted every time. Jobs even so entry level that 5 years ago I would never consider.
T'es dans quel secteur/boîte ? T'es en CDI plutôt qu'intermittent j'imagine ?
for every 1 person that has a story like this 1000 of them overdose and die in the streets. you're insanely lucky.
I can only speak for the UK but there's a crazy amount of jobs right now. The only thing I see being a negative are editors who cut long form are unable to work with this new wave of fast paced social content or they are expecting a higher salary.
Oh that's kinda cool.  How'd you get into that?
[deleted]
Yeah the backlog is real right now, Especially in production. Lots of reshoots for shows that had to hiatus haven't even shot yet. Still waiting on scheduling conflicts with talent and locations to clear. New principal is in the same boat. Network tv seems to be farther along however I mainly deal in features
I really, really, really, really hope so. I got plenty of contacts but everyone I speak to is in the same boat right now.

Everyone's saying that it's gonna come back something fierce in the spring...I'm just counting down the days.
On staff at a small studio in Atlanta.
>The real way is true networking, and I don’t mean forums/FB groups, etc. Im not sure where you live, but you gotta find out where the decisions makers hang. You get like 5 people, you can always pivot around. If they trust you, then you’re on their list. Shits always being made, especially in the feature world. 🤙🏼.

Features are slowly picking up. Most of the ones I hear about are aiming to shoot abroad in case Iaste strikes...they could keep going.
Yeah that’s why I was asking for details
Yeah i think thats going to be the norm.    


Get some passionate people that are at the bottom of the pole.  Pay them less and let the AI help boost those people to new heights.  AI can answer so many questions.  It gives the average person super powers.  But when everyone becomes super, suddenly, no one isnt.
I got a social media job during covid over everyone else with degrees and who was way more qualified than me and I have no experience in social media, the trick was I told the owner of the company  I will work and he can pay me whatever he wants as money is of no value to me.
To add, the only reason the bottom hasn't fallen out yet is simply institutional investing, followed by lobbying for gen z to "just keep renting! It's great not to own things!" Thus locking in the subscription economy for everything and effectively ensuring an entire generation lives in financial servitude in perpetuity. Laws need to be written to severely limit institutional ownership of single family homes and it needs to happen now.    


A few state govs have bills on ballots to start doing this...hence, don't go into real estate. Bubble go boom.
I will be goddamned before I learn motion graphics. I respect those that do it, but I refuse to do the job of two people. More power to you, and you're absolutely right, I have turned down loads of commercial/corporate jobs because they asked me about AE. Nope, won't do it.
Yeah... That's where I'm at - I'm in TV which has been mostly good for 15+ years, but this downturn is brutal and I'm looking to diversify by getting in some corporate work
I know buddy.  I know.
I’d encourage you to explore Premiere’s “new” tools, they have features like transcript editing, auto audio editing, etc.

I’m utilizing a beta software that is not yet available to the public that expands on the text editing software, using a ChatGPT-esquece text box to make avid/premiere pull specific selects in interviews based on a topic you feed it. E.g: you can ask it to pull every bite that mentions family, it’ll create a sequence and organize all of the bites in minutes. That’s something that should be available to the public soon, so keep an eye out for it (I’m unsure if I can disclose the name atm).

All AI tools are still very new and quickly evolving. It’ll take some proactivity to keep up to speed with new releases, following AI news, and or even following creators who often showcase AI tools, like Premiere Gal.

It’ll take time for our career to become obsolete, if it ever happens. I believe something like editing will still need a human supervising the process if it ever comes to that, and those who stand out will be the ones who are well versed in those tools vs those who are resistant to it. Of course it’s something difficult to predict, and sadly we’re not alone in experiencing industry wide changes.
You really made this shift? I always wanted to try CGI, but I thought it’s way too saturated and outsourced a lot. I have a descent rig for it as well. A 3090 with a 5950x. How do you get started once you learn it, put together a demo yourself?
I have a friend who posted screenshots of all the apps like doordash being full.
[deleted]
I'm quite confused what you are talking about.  What negotiations? 
 What is a "CAT"?

curious to know.
Cathy blew it in 21. She needs to go. 
It’s good if you can get in. But infosec is extremely oversaturated. And it’s also not an entry level job/position. No one is gonna hire you without previous IT experience of some sort. (Unless you get lucky)
Anything you find online about need in infosec is old. The field is saturated with people who have Sec+ and want a job. Entry level infosec needs 4+ years in IT.
As one who lost his job to a lower paid editor so the company can invest in AI, it’s reality to me-no fear-mongering here. Here’s hoping you aren’t making too much $$ in the eyes of your employer. Reality is a bitch. Companies will pare the upper levels and the lower levels and all the rest of you lucky slugs will be working twice as hard with less help. Good luck!
Sure but you’ll need 1-2 human operators plus AI to do the same job it used to take 50 humans to do. 

That’s the problem.
> sublet your room and couchsurf! i have a fuckin newborn man lol

My lease agreement also forbids it.

> perfect time to figure out how to begin some new career tracks 💀

Thats what this was supposed to be about, not learning how these two people started their careers and what cities they moved to. What a waste of nearly 2 hours.
Referring to new unscripted production. Should have been clearer.
That’s really sad to read. You have my full support and best wishes. What a wild industry we’re in.
Maybe check out data annotation as extra side gig. Work own hours whenever you want.  Not a guarantee but a nice side one if it happens
I also got a nice job in social media for a computer store, the trick was to say salary is of no  concern and you will work for free and let them pay you how much they want
It was the only job available after the recession
They won’t LET me shoot video 🤣. I’ve asked! I’m kind of particular when it comes to my video in a reel (as we all should be) and sometimes I think I have a better eye than my other 2 shooters but, oh well.
We’re all waiting to see what happens with the IATSE. Hoping negotiations are all good. I think it will be insane in about a month if they don’t strike. 🙏🏼
Oh nice.
Think you need to post in the country to get the incentives though.
Sorry, I’m having a hard time keeping up with the conversation. You know- gen x-er here. Lol. Official word was they eliminated my position due to AI but the reality is they hired someone who makes way less and are investing the rest in AI.
>  Laws need to be written to severely limit institutional ownership of single family homes and it needs to happen now. 

never happening lol. blackrock et al. are some of the largest donors to both sides

at this point, your only practical entry into home ownership is either inheriting it from your boomer parents who bought a house for $20 in 1997 or by getting a job at a MAG7 company
Where are you located? (if you don't mind me asking)
Omg I feel so bad I never replied. I took a break from Reddit. I really did make the shift. It’s NOT over saturated and there’s so much work it’s insane.

It’s most definitely not easy to learn, but I would start at some point just to start grasping it. I see more and more people want CGI as it’s cheaper than shoots and you can change about anything. 

Fortunately I work full time for a very large tech company who allowed me to just move around so I didn’t have to really pitch anything. But demo reals help. I would try to get work at an agency not independent as a lot of work people want will be too large for one system and one person to support.
That’s wild.
Im in the IT world.  Web Development, scripting and automation.  ChatGPT 4 can generate snippets of code well and it does a great job of getting alot of things done in my line of work.  I just finished reading the Sora AI website and i feel bad cause alot of small videographic gigs might go down.  


I've known some digital artists whose gigs dried up because MidJourney was capable of generating art similar to theres.  Just now i was able to generate my own wallpapers.  All i had to do was prompt and Midjourney was able to create all kinds of wallpapers for my Desktop.  

Im not saying AI is going to replace everybody but i feel like alot of jobs that are in the "lower part" of the totem pole might get cut.  Small gigs.  Such as myself.  I use to specialize in creating these small pieces of codes that would make a good impact at companies but now ChatGPT can generate those codes fairly fast and efficiently .     


Im surprised and shocked to see that AI making an impact in so many industries.  And when AI becomes AGI, i seriously dont know what would come of the world.  This all feels super surreal to me.
People want real photographs not AI slop
Let me know when Ai can show up at events to capture things in real time.
IATSE is entering into negotiations with the studios in about a week just like the DGA, WGA, and SAG did so there is potentially another big strike coming this summer. CAT are "Contract Action Teams" that are supposed to be the people in between the board and the membership keeping everyone informed about the plans for the negotiations but the board in their infinite wisdom has forgotten that would involve telling the CAT team members anything at all.
I know Cathy is beloved but when youre in charge while things get worse for almost a decade straight maybe theres a problem.
Idk what infosec is
Hey, thanks a lot. I sometimes come here to post advice to new editors because I don’t want them to make the same mistakes that i made. Many of us didn’t have mentors or *any* pathways to follow. The road to advancing had many gate keepers, and it was pretty expensive to be an editor once upon a time. Those factors created exclusivity. A lot has changed. 

There’s certainly a future for the art of video editing. It’s just that the way these stories are told will be very different. Sometimes, when i think about my time in Los Angeles between 2000-2020, I’m dumbstruck by the speed of technological growth.  The floodgate opened with more distribution outlets,  cheaper access to more powerful tools, and the once voracious appetite of digital platforms to fill space with anything for people to consume becoming standard.

 It’s arguable that as movies and TV have moved from away from art, and into the realm of product and commodity, where we’ve landed with AI and industry constriction was an inevitability.  

I’m not saying this as some sort of foo-foo indictment of commerce over artistry. Just a statement of fact. I think the tools are amazing. I only wished that the infrastructure supporting this industry that makes the wonderful things we watch had a pipeline that trickled down.  That didn’t feel like a scam or house of cards at every new production. 

I’m only sad that I never had a ‘career’.  I came into this industry in ignorance, and that’s my own fault. I’ve been reaching back and having 1 on 1 conversations with as many recent transplants as I can.  My old undergrad, isn’t equipping these kids with the right tools to thrive.  Skill certainly matters in this town, but social matters a whole lot more. 

I was a nerd that kept my nose clean, stayed out of trouble, stayed ambitious, treated people kindly, payed it forward as often as I could, and really REALLY loved storytelling. The world changed and, unfortunately, i didn’t change rapidly enough with it. That’s on me. 

My job is to make sure that isn’t on the NEXT person.
Negotiations dont end until the end of July...
While I mostly agree with the cynicism here, at some point kids are voting are becoming elected officials. So. There is hope. Unless they, too, grow to like money more than people.
New York
Im curious though from an editing perspective, can Sora achieve that? Transitions, effects, etc.. Or will that come in the future
People, yes. A drug company making a commercial for whatever-the-hell, no.
Unless the cost differential makes it too tempting. 10K for a day's shoot plus talent and editing VS 1K for an AI facsimile. Don't be left behind. Investigate the tech objectively.

There are already plenty of robot cams doing this. Has been for years. I worked at a major news station in a top 5 market in 2015 and the entire studio crew was let go except one guy that oversaw the robot cameramen that could operate a jib, pan, zoom, dolly in and dolly out all on its own. I remember thinking how odd it was to watch a live news broadcast with no one behind the cameras running the show.

She shouldn't be beloved.  She totally blew it in 21.  Editors guild voted to take that deal after rejecting in 18 (when she was going against leadership).  If she had asked for a no vote on the 21 contract we would have rejected it and either gone back to the drawing board or gone on strike during boom times.  We would have been in a far better position to get a deal quickly when the streaming bubble hadn't burst.

Now we're way behind the 8 ball.  The hourly contribution gains we received from the last contract for the pension and health are entirely eroded by all IATSE not working last year.  She and all the rest of the leadership need to go after not preparing for 2021.  It's something that will fuck us for a long time.  


And now we're sabre rattling at a time when membership is depleted both financially and mentally.  They ALL need to go.
Information security or cybersecurity.
You’re a good person. I hope there are plenty more like you out there!
But we’re gonna know a ton in month. You can always tell with the jump point where it’s gonna land.
Damn, I don't have contacts on the east coast. Was hoping to throw you a bone.
Today, I think of Sora as a stock library. You can probably find something, but it may have problems, and it won’t match your original footage. And like stock, you probably can’t source as much coherent footage as you’d like to have.
Those haven’t been traditional photography for nearly a decade now.
I saw an image I *think* was AI on a USC web ad today
Im actively working with the tech with major clients. It takes way more guiding hands than is actually worth it, and that’s unlikely to change ever for a multitude of reasons and it if it does there’s far bigger issues than you or I’s jobs
Na, if anything the novelty will wear off
Me and anyone with taste, yeah.
That is interesting, but not really a live event , that would still be a studio. I mean a live event like a party, wedding, concerts etc. where nothing is static and you have to be on top of the action. But hey who know's with this shit now a days.
The only thing I took away from this is how much you don't understand the event/wedding business. Just bangwagoning, oh everyone with a camera can do this shpeal.
But we got to check a box that said we identify as "dual flame"! That was way more important than asking about our health care concerns or fixing the health care she allowed to get infinitely worse.
From what theyve told me, publicly and privately, its not going to start off looking like an easy negotiation. They want to put up a heck of a front.
I'd say it's most likely the limits of the technology will become more clear. Whether it's a matter of control, or price, or even law. The recent acceleration of these new tools is not endless, because we don't live in a fantasy. In a way I suppose I could agree with that being called "the novelty wearing off."

The enthusiasm behind AI reminds me of way back in 2000 when everyone was afraid 3D would replace actors forever because of the Final Fantasy movie. Twenty years later, that hasn't quite panned out as suggested.
That is some grade-A copium.
cope more dude. reminds me of everybody complaining when photography went from film to digital lol or in the 90's when 3D/VFX replaced practical fx 

you need to adapt. if you prefer human made content, charge more for it. It's going to be boutique and artisinal, and a market of its own.
That was almost a decade ago, if you think the tech hasn’t advanced far past that by now you’re very wrong. Go take a look at what robot cams are doing in things like sports and major concert events. It’s wild.
U2 show at Sphere in Vegas could use some of that

ALso can't blame soley Cathy for the health care situation.  She fought the good fight for most of her years.  After 2018 Loeb made her pay and she held the company line since then.
I’ve heard the same, but I’ve also heard from people at the studios. They know how much they’re gonna lose if the strike happens. With all these productions trying to get started after last strike, they can’t afford it. They are so backlogged it’s insane…they are only now getting their footing, they can’t afford a long strike
The models are already hapsberging themselves. We are in a stage right now where all these firms are grossly overstating the capabilities of these models, so they can pump up their financials. Look at the sora stuff, they meticulously curated what they showed and even that stuff barely holds up to any discerning eye.
How exactly am I coping? My job is safe, have survived three rounds of layoffs (that had nothing to do with AI), and in fact was promoted. I’m on the round table for innovation at my company, we are implementing AI workflows, and they actually require more man hours to get any sort of consistent, quality results that hold up to any sort of scrutiny. It’s not the crutch y’all think it is.
By all means, feel free to put all your eggs into this basket.
We do not have robots walking around events recording footage. I guess I should preface that with "yet," because everybody wants to talk about what's coming someday instead of what's currently happening. Concerts sometimes have robot cameras locked on a track in front of a stage moving left to right, or (human-operated) drones occasionally getting a wide shot.

News isn't really comparable because it's one set that uses the same locked angles day after day. Of course that automation has been happening for a long time now, it's old news (couldn't resist, sorry). And sports have some cool shots like you mentioned, with cameras moving along elevated tracks.

But the price and tech barrier of having a reliable, mobile AI robo camera moving amongst a crowd? That's fantasy talk right now, and even in 20 years surely more expensive than hiring a camera operator.
Now you are starting to make more sense with this thoughtful reply. I have to agree who want's fake photos? You could just have a fake event as well. I think there will still be a market for having a person help capture the moments as they happen, and not use Ai to fake it. But as this tech develops I'm sure it will be forced into every area, for good or bad reasons.

And I still believe you are devaluing professional experience vrs cost, just because you think anyone can do this. I hope your mechanic isn't your 9 year old nefew, because ya know anyone can do this stuff.
She released a statement saying she didnt even feel like asking us our thoughts on health care because she feels like she knew enough and didnt want our feedback. On the other hand......dual flame!

> After 2018 Loeb made her pay and she held the company line since then.

If she was done fighting she couldve quit and gotten us someone else who would try.
Neither side can afford an actual strike, but posturing in the first months? They can both afford that.
What’s a film editing technique you never noticed before but once you saw it now you can’t unsee it?
I’ll start it first. I noticed that sometimes shows need a reaction from an actor that was never originally shot.

So they’ll take a clip, reverse it, intercut with an insert, the play it back normally.

There’s a clip in the first season of The Bear where Ritchie calls the cops on some mobsters.

They literally used a shot of him looking away, then reversed it so it looks like he’s turning his head towards camera.

It worked pretty good, except you can always tell when it’s reversed because the actor’s eyes follow their head movement which gives away that it’s unnatural.

And now I can’t believe how many films use this ALL THE TIME!
[deleted]
People/car/etc. passing in front of the lens, providing a good cut point

Didn't notice it til my editing mentor taught that trick. now i use it all the time too
When I used to do video production I would shoot and edit. I’d always hit record way before “action” and hit stop way after “cut”, those little moments of people before and after were always great reaction shots to use.
Dropped frames on fight impacts.
When there’s an over-the-shoulder close up reaction of someone, but you can tell it’s from a different moment, or they altered the timing of it because you can see the mouth moving on the character whose shoulder is in the foreground, but you don’t hear them.
the audio from the next scene starting just before the cut
Some of the proudest moments of my entire LIFE are sitting back by and marveling at my Frankenstein monsters.
The "multiple impact/explosion". It used to happen more frequently in the 80s-90s, but many films still do that today. Basically, when there is an explosion or something like someone being thrown out of a window shattering the glass, you would be shown the beginning of it, and then, instead of cutting on action, the editor would actually "replay" the beginning of said explosion or action from a different angle.
Music that goes from crappy speakers in a car to the full definition version (or the other way if it fits).
That warp stabiliser boat at sea.
i notice backwards clips really often too, because when i'm editing i think i'm going to be so sneaky and do that then it looks really bad. so I'm like yikes i guess not...

then i see it used in a big production and i'm thinking, huh... guess they were okay with that? (my only assumption is the producer REALLY wanted that reaction shot and they didn't have any alternative..)
here's a great technique for editors that needs to be done on set - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFuJp6oIMPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFuJp6oIMPk)
A couple tell-tale techniques:

First, the in-car shot right before the sudden collision is always a skosh too long, usually with the 'driver' not watching the road. So just as soon as you think "Hey, watch the road, dummy... BANG, T-boned by a red-light runner.

Next, in old-school film-only post production, you can often tell when a dissolve is about to take place because you can see the generation loss in the film grain at the match cut before the optical dissolve. Most visible on stuff originated on 16mm, or lower-budget 35.  Really telegraphs the upcoming dissolve. 

Last is the random isolated shot of some apparently minor piece of evidence or character action that will "turn out" to be key to the plot later on. Seen mostly in TV police procedurals. Around here, it elicits the cryptic comment, "Well, that's not there for no reason..." Lots of examples in the streamer "Will Trent".

This is more sound editing that anything else, but might still apply: how there seems to be only a few usable sounds in Hollywood for horses neighing or bears roaring and they are used every, damn, time. Maybe hearing those same animal sounds in World of Warcraft for years and years made them super recognizable to me, because I really can't unhear it haha.
Not really a technique, but morph cuts. Just watched To Kill a Tiger, and it's a powerful film, but man those morph cuts drove me crazy
I wouldn’t say that’s a technique, more that they didn’t get it while shooting and the editor had to save the scene. Sometimes there no other choice. 

A technique that (is a great technique but) is usually overdone is getting really loud, and cutting to silence. Or getting to silence and cutting to something really loud. I’ve seen some movies that have that almost every scene.
Ridley Scott's pointless stuttering post slo mo
When someone is talking and they cut to a shot from behind the speaker and their jaw movement isn’t synced with what they’re saying
When the music tells us how to feel before the scene does. Takes me out of the film each time.
When they cut to empty coffee cups
i do this all the time
The Texas Switch. The more obvious the better.
Pulling a frame out of a punch. To make the hit and reaction look more realistic.
I want to read a book on cutting on the closing of doors.
The cool as heck opening shots of the city that you just KNOW were bought from a stock footage supplier
>They literally used a shot of him looking away, then reversed it so it looks like he’s turning his head towards camera.

I noticed it as soon as it played and actually called it out to my girlfriend, then we rewinded and she was like YOU'RE RIGHT!!!!
Eye tracing match cuts
I don’t know the technical terminology for it - I believe it’s a split diopter shot but may have that mixed up with something else - but that shot usually found in thrillers/horrors when it shows somebody’s panicked face in a close-up, but the background is also in focus. Usually it shows the fear on somebody face when they’re hiding from someone or something in the background. There’s always that blurred seam where they’ve feathered and comped the two shots together. Every time I see it I think, it should be so easy to hide that seam, at least in the post After-Effects world. Wouldn’t take long to mask animate it. Or have the mask follow straight lines of the set. Maybe it’s for effect but it always pulls me straight out of the movie. 

Similarly, any time I watch a long ‘oner’, I’m more focused on finding the stitches than just enjoying the story. 1917 was awesome but the whole time I’m just thinking, ‘There! There! Maybe there too?’
This one’s more of a personal pet peeve. When music (usually more obnoxious when it’s diagetic) wraps up just as the scene wraps up - IE, a needledrop song plays it’s ending out as if the song ended perfectly in sync with the scene. it’s too pat, too synchronous for me. For reference: see any episode of Boardwalk Empire

edit to add: this is specifically for needle drop music in dramatic narrative.
The long, no-cut single shots, like the incredible ones in Children of Men.
Literally?
I love when the person being interviewed talks in past tense and needs to be in present. But honestly that’s the field producers fault. Now it’s a frankenbit nightmare.
Netflix docuseries are especially egregious in this area. I worked on a feature verite doc, and we did some stitching things together under broll, but we were constantly asking ourselves if we were honestly communicating the ideas portrayed by our characters, vs cutting things together to convey our own ideas. It’s can be a tricky balance. 

But man the Netflix docs, it sometimes seems like they’re creating sentences where every other word is an edit. It’s hard to believe there isn’t some creative editing to make things more entertaining, and that makes it easy to doubt the docs veracity.
The majority of my Frankenbites are due to the interviewee being unable to string a sentence together correctly. Mostly a grammar thing I find…
If you’re not concocting a cohesive soundbyte out of some poorly spoken train of thought, are you really editing?
If they're done smoothly, they should be invisible like everything else.

I've had producers tell me they don't remember that line read or bite being said. I say "yup."
I *always* try to explain to people what goes on when you're seeing b-roll. You've just put it perfectly:

>when an interviewee isn't on cam... its a madhouse under there
I’m an editor and I can tell you this is only getting worse as well - I’ve had clients Frankenbiting but supplementing it with A.I. audio of the interviewees voice to get them to say exactly what they need them to.
“Do we have b-roll to cover it?” Oh, it’s time to get nasty with this soundbite
 MasterChef Australia might as well just use AI voiced scripts at this point, it's gotten so bad.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ashO7GeFEE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ashO7GeFEE)
Every time my wife comments on something someone said in a reality show my question is always "Did you SEE them say it?"
It's so gross I hate doing them
Why is it called frankenbite?
Yup. Just had to cover a 45 second conversation all off camera. So many cut aways. “Can u make this feel more real” “can they be on camera for this line?” Fukin BRAVO.
Doing a bunch of brand film docs right now and dealing with this so much, it is what it is though.
I first noticed this from the [Left 4 Dead's main menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CGqSkckg_4) background video. I thought it was clean!
First noticed this in Scott Pilgrim, very stylistically done, and later in the first season of Sherlock, where it was done much more subtlety but also really cleanly and eye catching for me in a different way than Scott Pilgrim.
I'm consciously trying to stop pulling selects off this now. I include so much crap, if there's a nice wipe.
Of course!
I use these a lot in my films. It’s like you’re getting all kinds of alternate reaction takes that are always very natural and unburdened by there being no windup to hit a line or specific beat. 

My new feature has a few of these moments in use and they definitely helped in the edit as we mostly only did two takes per shot before moving on.
Yeah I did this when I used to make shorts. Been a very long time now though.
Along these lines, it's always entertaining to see when they "take" the scene too early -- so early you can see the talent reacting to "action".
I miss the heads and tails on 16/35mm film shots. You can emulate with some success by speed ramping and over exposing in post (or plugins), but it's never quite the same, takes more time, and you don't get the happy accidents. I liked my free, built in flash frame effects on every take.
Recently saved a scene with this. It wasn’t a fight, a mother pushes her daughter during an argument and she falls. The moment kept looking like the mother is not pushing her hard enough for her to fall down. Without that moment the scene wasn’t working. Dropped a frame, suddenly it was all very sad to watch the mother violently push her daughter.
oh i don’t actually understand this technique, would you mind explaining?
the old Monty Python slap. I love it. [I used it once](https://youtu.be/eVwJK986GxM?si=S2ZbyGq8JR-2MaTV&t=76) in a zombie short film where my mom got whacked with a frying pan
I'm not sure what you mean by this, can you link an example plz? Thx! 
Yes!
Can you explain what that means, any examples on YouTube?
Yeah, I remember the first time I saw this was way back when Braveheart was in theaters.
this one i’ve seen in every movie and series i’ve watched on the past 10 years
Was about to say this. You cannot unsee these moments and can really put you off when it’s in a movie or series.
Unless production wasn’t rushed and foreground and camera were stable enough to facilitate quick compositing.
i had to stop watching Billions on showtime because they did this so much that it drove me crazy
This is the worst.  "Nevermind that his mouth is moving but he's not talking.  Just use it!  Goooo!!"  Honestly this is probably at least 75% of the reverse dialogue shots.
I feel like this one has gotten excessive over the last few years. Seems like a lot more projects are getting heavily rewritten in post.
Good ol J cut
A part of my job is finding chapter points for dvd/blu-ray/digital. Dialogue bleeding between scenes = bane of my existence.
It’s amazing even how much game shows are edited down for time and messed with.
Same! The undetectable Frank’nEdit is my specialty!! And when I’ve done a good one, I will take a minute to replay/cycle around it and love my own work 🤣
when the producer says to just leave the clip on the interviewee over a really obvious frankenbite that they couldn't do without i'm like "i got some bad news.."
Right, really make it last longer - I think McGruber made fun of that.
Also often done for punches (with an even tighter timing of course) etc
Doesn’t it go back to Eisenstein? I remember a plate getting shattered again and again in the Battleship Potemkin
I call that a “double tap” or “triple tap” if you’re getting wild.
Definitely overused
Warp stabilizer on anything, really. I see so many shots that are poorly stabilized in post. If you can’t make it look natural, leave it shaky, please.
I try to do this on every setup.  Look left then center.  Look right then center.  Look left then right.  Smile, frown, you name it.  Saves my bacon (pun actually not intended but I'll keep it) every time.
Whoa, great idea for directors!
> the in-car shot right before the sudden collision is always a skosh too long, usually with the 'driver' not watching the road

the ones where it's truly sudden and there isn't this obvious "uh ohhhhhh they made a mistake" delay are very terrifying like an actual car accident and tbh i think that's a lot better anyway
ADR always seems quieter as if it was recorded in a studio.
This really sticks out like a sore thumb but sometimes it's necessary.
I've worked with ADR sessions that really focus on these. They called them Punch Ups.
I’m fairly amateur, so I just discovered morph cut in the last 6 months, and I really have to force myself not to use it unless I as the editor can’t even tell that I’ve used it.
I can’t stand morph cuts / fluidmorphs, they look so unnatural. So overused on TV, and I thought I caught one in Killers of the Flower Moon
JJ Abrams did that best in the first Star Trek reboot.  When they warp jump into the trap, there's a scene of crew rushing around until the hull is breached and they get sucked out into space. As the camera follows them, as soon as it goes outside into space, there's no noise and it's totally silent. It was the first time I had really seen it and it was so well done!
You’re right - maybe a tendency is a better word.
Can you provide an example?
Here's a good quote from Joe Walker on editing *Blade Runner 2049*:

*It’s odd how many scenes in films, not just Blade Runner, but all films, start with a door and end with a door. I don’t know whether that points to the theatrical origins of film, or whether it’s just a common way to shape a scene. In many cases, of course, doors can be phenomenally loaded symbols – of hidden secrets or paths disguised. I’m no door-ist, but if there are too many scenes bookended by them, the editor’s duty is to kick them down.*

[Check out the rest of the interview here](https://www.provideocoalition.com/aotc-bladerunner-2049/)
Soon to be replaced by an Ai-created stock footage supplier I should add
Haha that’s awesome
Example?
I thought that technique was done in camera
I spent Birdman looking for the stitches as well
[deleted]
Network executives constantly asking for a character to say xyz. Producer cobbles an unusable bite. I say that they don’t say xyz because it isn’t true. This is a detective that chose his words carefully. He cannot make an accusation. He’s hesitant to even theorize it. I’m ignored. Address note myself. Get over time later changing bite out when legal doesn’t approve it. It’s crazy how much money network execs burn.
I think Too Hot To Handle is a particularly good example where they frankenbite the interviews to make them sound even more incredibly dumb in the intro interviews.
Cough dts cough
Same, I recently edited something that needed extreme frankenbiting because the interviewee wasn’t articulate at all.  But problem now is I’m having trouble finding enough relevant B-rolls to cover it up.
This happens to me alot. Interviewee can't say anything concise and takes a long wild jumbled path to get to their point.
I blame producers who were interviewing the person in not asking follow ups to get more concise answers.
Broll is just hanging a nice picture over giant hole in the wall.
When a client is like "that bit's good, can we see his face while he says that instead of cutting away?" No, no you cannot, because I have painstakingly constructed that sentence out of isolated silables and it took me half a day 
I purposely cover non edits in interviews all the time too, though. A lot of the time what they’re saying isn’t about them, so it’s better for the story to be on viz. I’m just saying that it isn’t a **hard** rule that viz covering an interview means it’s _always_ covering edits…but often it definitely is.
Corporate work I don’t care. But when that happens in news, no bueno.
That’s terrifying. Better frankenbites
literally perfect
Sound bites you have to piece together to make the person articulate and make sense. Cutting out the uhs and ums and more.
Pretty sure 2 does the same, used to watch that shit when waiting for good versus lobbies lol
What is drop frame?
You simply edit out a frame right before the impact. Like a 1 frame jump cut.
I think this is an alternative to an original method. Which was called “undercranking”. Simply it is to capture with a frame-rate lower than your projection frame rate. When you play a 23fps footage on a 24fps sequence. It plays faster.

The term comes literally from the cranking arm at the side of the old cameras. Which would operate the film magazine and the shutter manually. And just turning that arm at a pace under the proper speed.

The proper thing to do would be to shoot an action shot at 22-23 fps so that it would look faster on 24fps. Because if you just drop a frame from a 24fps footage the jump is much bigger than a 23fps footage. Since the jump would be divided to 23. Another way to do this is to shoot higher frame rates then make it play faster. So that the jump isn’t obvious.

Jumping a frame is obvious %99,9 of the time. So, you just look out for those little possibilities where it can dissolve into the action.

Can you explain the technique? I don’t understand it
It’s also relatively easy to make a split screen mask and use a portion of the OTS take when their mouth isn’t moving. Especially if the camera is locked off. I’m sure a lot of network tv shows are kind of rushed and lazy about this sort of thing but there’s no excuse for this when it’s an actual movie/series with a decent budget. I think I spotted this recently in a Hollywood movie and it really annoyed me.
j cut would refer to a shot yes; but if it’s a scene, this is generally called “prelap” which i think is what this person is referring to
How do you get such a job?
Oof that sounds like not fun.  Can just imagine some whiny producer blaming you, with them not understanding the situation
The 1 frame audio dissolve is the best invention ever.
I prefer the reverse. Kick ass needle drop hits. Character leaves the car and it becomes a part of the scene as a muffled far away song being left on somewhere.
Fucking A.
I'm glad to see someone else say this because I thought I imagined seeing a couple morph cuts in Killers of the Flower Moon
Battlestar Galáctica reboot did this a lot too.
Pretty much every scene in a tv show or movie where they have those takeout coffee cups you can always tell there’s nothing in them. You can hear they are hollow when they put them down and more obviously, the way they move them so quickly and carelessly. It’s the 1 thing I always look out for and yet to have seen anything placed in a cup.
Only place I've seen it (anecdotally because me) recently is in U.S. version of Shameless, nearly every time they have disposable coffee cups. Props, just put some fucking water in there and tape the hole closed if you are worried about wardrobe getting wet. It's so obvious because the physics and actor reactions are just wrong with empty cups.
https://youtu.be/gi9OBRzbMNI?si=7Fbuw-hd1gpxlqoP
Oh maybe it is. I totally assumed it was comped because of the blur. Do you know how it’s done?
Oh yeah totally! And, if you happen to have seen it, that episode of Always Sunny - Charlie Work I think it’s called.
Yes, let's all utter our final important line just as the last bars of the song we were listening to complete. You're right, it's 101. Basic. Film School starter pack. It's basically lifting the denouement of the music for your own purposes which, sure, can be powerful, but it is WAY overused, and it's melodramatic as heck.

And no, continuing to the next scene would obviously not make sense especially in the case of diagetic music. I'm a hard cut fan. But nothing wrong with being a bit Baroque here either; rip the record off the grammaphone. Close Out with a door slam. Cut and echo. just a bit of variety

edit to add: this is specifically for needle drop music in dramatic narrative.
We used our first AI bite last year (something the talent didn’t say), they couldn’t be bothered to come in and read a line and gave permission to do it
For sure. Though shows like this, and even Welcome to Wrexham, for me are on the borderline of docuseries and reality tv. It’s like they’re making reality tv out of real life athletes. They feel markedly different from something like I’ll be Gone in the Dark or the NXVIM docuseries.

For some reason the ‘creative editing’ is less bothersome to me in shows like dts and wtw. Maybe because I assume all reality tv has little interest in being truthful, rather just entertaining.
And if they can't mangle a quote together they'll just get their fake commentator to record it
I came here to see if this would get mentioned and I 100% agree.
Very much this. Producers thinking their job is done by asking a question and sitting there until the interviewee stops talking. That’s why the MIV comes out at 2 hours long. Really gets my goat
Ahh makes sense, thanks!
You simply edit out a frame right before the impact. Like a 1 frame jump cut.
thank you for the explanation! i’ll make some tests with old footage here
You just cut a frame at the point of impact (or just before) to make a punch or kick appear more intense.
Right?  Of course most shows have to be shot by a camera guy with one leg on a 3 day bender.  To keep it "interesting."  IMO cinematographers lock down so yes, this should be standard.
I was taught it as a "sound bridge."  Makes sense but may not be an industry term.
Random post-house work followed by a couple of decades of DVD/Blu-ray authoring. Now with more platform delivery work thrown in.
Recently watched 3 episodes of Chopped, I swear I was gonna get sick. It was so bad
Sorry, what am I looking for here?
What am I looking for here?
Split diopter lens. 

I think the halo effect is because the lens can hold two specific distances in focus, but everything else will still be out of focus.
If you watch Spartacus - in that I’m Spartacus! No I’m Spartacus! Scene there is a reaction shot of the two Romans watching this that is completely out of place. Sky is different. Lighting. Everything.
> it's melodramatic as heck

let's be honest, most 'editing techniques' are very melodramatic because our job is either to make something inherently uninteresting interesting, or to package up something that's been finely tuned for audience satisfaction in the most attention grabbing way possible
Buxton? Im pretty crofty doesn’t record new lines
Frankensteins soundbite
I’ve worked on a few lower budget indie features and short films recently that required splicing two takes together like this with a moving camera. A couple of them even involved panning which was a bitch. But it’s still possible it just requires some extra work. 

For a handheld shot, I made a clean plate of the left side of the shot where the over-the-shoulder actor was (Photoshop’s new generative fill makes this very easy), then I motion tracked the clean plate to the main shot of the person speaking, so the over-the-shoulder person was basically removed from the shot. And then I added them back into the left side of the shot with a rough roto mask and used the portion of their performance that we wanted.
yeah in tv & film editing & screenwriting, it’s called prelap. a j cut is if you want the sound from an incoming clip to precede the picture. prelap is when you want sound from the scene; this could be music, could be some sfx or foley like footsteps or waves crashing or thunder or a car driving down a gravel road or it could be dialogue. i’ve never heard of a sound bridge; people would most likely understand what you mean if you used the term, it’s just not quite as precise or technical as prelap
Eye tracing
Totally, in a lot of use cases! I guess I'm pretty specifically speaking about scripted drama here. This is a brilliant toolkit piece for reality or magazine format for sure. It's a go to when I want a stupid awards show submission video to pop.
And that, kids...is movie magic.
and i googled it after i commented. sound bridge is a thing and seems like its interchangeable with prelap. i guess its just a matter of who you picked shit up from and which bays you’ve been in. could be i heard it but it didn’t register
Nice!  My ancient education paying off :)
yes!
I created a free After Effects alternative
Working daily on a Linux machine, I often found myself in need of an After Effects alternative on Linux, with layers, keyframes, video effects... so I ended up creating Pikimov, a motion design & video editor.

It runs directly in your web browser and is compatible with all systems: Windows, macOS, Linux.  
Pikimov is **free**, **without registration**, it **does not upload files** to a cloud server, and **does not** **use your projects to train AI models**.

Even if you already have an Adobe subscription, Pikimov can still save your day when you are on the go, far away from your work computer

Here's the link to the editor: [https://pikimov.com](https://pikimov.com)
It's neat.

It's also (IMHO) not useful here in this community.

And it's not because you're not magnificent. You are.

*This has potential* \- but it's primary appeal is going to be around free tools.  

After Effects has nailed a lot of key basics needs. 

* Text animation is one of them. I totally tried hitting SHIFT-T (which brings up the parameters in the timeline *where I will be animating*.
* I wanted motion blur.  
* User request: I want *to scrub* on any parameter *in the timeline area.* 

At a deeper level, there are tons of existing After Effects projects.  Meaning Many people can't create motion graphics from scratch but can tweak existing motion graphic templates.

It'd be too difficult to read existing Adobe After Effects projects. 

The last reason it'll run into problems is that very few motion graphic artists I know use After Effects in its stock state. They heavily rely on third-party tools

Now, for our sister community /r/videoediting, it's totally functional. I could see someone using this over something in Resolve. But for professional editors, I don't see it gaining any real traction. 

Your exports are MP4 and PNG sequences—you need one video format that contains an Alpha. ffmpeg will do DNXHD/HR, and every flavor of it supports an Alpha channel.
Seems nice and thank you for it. How do you manage to host it freely?
This looks awesome…going thru it now!
How many developers worked on this?
This is amazing! Thank you so much!!!

Awesome, does it have a wire removal tool?
Can this work to generate an HD and larger sized alpha title or roll/crawl animations in sequential .png format?
I know it's minor, but the very first snag that caught me when playing with it was the inability to scrub values. Coming from an Adobe ecosystem (and most other animation programs function similarly) I don't want to just type in numbers, I want to be able to click on the property and drag my mouse to increase and decrease the value. It seems like a silly little thing, but not being able to do  a very common interaction that is intuitive and built into your muscle memory can be a major annoyance.
it would be perfect for motion graphics if there is a way to adjust the anchor point on a image or video file to animate it like for scale and rotation.  
some ideas I think would be amazing  
like a way to add ruler, title safe those sorta things in addition to grids. snapping to it.  
The possibility to parent layers to each other would be game changer.
Can i create maps and show navigation on them from A to B?
Or you can simply use DaVinci Resolve.

Pikimov does not hold/save/upload video files from the users, that's how I am able to keep the hosting cost very low, by keeping files transfers to the bare minimum.
Just me, it's a side project I worked on in parallel to my full time job, but I hope to make it my main activity
Try Netscape Navigator???
[deleted]
People use opera? Firefox I get but Opera?
Not yet, do you have a video to share showing exactly what you expect as tool to remove unwanted elements ?
You can make crawl text animations with Pikimov, and export as a png sequence. Support for alpha channel in exported .png sequences will come very soon
I tried to implement it few months ago, but failed. I've just spent some more time on it, and I believe this time I got it right ! It will be implemented in the next update.   
Do you know the official name of this feature, or does everyone call it 'scrubbing' like you do ?

some kind of file management system after importing files. to arrange and search for that file.
As in Indiana Jones movies? You could achieve it with Pikimov, but there is no specific tool to do so
Thank you for your insights,

By posting about my editor on this subreddit I was hoping for genuine pro feedback like yours, this will help me understand better the target audience of Pikimov: for who is it really useful.
Thanks for the clarification.
The ability to develop something that advanced entirely on your own is SUPER impressive. You're a beast.
You mock me, Boy? I have a very cool 8mm film camera with 4 tapes here 🤣
The UX is really nice, you should try. But if you are a real nerd, try "Vivaldi" (is by the original team who made opera, they made it after opera had been bought by a Chinese team)

Looking forward to it. Best of luck on your Pik project!.
Yeah, live scrubbing is pretty much a standard terminology, like how you can "scrub" back and forth through a video on the timeline. Originally applied to playback, but also for being able to see results changing live in your viewport as you adjust the parameters in real time. You'll see people talk about scrubbing the playhead, scrubbing through the timeline, etc. I think the term goes back to the old analog days of reel-to-reel tape decks.

Just want to add, you're doing amazing work. Especially the 3D integration being such an intuitive, integral part of the workflow. Keep it up!

It would be great to build a template format. It will lower the threshold for entry level editors and entice ‘pros’ to make templates. I make MOGRTs for our editors to ensure a fast workflow and keep branding consistent. 
Thank you, I did not knew there were specific effects just for this use case
Scrubbing is now possible on all inputs, thank you for your support !
