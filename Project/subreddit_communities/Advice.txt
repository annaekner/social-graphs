My girlfriend said she’s not in a relationship at a party.
So recently me (18M) and my gf (18F) went to a halloween party. I was already uncomfortable with her going because a bunch of her co-workers were going to be there, and they try flirting with her even while at work. While we were there she got very drunk fast. (she’s a lightweight) In the room full of the guy co workers, my gf and I were sitting together and her guy co-worker that I told her about that I absolutely do not like was also sitting next to her. So it was me, her and her co-worker. She touched on his leg to get his attention to play with game with her and it honestly made me feel like shit, but it was a drinking game and I was the sober driver so I guess it’s understandable. Suddenly two girls came rushing into the room asking people if they want to play spin the bottle. Those two girls said “Who wants to play spin the bottle, you can’t play if you’re in a relationship though” My gf proceeds to say “IM NOT” in front of everyone in the room. I could hear the guy co-workers in disbelief and they were all kinda smiley idk. I don’t know how to feel. It honestly hurt my feelings for sure especially now knowing she’s been snapchatting that guy co-worker I hate. They snapped each other 6 times in one day. (which was today) I don’t know what to do, I feel disrespected and violated. I don’t know if I should break things off. I already tried to but it was honestly so hard to and I backed off and took it back. She was crying a lot. From the start I promised her I would stay to the end but I don’t know if I can if I keep getting disrespected.




UPDATE: Thank you all for your opinions and support, I really appreciate y’all fr. It’s going to be over between us and thankfully all of you have made me see it though. This was my first relationship, so thank you for honestly giving out advice about this situation. Have a blessed day and again thank you. 🙏
Dude, you’ve got to wake up. If she’s flirting and acting like that with other guys, especially when you’re right there, she clearly doesn’t respect you. Don't be a doormat; if you’re feeling violated, it’s time to cut ties. You deserve way better than this drama.
dude just break up with her, clearly you're not on the same page. 

you're young, you'll find someone who respects you.
believe her when she said she wasnt in a relationship and move on. she already is disrespecting you like this.

also dont let fucking tears stop you from committing to your decision. her tears dont mean shit and are being used to manipulate you in this case.

stop being weak.
You already know the answer because you already tried it. Do it again by text if you need to. Move on and save yourself a lot of grief.
Bruh. You “backed off” of breaking up? You’re quite literally telling her it’s okay to step over you like a door mat. She disrespected you like that in front of others and you’re willing to be caught with her in public? I’d deny even knowing her at that point. But to each their own
Bro are you kidding me she’s fucking the other dude and disrespecting you beyond belief you should just dip out no words at all completely ghost that
Cut bait and run
Holy fuck, young men, have some self respect.


Do not put up with being treated like this, if you don't respect yourself no one else will.


Despite what the world is trying to tell you, you are incredibly valuable; remember that, seer it into your brain.


Work hard to be your best you and do not tolerated being disrespected, just walk away.
If she’s telling people that she doesn’t have a boyfriend and that she’s single then I don’t think you’re in a relationship mate 😬
Are you sure you’re together? Maybe you should check…
[removed]
She’s for the streets.
Rip the bandaid of my brotha, don’t keep making youreslf feel like this. 

Not to sound like a dick but the moment she touched his leg and left you to play the game; that should have said it all. Then her blatantly saying “I’m not!” while you’re there… yea brotha, she wants out . Focus on you man . Money will never do that to you 😂
Dude, you stopped being in a relationship the minute she said that she wasn't in a relationship. Nobody is that drunk. She announced that she wasn't in a relationship with you, with you sitting right there, to the entire room. You should have left immediately. 

Her crying is completely irrelevant. You are single whether you accept it or not.
Why did you not call her out when she said she did not have a boyfriend, I would be done with her there and then.
I woulda left that party right then and there bro, fuck that bitch
Wake up and leave her. Have enough self respect to at least say you left a bop.
That's a deal-breaker mate
Leave her
Bro you are getting played and she has 0 respect for you. Cut her loose and work on your confidence by getting in shape and becoming a man that doesn’t tolerate that type of disrespect
Bro this shit hurt to read. Fuck that bitch and go hit the gym or something. You’ll get yourself a better girl but in the meantime just focus on having a glow up so you can make her regret that shit and then hit it whenever you feel like and send her home in an Uber for being a ho.
So when she is done with the next party, tell her she doesn't have a boyfriend. Girls like that, not good girlfriends. Don't take that.
Yo wtf lol you deserve better man.
Im gonna be brutally honest. You're young and have time to find someone who actually wants you. Clearly, it isn't her. She said she's single, make it true, and find someone who actually values you. Keep your head up.
You’re 18. This is a defining point in your life. Trust your gut and walk.
She ain't your girlfriend dude, she belongs to the streets.
The title is enough. Just dump her
Your single dawg.
as someone who went through something semi-similar, i personally would break things off

However, don’t take my word completely, i dont know the full ins and outs of your relationship with her, but with my situation, even though she broke it off, it was the best thing that could’ve happened
If I were you I'd take that "I'm not" as a break up. She can cry all she want but she did it.
I know it hurts but trust me you'll be better off in the long run.
It's okay not to keep your promise. You gave it under the premise that she would uphold her end of the deal and she didn't. 
If she wants to blame you for this let her know how she obviously doesn't care about your feelings, and she has nobody to blame but herself
I'll say this two ways so you can understand 

1. She's a hoe. She just said she's not in a relationship, so neither are you. Block her and be done with it. 

2. She belongs to the street.
You need to break up with her IMMEDIATELY I'm not even joking.
 
OP please, I'm literally begging for you to have some self respect and turn that bitch out into the streets AND tell her family that she's basically a bicycle for her co-workers.

Like the fact you didn't react at all shows you have an insane amount of insecurity and hatred for yourself, you didn't even TRY to stand up for yourself at the party. 

Your girlfriend HUMILIATED YOU in front of DOZENS of people that she works with, if her co-workers didn't respect you before that party, they DEFINITELY don't now.

It honestly just sounds like she's getting ready to cheat on you or worse, gaslight you so hard that you become her service cuck. You'll eventually end up driving her to dates and dick appointments and soon she'll end up pregnant and leave you or make you take care of the bastard.

Leave.
Sounds like she’s not respecting you or your relationship. If she’s denying being with you and snapping that guy, it’s a big red flag. My cousin went through something similar, and cutting ties was the best decision for her. You deserve someone who respects you fully.
Bro I feel so bad for you. Drunk actions/words are sober thoughts imo. But she was openly flirting with other dudes in front of you. She doesn't respect you. Keep your head down, go to the gym, do better than her. You deserve it
Great update.  Make sure you follow through.  No matter how much she cries and begs you to stay.  It’s all bullshit.  This kind of disrespect is completely unacceptable.  You deserve better.  Do not ever settle for something like this.  Nobody is going to stand up for you if you don’t stand up for yourself.

Also, learn what you can from this.  When you date a girl, don’t tell her what to do.  Don’t try to control her.  Let her do what she wants.  And then just observe.  Observe what she does.  And if what she does is flirts with other men, snaps men who flirt with her, entertains men who or hitting on her, or otherwise disrespects you in similar ways, then just leave.  The goal in dating is not to mold someone into what you want.  You can’t do that.  The most you’ll do is make them pretend and do things behind your back anyway.  The goal is to find a woman who will respect you and not make you feel like this out of her own volition.  Because she wants to.  Because she has integrity, respects you, and respects your relationship.  

Also, don’t be hard on yourself.  You’re so young.  Everyone is foolish and gullible when they’re young.  The trick is to learn from your experiences. and the experiences of others.  

Lastly, young people are immature.  Don’t put too much faith into dating at this age.  It’s extremely hard to have a mature and respectful relationship that will last at this age.  Because you’re so young and have so much growing to do.  

Oh and, read Models by Mark Manson.  Best book for dating you’ll ever read.  Wish I read it at 18.
My ex-girlfriend said she’s not in a relationship at a party. There, fixed it.
Make her statement come true.
You need to block this woman on your phone and all social media, and gtfo before you catch someone else’s STD. 

It’s a rough situation, but it’s one all men tend to find themselves in at one point or another. Keep your dignity, your pride and your manhood, and peace the fuck out immediately. I’m sorry this happened to you, but it’s really just one of many lessons you will learn down the road. Godspeed.
Would have been a pro move if you just stood up in front of everyone and said “you are right. You aren’t in a relationship. We are done” and left.
So, I'm usually an advocate for making things work, but this has a number of red flags.

The one that I'd like to point out is that when people are drunk, the lowered inhibitions can show you who a person really is. Not only was she flirting with a co-worker that you speficially addressed that you didn't like COUPLED with the fact that she openly declared that she was single so she could play spin the bottle and hook up with other co-workers? This alone sends a bad message. Not only is she willing to say "fuck it" to the relationship, but she just showed all of her co-workers that they have a shot with her if they're clever enough.

I know that you said that you swore to her that you'd be there forever, but 1. She might as well have said that you two aren't an item and that she's a free agent. 2. The person you made that promise to may not be the person you are dating now. People change, they grow apart, they find new interests. If that person is different than who they used to be, then you made the promise to who she was, not who she is.

Ultimately, the trust has been broken. Staying in the relationship is up to you, but already the doubts and suspicions are setting in, and you'll spend more time worrying about what she's up to. As much as I hate to say it, I would recommend breaking up with her. You're both still young, and you have plenty of time to find other partners. Let her find one suited to her lifestyle and find someone who is more compatible to you; someone you know that you feel is trustworthy. 

Best of luck, OP, regardless of the choice you decide to make.
Get a new girlfriend. This one is defective.
Bro, she said no, you should have said me neither!
Leave her she sucks
You said you would stay until the end of it’s the end
drop that bitch immediately and tell her why and dont fall for whatever bs reason she gives you
You've been given a gift.  You know exactly where you stand.  

You're her emotional support dog, not her boyfriend.  She's not actually into you, she's just comfortable with you until something better comes along.

Leave now

Updateme!
Her: "I'm not!"
You: "She is correct." Walks out.
This doesn't sound like it will end well. Updateme!
If she says she doesn't have a boyfriend you should believe her.
She said she's not in a relationship. Why are you still pretending you're in a relationship with her. You don't have to "end" things, she's already made it clear there's nothing to "end".
Ah yes, the old 'I'm not in a relationship, but there is someone who would be very upset to hear me say that' move.
So does she have to fuck her co-working *right* in front of you before youxget the message? You're the safety net. She's trying to catch the next trapeze.
You're a dumbass.  When she said out loud in a room full of people that she's single, you should have just left her at the party and never talked to her again.
You're in a relationship. She is not. Huge red flag.
The "I'm not" should be the final straw man
You're 18 years old and one day you're going to look back at this saying damn how stupid was I to let this bother me. 

My advice, if she wants to be treated like that, treat her like that and then move on to the next one.
She's monkeybranching with you. Find a girl who respects you.
Well, you can end it now, or you can wait until you catch her cheating...
You clearly are not her boyfriend. However, if you choose to stick around you will most definitely be her bitch. I advise you do not stick around. If you do, you will absolutely regret it.
If she's like that in front of you, how does she act when you're not there? Leave her before you find out how many guys she's cheating with.
What's the question? You're not in a relationship big guy
not worth it. She is always going to seek validation and attention, trust me. Just run
She sounds like a lovely person. You're 18 and have a lot of life to live. Drop her.
Why would you have to break up if she's not in a relationship?
Brother please take off the rose tinted glasses. break up with her, she clearly doesn't respect you. Your're both young, Don't waste your time on someone that actively flirts with others, regardless of if you're present. She knows what she's doing and she does not care about your feelings. If you already tried to break up and she cried, that's called manipulation. Break it off before the relationship gets messier. At this rate she's bound to hurt you even more.
Bro
Are you wilfully ignorant?
You're 18, you're gonna handle this poorly, you're gonna let her take advantage of your self respect or lack thereof. But this is a learning experience, you MUST dump her, and you MUST not let her talk you into "i can change" people don't really change like this if your current relationship dynamic is already cemented. Sad thing is, she'll probably change for another guy, hopefully she'll learn from her mistakes with you for the future, but it's already ruined here. You can't let her worm her way back in, please listen bro, break the fuck up with her.
She's not your girlfriend. She never was.

It was only your turn.....and it's just about over, if it isn't already. 

She clearly wants to be a single girl... let her be. Jettison her.
As a girl, you need to break up with her. I would never do this to my bf and a girl that really loved AND RESPECTED you wouldn’t. You need both in a relationship. She clearly has no respect for you and it’s very unlikely that she truly loves you if she would say that and keep even talking to that guy outside of work. She should honestly report the flirting at work if it’s unwanted, and if it’s wanted then she shouldn’t be in a relationship. Break up now and find someone who respects you, loves you, and actually cares about you.
You’re in a relationship, but she isn’t.

She already told you flat out how she feels, why are you reserving feelings for someone who doesn’t care for you? If she act this way when you’re around, how do you think she acts when you’re not?
She aint no gf, shes a mean person. 
Dont toy with other peoples hearts dont put up with those who toy with yours.

You are you, there are 4bn women in this world you can and will find someone who actually cares aboutbyou for you. Have the confidence to know you are better than that. Shes young and dumb, and being mean.

If she tells you shes not in a relationship then she is not. End of. Dont feel bad that you a breaking up feel good that you are getting away from crazy
As soon as she said "I'm not" it was time to leave
Bro youre single
*Spoiler alert* she's not your girlfriend
Unless you enjoy being humiliated, move on, ditch her
She’s gross. You’re worth being proud of my dude. Go get a quality girl.
Yeah, bro. As soon as she said, “I'm not,” I would have been done with her, Brodie. I would have left her at that party with those dudes. I understand you are 18; you must pay attention to the signs. If a person wants you, they will not disrespect you. You have let her get away with this before; this is not your first time feeling this way. Do not commit to someone who is not committed to you💯.
If she said she isn't in a relationship, she's isn't you girlfriend. WAKE UP.
Don't give her rides anymore.
Ouch.   You got the message "we're broken up" the hard way.
You’ve gotten the advice, this might get lost in the comments BUT: 

You’re 18, bud. I mean this in a respectful way, but you’re still a kid and have your ENTIRE adult life ahead of you. 

I say this, because I know being young and having a shitty relationship can really put you off dating. 

Your girlfriend’s (or ex hopefully) actions DO NOT REFLECT you. She messed up too, but tbf to her she’s a kid still too. 

Go out, have some fun, and if you even have to question a relationship, in my personal experience, this is a sign to move on ESPECIALLY WHEN YOURE SO YOUNG.
I mean she's the one that said she's not in a relationship in my eyes she cut things off so she can't be butthurt when you aren't in her life anymore
That's our gf buddy
No offense, but Your, I hope, now ex gf is a piece of garbage that deserves to be thrown into a dumpster and get ravaged by racoons. 


She's basically cheating with no remorse and she's doing it in front of you. No excuses for that shitty behavior.
She acts worse when you're not around bro.

You probably already got cheated on.
The disrespect
Are you dumb af? Dump her, clearly she's not into you. She said it loud and clear, she's not in a relationship. Block her and never talk to her again. Not even as friends, know your worth man. Damn this pisses me off.
Bruh I would’ve walked out then and there lol 

At this point you should just text her saying we’re done block her and move on she has 0 respect for you
lol if she’s like IM NOT. I would’ve been like SAME or just walked out she can find her own ride home. Stop being weak.
Time to act like a rabbit and hippity hop right out that relationship.
Then you need to drop her like a hot potato.
A preemptive breakup is in order
Seems like you should just go no contact. If she’s not in a relationship, then I guess she won’t notice, right? If she is confused then perhaps her coworkers can fill her in.
She belongs to the street
You can't trust her unfortunately.she made a fool of you at a party .you were there..all this wasn't behind your back!..which would be bad enough..this isn't excusable
She already made how she feels exceptionally clear bro what do you need a signed letter?
Im sorry young man.  I really am.  But it’s over.  Move on.
You dropped your crown, king
See you at the gym.
Be strong and you are awesome my dude.
Should have left her there.
Glad you saw whatever truth you needed to see and feel positive about it.  

As this was your first relationship, take this with you: at no time should you ever know how often your GF has snapped with anybody.  That something only a stalker does.  You either trust her or you don’t - but digging into her social media (or any forms of communication) is a giant red flag of insecurity.  Just don’t do it.
Boo hoo. You're both 18. Tons of more tail to chase. Next time go bag one of her female coworkers
See you at your nearest gym:

She's right, dump her and move on.
When did men become the “girls” of the relationships
Make an honest woman out of her and dump her trust me I've been the doormat its not worth it it's 1000% better to be single and alone than be in this kind of relationship
>"From the start I promised her I would stay to the end."

Little brother, that type of commitment is for marriage! You're telling me that you're supposed to be committed to her "to the end" when she can't even stop flirting with her co-workers!? You've gotta build up to that level of commitment and NEVER give it to someone who doesn't respect you and won't commit to you. I'm late with this so I already know you're dumping her and that's good, but guard your heart in future relationships.
Leave
nice, treat her like you just found her on the street….you sir just got an open season pass
Drop her immediately bro, you’re too good for her. Don’t stress, don’t cry, don’t even think about it. Let her go and one day she’ll realize how horrible of a person she is, but it won’t matter because someone who loves you for you will already make you happy💪
Stop your contact immediately, get on with your new life. You said you would stay until the end, this is the end. Stop disrespecting yourself.
Leave. That kind of behavior is disgusting as shit.
>My girlfriend said she’s not in a relationship

Then she’s not your girlfriend.  Have some self-respect.  “Hey babe it really hurt my feelings when you got drunk and told everyone you were single.  That’s not very good girlfriend behavior”.

Like, she shouldn’t be playing Spin The Bottle in a relationship at all, but what the fuck. She literally said she was single.  She broke up with you in that moment.  It’s an exceedingly shitty way to do it, but you should take it at face value and find someone who actually respects you.  Maybe she’d want to take it back once she sobers up, but she made that choice and you should have forced her to commit to it.  Don’t even give her the courtesy of a breakup conversation, just ghost.  Answer disrespect with disrespect.
Run, buddy, run!!
My advice is start looking for a girlfriend. You don't have one.
She’s a bum. Dump her ass and move on. Plenty of women out there who will be happy to be with you.
She’s for the streets, young man.
Should have left her at the party.
"You're right, you are". Leave.
God I'm glad you woke up son. you were about to be in an open relationship when she rails all her co workers and you get to watch in the corner.
Move on, she’s a bop
You're 18..... there are so many and much better girls for you! She wants to do other men when she's drunk, that means she wants to sober as well but she needs liquid courage to do it!
To the end of what bro you're 18 lol.  The best move here is three way then break up with her.
She’s for the streets bro
You're 18 , just move on
Have you asked her reasons as to why she stated that she wasn’t with you in front of everyone and why she was clearly very keen to play spin the bottle? I would have the conversation but it isn’t looking good my guy.
What the typa cuck retarded shit did I just read
She is for the streets, bro. 

Let her go. This won't end well.
then neither are you
You already know the answer to the question you're trying to ask us.
Grow a spine, my dude. You're still so young and this is a good life lesson. So learn from it. If you continue to be a doormat you'll spend the rest of your life being walked all over.
Next…….
She told the truth.  Move on.
Why wouldn't you break up with her and leave as soon as she said "I'm not"? You can't blame it on being a child or having alcohol; that shit makes you tell the truth
Just go find someone else that doesn't behave like that. Go now cuz at that age with those variables you're probably only seeing the tip of the iceberg

What you've described is a level of disrespect indicating she views you as a fool or "useful idiot."
She's definitely intending on cheating. No point in staying forever with a girlfriend who can't even remain faithful at a Halloween party. Get a clue and leave this person.
Not worth the heart ache buddy, plenty of better women out there that you don’t have to deal with this kind of stuff with. If you want to “stick it out til the end”, that’s likely going to be when she cheats on you, speaking from experience
You're so young. Go have fun, don't try to make things serious with people unless you think they're the one. You need time to mature, smarten up, etc before having a real relationship. I'm so happy I went through the ringer before I met my wife. I'm happy I learned how to be a good partner by the time I met her and I'm happy I knew how to spot that she was perfect for me. You're 18. FOCUS ON YOURSELF and go have fun.
You're getting finessed. Find your spine before it's too late
What advice do you really need in this case? Break it off with her. She's trash, and she will drag you down with her if you let her. Do you want to be trash with her? No. You're 18, and this trash will hardly be your happily ever after. Cut the loss and move on ASAP. The blatant disrespect it takes for someone to act like this lol, disgusting.
Ghost her. She will be back then you take her back and then you ghost again
See you at the gym, bro.
Someone needs to slap you across the face and wake your ass up!  WTF, she will or has cheated on you!
Be a man and tell her it’s over
Tell her that this behavior is unacceptable and that she indeed is not in a relationship (with you) anymore. No fuss, no discussion.
Buddy, it’s over. Walk away and never look back. You deserve better than that. If she cries, she’s most likely just trying to manipulate you. You’ll find someone that will respect you, I guarantee it.
You aren't dating her obviously, you go about your life and block that weird girl's number.
She just sees you as her lap dog lol
That’s not your girlfriend, that might not even be your ex. 

Move on
You guys are young… but you seem more mature than her, hence she’s being disrespectful… we reward disrespect with distance… enough said.
Couples that still use Snapchat are usually hiding something… why else would you need it?! There’s enough social media platforms out there that honest, respectful couples use… think about it…
This isn’t normal behavior brother. You need to have a conversation with her that she’s doing a lot of things you’re uncomfortable with and if she respects you, she will stop doing them. If there seems to be a problem on her end with your conditions then end it. You should be proud to claim someone as your partner. The reason she said “I’m not” is because she is interested in someone that was in that room….and I have a feeling it’s that co worker you don’t like. She’s getting attention from him and she likes it/doesn’t want it to stop. 

Two things you can do:
1) break up 
2) set very clear boundaries with her going forward and make it clear you won’t be disrespected again. talk about how her actions made you feel.

You guys are young and both learning about yourself and relationships. If you really like this girl, try and make it work. Sometimes people need to mess up once in order to never mess up again. But make sure to stand up for yourself and don’t let it happen again.
>I don’t know what to do

Dude. You know what to do. She literally announced to everyone there that she's free game *right in front of you*. That is *so* fucking disrespectful. I'm sorry this is happening to you but the cold hard truth is you need to grow some balls and dump this chick because she doesn't give a shit about you. No matter how much she cries it doesn't change the fact that she has ZERO respect for you.
End it quit being a tool and end it. I’ve been blacked out drunk and never said that. She just wants other dick. She’s insecure and loves the attention. Do your self a favor and move on or you gonna be over and over again. Or stay and quit whining about it…
You only needed to write the title, you don’t need to make the rest of us read the whole damn post. 

It’s pretty self explanatory. If you are not ok with your girlfriend lying about her relationship status then break up with her. I think most people would agree that’s where a relationship must end. 

Self respect my man, get it and dump her ass.
She’s keeping you as a “just in case” brother. Don’t wait for her to find your replacement. Cause then she’ll happily break up with you. The tears are manipulative. You seem like a very nice guy and she’s using that to her advantage. 

You’re young so you need to make the transition from “nice guy” to “good person”. See a nice guy ignores his feelings, but you can still be a good person and consider your feelings as well.

When she said she wasn’t in a relationship in front of everyone. You should’ve said: she’s right!! she’s not. And walk off. Whether you leave now or later, it’s still going to hurt. This will not end well. And you guys are 18!!?? The odds of you marrying this girl are slim. 

I’m twice your age and I will tell you 100% of the time if you forgive someone for being disloyal, they’ll do it again. And each time you forgive them-they get better at hiding it. They get sneakier and sneakier. 

So when you break up with her, you can say “now you’re free to snap whoever, whenever you want.” You can still get out of this with your pride and dignity. The last thing you want is another man sending you your girls nudes. Or you FaceTime her one day and a dude picks up and says “your girls busy right now.”
She has moved on.  She just hasn’t told you directly and frankly. You need to move on too.
Yeah she ain’t your girl my guy, but you’re also 18 so plenty of time for you to party and not expect girls that young to be faithful committed women.
Find your balls. She denied your relationship in front of you
Well at least you are not a stupid as my step son who keeps taking back his ex during the holidays so she can get gifts for her and her family.
She’s not your GF. 🤷. She said it herself.  Start looking elsewhere and ghost her
She Cheating my guy. RUN away and break up. Its either that or you are going to get those 2am texts starting with "Babe I love you" and ending with "Text back later lil bro, she's busy", and then Marvins Room in the shower with a gym arc
Cut that bitch off. Don’t worry about her tears. Was she caring about your feelings when she got drunk at a party and flirted with guys in front of you? Stand up for yourself.
This girl will hurt you. 

Get the fuck out while you can before she cheats, if she isn't already
This break up is coming. It's either you'll be first and keep your dignity or she will cheat , break your heart and leave anyway. Just a bit later
Dump her quickly and you be hurt for a couple days then You’ll move on and find happiness.  Or stay with her and be miserable the whole f-ing time and she dates you but openly tries to fuck others
She definitely wants the other dude and is flirting with him. Break it off as soon as possible
You're young and still learning how to navigate life but a simple rule of thumb is when people tell you something about themselves, don't overthink it, believe them. She's not in a relationship, neither are you.
What girlfriend ? … you’re not in a relationship. 🤷‍♂️
Believe her. She isn’t in a relationship.  Let it go and move on.
You're single bud.
Move on bro.
What girlfriend? I heard she wasn’t in a relationship.

Seriously man wtf leave her. Ignoring the obvious dismal of your boundaries with the leg touching shit (personally that’d throw me off but ig others can look past it) 

She wanted to play spin the bottle, with other people?

Like what
She’s telling others she’s not in a relationship to kiss people. Also did she do it?
If she did I have nothing to add cause your shooting yourself in the foot with this.

Just leave her man ignore the cry’s and begging just leave
Embrace being a cockhold
almost seems fake with how weird this is

She's not the one mate, she's not the girl your going to fall in love with cause she's not falling for you

she told you how she feels when she denied being in a relationship with you. Are you even official? you called her your girlfriend but she said she's not in a relationship with you.....then she cries when you break up??

you need someone better who is proud to call you her boyfriend, and she needs therapy or just needs to sleep around w8th a bunch of guys first. either way, she doesn't really want you

If my "girlfriend" told anyone she wasn't my girlfriend, that's the day we're not longer together
break up with her, man. that's disrespectful as hell and you need to put your foot down. she isn't the one.
Nah she said it directly to your face. Believe her.
How about you straight up ask her: “So are you in a relationship, or no?” And see what her answer is. Either way, she then gets to explain why she told a room full of people that she wasn’t. 

You deserve better.
You deserve better
nah bro she aint it, add me and we'll play some games or something to forget about her
She cried because she would be alone, not because she lost you. You're just a placeholder guy until the next one comes along. 

Love yourself and do right for yourself. She doesn't love you. Move on.
Bro you should have just left the moment she said that. Ditched her ass at the party and never spoken to her again. Anyone willing to do that kind of shit is not worth your time. Have some respect for yourself, find an SO who cares about you and shows you respect. Don’t stay in a relationship with someone who’s clearly shopping around for “better” options.
I'm not sure how many more signals you need to miss, OP. What's that old expression again?

"She's just not that into you."

I hate to be so blunt, because you're only 18 and just starting to really experience the world...but dude. Man. Bro. Literally all the signals are being sent and you're not picking up any of them.

If this is how she acts when she has a few, imagine what happens when you're not around and she has them.

Bounce.

End it.

Show yourself that you respect yourself enough to do it. She's not worth the trip to the free clinic to check for STD's, champ. Stay with her, and that day will come. Count on it.
She’ll respect you more if you leave. She disrespects you because you do not actually enforce your own boundaries. If you don’t respect your own boundaries, why should she? Time to pack it up.
Move on and never get near her again. She’s a hoe. I’m sorry this happens to you. My advise: get into sports and focus on that instead of girls lmao. I wish I hadn’t wasted so much time trying to get someone to like me at your age.
That girl's for the streets, grow a pair and move on
You gotta dump her.
OP you sound very kind, but if you stay, that kindness will be used against you, you’re very young and can find someone better in due time.
Time to get the last fck and go OP!
Should be over the moment she said she's not in a relationship to other people.
I think you should leave the relationship.

What she’s doing is very disrespectful, and it will take a toll on your confidence and self esteem if you let her treat you like that
See ya. Let her get a ride to hotel
You stand up, leave, dont look back. Grow a spine.
If your girl ever tells someone she’s not in a relationship when you know she is, then make her statement true.
Leave bro she not worth it.
> From the start I promised her I would stay to the end.    

Dude, you’re 18 and you aren’t married and you don’t have kids. Please think about what that even means.
Bro if she's snapping him like that, they already fugged. If she acting that way, you the man of the MOMENT.
You need to wtf up and get outta there!
Leave her
she told you herself. she's not in a relationship. you might think you are, but clearly she doesn't. if you're into cucking, i'm not going to kinkshame, but if you're not....why are you even bothering to ask for advice?
The best thing you can do for yourself is also the thing that will hurt her the most. 

Block on all contact methods and socials. 

Focus on you. Get jacked (if you’re already fit kick it up) and get moving on your life. Improve and find opportunities. Make money. 

She will notice from afar and will try to get your attention again. Step over her like the small person she is and keep going on your path to righteous Chad status.
If something like this would happen if I was even single, and thought I had feelings for someone, I would get up and walk away. 

Brother, you are in a whole relationship and she clearly seems interested in neither you, nor your feelings, I would just nope out.
This is how the trend goes , your instincts kick in , you ignore them , you see them again and still you ignore them.
When damage is done regret kicks in and it's not going to end well for the mental health.
Imagine what she’s doing when you’re not around. WAYYYY more than that. Leave or regret it later 👍🏼
You agreed to be her driver. You’re responsible for her then. Don’t let your feelings fuck you up on this. She’s drinking too much. Now protect her without being bossy or angry. Don’t let her get taken advantage of by anyone including you. Protect her. Deal with the fallout when you’re both sober Time to be a man and take responsibility for her safety. And tomorrow tell her you were worried about her safety.
If she wants to be not in a relationship let her be not in a relationship.

You should never tolerate that kind of disrespect from someone who's supposed to be committed to you. 

Dick, Something she can get any time she wants with little effort is more important to her than you.

Let that sink in.
damn bro you’re just a side piece of fun
Man.... Read your own post. Get the fuck out of there.
Bang her friends
Break up
I’m 28, and I was once in a situation like this when I was your age. Prolonging the relationship did me no good. The longer you stay in that relationship the more your saying to your self your willing to accept in a relationship. To be clear, what I mean is your saying to yourself a little bit of flirting from my partners with people they know is fine,if you feel like it’s not, it’s not for you. End the relationship for yourself.

The only way you’ll find what you want in a relationship is by finding out what you don’t want.
Smash her best friend “oh sorry I’m confused… I thought you and me were single.. as per the party?”
I guess you see we're you rate in her life.
TLDR: it’s the end and she’s not in a relationship with you.  And it’s the end. 

Longest version ever: Sorry man, your gf is not in a relationship and it the end. Show yourself out.
She’s choking her coworkers chicken on the clock.
Let me guess, you work at a restaurant and the guy co workers are older. Been there, get out before it’s too late.

Edit: also, spin the bottle at 18?  Weird.
Stay to the end? Homie you can’t even rent a car yet. Let her go, use the time you were giving her to work on yourself, _then_ find someone that appreciates and respects you.
She might as well have stood up and announced she is in one but she's down to fuck
My god, you're both 18. It's real simple. You break up, move on, live your life. Live your life!!! Let her live hers. 

In the 27 years that it's been since I was 18 I've had sex partners, girlfriends, relationships, two marriages and I've become a father to children with 2 different women, possibly 3 different women, I'm certain I have kids that I don't know from one night stands where neither of us even really knew each other past first names. I've had sex with somewhere around 54 people in the years I wasn't in committed relationships/marriages. 

My point is, when people tell the truth to others, listen and act accordingly. When you get to an age like me, for example you'll start to understand that things end, relationships end. Mastering the graceful exits and understanding that no one owes you their time and if they want to go, you have to let them go and move on.
You can also try:  explain her exactly how she disrespected you. Explain exactly what you never want to happen again. So she has very clear limits. She needs to make it up to you. And put in effort. For example: Tell her co worker on Snapchat that you are her boyfriend. And that she wants to stop messaging on Snapchat (delete/block him). If she’s willing to do stuff like that, maybe she deserves another chance
Hard pill to swallow but most guys experience situations like that when u are younger. Let it be a life lesson and cut her out of your life. Those girls aren't loyal. 
Go to your doctor and get asked to be prescribed testosterone. At that point you'll be man enough to thank me for calling you a bitch today
Lmao, your not Mr. Right, your Mr. Right now. Leave her ass.
You're not the bf, you're the placeholder
Leave bro. You just a ATM Machine or Uber driver at best at this point.
This is the kind of shit people make posts about when complaining about the sub. It's outright disrespectful if this is even real. Grow some respect for yourself and ghost her. She doesn't even sound like your girl.
She’s not your girlfriend bro. You don’t even have to break up with her, just ghost her. 

Girls like these thrive on the power they get from having guys like you desperately trying to get an ounce of their love and attention from them.

Leave the bitch asap and never, ever look back. She’s going to try and gaslight you into believing you’re overreacting. She’s going to try and manipulate you into staying with her.

Don’t listen. You’re young and these are your golden years but you have a lot to learn, so don’t waste your time on some slut who is OBVIOUSLY already the local neighbourhood’s cum dumpster.
Get rid of her
Send this wench to the dungeon
Time for you to fly.
Run whilst you still can b4 you get her pregnant and have to put up with her bs forever
Hi there, I’m sorry you went through this. It sounds like this is the end for this relationship. You’re young but it sounds like you feel stuck in this relationship, why’s that? You have time to figure out what you want and need in a relationship and learn to communicate that. Take your time and find someone who loves and respects you!
Wow!  If my guy said that to everyone, I would loudly say, “Go for it. He’s single now”. 

And go full Ghost mode.
It’s a hard sell to garner respect from your partner when you show such a clear lack of respect for yourself. She openly disregarded your relationship, to your face in public. Have respect for yourself and move on.
I'd say leave and find you a nice girl
Nah I’ve been in op shoes b4. She flirted right in front of me all the time didn’t think anything of it. I’m a dumbass bc she was fucking dudes behind my back when I was sleeping for work in the morning. She was also way older than me tho lol I was fresh 18 she was 26 ( I’m a dumbass)
You promised her you would stay to the end. 

This is it, the end. You are giving her the security of being with her until she can roll into her next relationshit. 

It won’t hurt for her nearly as much as it will hurt for you, and you will be left kicking yourself for not ending it sooner. 

You said you tried ending it already, and it didn’t work? That’s because she hadn’t found a new person yet, and didn’t want to hurt. 

Not every relationship is meant to last until you die, and you are still VERY young. This is all part of the journey of life, and you will both be just fine.
She’s beautiful right? You’re afraid you’ll never be with someone like her again?

Have some respect for yourself. Stop letting her walk all over you especially in front of other people.

It’ll be tough at first because as much as she cries etc when the breakup happens she’ll probably be with someone a week later. Use this time now to work on yourself instead of being treated like a doormat hoping she’ll change. You’ll be kicking yourself if you stick around and find out she’s been cheating on you all this time.

Work on yourself, get some hobbies and maybe you’ll meet someone who truly respects you and loves you for who you are. You’re only young, you don’t have to feel like you’re too invested in this relationship to get out now.
Idk if she told you but you’re not her bf. You’re her plaything. Respect yourself and get out of that man. You’ve got too much life and potential good times ahead of you.
Not a matter of if, but when she cheats; I mean fuck, she might have already, and she’s at least emotionally cheating. You need better my guy.
OP this isn't good for you. Have the conversation in much the same way you conveyed your feelings above. Don't let histrionucs and tears sway you from communicating how you feel.

With respext to you, you're both young and finding yourselves, it sounds like your girlfriend isn't ready for a long-term relationship and her actions don't put your feelings first.

You're just starting out, don't get weighed down.
If it were me, I would've said "Me neither!" and went to play spin the bottle.

I also would've put some effort into hooking up with a new girl at that party and ditching the ex-girlfriend.

That level of disrespect will make me move on and forget someone quicker than the last piece of gum I spat out.
Leave that b alone and run
She could have elbowed him,.called him by name or really done anything aside from grabbing his leg,
Updateme!
Looks like she's single
I would have stand up and left. Not my girlfriend apparently, so not my problem.
Bruh she doesn’t respect you if she’s openly touching on and flirting with other men. I can tell you from experience that it’s better to break it off with someone who treats you with disrespect than to try to hold onto something toxic. Clearly she’s not committed or loyal to you, so she’s for the streets. Walk away with your dignity man

It will hurt less if you walk away before she goes all the way with someone else. Work on yourself, get ripped in the gym and look for someone who actually respects you.
bros cooked😭praying for ya
Just walk away, she doesn't respect you. Don't wait for her to be the one to dump you
She said she's not in a relationship 

What are we even discussing here

Ghost her
"My girlfriend tells people she's not in a relationship".

Well, she's being honest to _someone_.
So it seems she answered this question very loudly that night—she’s not in a relationship. You have to take that for what it is and move on. Or… keep down this path, break up further down the line, spiral into an emotionally charged psychosis and get hospitalized. Not.. uh… speaking from experience or anything
Respectfully, YOU GOTTA LEAVE THAT BITCH
This girl isn’t even going to matter to you in like 2 years. Just dump her lmao
Id instgate some type of fight with the dude for self defence , then tell the chick were done and chuck all her stuff outside my apartment and cut it off with prejudice. With that kind of disrespect id do everything in my legal right to hurt her or make her life miserable. Contrary to muy name this is terrible advice but its just what id do, if anyone draws blood from me i wont leave anyone without a lost eye lmao. If hes your coworker watch him intently at work and try to find some damning evidence against him, get him fired. If any pussiefied freaks here tell u to let yourself get walked over or to walk away forget it otherwise it will be on ur character for life and youll regret it. society stops u from crime but it has shit in place to legally fuck with peoples lives for one cheating and disrespect is one but there are many other ways so do unto others. Flirt with a chick while shes watching ect ect
Your girlfriend’s actions at the party and her comment about not being in a relationship must have felt hurtful and disrespectful, especially given your concerns about her co-workers.

You deserve to feel secure and respected in your relationship. It’s important to have an honest conversation with her about how her behavior made you feel. If she doesn’t understand or change her actions after that, you may need to reconsider whether this relationship is right for you
Your young find someone that actually cares about you
Don't be a simp.  Keep your honor and walk.  If she acts that way when you're around, imagine how bad it gets when you're not.
Really? Seriously? Wut?
Run, don’t walk , from this one
If she acts like that in front of you, how do you think she acts when you’re not around?
She’s not your gf lol simple as that
Duuuuuude, fucking hell. Of course you need to break it off. You don't deserve to be disrespected like that
She'd have been getting an Uber home as I'd have quietly left at that point and cut all ties.
>My gf proceeds to say “IM NOT” in front of everyone in the room.

Don't make her a liar.
The thing about doormats is they are already on the floor when people walk all over them. 
Do dudes like yall really exist? I get it ignorance is bliss but your gonna ruin your life by continuing to fuck with her, she clearly doesn’t respect you or the relationship and wants to fuck the co-worker, I wouldn’t put it past her if she wants a open relationship. DUMP HER
Does she know she's your gf? Like did you actually have the make it official talk? If not, talk it over. If you did make it official and she's doing this...leave. like she just said, she's single
Put her in the bin.
"You said you are not in a relationship at the party, and you know what? I'm inclined to agree," and leave it at that.
Just leave that bitch
If she's like that when you're there.... lol when you're not.  
She doesn't care about you. She cares if you leave her. You're the "safe" partner until she finds someone she likes more.
I have never been so drunk I forgot I was in a relationship; it's over and you don't know it yet
Bro.. As an older bro, im going to tell you straight. Wtaf are you doing?!? Run for the hills, and don't accept her back.
Her behaviour is absolutely unacceptable. You're worth more
Rule number one: your goal should never be chasing a partner. Rule number two: never chase your partner. If that makes sense. Whatever belongs to you will always come to you naturally.
Dam brutha you're down bad, you needa bounce right out of that sitch if you've got any respect for yourself boss
Move on bro
Clearly she’s not in a relationship
You’re the only one who thinks you’re still in one
its gojover
You are the only person in charge of protecting you.
WAKE UP TO REALITY.

Close the Chapter ASAP.

The longer you are with her, the longer you will keep getting hurt.

The second she said she is not in a relationship, I would have f..in left the party and ofcourse broken up with her.
Are you guys like 16?
She shouldn’t be trusted. That means goodbye relationship.
She’s using you. I would’ve got up and left then and there. Let somebody else date her if she’s able to say she’s not dating you.
Your girlfriend is right. SHE isn’t in a relationship. If you think YOU are, you are sadly delusional
You’re not her BF; you’re her lift to & from the party.
Stop wasting your time with the skank
She's not your girlfriend buddy. Doesn't matter what you think
stop being such a schmuck dude, you are 18. "promised i'd be with her to the end" what do you think that means? til death? you're both going to end up as emotionally stunted freaks if you don't grow, and you cannot grow if you're stuck in an unhealthy relationship. 

break up with her and learn that you deserve to be in a relationship where both people are equally respected and appreciated. you can do it buddy I believe in you
People are telling you to break it off. That’s your choice. Consider for a moment that she straight said she’s not in a relationship. 

Booze doesn’t make people lie about things like that, it just removes the inhibition.

Her mind is that she isn’t in a relationship. Girls like that only want what they can’t have.

To my mind there’s nothing to break off here. 

Just move on to someone better and when she complains about it remind her that she’s the one that said she wasn’t in a relationship.

Don’t break it off, but don’t bother tying yourself down either.
Sounds like you are single.
Go to the doctor. Your testicles may not have descended.
kick her out.

she told it : YOU ARE NOT IN RELATIONSHIP.
Chad from work already smashed that shit and busted balls deep bro. Call it a day and walk.
not your girlfriend bud

that;s our girlfriend
I'd say break up with her, but judging by this, you guys aren't together anyway.
I don't think this girl is for you. You need to set a healthy boundary for yourself and your future relationships. There are videos of people under anesthesia going "I have a partner leave me alone" to their partner, which is both hilarious and endearing, so being drunk does not really excuse this behavior, it makes it worse. She's not forgetting that she's in a relationship when she's drunk, she's forgetting that she cares about it.

There's a chance she did it on purpose to make you jealous, cause girls like to play games, but do you want to play those games?

You could definitely explain to her why you're not happy with her behavior, but I guarantee she won't be sorry and instead will put the fault back on you and try to gaslight you by claiming you're being paranoid or she'll cry to make you feel like an asshole.

If that happens- 99% chance it will - it's time to break up. If it doesn't and she's genuinely sorry, you could give it a chance, provided sue doesn't do it again. Crying instead of apologizing does not count as an apology.
something something toxic masculinity, fragile ego, controlling ect ect
RUN DUDE!!!
You're a doormat. Grow some balls man, she's comfortable enough to disrespect you infront of you because she knows she can get away with it and you will forgive her. You're only 18, we've all been there, bad breakup, some crying and missing her for a while, but it'll pass and you'll meet other great women out there.
Move on my friend there is only heartache and disrespect here, sorry
Hopefully you never stayed a moment longer. Sober driver? Hope she got an uber. Why would you take some girl home who's apparently not in a relationship with you. Get her binned.
Took my girlfriend to a Halloween party with her coworkers one year and the first thing she said when we walked is was “Hey everyone, this is my friend Scott.” I shrugged it off as a mistake because our relationship was new, but other times when we were out dancing, she’d walk over to another group of people and start dancing with them. Disrespected me a couple times after that and I left.
Haha. Nothing to advise you don't already know.
You’re 18. Let her go.
I had an ex that was like that when I was around your age. She totally strung me along and I thought I was being patient and good putting up with her crap and the little crumbs shed throw me at times that kept my stupid young horny ass happy. I should have ditched her and I did notice when I did refuse to play her games she suddenly got a lot more interested but fortunately I had got myself and my life away from her. She emailed a year or so later totally wanting to get with me but was way too late by then. 

Tldr...get rid
She's cheating on you and keeping you on the hook. It's already over as she doesn't care about your feelings or respect you. 

Move onwards and upwards or you'll forever be a doormat and her financial support.
either drop her asap or drop ur feelings of attachment and just spin her around while it last, if she gonna act like a skank then she deserves to be played as one
Kick her dumb ass to the curb brother
Take her on a picnic somewhere far away and act like you forgot something in the car and drive back without her. Her type won't change either, I have the misfortune of having my children with one like that. Leave her while you can, and find someone that actually wants to be with you for you, and not for what they can bleed you dry for.
🎶 *So there I* ***go*** *- o; Can’t make a wife out of a* ***ho*** *- o …*
Dude. Have some god damn self respect and dump her.

Updateme!
For the streets
I would've already left her. Soon as she said she wasn't in a relationship I woulda left the party, blocked her number and social media, and never spoken to her again
Lol fuck that OP have some self respect and dignity. I'd either break it off or start shopping on the side since the relationship is apparently a game to her.
She used and abused you. Played you. I’ve been there before. You don’t realise it until you’re dead in the middle of it. Leave her immediately otherwise it’s only going to get worse.
This is undoubtedly your first relationship. You need to understand, that it’s not your last relationship. At your age you may go thru several serious relationships before you settle down. She’s simply too immature to be in a long term relationship. You probably are too. If you weren’t, this wouldn’t even be a question. She has literally told her friends and work colleagues in front of you that you aren’t dating. That’s not a little slip up. That’s not a drunken mistake. That was a declaration of her independence from you. Treat it that way. You deserve better, move on and find it.
Is this truly a canon event? Somebody gotta tell the devs to patch this bruh
Now you know
You should’ve punched guy coworker in the throat called her a slut then left
It is impressive that you still need an "advice" given what you experienced. Time to wake up and stop being a gullible tool, take that trash out of your life.
At 18, it's crucial to establish boundaries and not allow anyone to treat you with disrespect. Real love is built on respect, not disregard. cut her off immediately, having her longer will affect your self-esteem hugely.
You mean "our" girlfriend.
Are you going to buy her the plan b out of your own money so she doesn't get pregnant by her coworker after the party?
Leave my good man
Smells like you need to take out the trash.
R/amitheex

Jesus dude, have some self respect and drop this woman.
My guy, you know what to do. That is NOT your girl
Sounds like someone’s walking home….
Your over it, you need to just like not be this girls friend even  She is treating you like property. . But your letting her. Stop. People who do that are horrible.
She’s cheating on you. 

She’s been cheating on you for a while. 

She’s so confident that you’re not gonna do anything about that. That she’s willing to do it in front of you. 

She doesn’t respect you or think you’re a man.

If her actions have no consequences then they’ll get worse. 

Leave her.
Get gone
She's young and doesn't know what ahe wants. The age when one becomes an adult is 26.5, not necessarily 18. Let her go "explore". NEXT.
You'll learn yound padawan.. the only way is thru. You'll have more shitty experiences with people like this.

And then you'll find her in a tiktok video in 5-10 years crying her eyes out where are all the good men gone.
Tough spot and then she hooks up with the jerk hmm. Time to spread your wings and fly away! And block 🚫 you don't want to know!
I'm going to tell you as having been that guy coworker many many times in the past. It's time to leave her. You're 18 you have all the time in the world.
Go fuck her friend and say sorry
Definitely say see ya! Her behavior will continue, she can't help herself
Drop her like it's HOTTTT. That girl doesn't respect you AT all, and she's ready to be done with that relationship.
Fuck the title alone is all the reason to go.
Our girlfriend
I immediately broke up with my ex-fiance because she put her hands on another guy in a flirty way. The guy was married too... 

Get out of it and don't look back. Your not hurt, your betrayed. 

Simply find a different, more interesting girl.
Look up Cuckhold.

Then get a new gf.
Grant her wish. Say goodbye.
Oh no no no no no.

Take it from me, y'all are still so young. You do NOT, listen, DO NOT stay with any partner who would belittle you that way and basically humiliated you in front of her COWORKERS.

STOP competing with those AHs. Let them have her, like someone has said 'she's for the streets.'

You deserve SO MUCH better than this, OP.
You're going to look back at this moment and feel bad that you let a girl make you such a bitch. I'm not saying that to be rude, I've been there myself, trust me.

The older you get and the more you have going for you, the more you tell the girls you date to stop acting slutty etc or you're out. It's second nature. Id like to tell you to break up but I doubt you will so at minimum start lifting and get your life together and use the inevitable break up to become a better version of yourself
You set your own standards mate, if you allow her to walk all over you and disrespect you then she will continue to do so. 

I was in an 8 year abusive relationship eventually found the balls the leave her, then the next one came along I had learnt my lesson on what I would tolerate and when she started showing behaviours I didn’t like towards me I left her. Now I’ve met the love of my life who is my best friend. You don’t have to just put up with it
She has no respect for you bro.

Only thing left to do is to keep ur dignity.
Well, time for you to be not in relationships?
Mate if you're going to get any respect it's gonna have to be self-respect.

Bounce her.
Brother, women in that 18-22 bracket aren’t meant to be taken seriously.  She’s not in a relationship, neither are you, go fuck her friends

Don’t buy her tears, they’re just manipulation.  I fell for this at your age, DO NOT fall for it.
You can either cut her loose now or cut the bs and put your foot down regarding behavior that’s not gonna work for you and that can go well beyond just the specifics of your party scenario. Since you would be establishing boundaries that you had no idea needed to be discussed you may as well make things clear across the board seeing as you can’t just assume she is on the same page without going over things together. Just be direct and explain that you want to cover things before there’s an actual problem since you care about both of your well-being and don’t want to be involved in any toxic dynamics or leave anyone feeling hurt because nobody knew any better. 

Tbh she might not be into you establishing boundaries but if that is the case, you can just tell her to take a hike and if she starts crying again, just stick to your guns and explain that you would love to be with her but that is only if you are being treated such that you want her as a partner. There are so many reasons that you her, I’m sure, but if you aren’t being respected or considered as you need to be then the mature thing to do is to just move on. If she sincerely comes around and is able to maintain improved conduct that you can appreciate, that’s great. If not, at least you know what to do then and she will only have herself to blame. I would be keeping an eye on her coworker situation moving forward, at least for a while anyway. Good luck.
Looks like you’re not in a relationship.  Ignore the manipulation by tears.
Look, she is telling you that she wants to be single, in every action that she does. Why not let her be? You need to power through her tears, they are a manipulation tactic.


This is the time in your life to start setting your own boundaries as a man and developing that moral character. Not putting up with shit from women who don't respect you is an important one.
Dude she’s cheating on you RUN
She’s cheating
Its over. She isnt your girlfriend except in your mind, or when she needs something. Find someone loyal
You mean your ex GF right?
If you wan't to have mutual respect in a relationship, you have to call out bullshit immediately. You can't just sit there doing nothing!! A good response would be "I MUST HAVE MISSED OUR BREAK UP THEN" paired with a cold stare.
Young man, the relationship ended as soon as she said that. The only appropriate response was to immediately leave the party, block her forever on every possible outlet, and move on completely. Under no circumstances consider even having a conversation with her, let alone staying in a relationship with her.
The question now is, does she know she is in a relation with you? Cause seems not. She is acting as a completely free person.
It’s that point, or she doesn’t respect you, so.. cut off. Do it for you.
she wants to keep options open. that’s a red flag leave her. you shouldn’t even have to worry about this in a secure relationship
Be a man and leave with your dignity while you can, it's the only way in this situation G
You’re 18. Don’t wast your time with this one, it isn’t worth it.
There's no need for a break up if there's no relationship she acknowledges.
Drunk words are sober thoughts.
She said it herself brother she’s not in a relationship, remove urself from that situation n find someone that loves n respects u. U deserve better, but if u stay with her u deserve what she gives u
Grow a back bone mate. She's acting like this in front of you, how do you think she's acting at work? She's disrespecting you. You're 18, move on, she's not worth it.
End it. She doesn’t respect you. Its only a matter of time before she does something (if she hasn’t already).

Theres two ways of going about it. The moral high ground and the sleezy way of dumping her.
She said she single. So respect those wishes 😉
This girl is cheating on you. Just leave. You’re 18, there’s so much good shit ahead. You will kick yourself a decade from now for not doing it sooner.

Edit: and you know what, fuck one of her friends/sisters if you can. Sounds like she deserves it.
Leave her broski she’s a hoe u deserve better 100% jus knw she’s fucking dat wasteman
you’re really young and you seem like a great boyfriend, sad to say but your kindness will get you screwed over by the wrong girl. you deserve someone who respects you the way you respect others and from what you’ve wrote, I can tell you she’s not it. she’s not serious and shows immature tendencies, even forcing you to go to a party knowing her male coworkers make you feel uncomfortable. if you feel something in your gut, trust it. I know it hurts to break off a relationship but when I was your age, I’m 26 now, I lived with my boyfriend for a year and a half until he cheated on me then it wasn’t just suspicions anymore, it was real and it hurt a lot more if I had just walked away from the other red flags. you deserve someone who loves you and treats you well. hope you make the right decision!
Had 1 you'll never get respect back, because you no longer have trust enough to trust her,& from experience it will end up being your fault because you don't & she'll be righteous to the end. But you've been shown your true value, unless you enjoy abuse, she should be in the rearview.
Bro I’d fuck a another bitch so fast. Tell the bitch/confide in her. Fuck her again 

Then tell my gf on purpose I fell in love with another.

…all Is fair . No love only war!
My friend come here while I give you a a big hug you are a genuine soul my brother and your “gf” is not your girlfriend my dude. Let me tell you now coming from a 30 year old
Who’s had many relationships. Been with mine for 8 years now. She snap chatted one guy 6 times in a day? And she works with him? She sounds emotionally immature too the way she cried when u tried to leg her but then she’s acting like she’s single in front of you? Even sitting down next to lads. Come on man. Haha. You’ll find the right one dude. Big hugs from the u.k.
You are a child with your whole life ahead of you, dump her and move on.
Run.
Yeah, she's not your gf.  Cut off and move on, you deserve better.
She just admitted she's cheating and that it's no big deal.  Dump her
If she's snap chatting her coworker, I wonder who else she's talking to behind your back. If you were doing the same, how would she feel? I think it's time to end this and for you two to go separate ways. I mean if she says she's not in a relationship in front of all her co-workers with you sitting right there, what else is she saying to people? Time to let her go, man. She's not worth the stress.
She’s shopping around for other options. Time to be done OP
Exactly, OP needs to stop making excuses for her shitty behavior, treating him like shit and like a fall back choice. She's not a good partner, stop wasting your time and your sanity. OP you are still very yonge, but time is precious, don't waste it in a bad relationship.
[removed]
Make a scene. You don’t even have to get excited. But yeah she’s getting put in the spot and I would’ve immediately ruined the vibe of the party. F that
And when she drunk is when her subconscious truth comes out
You’re right, thank you
lol break up? Didn’t you hear, he isn’t dating her. Just lose her number OP
There’s not being on the same page, and there’s being a piece of shit. This falls under the second category, assuming that they’ve discussed that they are actually in a relationship that is not considered an open one.
“Not on the same page” is an interesting way of describing an immature and disrespectful young woman
I'd just like to throw out there that you shouldn't bring this as baggage to the next girl you date. 

If you trust the girl, it shouldn't matter if people are hitting on her all the time. It'll happen if she's hot. You should be confident that she won't pay it any attention thus making it a non issue. 

Your current gf is a ho tho. You cant trust her.
Drunk words are sober truths
Exactly - tears are simply emotional manipulation.  Do not give them any credit, she can probably ‘turn them on’ at will.
No text needed for her
this is exactly what you do whenever this situation arises, you just exit and never talk to them again, dont make a big scene or any drama, and dont ignore all these red flags next time, just leave and move on to the next girl thats it
No you don't, you explain her behaviour and how it's made you feel, you get across why it was wromg and then you leave, and sure, don't look back.

Have your say, ghosting someone can leave you feeling like you've not resolved the issue or communicated the problem.
Disagree. When you ghost the other person gets to say “that asshole just ghosted me”, talk shit and make it all your fault. 

Even in the moment you say “we’re not in a relationship? Oh then I guess I’m free to go.” THEN you leave.

Or you text her something after it happens like “I didn’t appreciate when you told X we weren’t in a relationship. So I’m out.”

[Saying it out loud is better than texting, but saying something at all is better than ghosting]

The other advantage of this method is that you don’t have to wonder if they know why you left. You get to say your peace and you’re a mature class act. You get closure and completion (and sometimes an apology or a chance to understand something you didn’t before). I’ve done breakups both ways and I can’t recommend expressing what needs to be said before leaving vs. ghosting highly enough.
>you should just dip out no words at all completely ghost that

If you completely ghost they have self deniability that they were the problem. You find an opportunity to throw it back in their face and then ghost
I agree with you 100 percent . It's so unfortunate some men are scared to be single they get into these strange situationships.
Don’t check. Just treat it as a win. You free.
OP is her safety net until she finds the next one. 

I would put money on her saying people without a BF/GF are losers, which is why OP thinks they are in a relationship. ( unless it’s spin the bottle time of course )

Definitely should have left her to get her own “ride” home after that comment.
For sure
OP needs to listen to some future
I mean tbh that level of drunk is real and they are young, but it doesnt mean that its an excuse either. He needs to get out and just say "you treated me like shit, and im drawing the line here" and hopefully after they break it off she will learn to not be a POS, but honestly, id just break it off and let the next person figure it out the hard way
Yup. Missed opportunity. Although he’s young, I may have been too dumbfounded to say anything at 18. But yeah letting her yap like that gave the sleezy coworkers (likely much older than her and OP) the green light to keep on pursuing her.
He should have responded "well you're not anymore" and walked out.
Bro still stayed until the end, to make sure that the other dude wouldn't fuck her.
Real. 💯
Lol, a few days ago, my daughter used the word bop. I'd never heard it, and she had to translate for me.
dis da way
I disagree. Cut all ties. That can blow up in your face. 
Exactly, she made it very clear she's not his girlfriend.
He might be the side piece 'service cuck' (I'm stealing that btw) already
😂
Absolutely agree. The old saying, sober thoughts become drunk actions.
OP driving her to the store too
OP treated like an option he should show her how many he got👑
She is going to bang someone else as soon as she is able. It's a dead giveaway. 

As it was once put to me by another dude, "Your chicken wants to cluck someone else."
In all fairness they are both 18 , my advice would be to keep your options open just like her , but don’t fool yourself into thinking this is the one because she’s 100% not . Have fun and use protection all the time also 100#
shit, if she's doing that in front of you, she's already shopped around when you're not there.
[removed]
Or you whisper to her, "I'm leaving, we are not in a relationship anymore, " smile and thank the host  and leave. No drama, be cool.
Why get mad over something that's no longer your problem?

Hurts them way more to just act like they're nothing, get your shit and never speak again.
This is the most ridiculous advice and absurd reaction in that situation it makes the person even though they're in the right look unhinged and trashy.

Whoever you are, do not give anyone advice in fact you should be asking for it
Hey another bit of advice. When you break up don't make it a big deal. Just tell her she isn't right for you. She already doesn't respect you. Don't give her the satisfaction of making you feel bad or letting her know you feel bad. She doesn't deserve that from you. Just tell her you aren't vibing or you aren't feeling her vibes and just make her stew in that shit. Then just go on with your life. You're super young and don't need people like that in your life draining your life energy. Good luck!
well he clearly said girlfriend so i assume they're dating or so he thinks lmaoo
*In vino veritas*.
I wish people thought about this more. It’s been said millions of times but everyone ignores it in the moment. Like no mf they’re spitting their truth when they’re drunk, they don’t have enough of a brain to come up with empty lies when they’re drunk that should be obvious (at least for most ppl, there are some drunks that I question why they even drink cause they basically the same person).
“Trust not a woman when she weeps, for it is her nature to weep when she wants her will.”

That's... that's not how emotions work, bud. Crying isn't manipulation. It can be paired with behaviors that turn it into manipulation, but crying on its own is NOT manipulation. Tears are not manipulation.
This is a toxic generalisation; tears are not emotional manipulation, they're an expression of emotions an in a healthy situation are a perfectly acceptable response. Plenty of people cry during any high emotional moment; happy, sad, angry, etc. 
The reason her tears don't matter here is because its likely tears of panic not out of actual care for him. 
But tears are not inherently wrong so don't take that approach; advice like that could poison future happy relationships 🤦🏼‍♀️
Well, she isn't in a relationship...
I’ve done this three times between the ages of 16-23. It’s the only way to handle it. Walk away and never look back.
No scene at all, ghost, block and smile like crazy if you see her again. :)
That would've been the best move for the guy as the designated driver.
Nothing left to say I mean. If she said she isn't in a relationship then everything was a facade basically.
No point even talking to her at all.
I disagree, ghosting someone is sometimes the only way to leave a relationship. Especially when the person is a master manipulater or narcissist who will always talk you In to taking them back
But not before you play spin the bottle.
I’ve been all types of drunk from tipsy to passed out never forgot I was in a relationship
I get the impression that the coworkers reaction indicates they know she's in a relationship and that her statement confirmed she's a dumb bitch... which is amusing and why they smirked.
Exactly, playing with trauma and thinking you can exercise some sort of control/vengeance through sexual activity is silly. Deep down he’d probably still care while she doesn’t give a damn about him, not worth it.
God it's so fucking infuriating when I see stories like these because I always sympathize with whoever is being treated poorly but guys like OP make it so much worse by having no self esteem or backbone to speak of
Shit, he's gonna be driving her to her dick appointments before long
Yeah but she also brought him to the store... if she has friends... 1 of them would LOVE to get her back for something. There is always at least 1... I never once had to feel bad about a hoe GF for more than 2 days, thanks to their friends.
OP need to tell her they're not in a relationship outside of the party either lol
If OP actually had options, do you really think he'd be on here seriously considering just putting up with this?
He should confront his gf friend making a scene depends on her.
I think they’re referring to what OP’s girlfriend said.
What if OP is a stalker and this lady really isn’t his gf
"It appears u/Sanpaku is an educated Redditor. Now I really hate him"
Has any of them come searching for you wondering why you disappeared?
It’s because you’re not a piece of shit. IMO drink can bring out the worst in you, but it acc has to be there to be brought out. This girl is obviously a shitty person who’s hiding it and unfortunately for her, she got too blotto to control her mouth and exposed herself for what she always was. I’ve been in some states and never once have I done something out of character like that
He already is from what it sounds like 😂
Jesus this comment hit me hard. I drove my girlfriend to the airport for a show in another state, picked her up at the airport only to soon learn she spent the entire weekend with another man.. all while she knew my mom was on her death bed, literally. Anyway, I’m embarrassed to say we’re still together 🤦‍♂️
OP just doesn't know he has options. Time for some gym and therapy to shine up that crown.
He's 18 and confused not some unlovable social outcast Jesus dude 🤦🤦
The whole event of the evening to me seems like he was set up and put into a position where he was either going to be made to look like a submissive beta male or an abusive boyfriend that got his ass beat down by her co-worker boytoys. Either way he looses and the whole thing just feels staged and planned for either of those things to happen and one of them did. She made him look weak and nonthreatening in front of her side pieces. That may have given then the green light to take things beyond flirting if it hasn't already.
Nah, he should take the high road & keep his dignity. I went to a concert with a chick I had recently began dating. At the show, she was spending most of the time with her ex. Finally I approached the both of them & said, "look, it looks like yall are having a good time, but it's weird for me. So I'm gonna go do my own thing." Then I went & danced with other girls. Her ex realized she was playing the 2 of us against one another so he parted ways with her too & he & I became friends. & the next day I got the girl back. So always take the high road :)
Confront yes, but not at a party. What do you think will happen if he confronts her, when she is person like this + drunk.
What if he’s dead and just doesn’t know it?
I didn’t say I ghosted. Each knew exactly why.
Unzips…
The OP on r/wallstreetbets?
i know people will encourage you to break up with her. but i think the best revenge is to keep using her and then when you have a come up, just ghost her.
Brother get out how ever awkwardly it mite be right now. Trust me dude same situation with my ex except my grandma. I was also finishing off a house inspection clean while she was out with a dude I later find they were building an apartment together so when he dumped his wife and she dumped me they would live together. Still recovering from the bitch and I got harps out of the whole thing. Been 2 years and still havnt gotten a fuck.
Only thing that helps my mind is she fucked it up with that dude and everyone else since. So I've herd. 
Run bro run
How are you alive
WTF Dude.
Oh snap 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣🤣🤣😳
Dude no!! Stop the madness.
Tell her to hmu

Rip to your mom obviously I don't want to hit her up- very funny people messaging me about that and I apologise. 

What kinda concerts your girl like?
Bro, dump her man. Don’t settle for a cheater, its not worth it.
You should be embarrassed
Seriously? Why are you still with her?
Bro, you need to seriously seek some help and also - grow a spine. That creature is currently sucking your soul dry.
This is it
This is the way.
lol, her friends... In this situation, you always just sleep with one of her friends and move on. It's the best resolution.
This comment alone is a bit of an eye opener....wow. thanks
Why not at the party? He is sober, and the driver. You say, "Oh, you're not dating anyone? Then why the fuck am I here? ✌️"

This dude drove her home ...
He just needs Bruce Willis to help him move on to the afterlife
Yup. Say it straight up and then leave.

"You did this: ...

Bye."
He has to marry her first, and then we can ask his wife's BF for financial advice.
Don’t encourage this, he is right to embarrassed. Not wanting to be rude, but this makes dude a cuck. If girl cheated on you like that during what I’m assuming was one of the worst times of your life? She gonna do it again and again. Please leave her dude.
Yeah read up on the research on mate poaching. That’s what they did is called and the relationships that result tend to be fucked. 

The people that do it aren’t very emotionally healthy usually, and they chase the honeymoon high like that’s real intimacy.

Don’t ever trip over a mate poaching situation, and don’t waste your time with someone that catches feelings for you while they are with someone. You’ll likely find an avoidant if you get sucked into their vortex (they are great at love bombing and usually good in bed, that’s how they get you).
Try for best friend,  if not her sister.  And if you're a real OG Mack, sleep w her mom.
Agreed.
Yup. Let the guys who are railing you otherwise drive you home 💀. You can certainly figure it out if we're not dating lmao
Depends how he plays it. She probably has some reserve of repressed guilt you could use to trick her into lending you a credit card or taking out a car loan for you in her name, something like that. Theenn you ghost her. 

Or you play along at a distance, wasting her time as much as you can until some crisis hits her and she thinks she has the security in place, and that’s when you crush her in as emotionally a brutal way as possible. 

Otherwise though yeah I agree with you
A friend of mine in high school banged his ex girlfriend’s mom. He introduced the ex to another friend of mine and they ended up eventually marrying. He didn’t know the other guy was hitting her mom and one day he says to me. You know I think I could get with hername’s mom she flirts with me a lot and I’m like, oh really… while deep down knowing he definitely could.

He even finger banged her mom right in front of me on the front porch of her house as we were leaving one day.
Wife's ex called in the middle of the night.
So last night my wife f61 and I m61were talking in bed after some spicy activities. And her phone rings it is her ex husband whom she has been divorced from for 38 years. He had her number because his current wife and my wife know each other professionally. They got married about 10 years after the divorce. So my wife says should she answer it we don't but he keeps calling. Thinking something bad had happened to his wife my wife answered put her phone on speaker. The man is drunk off his ass. Starts professing his love for her biggest mistake he ever did was cheating on her. Saying how lucky I am. And more of the same for about 5 minutes before we both told him to go to sleep. Then he starts crying about how he fucked up his life. And on and on till we just hung up. No my wife is not cheating. He lives over a 1000 miles away.
The question is to I contact him soon and tell him to knock it off. First time my wife has spoken to him in 27 years.
Some ideas for a text response to embarrass him would also be liked.
Once in 27 years and he was drunk? I’d just let it go. I’m sure he’s already mortified at himself if he even remembers. 
Sorry but after 38 years of divorce and one drunken phone call, you're asking us for ways to humiliate him further after he already did that to himself? Sorry, but you're kind of acting like this person is stalking you or at the very least constantly calling at weird hours. It's probably a one time thing and I don't think you should kick someone who's clearly already down. Feel sorry for him but ignore it. You can also block his number. But I'd leave it at that. 

People do stupid things sometimes, and no one got hurt apart from him.
Just take the win and forget it.
Let her handle it. If he persists then you step in.
Thats crazy. That guy is 40 years to old to act like that. I dont think you guys need to say anything to him, clearly he screwed up his life and i think that would be enough for me!

I think she should just block his number, block all socials and move on - he doesnt exist.
Don’t stir the shit. Don’t give him any attention. Indifference goes a long way.
>Some ideas for a text response to embarrass him would also be liked.

To what end?
No response is the best response. Block him on everything. Don’t give him the satisfaction of entertaining him, drunk or not.
Maybe show some grace.  


The guy is in a tough spot and you want to pile on?  


He's no threat to you.  What would you like to be done if it were you that made the call?
I wouldn’t, I’d just let her block him and keep it moving. Or she can text him to say “don’t do that again” and block him

Don’t see a need for anything else tbh
Ask your wife to block his number.  If he calls again, don’t answer and don’t respond.
leave the poor dude alone...unless it becomes a pattern.
Let it go…
Just congratulate your wife for the positive karma
Why would you want to embarrass him you said he was drunk meaning he must likely had an issue before hand and may have been drinking as a result then he got really drunk and called your wife no one is themselves when drunk don’t make this a whole ordeal she’s not cheating and it’s the first time he’s called you can ignore it and give it a rest what are you so worried is going to happen if you don’t respond do you think your wife is going to leave you for him? If this sounds rude that is by no means my intention op
A man is allowed to have a moment of weakness and embarrassment.  Forgive him, pity him, move on, and maybe buy the wife some flowers :).  Show her who butters her bread.  

If it continues, then you should start answering the phone.
[removed]
i probably shouldn’t comment what i think
Let that go. Know you won.
Don't embarrass him. What a horrible thing to think. Please try and act with a little kindness. This man is clearly drunk and feeling emotional. You are creating very low vibrations by feeling this. If you want to respond at all, reply with something somewhat boundary setting. But don't embarrass him. What are you gaining from it? I mean this is in the nicest way and just trying to spread a little compassion throughout life
Damn. You can do three things 1. Call him and tell him to leave you alone and move on with his life, then block. 2. Do not respond and block. 3. Tell his wife what he said (very petty but hey, he's a cheater and now he's trying to cheat on his current wife WITH HIS EX LOL). 

Your choice OP. Imo all three are valid. Number Three will lead to a fun update though just saying.
My ex did this, I had to tell him that I would rather pour gas on myself and light me on fire than be with him.
I would just block him.
My wife and I have been together for 25 years, married 20. We have teenage children. Every few years, we still get a drunk phone call from a loser whom she dated for one year in high school professing his love. The only feeling it gives us is pity for him. Just ignore it. He won’t remember calling and it has nothing to do with your lives.
However you decide to word it, include his wife on the distribution list.
Let it slide unless it happens again.
Good grief I’m 46 and too old for this nonsense.
An option:  rise above.  You use her phone. You call him and say you're both worried about him. Is there somebody else you can call for him, to get him some help?
Non-issue.  He got drunk and emotional. It likely means nothing.
As my Dad was beginning to succumb to Alzeimhers, he also reached out to an ex and started a flirting campaign. One of the problems with this disease and dementia is that it impacts one's judgement first. Soon after, it affected his memory, and then his body. And then that was it for him. My Dad was around his age when this happened. 

So as you proceed down this road, i would suggest acting with compassion. There may be more going on than you know.
Call him. Not because your wife is doing anything wrong, but because he showed you zero respect. Call him and tell him to never call your wife again and make sure he acknowledges that he understands that. Feel free to get a little hostile if he doesn't.
Man dudes crazy. I’d avoid it. After all these years he is still this way. I wouldn’t trust him. He could do something crazy. You never know these days.
Since your wife doesn't have any interest, he really isn't a threat to your marriage. He is your wife's baggage, let her take the lead on how to handle it. Just offer to help if needed.
Just ignore him and block the number. There's no need for a response from you.
I'd not do anything. But it's up to your wife to decide how she wants to handle it. Not you.
At 61 does anyone really care?
So what did telling us about you and your wife engaging in ‘spicy activities’ prior to the call add to the story?
I don’t believe a 61 year old would ever talk like this. “Spicy activities” that’s how a stunted 40 year old talks.
If it were me, I’d call him the following day to see if he’s doing ok mentally. It doesn’t sound like he is. Maybe you can push him to get some help. Just be kind & understanding.
Why do you need to embarrass him when he so profoundly already embarrassed himself?

Don’t embarrass him. Pity him.
Next time, you get on the phone. Tell him that you agree with him 100% your wife is a total catch but that your lives and his do not share anything.

Block the number.
I’m an asshole for cheating on you 40 years ago, biggest mistake of my life.
PS ( don’t let my current wife know I want to do the same to her whenever I get drunk)
Hey, she’s not cheating, and YOU got the girl. He can live a life of regret for cheating on her. That’s his problem. Just block him, so should your wife. He’s ancient history. You won. :-)
Same here. Put him on speaker. Husband told him to never call this number again. Blocked him. Don't worry someone will call if they need to get in touch.
Wild.

I'd just let the alcohol fueled drama end with that phone call. 

If there's no reason for remained contact, block the number and let the drama end there. 

No need to advertise the "back off" vibe. Just let it be ended.
I would thank him for fucking up his life. His loss is your gain. My wife and I would have a good laugh about this.
Block him.

Don't be that asshole that piles on to do a metaphorical corpse dance on  a man who cannot hurt you or your wife.
Send him to /r/stopdrinking
Ah. My husband and I have been in similar boats. Just best to let it be. If it keeps happening, block him. I'm sure he already feels like a big heel.
Just leave him alone.  Why kick a man when he's down?  He already humiliated himself.
Sounds like life doesn't hold enough drama juice for this guy. He's desperate to create some. 
It was one time. Let it go. If he calls again, block him.
Two routes you can take. 
Send him back a selfie of her in your arms. Or just block the number and move on.
I’m 34M my wife 30F got married and divorced in her 20s.  We also were having spicy activities once and she got a text from him during that was very similar.  Didn’t come right out and say they should get back together but formed it in a way it was obvious.  

Her reply was ‘did you mean to send this to your wife?’
Dang imagine holding that in for forty years…
Just like the song says.. let it go..
Maybe send the guy the cd...
Just break out the popcorn 🍿, watch the comedy unfold and have a good laugh.
Seems he’s already miserable enough.
Meh. Leave it alone. If he calls again, don't answer and block his number.
Just let it ride dude we've all had those moments
Wow. Funny story, but I'd leave it be. 
We all make these dumb mistakes, sad that happened, especially since he is married again. 

I wouldn't bring it up, but if it happens again, I'd have words with him.
He already hurtin himself, let it go. If it continues then maybe address it
Your wife is a grownass woman; let her deal with it.
I don’t think you have to respond for him to be embarrassed.. why does this upset you? You have the prize.
If he wasn't being mean, best to treat him with compassion.
Should’ve put the phone down and got back to getting spicy with the wife.
If it’s the first time he’s called in 27 years and he’s that upset, I’d let it go.  My god, it’s sad.  He could be suicidal talking like that.  Don’t kick him when he’s down.  Any conversation like that needs to come from your wife, not from you.  This is her history.  It’s 2024, she handles her own relationship issues period.
Sounds like he’s about to be at that lonely rock bottom stage.
I say forget the call even happened and move on. 
Poor guy obviously has some deep regrets and issues he is trying to work through
If this is a completely isolated thing, I wouldn’t do anything.

2nd time, a stern text with a warning about telling his wife and blocking him. Depending on the content, maybe tell the wife anyway.

3rd time?  Block and tell the wife.
I’m glad you all decided to take the high ground because this guy is going to be paying for this in someway shape or form probably for the rest of his life. This is pretty mortifying behavior and he definitely has something deeper going on.
A man would let this go, you won, don't rub it in. 

The fact that he did it is punishment enough.
Eh, as long as it only happened once, I’d let it go.
I can tell a lot of you guys are single and probably never experienced being in a relationship
Alhamdulillah for being Muslim.
Sound like a one-off plus drunk; just let it go unless it happens again.
Nah, just a drunk dial.  I used to know a guy who would drunk dial the White House LOL.  Bro just realizes that YOU won in life.  Take the victory lap.
If this is the only instance, id leave it be. You've already won.
He was feeling sorry himself and was drunk. Let it go. It’s not worth your time but if he does it again, you have a problem, not with your wife, but with him then you need to say something.
First time in 27 yrs your wife has spoken to her ex? And he was drunk off his ass?   
IF he recalls this mortifying experience in the morning, he likely has already embarrassed himself in his own head. He doesn't need your salt poured on his wounds. He already admitted how lucky you are to have the wife he shouldn't've cheated on.   
You're in your 60s. Put yourself in his shoes, and imagine it was you who made the call. Grow up, show some grace, let this one go. This is not a battle to start or try to win. You already won when you married your wife. 

FWIW, in my experience, when I hear from someone so remotely buried in my past, it's usually a serious health crisis that has people going through their address books/phone lists, and reaching out to 'make emotional amends', or right the wrongs they feel they need as closure before it's too late to say anything. He needed liquid courage to make this call. Don't make him feel worse. He may be completely out of the picture in a few months.
 He was drunk, sad, and more than likely thinking too much. It may never happen again. If it does, you can tell him it's not appropriate. Embarrass him, why?
I would actually feel sorry for the guy tbh lol
Dude be a cool man and reach out and just ask if he’s ok
Don't call him in case he embarrassed himself, leave him be.

But ask his wife what's going on.
I'd let it go. He got drunk and stupid. If it continues, you answer when he calls and tell him to knock it off, and hang up.
Something similar happened to me. I must have been 35 or so and we were sitting watching TV when the phone rang. I answered it, and it was a guy I had dated when I was 16. He was drunk, professing his undying love for me and saying that he'd called my Mum and she said I'd got married, so why did I refuse to marry him and  ruin his life. He was also on the other side of the world. Two minutes after I got him off the phone, my Mum called to say she hoped I didn't mind but she'd given x my number but thinking about it she thought she'd better warm me as he might be a bit drunk. 😂 Thankfully hubby didn't feel the need to react and I've never heard from him again. I suspect that if I did see him, he'd pray I didn't remember.
Let it go, You got the girl.
Bruh, I once called an ex-girlfriend I dated in high school drunk because i remembered she had my Nirvana Nevermind tape and I wanted it back. The next day I considered jumping off a bridge. We've all been drunk, we've all been there. Let it go and lol.
Leave it. He was just super drunk and super emotional. I am sure he is embarrassed and you'll never hear from him again.
Simple ignore it, he's drunk and depressed it happens when you get drunk. If it becomes a recurring thing then you need to put your foot down and also inform his current partner
Let. It. Go.
Y'all 60 and he regretting it still? Your wife must've put that thang down, and she still got it if y'all old asses getting spicy 😂😂😂
I hope he heals but I feel your perspective really cuz I think my man got a “I’m so sorry I hurt you” text on insta and he left her on seen it’s a weird feeling but I mean it’s more their issues to solve than yours I hope y’all are happy forever 🩷🤍🫶🏽
Be a gentleman about. Check on him see if he's OK and leave it at that. We're all out here just doing the best we can he was just having a moment.
Leave it alone unless he start harrasing her. The guy is likely a broken down mess. Abit of compassion may go a long way.
Absolutely let it go.
Just block the number and move on. Some phones need a breathalyzer.
have some compassion jesus. show some understanding just block the number and move on like an adult lmao
Dear Lord, you’re 61 & don’t know how to handle this situation!?…..he’s drunk, he’s 1000 miles away, & she hasn’t spoke to him 25+ years……pretty simple.

You just came here to tell everyone you got some, cause that statement was pointless in the whole question.
Stay off Reddit. Don't do anything. He embarrassed himself. Let it go.
Just block him
You don't need to do a thing. He's gonna wake up next day and the shame of drunk-calling somebody he hasn't seen in 27 years is going to hit him like a bulldozer. The cringe and embarrassment is gonna stick with him for awhile lmao.
She needs to tell him, if it happens again, that she is not his therapist or an AA meeting.  

Never tell a anykne they need either, but this is a subtle hint for them to evaluate for themselves.
Why torture the poor sod? He sounds miserable as it is.
Are you 61 or 16 my guy
Leave it alone. Sounds like it was a one time thing. You only need to address it if it continues.
Hopefully the cringe he got when he saw his call log will be deterrent enough.
It reminds me of my dad drunk texting my mom "happy anniversary" on their wedding anniversary..... about 20 years after they got divorced. She and her wife had a good chuckle at that, as I hope you and your wife do too.
If he's felt like that for 27 years, revenge has already been served. Hard and cold. He served it himself.
How do you know they haven’t spoken the last 27 years ._.
There's no need for any of that. He was drunk, it's been literal decades and it was a one off. 

If it continues that's another story, but for a one time thing? His self reflection and embarrassment is his punishment.
I am fascinated by seniors drama
Text his wife too while your at it! Bullet points of his conversation for added effect!
There is nothing you need to do here. It will just waste your own energy. 

Block his number and live your life.
It's been 40 years, block that number and move on.
My dad does this to my mom every time he’s drunk. They divorced 20 years ago. And he still calls her to remind her what an asshole he was back in the day😅
Your wife got drunk dialed from an ex.  She didn’t seem to be in contact with him for decades, didn’t seem to be hiding anything and didn’t seem to be receptive at all to his words.  What advice are you looking for?  This was just a thing that happened.  Move on with your life.
100% tell his wife, fuck it
I would just leave it, if I were you. It was just a drunken mistake. Just don't take the call again, or block the number, if the relationship between your wife and his wife isn't that important. 

I'm sure he is embarssed enough if he realised what he has done. He was crying and regretting his mistakes. I would let it go, since no harm done.
If this is the first time he's done this, a warning shot across the bow might be enough. Something like your wife sending him a text like this:

*"Your late night call the other day was inappropriate and unwelcome. If it happens again, I will be blocking you and providing proof to your wife. And no, I don't want to discuss this."*

If he's done this sort of thing before, then maybe a group text to him and his wife in a similar vein:

*"Your late night call the other day was inappropriate and unwelcome. I'm blocking you. If there is an emergency \[ex's wife\] knows how to get in touch."*

And then block him.
Yikes, talk about a blast from the past.  Yes, perhaps in the light (and sobriety) of the day, he won't need much persuasion to not reach out again.  My guess is he's probably mortified he did that.
Block block block.
After 27 years? Whatever drama is in his life, don’t feed into it.

Just block him and ignore it.
I would just block the number. Then cross the bridge of escalation only if need be should anything continue
I would just let it go unless it happens again.
Pretty sure when he sobers up he will be embarrassed enough.
This literally isn't worth your effort. Giving this any energy at all is just a waste 

This should be dismissed entirely. Just send the following:

*"If you need to call, please be mindful of our time zone and call during normal daytime hours. Hope you have help and support on your end.* 

*Best wishes,*

*xxxxxx"*
My only contribution is that I've recently been prescribed a medication that causes insanely vivid dreams. Mixed wirh alcohol, I can see how I could act out of character.

I would DIE if I somehow drunk dialed my ex at this point in my life, but honestly, please tell my husband. He may need to help me adjust my meds.
I would not, because it would do no good. If this were not a habit and a one 'off' I would let it go. Clearly he is miserable....You are a lucky man, and let that be that. If he does it more than once I would then stand up to him...He sounds like a man with remorse, a drunk man with remorse.
I would do nothing. First time he's ever done this? Let it go and continue not to speak to him for another 27 years. If he does it again, that's when you step in and put a stop to it. Or simply just block him and be done with it.
I would cease all contact with him immediately. He made his choices all those years ago and he is still dealing with the consequences. Clearly you and your wife are very happy and you guys don't owe that man anything. If this sort of thing happens again, reach out to the wife and let her know that you value her friendship but the things that her husband are saying is way too far over the line. It seems like he has learned nothing from those past choices because he just wants to cheat on his new wife with yours!
As fun as it would be to embarrass him, I wouldn’t. Instead just block his number and block him on all social media’s. Don’t do anything that would further invite that sort of dysfunction into your lives.
Honesty, my wife and I would probably just ignore it. If it happens again, then address it.
I always wondered what the other side of the conversation was like in the film Sideways after Miles drunk dialed his ex-wife and hung up.
block number. forget about it.
Ignore it. Don’t engage with him. Just let it go. He was drunk and might be horrified that he made that phone call. 

No action is required, unless he does it again. Then it should be up to your wife to tell him to back off.
Since he was shit-faced he prob doesn't remember. Let it go. Once. If it continues, then take the advice given here & simply block him.
Have your wife block his number. There's no reason for you to reach out him.
He's probably already embarrassed.  Maybe ignoring would be best.
Omg maybe he's going senile. I would laugh my ass off if my ex did that.
A new Billy Strings song is soooo appropriate for this ….. is called “Don’t be calling me (at 4 in the morning)” ….. at least listen to it for a laugh.
If he’s blackout drunk, there’s a very good chance he may not even remember the phone call when he wakes up. In the morning, he might check his call log and go wtf. I’d block him and ignore him for now. If it continues, then reach out to let him know he crossed a line.
My dad was an abusive alcoholic and my mom left him before she was thirty. For the REST OF THEIR LIVES he did this, get drunk and call her to say all the same garbage. She never stopped loving him, and she was single, so she took the calls. Then his wife died and he wanted her to move across the country to be with him, and she wouldn’t do it. Then they both died within two months of each other. I’d just tell him to F off and then block.
I'm not saying the call was ok, or excusing his behavior, but the guy was drunk and possibly depressed or going through something in his own life.

Don't give it more importance than what it has. Blocking the number and leaving that event in the past is enough. 

The guy is probably embarrassed and might not do it ever again.
Your wife needs to be the one to tell him to knocked it off! That's her place!
My first thought (38F) is you reach out to him man to man. If they dont have kids, he is fair game to you. 

Reach out and let him speak for himself in a sober way. Maybe find out his intention there or just acknowledge what he did/said. And then speak your piece, let him know how this won’t be tolerated or keep your regrets to yourself or whatever you feel. 

If they have no kids, it sounds like you can have a chat with him for sure. Just remind him real quick that you’re the head of your household with her and from now on share that regret shit with his therapist or his mom, not YOUR WIFE.
He has repressed regret, he’s depressed, has a shitty marriage, got drunk and was stupid. Now he’s in a shame spiral. End of story.
First time he’s spoken to her in 27yrs? Just let it go. He was most likely having a moment. No harm done, really. Move past it
This sounds like a non-problem. It was annoying, but I don’t think it’s a problem. 

Why would you try to embarrass him? To what end?

Why would you contact him? He didn’t call you. He called your wife. Let her take care of it. She’s an adult.

This is a data point of one. This has happened one time. I’d bet that it never happens again.
You sure you’re in your 60s? You sound like a child
I would let it go. He was drunk. If it's a continued pattern, then you may need to just block hm and let his new wife know. But other than that why would you need to reach out to him?
You should probably take the high road on this one and ignore it. He isnt important enough to warrant a response and you guys shouldnt be spending your time thinking about it, it’s just not worth it.
Some of you are so dramatic. I promise you life will be easier if you don't burn the house down over every little thing. It costs you nothing to just leave it be - if it persists, that's a different matter.
Everyone  has that moment  when booze and there mind.....do thing that they should not do.... but them the next  day you go wtf was i thinking......... i would just let it go.....
it’s great that you both handled it together in the moment might as well ignore or block him, so he won't disturb your peace
Take it as a compliment instead of an offense, and move on. There is no need to waste your energy with this.
How did she know that was his number? She's cheating sir.
Have her block his number. Problem solved.
I wouldn't kick him when he's down, he's clearly v depressed, and you seem to be doing alright and you're with your wife not him.  
Of course if he kept on then I'd say go ahead and do what you need to do, but with this one time thing, I'd say you guys could leave him a message telling him you 'hope he feels better and moves on, however you need to block him as that was inappropriate'. You could also let his wife know, I feel like she should probably know that since someone who's cheated before then professing their love again is a huge red flag.
This one is as simple as treat others the way you would want to be treated. Im sure we have all gotten drunk at least once and made a fool of ourselves. I know I have. I still think about it with embarrassment to this day. 

If this was a regular thing, then you would be correct to call him out. This was a one-off, and I'm sure he is already mortified. Lay it to rest. If it happens again, then you can call him out on it.
I would let it go, it’s been years. Consider yourself lucky to have married such a catch and move on. He already humiliated himself with that call.
Dude called to say goodbye, he's thinking about offing himself.

There's nothing you can do about it. Sad

Leave it alone now, he's in a terrible place and doesn't need encouragement to die.
Dude was drunk and your wife loves you. Laugh at the situation together and let it go. Dude has already embarrassed himself enough. Block his number if you feel that strongly about it.
This is why ppl need to stop cheating. He lost a wonderful woman for selfish gratification outside of his marriage. The grass isn't always greener.

I am glad you know your wifes worth and the love you have for one another.
He's probably horrified about what he has done. Sometimes, the more peaceful choice is to forgive and forget.

If he repeats, though, tell the wife to knock sense into him.
>Some ideas for a text response to embarrass him would also be liked.

Don't be an asshole!

Wife can block/mute him, and unless he escalates this shit just let it go.
hes probably pretty embarrassed already. no need to say anything.
Sometimes when people are drunk they do stupid things. If he never calls again, or offers a sincere apology, then let it go. If he continues, then you need to step in.
How do your wives know each other professionally but yall live 1000 miles away?
He wants to embarass the guy bc he tried stealing his wife???

I agree that you should wait until or if he does it again to embarass him
I think he would be enough embarrassed by himself when he woke up. I would stay polite, if you really need to do so, maybe text him that we can't change past but we can still do good and be better today than we were yesterday, and still have an amazing future. Tell him you wish him the best but to not call again since nobody can change past.
Why do you want to embarrass him??  You sound like a horrible person
You should've gotten the phone and told him not to call anymore.
I'd be focusing my energy on appreciating my wife. Make sure she's being showered with your love and adoration. Clearly, she deserves it. That loser lost her & you wanna remind her why you're the better man.
I don't think there's anything you could say to him that would be worse than what he's probably saying to himself. Let him wallow.
Have been on both sides of the drunken phone call. 
As I’m sure most have. 
He is almost certainly mortified with himself if he realises what he has done already.
As I one off in 40 years, I’d literally just let it go. 
That wound is in no way worth opening up.
Leave him alone, unless you want to help him. He sounds like a guy who could use some help.
Send him some free visits to Betterhelp.
Do nothing. Not worth it.
Just let it go.   Your wife doesn't give a shit about him, the call or talking to him again.   You both understood it to be exactly what it was, a drunken rant by a ex who regrets his actions that cost him a marriage.    If it continues, handle it.  If it was a one time thing and she can go another decade or two without him calling again, you are all set.
First time this has happened? Chalk it up as a single mistake and laugh it off with you wife. Make a joke out of it between the two of you. 

If this happens a bunch then it's time for a conversation but otherwise the ex-husband is probably banging his head against a wall in embarrassment. No need to do or say anything about it.
If he remembers he's going through hell over it. If he doesn't remember he probably won't do it again if he hasn't done such a thing in 27 years. 

She can block him. I'd let it go otherwise. Interesting situation, however.
You can just leave it since it's only a one time thing
Your wife (and you by association) should be flattered and feel for the guy! It's not like it was a bootie call, so why get all up in his face about something that hurts him way more than it hurts you?
Oh Lordy! Well, at least your wife is desired and she is YOURS! Also, banger job for doing it at your ages. My hubs and I are in our 40’s and don’t even do it. Ha.
OP. The less said the better. Any advance on this would be simply inviting further interaction. His life is a car crash. Boo fucking hoo. He’s almost certainly the author of most of it. Maybe I’m being heartless. But why is it that people who have never given a single fuck about anyone else, think that everyone should bend over backwards when it all comes home to roost. 

Sounds very much like he’s been sideswiped by the karma bus. Good luck.
I think he embarrassed himself enough, he is obviously going through something, you definitely have the right say, you got that off your chest, now plz don’t do it again. I know as I got older and thinking of my past , I have reached out, mostly to just be able to say something I needed to, so I can move on and let myself heal from my part in things. But as long as she doesn’t feel the same about him you should be fine. Life is full of surprises and regrets and wants.. most miss what they needed. And end up like this guy calling 20 something years later. Good luck brother.
No, let your wife handle it.  If it persists and he doesn’t get the message, then you step in and take over.
First I’d laugh my a** off. Next I’d give thanks  to the relationship gods for not staying with this person. Lastly I’d ask my spouse what they wanted me to do and do exactly that.
If you'd rather not get another one you could also block him. Clearly he's got some boundary issues.

Perfectly reasonable.
He is probably embarrassed already. Lol. I would let it go. My bet is he will never call again.
I’d let it go. If it’s really an issue for your wife she can block the number he called from.
Don't let this go. You need to cut that shit now. You need to let him know he fucked up and has to live with it and don't call again
Ignore it and block his number.


If it's something serious in future the new wife will call your wife.


Simples
Thinking your wife handled it perfectly and will continue to handle it right. Wouldn't stress it unless she asks you to.
Sounds like something he's gonna regret in a few days. You deserve to get a quip in, but I don't think it's worth escalating past that. The benefit of the doubt was designed for situations like this.
He felt a disturbance in the Force, as if his ex  suddenly cried out in ecstasy and was suddenly silenced.

Ex: "I fear something terrible has happened. Where's my phone?" (Dialing noises.)
Great bit in Sideways about that.  "Did you drink and dial?"
>The question is do I contact him soon and tell him to knock it off

Why would you? Did she ASK you to? Your wife is an adult, a woman in her 60s. Don’t go inserting yourself into situations that are hers to handle UNTIL she either asks for your help specifically or it involves you directly. Currently it does not involve you directly. And it won’t unless he calls or contacts YOU.
Why try to embarrass him. Don’t be a dick. No need to respond. Move on.
yeah, i would let that go. he's clearly got some shit going on up in that brain... i suspect he's more embarrassed than you could ever be angry...
Text him from your phone. Are you good?
I scrolled thru all posts (quickly) and didn't see...

Dude, you're 61 and still having "spicy activities"!!!!!!!!!!   Congrats, u da man & she is the bomb! 👊👊

But a one time incident?  yeah let it go....no harm no foul.....but keep on bangin!
Block his ass.
I think just let it go unless and until it happens again. Him seeing that in his Recent Calls list will be enough of a reminder to him about his bad drunk dial decisions.
Oh god. One of those moments. Yeah feel free to block him. Your wife knows he messed up and luckily she has you. He gets to live with his mistakes. He needs a therapist. Your wife and you need to be all “sorrows… thoughts and prayers!” And…. Blocked.
Memories are hard to forget and, moreover, difficult to dissolve when drunk!
Drink it off, bud
F’k this slug, block him & be done.

*(For sure, tell his (current) wife why you have to block his dumb, drunk ass!)
I would ignore it. However, if he does it again, I would record it, then reach out to his wife, letting her know I'm concerned and show her what he's doing. Maybe she can get him to stop by either getting him some help or consequences.
I won’t say anything.. poor fella already feels like crap
let it go. you’re too old to be worrying about embarrassing him and making shit anymore awkward for your wife
I'd let it go. If it persists then have the wife say something to him. I wouldn't get involved & I wouldn't involve his wife because it may cause conflict with her work
I would message him and tell him that you recorded everything, and if he ever contacts your wife again you will play the recording to HIS wife.
You have the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever. First you need to buy a 5th of cheap whiskey and track down his new wife’s number. You then set an alarm for 2am. You know what to do from there
Just let it go. 

He's embarrassed himself already doing that. 

And not be ageist but 60s is pretty old to be drunk calling an ex like that. 

This shit sad to me. 

And yes, you are a lucky guy 😁
Just pretend it never happened
Oh well. If he keeps bugging her, ask her if she would like to tell him never to do that again or would she lime you to do it. Leave his wife out of it- too much drama. Otherwise let it go
Can we have an update on which advice you chose?, OP? 😊
He was drunk.   I would not call back unless he calls back.    If he does call again, don't pick up and talk to him probably early afternoon when he is not drunk keep the call short ask why he is in a bad spot, and take it from there.   Your wife should not call him back, you should.
A short emotionless text informing him that the call last night was inappropriate and you'll be blocking his number is the biggest, most efficient slap in the face I can think of. It has to be your wife's decision though
I do think you and him need to have a mature conversation about this. Men talk out their problems. If yall don't talk about it now, it'll come out later and be worse. Ask him to buy you a beer or coffee and ask him what's up about it. Let him explain himself.
Just let it go. Your wife isn't going to leave you. Your wife should however contact his wife and let her know about it. She is innocent in all of this and the true victim.
Just block him
Let it go and have your wife suggest to his wife to get him into therapy or some form of mental health treatment.

I know it may seem like a simple drunken call but it could have also been a cry for help.
Let it go!
Grow up
Let it go, Tiger. You and your wife are happy and the dude was drunk. 

It'll likely never happen again.
Let this one go. If it happens again call the guy the next day.
If this is a one time drunk call, then I would just let it pass.
I thought the drunk caller was the pathetic one, and then I read that last line.  OP won't be happy unless he can bully the guy into offing himself...
I really like that the two of you made joint decisions here rather than her just taking the call! Anyway, he's spoken his piece, now his number can be blocked.
Let it go, bud.   You are old enough to know.
I still think of the one that got away regularly and it's still really painful 30 years later, but I know we are both happier without each other. I have sent a few drunken messages over the years on Facebook and never received a reply, but i do feel some comfort just getting it off your chest from time to time. I'm not sure if she has ever read them but again it doesn't really matter.
The man is miserable and doesn't need your help to feel terrible evidently.  Let it go
Don’t let him live rent-free in your heads. It’s a nice reminder to your wife that she’s in the right place. Block his number and forget he exists.
Let it go
Let it go and block him. My issue with this is that you both listened for 5 minutes?! Were you asking him if he was safe, or just listening?
I would say for it just being one time in 38 years to just let it go.
She must be a keeper! If he’s not got over her in decades? 😂
Let it go lmao buncha old mfers getting butthurt this is wild. I’m sure he knows he fucked up.
First off.. call my wife’s phone in the middle of the night you’re just gunna hear me pick up aggravated as fuck with “somebody better have died bro”. And he woulda had to tell me all that shit and I would enjoyed everybit of it 🤣🤣 then replied with a simple “so what you saying bruh” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's a one time thing across four decades. I wouldn't stress it too much. If he continues to call put a stop to it.
Meh, I’d give it a chuckle and pat yourself on the back for having to deal with this comedy in your 60’s….also, good work being 61 and still spicy!
Block the number and you're done.
Be the bigger man and just ignore him.  Ask your wife to block the number.
Leave it be
Late life crisis. I wouldn’t worry too
Much. But if it came to it, can you take him? I’m
Guessing so since he cried on the phone…. And also you were just finishing from smashing so in my eyes you’re the fucking man and kind of my idol. If it happens again send him a selfie of
You and your obviously awesome fucking wife just wrapping up the deeds and say “new phone who dis” he won’t ever call again.
“Do you remember calling US  and talking on speaker to my wife & I last night? 

Him: Yes/No

OK, I’m sorry you feel you’ve messed up your life, I agree my wife is amazing. I will have to politely ask that you refrain from calling US again while intoxicated.
Thank you & good bye” 

Drop it & move on HAPPILY
Why would you even invest time in this?
If you feel the need to have a talk with him then do it honestly. He was drunk off his ass and clearly was having some kind of episode or breakdown. He probably regrets it as well.
  I would personally take the number and send a text from my own phone “Hi ex, current hubby here. I just want to clarify that your late night contact is not okay and can not happen again. I understand mistakes happen and wish you the best of luck moving forward.” 
  You get revenge by being a good man, worthy of what you have.
That's definitely a situation that would leave anyone feeling thrown off, especially after such a long time with no contact!
Just let it pass, I think he just playing around. nothing serious on that or maybe he's crazyyy
It happens.  She loves you now.
Dudes in a bad place. He's already miserable, drank too much and got nostalgic thinking of a better time in his life and about what could have been. It happens. Was it the best thing to do? Of course not. But it's just how humans are. Be empathetic and let it go. No need to kick someone when he's already down. Tbh I think you wanting to humiliate him even further is far worse than him getting emotional and making a harmless phone call out of desperation and under the influence.
"We talked for 2 hours" I'm like me and you talked? Are you sure that  was me? I said I wanted to marry you? Wtf yeah I guess I was drunk lol my bad, disregard everything I said lol
Out of respect for my wife and your current situation, please let’s keep things in the past.
Have a respectful and calm Man to Man talk over the phone.   End it with I appreciate your consideration for my marriage and know you will act more appropriately in the future.
Your wife and him may be having an affair. You don’t know for certain that they aren’t. I’d try and see her phone without her knowing just to double check.
This could be a good way to set boundaries without escalating things, making it clear that there's no need to revisit the past while keeping the tone civil.
A one off drunk call in 38 years. I’d let it slide if it ends there.
Give him a pass....just this once, though.
I’d let it go unless he does it again
Let it go dude, don't be a dick.
Be the bigger person and let it go.
Yes, call him and assert dominance. It’s probably unnecessary, but it will be good for you psychologically and emotionally. In fact I would ridicule the call as pathetic and tell him that you and your wife had quite the laugh. He will NEVER do it again.
Leave it alone. It happens. Once in 27 years.
There were no cell phones 27 years ago …how did he have her number ?
You’re better off talking to your wife and asking how she feels and if she is ok after hearing from him. 
Then give him a call calmly reminding him that the past is in the past and you did not appreciate his call and not to do it again.
- If he’s an ass, put him in his place
- if he apologetic, take the W and let it go.
If you and your wife are both good to move forward and put it behind you, then do so.
Cheers and good luck.
I did this with my ex and was super embarrassed with myself when I sobered up
First time in 27 years I honestly would just ignore it if your wifes good with it. Besides, with any luck his wife heard him and he's already in shit lol
If it's once call it an isolated incident. Twice means it's time to get go nuclear.
28m here with some advice....Once in 27yrs? I'd let it go and block his number. As to someone who has also now been sober going on 5yrs, I'll tell you, I CAN'T COUNT how many times I used to call people when drunk and DONT EVEN REMEMBER calling nor the conversation the next morning. Not to mention the amount of anxiety that came afterwards. Did I do something wrong ? Was I an ass? Did I accidentally embarrass myself? Like THE ANXIETY it would cause is embarrassing in itself😳😳

Like if my ex fiance from 7yrs ago called me today, I'd blow it off and do exactly what I'm telling you. You're blowing this out of proportion.
First time she told she has spoken to him...are you sure? If you are sure then maybe it would be best to call his current wife and let her know and see if she can best handle the situation and block his number.
My ex’s ex did this every 5-6 years or so long after we moved away.  He was a drunk, too.  I guess it’s a thing.
Just putting this out there. This could be a cry for help call.  I’d avoid any further humiliation and perhaps try calling back at a time he’s likely to be sober, make sure he’s ok.

Do be clear that further calls of that sort are not welcome though.
Nice job on the wife! You do sound lucky! The guy is regretting fumbling the bag 38yrs later
I would just laugh it off and have a new inside joke with my spouse. Not worth letting it drag on for no reason
Bro this might have been me 😂 was it last Friday lmao
I’d move on and forget it. Now if he sobered up and then kept calling it would be an issue.
Just block his number
Ignore him, he will surely not remember and will end up denying everything. And trust your partner.
Once in 27 years? Let it be, it isn’t worth the time nor minimal effort to respond. The guy is having a rough time and no need to embarrass him in a once off call. Be the bigger man

If you must act, just block the number
In yalls 60’s and still with the petty insecurity feelings ? I mean damn has it been a rough ride this whole time ?
I do despise a crying drunk. They think they can cry for you and get a reprieve for all the bad things they did in the relationship!!!
You know what, how about just call him up and say hey man do you need to talk. Or just let it go and have her block his number
Just forget it
Why the heck would you be so cruel as to kick him when he was drunk off his face???

He obviously wasn’t in his right mind and the guy sounds wrecked and regrets everything he did.

It should fill you with absolute security that he professed his love to her and she brushed it off.

That shouldn’t inspire you to give him
More reasons to drink himself to death.
Let his wife explain the problematic nature of his phone call.
Let her deal with it. Sounds like he's a very sad fellow.
No, just move on.
Nah just leave it. He is already embarrassed and your wife won with a better man. It makes me feel better because all these cheaters and liars always come back when life doesn't work out. Karma is real.
I’d leave it alone unless he called again
He's definitely going to be so embarrassed once he realizes what he did, that you might never hear from him again. You trust your wife, so I'd let it go. Rest well knowing you are living better than he is.
YEESH.  What a twit! 
"We know it's Halloween but are still horrified over your whacko wacko nutball phone call."

My ex of 12 years got busted and called me from jail wanting me to bail him out. It was a 40k CASH bond and he knows I don't have that kind of money in the first place. He suggested I put up my house and he'd pay me back. 

Ever been in one of those states where your response would be "hell to the fuck no,  eat shit and die" but you couldn't because you were so stunned that this was happening in the first place?

He said to think about it and call him back. He probably thinks I am still thinking about it 8 years later.

Oh - and I divorced him over domestic violence. The reason he was in jail was for stalking another woman. 
lol oh come on you guys are in your 60’s, he was just drunk… I’m sure he feels a million times worse for it the next morning without you calling to give him an ear full… Now if he starts doing it once a week then yeah tell him something
Block the number and leave it. Not worth the hassle and he’s done it as a one off when pissed up.
I agree with most of what people are saying. But why does your wife have HIS number?!

I get her having his wife's, but you said she said "I should answer or he will keep calling"

So it was HIS number, not her coworkers. Why does she have it?
Depends. How much money/assets do you have? If it is millions, can you convince your wife to leave it all to be with her true love? Yea, your wife leaves, but you make bank.
Your a grown ass man  if you  feel like he will come all that way just to see her let him know you will fuck him ip personally if not just leave it alone...
Y’all could always throw down, though you’ll probably both throw your hips and back out. It’s nice to get a little aggression out every now and again!
Don't dial drunk!
Don't ever ever drunk dial, don't care who you are.
Tell him that your fine with him randomly calling, its understandable, but your wife's boyfriend is crazy af and didnt take a liken to it one bit.
I had this problem with an ex. I changed my phone number. Short term inconvenience but Its a solution.
Nothing burger
block his phone number. if his wife needs to talk to your wife his wife can call your wife. And i would send him an email and tell him to leave your wife alone. This happens but it is BS.
Sounds like he confessed his mistake with liquid courage. Why beat him down unless you are jealous? He sounds pitiful. He hasn't done anything bad towards you, so show some mercy. It will pay back to you later.
You won, grow up
Leave it alone. The guy was trashed and obviously having a tough time. If it happens again say something.
Your wife should have no problem with blocking him, this is her drama scenario. She needs to make it clear to him, the next call will be recorded, and sent to your wife, if he attacks or threatens your wife, then that’s his torso, ripped apart lol 😇👍🏽
Set boundaries.
You could tell him to cut it out, but he probably won't remember calling.
Lost me at 61 & “spicy activities”
Let it go bro. Ain’t even worth the drama. If it happens again, maybe a conversation needs to be had, but this ain’t worth your time.
Block his number.
He got hammered and called his ex and made an ass of himself. Probably a one time thing but if it bothers you both she should just block. Contacting him or trying to embarrass him is doing too much. Shit happens. Don’t make it a big thing unless he continues to be weird.
Let it go.  If he does it again record it with your phone and then send it to his current wife.
Let it go.  If he does it again record it with your phone and then send it to his current wife.
Harry dubois…
I can only imagine the nightmare the ex-husband would have seeing his phone the next morning hahaha
He probably doesn’t even remember
Just let it go my man. He probably has done the damage to himself.
wow, that’s a lot to handle in one call. props to you both for keeping it cool during his drunk confession. honestly, a text from you might just end up adding fuel to his late-night drama, so it might be better to let it lie unless he pulls something like this again. he’ll probably wake up with a massive hangover *and* a hefty dose of embarrassment without you needing to say anything.

but if he does keep bothering her, you could go with a short, straightforward text like, "hey \[ex's name\], last night’s call was a bit much. let’s keep the past in the past and let everyone live in peace." no need to roast him—just a nudge to stay in his lane should do the trick.
If it becomes a problem bring it up though I’m sure he’s having issues with having made the call
I wouldn't see an issue but I would let his current partner know
Honestly 1 drunk call in 27 years? That's pretty okay stats. Guy got to drunk but if he does it again contact his current wife to tell him to knock it off.
Dont humiliate him. Just Let it go.
That feeling of waking up hungover/confused and looking at your call list... 😬

Then, seeing the call time duration... 😳
This is the path we are taking.
Similar thing happened with my mom and her ex BIL. He had been divorced from my aunt for over 30 years, then randomly called my mom professing his drunken love for her. My mom and I still laugh about it to this day.
Yeah, this is a definite let it go moment.  Whatever promoted that call had very little to do with your wife.  Saying anything would only bring you into the drama.
This. Don’t see the need to shame him
This.   I have done dumb things while drunk that I cringe at and I’m not really one of those guys that do dumb things while drunk because I’m usually a stay at home kinda guy.   Asked a female friend for naked pictures and then asked her out. Like, I’m not even interested in her like that. And I’ve only ever asked for naked pictures from girlfriends. So that was weird. But, in my defense, that’s one of my top three closest to blacked out drinking times ever. 
My dad's ex did the same. He was a poor farm boy. Married this girl at 18. She was caught by my grandma fucking a guy in the grocery store parking lot a year later. 

She ended up in a trailer park. My dad hit it big. She called when he was about 50 and asked him "where do you think we would be now" and he responded "not sure, either at the lake house, the Florida house, or the mountain house, probably one of those three..."

No idea if it's true but that's what he said and he ain't a liar.
Agreed! It sounds like he was really drunk and was just reflecting on his life. If it becomes a regular occurrence, I would block his number and if that doesn't work, have it out with him.
This is the way
Yeah, I’m with you. OP needs to grow up. “Ideas for a text response to embarrass him,” is this dude in middle school? If at 61 you haven’t come up with some of your own material to embarrass people, you should at least learn to keep silent.
Yeah, and that’s just fuckin sad. No need to add to it. Unless he makes a habit of it.
Thank for this comment it really hit the nail on head.  I’m sure he’s in enough agony if he even realized what he did.
Mortified? Doubtful. The only thing this guy would/should be mortified about is the disrespectful trash he was spewing getting back to his wife.
He may not even remember that he did it if he was drunk enough. Definitely let it go until it happens again.
I couldn't agree more, wish this was top comment.  Glad to see some folks still have a modicum of class.
It makes me feel better that there are nice people with some class whose first instinct is to give grace to people who need it. I hope you get back the joy you're putting into the world three times, /u/bowlinggr33n
I was genuinely concerned that I was having wrong thoughts since this wasn't OPs idea.

Like, the dude is obviously hurting, if anything I'd ask if we should or could help support him in moving on.
Yep I was going through a rough time and called my first love saying all kinds of things I wouldn't sober. Things happen and when at that stage of drinking just have all kinds of emotions then act on it without thinking things through. Just let it go bro unless it becomes repetitive
> People do stupid things sometimes, and no one got hurt apart from him. 

I agree with your post, but somewhat disagree that it was stupid. Dude clearly wanted to get it off his chest after all of these years.

Doesn't sound like he was being disrespectful in any way towards OP or their marriage. Dude was just low and needed to finally make his peace. This stuff acts like poison when you pretend you're not feeling it and saying it out loud is exactly what any therapist would tell you to do.

OP I get why you're a tad annoyed but as others are saying, let this one go, and think of it as contributing to someone else's healing process.
if i was the current husband, i would call the ex to ask if he was ok. we can be bro's and offer help when a bro is down. maybe you will save his life.
And only if she wants him to step in.
Yeah, not enough commenters here who picked up on the fact that this was a call for *her* on *her* number, to talk to *her*, from *her* ex husband. None of OP’s business, any of it. OP’s wife is also in her sixties, I am pretty sure she knows how to set boundaries without needing OP’s assistance, especially since she knows her own ex husband way better than OP does, so she knows how to handle him. This is between two people, not three. And if things got out of hand to the extent she would not be able to handle them on her own, police/court intervention is better adapted than OP doing probably nothing productive with this.
Drunk dial is a drunk dial no matter your age.
When people get old, they revert to childhood. Especially once they’re retired. 

This is literally a 60 year old man acting like a pre-teen. Yes, you fucked up and ruined your marriage. Crying about it isn’t going to make anything better, move on. 
One thing I learned from my elderly parents: high school is never over.
They’ve been divorced for almost 40 years, he’s likely at least 60 years old
I'm glad I'm not the only one who rolled his eyes at that. This completely shifted my interest in this dude's situation to just feeling sorry for his wife on multiple levels.
This. Just block his number and communicate through email only
^^^ This is the way.  Block, block, block.
This is it. Don't engage.

*Don't give it air.* Just end it. You gain nothing by giving it air. If anything it might weirdly motivate him, because it was some kind of response. 

Only thing I might consider is telling his wife, but -- look, he's miserable, and apparently in a miserable marriage, and it's been 27 flippin years. Let them figure their own shit out. It's not your circus, and you potentially make things messier for everyone (including them) if you decide to get involved. Leave their drama out of your life.
Just had a long conversation with my drunk stepfather who professed that he was still in love with my mother 14 years after divorce. 

He gave me some good advice on fighting for the relationship if I’m being honest.
Tell his wife then cut him off.
If my partner did some shit like this, I'd wanna know. Who wants to be with someone who's like that.  "But he was drunk and it was a mistake!" I hear you, but if this was, "Drunk man makes a mistake and beats his wife" everyone would be raising pitchforks. You're responsible for your actions when you're drunk so id understand whatever direction you want.
But how do you REALLY feel?
I can’t believe I had to scroll this far down to find this comment! Have a little compassion. Although, OP saying “spicy activities” immediately gave me the ick and so I wasn’t a fan from the off 😂
This is the point many people seem to be missing. And it’s a big one.
For real. 

I hope I’m not as petty at 61 as OP. 

To seek out *more* drama at that age is sad.
I mean..its hilarious. He cheated on his ex wife and is now trying to cheat on his current wife with his ex. It's pathetic loser shit. Funny as hell. He should be embarrassed 😂 also i feel bad for his current wife, too. Can you imagine?
Seriously, they're 61 and trying to ask how to best start pointless shit. Move on, nothing is more embarrassing than just being ignored anyway
People have spicy activities into their 80. 62 is nothing
Been there, done that. This is why I don't drink.
Can't even look at your text messages until late the next evening when the anxiety goes down a bit
Oh my God it's terrible. But the worst part is not knowing a damn thing that was said. Was i a dick? Did I break and cry? Yeah I don't miss drinking at all lol
The hangxiety is off the charts as you vaguely remember calling your ex… 🤢truly one of the worst feelings ever.
In AA, they call it, “Waking up with the Four Horsemen…Terror, Bewilderment, Frustration, and Despair…”

Met them MANY more mornings than I want to count…
1987, I was 18 in my first apartment. Had a few drinks by the pool, older neighbor guy asked if I wanted to smoke some pit with him in his apartment - of course I do. 

After a bit he grabs his telephone and tells me it’s time to go. I go. 

Next day he stops me in the sidewalk, “hey, when left my place last night, I wasn’t getting on the phone was I?”

“Um yeah”

“Awe fuck, my long distance bill is going to kill me”

Don’t know who he was calling or what he was saying, but I made a mental note - what not to do.
Exact reason why I let my phone battery die before I get drunk... by the time it charges I'm waking up with a hangover and not mortified with all of the texts I receive back from my exs telling me how much they hate me.
I dread this.
Did this two weeks ago. At least I didn't call anyone, but my drunk ass made a bunch of appointments with people and I had to scour my texts for dates so I could put them in my calendar.
I learned a phrase for this from a friend in Dublin - “the Fear” as in “there is nothing worse than waking up in the grip of the Fear”.  
You know you’ve fucked up badly, and even if there is way out, you’re in no condition to conjure it in that moment.
Before the age of Ubers I once called my boss at 2am while hammered asking for a ride. Her name was Cathy and I had a contact in my phone called Cab that had the numbers of every cab company in my area. The call lasted 12 min and when I spoke to her the next day asking what I said she cracked up hysterically and told me that she told me she was on vacation and couldn't pick me up and my response was always "but you're a cab how come you can't pick me up?" On repeat lol. Thankfully she was cool and we just laughed about it. She told me she was happy I was trying to call a cab and insistent upon a ride home lol
Next time I “miss drinking” I’ll come read this comment
Absolute worst lol
Call time duration is the real kicker in this situation  😬
The only thing that could redeem that feeling of waking up hung over to find out you left a 15 minute voicemail on your ex’s phone is the sweet sweet relief to realize you had the wrong number entered
1,000 miles away means a different time zone, so if he’s shit faced drunk and hasn’t made contact since the Clinton or Bush Administration, I would just ignore it be flattered you won the prize.

Some of the keyboard warriors on Reddit might suggest you buy a plane ticket, rent a car, look him up and have a beat down that goes viral. But you can smile and know that your prize answered expecting the news of a death in his family. 

Just be amused and enjoy your life.
Obviously say something if it keeps up, but a one time occurrence should be ignored.
Put your self in his shoes. You didn't mean to but you heard his soul on the phone. Would you want to talk to you in this situation after that? Give him one single time a pass. Everyone deserves one time to do something like this. Doesn't mean you have to like it, I wouldn't for fuck sure. But as a dude let him have the one time. Now if he even thinks of trying it again? That's when you unleash on him, maybe even harder than you initially even would have because you gave him a pass and now he has violated your choosing to be cool in all this.
Yea poor guy may just have drank a bit too much. If he calls back sober pretend it didn't happen and go on.

If it continues then it could be a problem.
Best path here! If it happens again then it’s an issue, discuss with your partner how you will both handle it from there.

Until then, enjoy the massive ego boost!
I mean..its hilarious. He cheated on his ex wife and is now trying to cheat on his current wife with his ex. It's pathetic loser shit. Funny as hell. He should be embarrassed 😂 also i feel bad for his current wife, too. Can you imagine?
I mean my worst things I do while drunk are usually tanking my halo 3 team on team slayer. I either do really good while drunk or really bad. 
Top comment says roughly the same, at least as of now. The good news is at least OP knew to ask for advice instead of being a dick immediately without thinking about it
This has been the most unexpectedly wholesome thread I've seen in months. I guess I'm just so used to the revenge type responses that these mature, thoughtful responses caught me off guard and made me so happy. I was gonna suggest pretty much the same as a lot of others, but it's been covered. I'm just glad I clicked and read the top few comment chains.
That's how I expected the post to end ... "How can we help the poor guy?"
I agree up to the help him move on… it’s already been 27 years!!  Haha. This is called a mid-life crisis.
Yes, I agree absolutely. The "stupid" was more from his own perspective because I suspect he will regret his action. Couldn't agree more about him being nothing but respectful. I don't understand why some people get so worked up about someone who pours his heart out after 40 years and act as though he's harassing his ex. It was one phone call. And he waited 40 years. Even said to the current husband, you're a lucky guy. It's best if everyone just moves on, in stead of stirring the pot further.
Honestly love this response 
Just want to shout out and acknowledge you for this advice and perspective. Much respect to you.
This! Unless it happens again the only non-AH options are to pretend the call never happened or for OP to call the ex and gently ask "is everything okay?"
If she asks him to step in.
>None of OP’s business

What? Are you serious? How is an ex professing their love for your partner none of your business? It absolutely is! Why do you think she put it on speaker? It's because it was an inappropriate call at an inappropriate time. Of course it was his business. 

That's his wife. Not some chick he's FWB with.
Dude, what are you smoking? Someone calls my wife in the middle of the night expressing his love for her drunk or not that's a huge no no, being the husband of said wife, it is most definitely his business. Its disrupting his life as well as hers. Let someone call your spouse like that and see if you don't react.
60 or 12..  There are still emotions.  Sorry we aren't as strong as you
62 years old they were married for ten months.
I was kind of side eyeing the need to tell us he banged his wife. That could've been left out for the purpose of the story.
Yup.
What was his advice?
My stepfather did the same!  After divorcing my mom, calls me to see how she's doing and wah wah wah... he was engaged to someone else by the time the divorce was final!!!  Fuck right off man
This is the only answer. And it’s the new husband’s job to do it. Because the new wife will not believe the ex wife.
I know, lol.
It really is pathetic serial cheater behaviour
I couldn't agree more. If I didn't know better from the details in this story, I'd think that I was reading about some recent breakup between two 21-year olds and drama with a new boyfriend.

Come on. People in their 60's should be amused about these things, with a hint of compassion or sadness for other people in that same age bracket who clearly haven't found a way to be happy.
It's like living through the worst fucking detective story, where you are the perp and the P.I. but don't know what you've done and you're hoping against hope that you just blacked out and went to bed and your wife is a fucking G so she just waits for you to find the piss in the hamper and smell the smoke from the charred chicken nuggets you tried to bake at 4am. 

God I'm glad I quit drinking.
Ditto worse feeling ever
Me too
This is why I don’t call people while drinking
That’s why I don’t play on the phone when I drink.
I was more into drunk texting.  Quit drinking 8 months ago... turns out, I'm just an asshole who texts late at night.
I have never done this when stoned. Why I ditched booze for pot.
This is exactly why I quit drinking. I would become a hermit for two days with anxiety thinking about the dumb shit I did while hammered. 

I just passed 4 years sober from booze. Weed makes me hate myself so I got off that 12 years ago. Now I’m just a workaholic.
Or Reddit comments =S.
I usually just delete them before I go to sleep. If I don't see it, it never happened.
I’ll never understand why people even get the urge to bust out their phones drunk. I’ve never once felt the urge to blow up my life with my cellphone while plastered and I was a 2, 40oz of malt liquor per night kinda alcoholic.
Dude, most embarrassing shit ever. I'm at the point now where I'm both more mature, and have the wherewithal to stop myself from drunk texting. Even if I think it's an apt and we'll written text, I'll just take a sec then delete it because I know I'm drunk and it will seem way different the next day. I've never drunk called though, except with my then gf because she was fucking psychotic and blaming me for stuff I didn't do.
Saint Patrick’s day 2011 I was in my early 20’s and blacked out. I contacted every woman I had access to. “Hey 6th grade girlfriend, you should come have a drink “
That's the worst! I had a habit of sober avoidance and would revisit when I was drunk again. The cycle just repeated. 

Idk if it was getting sober or healthy for you, but I am genuinely happy for you! I was dry for 2 years and need to get back to that.
"Vaguely"
I used to leave my phone at work if I know I would be drinking. "1 is too many, but 100 is not enough"
That's the other downfall! I either drunk dial/text, or suddenly become this super outgoing person who makes plans with everyone. 

Then I wake up the next morning knowing I'm cancelling with everyone.
I've seen it referred to as 'hangxiety'
This has been the best response to my comment!  I'm glad you were trying to call a cab and I love that your boss picked up on that
Why was OP’s first instinct so mean? To further embarrass a guy who’s down and out?
Why? He’s a 1000miles away, just block his number and be done with it.

When an ex comes crawling out from under a rock, always take the path of least engagement. Engaging only encourages them more. 
If he does it a second time he clearly has a drinking problem. He's zero threat to OP's relationship. I think I would have more compassion, but I'm an alcoholic
I so agree with this. Almost 3 decades in the making, sometimes some things in life need to be addressed once before we’re all inevitably gone. The man clearly has held this close to his chest for decades, I do think a one time thing should be allowed to slide & ignored.
And he had to go clean decades. He probably went down a lift of every woman he’s been with for longer than a week in every year of his life and finally got down the list to OP’s wife. That is a long list.
I mean OP is 61 and refers to sex as “spicy activities.” Anything is possible
I feel the same way. My first response to any sort of conflict is to have as little confrontation as possible. I give a lot of people the benefit of the doubt. And whenever I respond to certain threads with what I consider a passive and/or diplomatic approach, I get downvoted. But seeing that a lot of people are on the same page as me gives me some hope.
Yes, more precisely.
What an ex says to their ex is no one else’s business. How the ex feels about what their ex tells them is no one else’s business. How the ex responds to what their ex told them is no one else’s business. It becomes other people’s business when her response has implications for other people. What are the implications of a drunk ex calling in the middle of the night beyond waking them in the middle of the night? When she cheats, when she uses her ex to get her husband jealous, or when she disengages from her current marriage because of the ex husband, *then* it will be OP’s business.

I am apparently attractive. If every time a guy expresses interest in me my partner felt that it is his business, if every time that happened he wouldn’t trust that I can handle the unwanted attention and fend off its possible impact, if every time that happened he would get scared that I will cheat or leave him, I would rather be single because I don’t care to be infantilized nor do I care for controlling attitudes. Which is why I don’t date insecure men.

Your comment reeks of possessiveness and insecurity.
LMFAO this makes it so much better
Don't bring yourself down to his level.

You won, he lost.   

Isn't that enough punishment for him?
Basically not to let your ego destroy a relationship. When my mother said she wanted to end things he didn’t put up a fight or try to work things out. 

He said that once she told him that she didn’t want to be with him anymore that he wasn’t going to beg or anything and he was gone the next day(ish). 

Later on my mother had told him “I can’t believe you just gave up”. Which to be honest sounds toxic as fuck. 

Sadly they were pretty happy together, from my recollection. They always spent time together and loved the same things. He theorizes that the medication she was on changed her. And I don’t know how accurate that is but it sounds right. 

Now she’s in a marriage with a dude who doesn’t work really, and they barely talk to each other. Like siblings or room mates or something. Sad story.
Oh god. Nah, last time I got hammered I ended up having a random dude from the bar drive my truck and his buddies home. I was in the bed. There was puke along the side of the truck and my phone was dead. Apparently I called my then girlfriend and we talked foe 2+ hrs. I didn't even know what I said but apparently she broke down happy when she saw me next. And now I have a kid.
One of the last times I put up with my husband drinking, he got up, black out drunk, and pissed in/on/around the kitchen garbage can and went back to bed. I left it and made him clean up cold piss hung over. The next time he drank he was draped over my lap, out cold, actively vomiting while blacked out. He still doesn't remember it. He had had 3 5ths of vodka, 5'10, 200 pounds soaked, no food because he drank his calories, and I'm pretty sure that I am the only thing that kept him alive, bent over my lap while I held a garbage bag to catch the vomit. Otherwise he would have aspirated. And afterwards he was cleaned up and placed into bed with a garbage can next to him. 

He's been sober damn near a year now.

We were talking about drinking last week. I told him if he fell back into the bottle at this point (keep in mind, I said fell back in, not had a back slide, not fucked up, an active choice) I would leave him. 

Your wife may be a G. But she doesn't deserve any of that. (Not you you, generalized you) 

I didn't deserve to have the trauma of basically seeing my husband almost die of alcohol poisoning in my lap because he didn't want to deal with his demons. 

Thank you for quitting drinking..
Just hit 5 years sober in Oct . Congrats to us both. My biggest accomplishment to date.
I'm sorry you're addicted to workahol
'Hangxiety'
I just hit 6 years this past October 13th. Congrats to you
Very nice I'll be at 4 years without a sip of alcohol on December 1st of this year. Almost 4 years ago on my birthday I almost died 🤷🏽‍♂️ took a lot for me to stop drinking smfh
I think I’m so hilarious when I drink and make Reddit comments.
Exactly!!!!
No it definitely still happened… You just don’t have to face the reality of it until your confronted bout it… kinda the cowards way out to be honest
Yeah i was bad. Alcohol would always lead to other things but mostly alcohol. Got to where it seriously broke my brain for lack of better words. So for legal reasons, family reasons, being alive reasons I had to quit. Took a few tries. But finally stuck. Actually in 2 days, Nov 1 will be my 7 year mark. It's tough. Don't be too tough on yourself. But definitely call yourself out when you get that talk oh I'll just have one or few. I knew I was so full of shit when my brain woukd tell me that. I'd think it and just laugh. Like really mfker? No you won't lol
I see you’ve been in the rooms.
Oh my God, I'm adopted and this hits so hard I think I've found my siblings.
I'm still friends with her and her husband! At the time I was 22, fresh out of college, in my first big boy job. When I saw the call lasted 12 min I thought my career was over before it even began. This was many years ago and she still gives me crap for it on rare occasion lol
You two are saying the same thing. By ignore, they meant not contacting him. You mentioned blocking his number. Same thing. If he calls again in 28 years again, nobody will care.
This made me cringe. Also, I don't know how it is relevant to the story.
It was just a detail that didn't need to be shared at all lol it has nothing to do with the situation
I assumed they were just seeing who could eat the most carolina reapers.
That’s because OP is probably a teenage boy in real life.
Hardcore redditor.
OP wears Ed Hardy
OP is also 61 and on Reddit…asking for advice.  Judgement is quite poor
I don’t find your mother’s shock at him giving up so easy to be toxic. It would only have been toxic if she had told him she wants to end it to test him but hadn’t actually meant it. What if she really did mean it? What if there were issues in that relationship that she had been asking to fix together but he was just not committed to fixing them, and she came to the conclusion that the status quo would make her miserable? What if it wasn’t your father she was rejecting but elements of their relationship? What if it was just as painful for her to break the sad news as it was for him? What if, had your father fought for the relationship, she might have realized that there was still hope where she saw none at first? What if what she really meant was “either you stand by me so we can fix these issues together or we can’t be together anymore,” and your father took it as “she doesn’t love me” rather than “it has become hard for her to love me because she doesn’t feel loved back or because I don’t let her,” or “she loves me but not the current relationship with me and needs me to get on board and fix it together?”

Looking at how people behave is never enough to draw any sensible conclusion. You also need to look at the motivations behind the behaviours, and the underlying causes. Being shocked that the person you dumped just accepts being dumped is only toxic if the dumping was manipulative.
Interesting. I love my girl dearly of 7 years BUT… one time she was pulling away and got her back and now sometimes I wish I would have just let her go lol. Our relationship is fine but still lacking for me. She’s happy as hell while I deep down feel unsatisfied. I don’t know if it’s from the relationship itself, or my own inner demons. Relationships suck if you are not complete within your own self. You tend to attract people with similar energy.
Now that's funny
Ah, "From the mouths of babes and drunkards you will learn the truth"... 

It worked that time.
The same thing happened to me after taking my ambien for sleep and then making the mistake of talking on the phone. My then boyfriend calls me the next day asking if I meant what I said the night before. I tried to play it off and said of course I did. Then he went on about how he talked to his landlord and was going to be able to get out of the lease of his apartment. I was shook, but I just rolled with it. Anyway, we have been married for 11yrs and have a 10yr old. So I think it worked out alright. I didn't admit the truth until we were married for a few years.
Congratulations 🎈 
I just turned 15 years sober. I don’t miss it a bit. I know all those years of drinking I made an Ass of myself multiple times. 
Don’t miss the hangovers
That’s sick bro. Congratulations! It’s refreshing to see so many sober people in this thread.
October, me too just hit 6!
I have about 8 1/2 years, which I never thought possible! My life still sucks, but not because of alcohol! It is my biggest accomplishment as well.
It’s ok it’s not leading me to getting arrested or ruining relationships (besides less free time)plus I like what I do
7 years?!? *SLEDGE*!! CONGRATUFUCKINGLATIONS! 
This comment made my whole day and has inspired me. No fkin joke and I'm proud of you!

I very much relate with the legal, family and *being alive* reasons. 
I narrowly got out of a DUI - deferred to wet reck and then withheld adjudication. 
I have an issue with moderation (for most anything). I'm not done partying until my supply is gone and it's too late to get more. 

I dont drink into oblivion anymore but I want to get back to being okay with boredom and dealing with stress, healthily.
Yep, really helped
Have to prove they have the sex
This is really good. Thank you.
Disagree. If you’re in a relationship that really requires you to fight for the other person, there’s a very small chance you will have a good relationship with that person going forward. There’s either too much baggage to come back from, you’re dealing with a test (which is toxic), or you fix your shit for a short time and then revert back to normal. 

I’ve almost never encountered a couple that offered a “I’m done” ultimatum and then are still together later and are both happy. That has to be pretty fucking rare, I’d say.
The one place where two halves don't make a whole.

Maybe while you have the stability and are at least not alone, you can take the opportunity to do some personal work. Weirdly, a group therapy month, or 3, is a good start, so you can realize the humor in it and see that you are not alone, maybe pick up a few new tools from the big book of sighs, that only the best licensed therapists have. I did this years ago after a couple of weird run ins and still laugh about it. I also feel more at ease in being vulnerable and open... apparently a requirement for a good relationship of any level.
I'm late to reply but that's not how it feels,  especially after 7 years.   I've been with my wife for almost 15 years and I'm crazy about her.   And I know that she's just as crazy about me too and I can't imagine spending life with anyone else.   That's how it should feel.   If you aren't willing to fight for the relationship you are in then it's time to leave.   You're wasting precious time you could be spending with someone you want to spend your life with and honestly,  staying with her keeps her from finding that person as well.
The best comment thread on here
You’re welcome. 

The topic of your comment is a tricky one. As you already likely know, it is fairly often discussed online. Unfortunately, people tend to fall into the extreme about it, and of course when most people say it is toxic, we tend to use the shortcut to assume that it is because it is easier than to make the effort to think it through.

Personal experience: after YEARS (too long, in hindsight) of trying to get him to understand that there were a few things that needed improvement which I was super motivated to work on together and patient enough to not pressure him to morph into the perfect partner overnight, but also repeated ample warnings that if nothing changes, it will ruin the relationship and I would not be given the choice to stay in it, I ended it. He only took me serious once it was too late. He cried, because he didn’t expect it despite all the warnings, and that’s because he took me for granted. But he didn’t try to work it out or even ask me for a chance to try. I am still mad at him for that because it made me feel like he didn’t care about the relationship as much as I did, and I felt like I had been wasting the best of myself on someone who didn’t value it. It made me feel like I had been living in an illusion, led to believe that I was loved when I wasn’t. It made me feel betrayed for years (the better part of eleven years). I still wish he had taken my concerns more seriously and that he had shared more of his with me, because we otherwise had a lot going for us, we were hugely compatible, and before he started to take me for granted, he really caused some pretty big improvements to my life by just being part of it.

I know where to reach him and he knows where to reach me. I know that if it came to that, he would come running to help me. The ending was ugly, but I have no hard feelings and still trust him because he is not manipulative in any way. We have unfinished business. But neither of us reaches out, probably because it would open a can of worms to revisit what happened and why. I don’t want him to feel guilt at this point, I wish him well—and he probably regrets and has guilt feelings under the surface he would rather not unearth. If he reached out with questions on the past, I would, as respectfully as possible, give him honest answers. It would probably even help him with his relationships going forward, because it turns out he was very confused about relationships back then. But I don’t know if he has been progressing on that and I know that the only way I could do a post mortem is if I could first tell him how pissed I am that he didn’t fight for it. I am not sure that would be helpful to him because I don’t know how far along he got with learning to do relationships. As for me, water under the bridge. I just wish I could take that time back and be eleven years younger.
UPDATE: My Suspicions Were Correct—My Wife Has Been Secretly Messaging a 17-Year-Old She Coaches. What Should I Do Next?
**Here’s the link to my previous post for those who wanted to go back and read it:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gahddb/i\_think\_my\_wife\_might\_be\_cheating\_on\_me\_with\_a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gahddb/i_think_my_wife_might_be_cheating_on_me_with_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**Original post summary:**  
For those of you who didn’t see my original post, here’s a brief summary:

In my previous post, I shared some difficult suspicions about my wife, who recently became increasingly close to a 17-year-old boy she coaches. She started making strange comments about his looks, athletic abilities, and personal qualities that went beyond her usual enthusiasm for coaching. Meanwhile, she’s become much more secretive with her phone and is often late home from practice without clear explanations. These changes have left me wondering if there’s something more happening between them, but I don’t have solid proof and don’t want to jump to conclusions without evidence.

**Late update**:  
First off, I want to thank everyone for the comments, advice, and support on my original post. Unfortunately, my original post was initially taken down, and I received a three-day temporary ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was eventually restored after my ban ended. Since I wasn’t able to share updates during that time, I’ve decided to create a new post with all the updates so far, structured chronologically to keep everything organized. Sorry to keep everyone waiting—this is why I’m only updating now, and the last five days have also been a whirlwind.

**Post update 1:**  
I took some of your advice and reached out to a lawyer—well, sort of. An old friend from high school, who’s now a successful family lawyer, happens to be visiting his family here in *{my hometown}* this week. While family law isn’t exactly what I need, I’d rather speak to someone I trust before hiring a lawyer and potentially escalating things out of control.

I’m meeting him for coffee tomorrow and will update you afterward. I’m hoping he can give me some solid legal advice without things getting too intense. I obviously don’t want her to be arrested or anything drastic like that, but I also don’t know what to do next. Right now, I’m not even angry—just overwhelmed and in shock. It’s hard to process that someone I’ve been so close to over the last two years might not be who I thought and could have been hiding something awful this whole time.

**Post update 2:**  
The last five days have been absolute hell. The title is a bit of a giveaway, but pretty much everyone who commented was right, and my own suspicions have been confirmed.

After talking to my friend (the lawyer), we agreed that I should confront her with my concerns suggest looking through her phone together just to put some of my suspicions to rest. I realise how risky this was, but we really didn’t have a lot of choice considering there was no clear proof that anything weird had been going on.  
He suggested that we meet somewhere quiet, but still in a public setting in case she decided to freak out and do something irrational. I decided to take her our local park where I sat her down on a park bench well away from any crowds of people.

When we sat down together, I told her how serious of a situation we could be in and that she MUST be completely honest with me, and that want to be on her side but the way she had been acting had led to some serious suspicions. I explained to her that I didn’t want to break the trust between us so had decided against looking through her phone, despite how tempted I was.

When I told her the concerns, she immediately got defensive and started denying everything. She called me a “paranoid asshole” for even suggesting that she would be in a relationship with a minor. She said the fact that I would even question something like this means there’s probably something wrong with me and that I must be the one hiding something.

Honestly, the way she reacted just confirmed to me that there was something that she hadn’t been telling me this entire time and that without her cooperation, the safest bet was probably just to leave.

I suggested that we look through her phone together just to provide ME with closure and even if there was nothing to hide, it would mean a lot to me that she would just humour me and that it might even be fun to look through together and laugh at how ridiculous I was being.

She screamed at me for “trying to invade her privacy” and that I had massively overstepped the line before storming away from me, back to the car and driving to her friend’s house to stay for the night.

I don’t know what she talked about with her friend but at around 3:00 am the next morning I got a really long text from her giving her view of the situation. The messages was as follows (the entire message was considerably long so I’ve summarised it for this post): My wife - I really don’t think what I have been doing is wrong, it started with me just helping this kid with some extra practice because he was struggling to get the hang of some of the drills we had been working on in that days training session. These private sessions were becoming more regular and after about three weeks of extra training sessions he sent me a friend request to my Instagram. He wasn’t the first one of the team to send me a request and I wouldn’t usually accept them but as I was giving this kid private coaching sessions I though it made more sense.  
He started to send me DMs so I responded, because I’m not a total asshole. Ok, maybe the texts aren’t just about soccer anymore, there’s nothing wrong with being friends with a kid, you’ve always been super close to your younger brother and I’ve never called you out for being “weird”.

The message then proceeded to say how much of an asshole I was for trying to call her out and trapping her in a situation that would always leave her looking bad.

She ended the message by telling me that she thinks that she’ll be able to look past this and forgive me for being a “total insecure dickhead” and that if I ever questioned her like this again, she would be filing for a divorce.

I was in complete shock when I read this response as I have never seen this side to my wife. This is not the kind, loving, respectful, and open person whom i had married and it is driving me totally insane, I just don’t know what to do.

I understand that what she was telling me is not normal and I can’t believe how naïve I have been for so long, but I still feel like there’s even more going on that she’s not telling me. Her long message didn’t actually explain why she had been messaging this kid so much and for so long, or why she had been spending literal hours every evening locked in our bedroom or on the sofa just on her phone.

IDK, maybe I AM just being paranoid?

Maybe this is more normal than I’m making it out to be, although this seems unlikely.

Should I still try to look through her phone anyway, despite what she’s told me?

When we had met the previous day, my friend mentioned that this was out of his field but that I shouldn’t contact the police until I was more sure of anything because if we did end up getting a divorce, and she is technically innocent, calling the police on your wife for providing extra help to a kid she coaches wouldn’t look very good for me in a courtroom.

**Again, I apologise to everyone for the late update, and I know this post is kind of all over the place, but I hope you have been able to follow.**

**Edit:** This post was temporarily removed but has now been reinstated. I appreciate all the support and advice so far, and I’ll be responding to comments to answer questions and clear up any confusion. I will be giving another update on the development of the situation, thank you for your patience!
Say nothing, reach out to the kids parents and have them get his phone.   If there is shadiness going on, THEY'LL be calling the police. Then your hands are clean of it. 

If it happens and there is enough to call the police, get a lawyer.
> Should I still try to look through her phone anyway, despite what she’s told me?

You can try, but at this post the incriminating evidence is almost certainly deleted.
She’s gaslighting you. Do not believe her lies.
I'm a 45 year old woman. I DO NOT MAKE FRIENDS WITH 17 year old boys. It's skeezy
She is really trying to squirm her way out of this. I remember your post from before, and I have to say, your wife KNOWS she's in the wrong. 

If she had nothing to hide, she would be showing you the messages to prove her innocence.

Putting myself in her shoes, she knows she's caught, but has enough deniability to make it seem like you're the one with the issue. If she were smart, she'd already be distancing/blocking the kid, so I wouldn't expect their relationship to continue, however she's already broken your trust - the pinnacle of your relationship.

You have a few options:

1. Forgive your wife and learn to re-trust her (I couldn't do this myself, probably self-destructive)

2. Start the divorce proceedings, and hire a real lawyer. (Self-protective, my choice)

3. Protect this kid. We don't know how far this has gone, but he's a kid. Find his parents and tell them you're not sure what's going on between the two of them, but you fear it may be inappropriate. (High risk, and possibly vindictive, but also looking out for this kid your wife groomed)
I would absolutely file for divorce and contact the police and the kids parents
Oh she'll forgive YOU? How nice of her... Time to get those divo papers started.
Aww bruh you fucked up by confronting her without proof. All she will do now is clean up the breadcrumbs to keep you off her trail. And as someone else pointed out she is gaslighting you. Get your fucking ducks in a row. I think you two are beyond the point of no return. The only play you have now is to confront the boy's parents with your suspicions. And that's not really the best move you could make.
I don't think that lawyer gave you good advice. Now any trace evidence is long gone.
She tried to say it's like you and your BROTHER? Oh she's deflecting hard. She's on the attack because she knows she fucked up, don't fall for it
You handled that completely wrong. Any evidence you have wanted is long gone.
Let’s give her the benefit of the doubt here. She is just trying to be friends with him, and even though we, as adults, as coaches and teachers of children know DMs and private conversations are a no-no, she overstepped but did nothing wrong.

When you want to be up front and legit you walk in the sunshine and leave tracks. I respond to children on this sub all the time. You can read what I say, you can check my account, you can look and look and look and what you will find is exactly what is in the open.

Your wife needs to show you what was passed back and forth. If it’s deleted, missing, she can’t find it, or she says no, then what’s written is damning and that benefit of the doubt is gone.

Right now, it does not look too good for her. If it were me, and I was innocent, I would let you see my phone. If I was guilty, I would have consistently made my phone show nothing so that anytime you asked I would hand it to you and say, check for yourself, I am clean.

Either way you would be handed the phone. Since she won’t give you the phone, that’s a red flag.

You are in this with her now. Regardless of what you did or did not do, if she goes down you get dragged through it. Sexual abuse of minors hurts a lot more than just the victim.

I think you need to pay for a lawyer and figure out how to go forward. You are not a mandatory reporter but, if I can show you knew and did nothing, and I am that boy’s parent, you are getting sued - which may happen anyway- and no jury is going to take your side on being quiet and letting it go on.

You are not the first spouse in this situation.
OP fucked up by talking to the wife too early. Should have hired a PI and snuck into the phone before calling her out.
Honestly you should've tried looking in her phone before you confronted her because now everything will be deleted. Especially now since she knows you think she's having a relationship with a minor that can ruin her life and get her into legal trouble she's gonna be extra careful now.
Why is she messaging you, not talking in person? I suspect she's afraid that you'll see through the lies if you are looking in her eyes.

Also, she has now admitted to you that she was in contact with the boy...I think it's pretty obvious that that's who she was chatting with when you caught her the other day. Seems like there's a lot more than she's admitting. When you meet in person tell her to show you that particular conversation...you know when it occurred...I'll bet it's been deleted.
[deleted]
I volunteer with kids; I work with kids. 



It's against the rules, and super unethical, to contact them outside of the very specific situation I work with them. It's almost certainly against any rules or policies she had to agree with in order to coach. Children of any age are vulnerable, and that is taken into consideration when making these policies. 


To sum it up, even if nothing explicit has happened, she's almost certainly violated any agreement she'd made, and has crossed ethical/moral lines.
Dude your wife is a predator. She is using her position of power over this kid to groom him. That's what the texting, late night practices, and social media follows are for.

  
She is grooming him to be her perfect plaything. 

If I were you, I'd consider hiring a Private Investigator.
She's lying. She fled to her friends house to clear her phone so that it matches her new story. That she wants an apology to move on, which is classic gaslighting move, is telling. Someone who has nothing to hide does not behave like this.
Please reach out to the kid’s parents.
Teacher here. If this is sports team is affiliated with a school, contact the school immediately!! The whole "there's nothing wrong with being friends with a kid" is CRAZY!! I'm 22, and I teach high school. Even I would not dream of allowing a teen to follow me on social media/text my personal phone. This is against every ethical guideline adults working with kids must follow. Even if it's nothing more than a friendship, it is highly inappropriate and the kid's parents need to know.
I can’t believe you didn’t just hack her phone somehow. I’m not sure how your marriage survives at this point. If she fucked a student she knows you are on to her and it’s only a matter of time. If she didn’t fuck a student, she is never going to forget this.

Ps-Her comparing this to your fucking brother almost certainly means she is guilty. That doesn’t even make sense as a comp.
The fact that she ran away instead of showing you the messages speaks volumes. She ran so she could have time to delete any evidence!
Truthfully, I’m burning it all down if I were him. I’m calling the police, filing for divorce, letting the kid’s parents know, all the other parents from the soccer team, & any league officials. 

YOU ARE TAKING THIS TOO LIGHTLY
First of all, the fact that she is threatening you with divorce is a red flag. 
Like YOU are the one destroying the marriage. She doesn’t realize is that she is responsible for her own feelings and reactions. This seems really immature, extreme, and emotional - another red flag. 

That she screams at you and calls you names because of YOUR concerns about her behavior does not seem healthy - it seems a bit selfish and lacking in compassion for your feelings and concerns - another red flag. 

That she thinks it’s okay to have private DM’s with a minor about non soccer things is ANOTHER red flag, regardless of what is happening. And then she justifies it. 

Honestly, I would be very concerned regarding this behavior, regardless of whether she is cheating or not. 

I would tell her that you would like to get couples therapy, and make sure you see a good, neutral therapist. 

I would tell her behavior doesn’t make you feel safe or secure in the relationship. 

I would tell her that if she is going to act this way towards you, you are going to have to take steps to protect yourself emotionally. That might mean (fill in the blank), whatever that looks like for you. 

Whatever you do, don’t stuff this down and ignore it. That will destroy the intimacy in your marriage. I would recommend a book called Boundaries in Marriage by Henry Cloud. It can help with having these difficult conversations.
Save everything, document everything you can.
First of all, I think your marriage is over. I’m sorry. I supposed it is possible that you could try to forget all of your suspicions and pretend everything is fine, but I don’t think that is the best choice for a long-term happy life. 

So you brought it up and she has just started the tickle truth. You got an admission that they have been messaging quite a bit and spending alone time together. Her excuse about extra practice doesn’t even make sense - if he is as good as she has been telling you, why does he need all the extra help?This is bad, but I have no doubt the full truth is worse. 

This isn’t just about your marriage. She is in a position of authority over someone who is legally a child. Let’s say she is telling the whole truth. Do you think his parents would be ok with the scenario that your wife has already admitted to? I doubt it. 

I think the first thing to do is get an unbiased lawyer. I don’t think your friend gave you the best advice, as she has almost certainly deleted the evidence by now. 

Then you have to at a minimum tell his parents. If this team is affiliated with a school, you need to notify the school. And if anything more comes out, you may need to notify the police. His parents might do that anyway. 

And if you are wrong? I’m sure there is a big part of you that hopes that there is some innocent explanation to this. But her reaction is way too extreme for a few innocent messages. I don’t think you are wrong. 

Again, I’m sorry. This is a terrible position to be in. There is a better future waiting for you, but right now you have to deal with this crisis and get it resolved. Best wishes.
I tried to tell you in the first post what would happen if you confronted her without proof. You're cooked. She's going to cover her tracks. She's going to warn the kid. And you're always going to wonder if you were a total ahole or right all along. Should have hired a PI. Should have gathered proof. Should have absolutely known before confronting her.
Now is the time to properly use the word “gaslighting” everyone
There IS something wrong with a grown woman being friends with a 17yo kid. 

She's his coach. She's in a position of authority over him. That imbalance of power is a serious red flag. She's prioritizing her "friendship" with him over her marriage to you. She's comparing her relationship with her student to your relationship with your brother - that is gaslighting. The two are not the same. She's displacing you, dismissing your concerns, and being secretive. 

Honestly, you may want to start divorce proceedings to make this real for her. Bring her the papers and insist that you see her phone or she signs the papers. Also consider reaching out to the friend she stayed with and expressing your very real concerns. That she refused to let you see her phone is highly suspect. 

Have you heard of DARVO - deny, attack, reverse victim/offender - that is what she's doing. She's pretending you're the offender and she's the victim. When in reality she's the one with secrets. She's the one sneaking around. At minimum she's having an emotional affair if not a physical one.
You need a private investigator to find out what your wife is up to. My ex husband swore up and down that he was just helping a newly hired realtor and that I was jealous and crazy. I hired a PI and sure enough he was fucking her and I had proof that his car was at a hotel when he said he was going to the gym and pics of them kissing and sitting close at a booth in hotel restaurant. 
Plastered those pics on the outside of our front door and had the locks and garage door code changed. You have to get definite proof!
hey OP. I’m a (almost) 24 year old woman and I don’t make friends with 17 year olds. I think that’s weird as hell. Your wife is older than me and making “friends” with a 17 year old. She’s a predator and she knows it.

iCloud can hold her old messages if she deletes them. You can also find deleted messages in the app on iPhone and if you go to battery usage you can see all the apps she’s using in case there’s an app she’s using to secretly talk to him. 

Also, there’s a way to access all data on ig (like DMs) but it’ll require you getting her phone.

Best bet is to “apologize”, make her think she’s right you’re wrong, and then in a week or so wait until she’s sleeping again and go through that damn phone. 

Save a kids life. Best of luck 
Fake and stupid
Thanks for the update.

Sorry you're going through this.

"He's so much more athletic than his teammates.  His athletic instincts are extraordinary.  He's an innate playmaker."  And then..."he needed extra private practice sessions because he was struggling to understand some of the drills."  What?  Make it make sense.
Every accusation is a confession
If i found out my 17 year old sons, 33 year old soccer coach was texted him, I would lose my mind. 

She is grooming him. He is probably flattered, but he is a child and she is the adult. The adult is a place of trust.
I've collected kids over the years. Kids who had parents that really shouldn't be parents but weren't awful enough that cps would step in.

I love these kids dearly, they love me.

We barely text. We'll send cute animal videos. We see each other sporadically.

Never is it inappropriate nor so damn often.

She's gaslighting you. Please run.
NTA OP, but your wife has clearly overstepped all boundaries in this case. 

I've coached numerous aged players in various sports, from 6 to 19 and have always remained the adult and mentor relationship. I've only had phone numbers to send reminders about practices, games, uniform or game reminders, to pickup or drop off kids (and only while my own is also in the car), snack/drink schedule reminders or in a few instances job interview or college recommendations... There should never be a question, at any point, when you're coaching youth where it's even a tad too much of anything! They're so impressionable it's just not a line one should blur - especially as the adult here! Boys will inevitably try to joke or push it - but she needs to stand firm and not allow any of that around her. 

I would reminder her the reason she's doing this is to help all the children and youth- not just one. It seems odd and if she's really that passionate, she needs to remember why she's doing it all and to not blow up your entire marriage and relationship... 

Praying for you OP🙏
Updateme
She should be on a list. It is not normal for a grown adult to be getting that defensive over conversations with a 17 if it's all innocent. There is absolutely something going on there, i can promise you that. I'm not immediately going to call her a pedophile, but there is something really wrong.
I remember your last post and commented then as well - I have concerns. 

I work with kids, mostly teens - one of the kids was working on a personal fitness badge so we met at the gym a few times, and chatted about gains and how they were doing. I have commented that they are building muscle - because that is what they were working on - however even those comments were either in public (like at the gym) or in our troop. 

I do not text, email or contact kids that are not my kids without another adult involved. It's one of the practices put in place for our organization to try to help prevent abuse. 

Do you know this 17 year old? Do you know his parents? Do you know anyone who does? This is concerning - as both a leader and a parent I have issues with anyone privately messaging kids - there is no reason that there shouldn't be another adult involved in the communication. 

Even when the kids forget they need another adult in the conversation it's still up to the adult who was contacted to make it right. (Usually just doing a reply to their email, copying a parent or other leader and noting that they need to have a second adult when sending messages.

I am sorry you are going through this - it sucks - someone needs to be looking out for this kid, and you need to make sure you have support as well
My wife loves to say she has nothing to hide and I can look through her phone any time. I don’t look, I trust her. If I were ever worried and asked to see it, and she responded like your wife, I’d be gone. Her reaction spoke volumes, she knew you’d find something. That’s the only explanation.  The moment your wife called this a huge breach of her privacy and wouldn’t assuage your fears was the end of the relationship. Anything she has to hide is now hidden or deleted. Your trust is broken and relationships don’t survive without trust.

My advice:

Retain a lawyer and do what they tell you to do.
It certainly seems like at minimum she has an emotional affair going with this kid. Whether he has reciprocated isn't clear. It's also not clear whether they've crossed the line into it being a physical affair.  

Either way, it's inappropriate. But there is probably a difference in what the law will do about it and maybe how it plays out in a divorce. Your lawyer friend should be able to elaborate.  

I find it suspicious that she didn't show you her messages at the time you confronted her about it. If I was innocent, I certainly would have - then given you hell for even thinking that.  

You need to decide whether this is a deal breaker for you and how you go forward from there.  

Also, the messages will still exist on the phone companies server for a while. I'm clueless whether you have any ability to request access to them as part of a divorce.
Her reaction says it all. People who feel guilty about their actions will react like that. She knows what she is doing is wrong and yes, 100% she isn't telling you everything. The fact that she lied right away should tell you that she carefully though about how much to reveal to you in that 3am message. An innocent person doesn't react this way. I honestly don't think this is salvageable. And yeah, you have nothing to go to the police with so I would recommend against that.
Not sure where you’re from but as someone who as a teenager frequently worked with adults in youth / volunteering spaces it was 100% illegal to talk to me / young people outside of those spaces

You and your brother have a close relationship bc he’s blood related to you and you’re not obligated by your JOB to have a mentor-mentee relationship

It isn’t wrong to get to know a student and chat with them in the work & professional setting but it IS wrong to further develop a friendship outside of it- this is a minor, and her student

Her trying to keep their friendship off the record (even if it really WAS just a friendship, but her not even mentioning that to you before this) is a huge red flag and she herself knows it
Forget the phone now. Everything is deleted by now.

Best you could do is give it some time, wait for her start up again, and catch her in the act.

And judging by the gas lighting, she gonna f up sooner or later.

Best of luck ✌🏻
The fact that she refused to show you the messages and ran off in the car tells you everything you need to know.
At this point I’d hire a PI. Or still go through her messages.
This soap opera is completely fake, but I’ve got the popcorn out. 

Next episode we learn more. There will be a plot twist.  Maybe OP can find the text data via their cell phone provider?  Maybe he finds an iPad logged in?  We will see.
I hope to god this is fucking fake.
No longer is the stereotype a male coach. The feminists were right. The world will be female. 
Look at it like this... Right now, some 17 year old young buck is enjoying the feeling of your wife's tongue passionately licking his cock.


Here's him: 🍆🍆🌋🌋😂😂😂😂😜😜👍 


Here's you: 😢😢😢😢😢🤡🤡🤡


And the BEST part, is that she WILL end up being compensated 💰💰 during the divorce proceedings... And that kid will be 18, spending YOUR money, with your X-wife's mouth wrapped around his cock. 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣






In the words of Anton Shagur -
 "If the rule you followed led you here, of what use was the rule?" 
The phone has already been erased. But you know that denying her access to the phone and running away gave you the answer you needed.

Get a divorce, you lost her trust and she is DARVOing you, typical of someone who has been caught cheating.

You didn't mention children, which makes divorce much easier. I'm so sorry you're going through this.
Thanks for the update OP. I am sorry that many of our suspicions turned out to be true. You were dealt a very shitty hand here and you handled it like a pro.
You need to report her and file for divorce. Clearly she is a predator waiting for her prey!!
Talk to the kid's family.  They need to be made aware of this.
Just tell the police. You're protecting a pedophile. Makes you just as guilty to allow her to continue
Talk with your own divorce attorney and ask for advice on whether contacting his folks was beneficial and right.
If you are in the US, see this link. This educates coaches on how to maintain appropriate boundaries when coaching youth. I was a referee for youth rugby and was required to complete the training and follow the guidelines. Your wife has engaged in inappropriate behavior even if she has not engaged in sexual behavior with the youth. The strength of her reaction, however, suggest that their relationship is likely sexual or on the verge of becoming sexual. 

[https://uscenterforsafesport.org/](https://uscenterforsafesport.org/)
Went about this the wrong way. Def needed to go through the phone or hire a PI
You are in legal jeopardy.

Do not take another step on your own. No investigating, no confronting, no communicating with the kid, his parents, the friend lawyer, the organization your wife works for, or the friend she ran away to.

 Spend the damned money. Hire a lawyer and do exactly what they say.
I don't think you need to find anything. 

Your wife is a fucking weirdo. When you finally see it, you won't be able to unsee it. It'll taint everything you two do together. It'll be embarrassing. 

Less of a "Your *wife* is a fucking weirdo" and more

"*Your* wife is a fucking weirdo" 

Other dudes wives? Not fucking weirdos.


Single men? Not married to a fucking weirdo.

You? Married to a ***fucking weirdo***.
A 33 year old woman becoming that close, even as friends, is weird AF. Going further than being just a coach discussing the sport is weird. Comparing the relationship to that of a sibling is deflecting unless she’s an idiot too and not just weird. Just like your brother? WTF? I won’t go as far as saying they are in a romantic relationship though I wouldn’t be suprised, but she is in an inappropriate one. If this were reversed and it was a male coach, this wouldn’t even be a question, everyone would think it was inappropriate. As a mom, I would want to know - tell your wife to show you the texts (if they are deleted and she doesn’t normally delete texts, that’s guilty enough), since she did admit to texting. If it’s inappropriate then tell her you are going to the police if she doesnt tell the parents about the relationship. If it’s not inappropriate tell her to stop texting or you will go to the parents.
Holy shit thats gaslighting to a t id say check those messages while you can before she wipes them to cover her tracks.
Call the police
If she was staying late after practice to give him some private sessions, then why didn't she tell you about those private sessions? And didn't she tell you he was exceptionally talented? If he was so talented and special, you'd think he wouldn't struggle with the drills during practice.. 

Being friends with a 17yo as a 30+yo person, is already not right. But as a coach she has a position of power and authority over this kid, that's an aggravating factor.  

Please contact the police, tell them what you suspect, tell them you don't have any solid proof but you feel obligated to share your concerns.

I understand you don't want her to get arrested etc. but if she gets arrested and goes to jail, that's no6 because you reported her, it's because she is doing something that's against the law.
Definitely, reachboyt to your local police and inform them if your suspicions. If no other reason than to cover you butt if something untoward comes out, you don't want to be seen as complicit. Just go in and ask to speak to an officer. 

Then I would try reaching out to the kid's parents to see if they have any similar concerns. It definitely will not be easy, but you can couch it as you worried your wife is not seeing the signs that their kid is developing a bit of a crush.
Good lord, if there's nothing to hide, why is she coming unhinged?
Every youth organization I have been involved with has had some type of training to help protect the youth (as well as guidelines for addressing a power imbalance - like coach / player). For the BSA, it is their youth protection training. For the different churches, it can vary, but there is almost always something. For any organization that is the governing organization for a sport that is part of the US Olympics, it is Safe Sport. Some of these trainings you have to pay to take - others like the BSA's Youth Protection Training are available online for free. It can be boring, but you may learn a thing or two sitting through it - and it may help you to better recognize behaviors that you are seeing.

Grooming is a thing - and it sounds like that is at least what is going on here, if it has not gone beyond that already. You need to report this to the organization that she is coaching for, and possibly to the local authorities. Chances are she has already violated policies of the soccer club she is coaching for, and the last thing you want is for this to escalate to a point of hurting a minor.

I know you do not want her to get into a lot of trouble, but it sounds like things are already beyond that point.
You approach this thus, if you don't want a divorce:


You are still on her side. You're coming from a place of concern because of her pivotal role in the community. 


You don't want her to undo all the good she does for these kids by being involved in scandal, and that means she has to be above reproach. 


Remind her that you still value her privacy, but messages directly from servers can be subpoenaed and she should have a long hard think about if this "friendship" is worth it when looked at through the lens of the courts.
And this, folks, is why you just snoop, instead of confronting.  

OP could have gotten clear, conclusive evidence off that phone if he had just examined it privately, and taken next steps based on knowing the undisguised truth.  That includes the possibility of finding nothing or a bunch of entirely innocuous material, kicking himself for being paranoid, and going on his way without kicking the hornet’s’ nest.  

Instead he gets a liar going on the absolute warpath against him, and no doubt spending the time she took at the friend’s place frantically erasing everything.  Now what he has is an angry partner and no way to prove anything one way or the other, beyond the circumstantial implications of a phone full of obvious erasures.  Nothing conclusive though.

The idea that you should just “communicate like adults” is some seriously naive crap.  As if the person who would cheat on you wouldn’t dare lie about cheating on you.
Buddy, you’re already seeing the ‘trickle truth’ happening. 

First it was “there is nothing and you’re paranoid “… 

Now it’s “just friends and we message on Instagram a lot“. Soon it will be “there we are few flirty messages but I stopped it”…

Soon it will be followed by “he said he was sad so I sent him nudes just once to cheer him up”… 

And eventually it’ll be “it was his birthday and he said he wanted his first time to be with a woman he felt safe with”. 

You need to look through her phone and get proof, and prepare for a divorce. She’s not your wife anymore, and she hasn’t been for a good while. She stopped being your wife when she choose to become a sex offender. 

Your marriage won’t survive when this becomes public anyway (and it will become public) so make the call now and put things into motion.
Your wife knows what she was doing was wrong. She was hiding it from you because she knew it was wrong, and her defensive disclosure just underscores her awareness that she is being inappropriate at a minimum. Someone needs to inform the kid’s parents, though that will no doubt create job and legal problems for your wife. I’m sorry, OP. And I’m concerned there’s more to it than she admits.
As someone who works with kids, if this was me or my employee and I knew about communication (even if there isn’t physical stuff) I could be prosecuted and fired by any SafeSport overseen program.
The fact she tried to compare her talking to a 17 year old that she is not related at all to her and you talking to a younger sibling is insane not even in the same realm
100% trying to gaslight you and I know it is rough but I think you should try again to go through her phone as like you said if there is nothing going on then that would be the end of it
IMO If nothing inappropriate were going on, she wouldn't have been so offended and would have tried to dissuade your "paranoia." It is possible nothing physical has happened yet and she's lying to herself saying it isn't inappropriate. It's also possible she's straight up lying. Either way she's not concerned about your feelings towards the whole thing.
Honestly you're headed for divorce no matter what. You know she's capable of hiding things, you know she won't show you the phone, you don't know if she's talking to adults. Nobody who respects themselves could put this relationship back together unless she provided proof.       


I'd tell her you believe minor children deserve the priority and unfortunately she refused to prove she isn't abusing her authority over a minor child and you aren't looking passed it.      


At this point it doesn't even have to be sexual, she's messaging him about topics not related to coaching at all hours of the night. That's not appropriate for a person in her position to do. If you want to hire a PI go ahead. I'd be contacting a divorce lawyer regardless.
I just took a class on this actually.  You are not suppose to be friends with your athletes in any way shape or form on social media until they are two years removed from your coaching.  She is grooming this kid.  Report immediately to her school organization(not the police) if she is refusing to cooperate.  They will handle it give her one last shot to come clean.  This is going to sound Dickson but Two years from now if she divorces you there will be no legal action you can take against her because it will be outside the time table
Regardless of it's sexual, grooming or not, a 17 year old isn't her friend. She is an adult in the position of power as a coach, she's already crossing lines. It's already creepy. She coaches, she doesn't need them on her IG, she doesn't need to be talking to them. Next step is law enforcement. You need to protect this kid.
as someone who has done a lot of non traditional education -- summer camps, workshops etc -- this is NOT NORMAL and usually expressly forbidden. Many community based organizations that work with kids make you take trainings to this effect and messaging on social media with kids is a big no no. a lot of teachers and coaches go by modified versions of their name on socials so the kids have a harder time finding them. I still do this even though I'm not working directly with kids right now.
She is totally gaslighting and manipulating you. When somebody gets really defensive, it is a textbook sign that they are hiding something most of the time but not always. However, when it is followed up by personal attacks and bone fide manipulative and gaslighting tactics that make you second guess yourself, it very likely is something serious.

I know it is too late but I never would have confronted her rather I would wait until she was asleep and then look through her phone (there are 9999 possible codes but a good techie can get past that). Had I confronted her, I would have started with, "I am starting to get concerned that this boy really likes you and might see you as a potential romantic partner even though I know you'd never do something like that. Blah blah blah"

However, now you are too far into it. Wait until she is asleep and look through her phone. If you find some sexual stuff, you basically have two options. 1) Just ignore it and tell her that you were just really concerned that he may be seeing her the wrong way to get her off your back. 2) Take the phone and go to the police station immediately. Between the time that she discovers the missing phone and the time that she gets arrested, try not to be at home as she may act very erratically including violence. If you have to defend yourself just for your safety, the police don't care as it is a double-standard that men cannot win. Therefore, you could go to prison for assault or battery etc..
It’s an inappropriate relationship.  End of story.  It needs to stop and she either has full disclosure or I don’t see how you could trust her again.  I’ve worked as a school administrator for 35 years.  No student has ever had my phone number or contacted me after school hours.  Is it a school sport or community sport? Not that it matters but if it’s a school sport the athletic director should be made aware.  Tread lightly
Look up DARVO. Look up gaslighting. You're being manipulated. Come on...you need to wise up.
This could be considered illegal in your state.  You are OBLIGATED to report this or potentially be considered an accessory to a crime.
I work in public education and we are NOT allowed to be friends with kids on social media OR message with them directly at all. That includes texts and phone calls. This is a fireable offense and should be reported. Not normal, not okay and is actually considered grooming. You should report her to the school and leave.
Someone who has nothing to hide, does not hide things.

Someone who *doesn't even consider* their actions to be inappropriate wouldn't be defensive. At all. They would say "Oh is this bad? Okay I'll stop"

She is namecalling you, to deflect from her bad behaviour.

She was acting inappropriately and is blaming you for even mentioning it. She gave you an ultimatum. One that conveniently allows her to do what she wants "or else."

Go. Nuclear.

Report your wife. There will be an investigation. Her messages can be subpoenaed. Deleted pictures and messages aren't actually erased, the link to them is just removed. Pictures and messages can be recovered from her phone.

Two teachers from my old highschool have been fired and prosecuted for messaging students inappropriately.
Yea she's fucking this kid and from what sounds like she may have others.  It is never ok for a teacher or coach to be getting dms and text messages . If he needed help with extra practice parents and other coaches should have been involved never in private.  That's just asking for suspicion . Even if you go through her phone and insta now all the proof is gone. She deleted all the real stuff so you would have to get personal phone records from your carrier which if your on the same plan and your the primary you can usually do with no hassle insta though would be a lot harder would need police involvement etc . Sorry to say your wife is a predator and you really should think about involving the police
Yeah, so I can only comment from my experience.  I can't think of one time ever (since I was 17) that I had any contact with a 17 y/o outside a professional capacity. When communicating professionally, the time of day, message content, cc (for paper trail) would be things to remember.  Personally,  I'd rather send the message to the parent, let them pass on the information.  Not worth the chance of this exact scenario happening.
Looking at her phone is useless. Any incriminating evidence has been destroyed. I am sure she has spoken to her friend about this and this is her strategy to spin the problem as a you problem, not a her problem.

Updateme
Also, all of you saying you need to confirm that their relationship is sexual before contacting the police, WHY!? 

If this were a man, y’all would be ready to throw the book at him but somehow this wife gets a ‘you need to find out what’s going on’ 

Nahhhhh fuck that, your wife is communicating regularly with a 17 year old that she has no relation to. That’s weird as f’n hell
You need to contact the child’s parents as well as the police. The absolute LEAST thing this could be is grooming. You have an obligation to protect that kid.
She instantly became defensive shows a lot.  She’s gaslighting you now cause she knows how much trouble she can be in. As a mom of 9, I wouldn’t want my child’s coach texting them. She’s trying to turn this on you. This is all wrong in so many ways
It's weird that her defense for texting a minor is that you talk to your brother.
She's gaslighting you. Talk to the parents about your concerns. The kid will crack if there is something going on. But be clear, you don't blame him or hold anything against him. He's a victim. 

Or anonymously inform the parents of concerns. They will take it from there, and all will be revealed.

She said a lot and nothing all at the same time.
Skip checking the phone and try her laptop. Most people don't bother signing out of apps, and theres lots more ways of getting passwords on a pc than on a phone. Install a keylogger so you can see what she's typing, even if she erases it. I would also guess you gave her the chance to erase everything, so it's going to be harder to catch her now. She will be more careful now, but I think she likes the attention she's getting from the kid and won't stop. Airtag, keylogger, Google location settings(turn on). There's options, but you won't like the answers likely. Sorry you're going through this.
Bro. Hire a private investigator. You should have done that first before confronting her or asking her anything. But. Okay okay. Act like everything is fine and okay. That you're dumb and paranoid. Let her get comfortable again and then hire a private investigator to be around these extra practices. 

If it gets down to some serious inappropriate stuff you will be so glad you're hired a private investigator. Even if you walk in on them banging it is your word against theirs. If a private investigator sees it and documents it that is a whole other story. 

Stop playing around and hire a private investigator. Most charge by the hour. I wish you were in my state because I would almost do this for free.
She’s gaslighting you; common tactic amongst these good-for-nothing cheating whores. Proceed with whatever you’re doing and make sure not only you separate from her safely but also this kid gets help.
She's likely already deleted everything so you won't find anything. 

Her reaction tells me there is more going on than what she is really saying. 

I would contact the kid's parents and ask that they look through his phone to see what the conversations were really about. I'm willing to bet, she's not just helping him with extra training. She's probably sleeping with him.
Get a lawyer the real way, man. No friends, family, or even acquaintances. Hire a stranger.
She left the park to go and delete all evidence so you won’t find anything on her phone now. The fact she then gaslights you into making out your the weird one tells you at the very least you need to bin her off
when they turn it around on you. it's a classic sign they are in fact guilty.
The way she brought up the relationship with your own little BROTHER (and turned “being weird” around on you) and compared the situation to that, oh, I would’ve gone NUCLEAR, so gaslight’y of her. 

Regardless of what is happening, it’s inappropriate for an adult woman (who isn’t family/ family friend) to have a secret relationship with an underage athlete. Put it this way, think about how this would look if it was a male coach with an underage female athlete?

I’m normally against invading privacy but this is a little different as it possibly involves the abuse of a minor, and for that reason would’ve gone through her phone whether she liked it or not. 

I worry that the two have now had time to delete any evidence if there is any but who knows. I hope it’s not true but all the signs are there. I’m so sorry this happening to you. Please trust your gut and keep us updated.
Wrong move to confront her-- a cheater will always lie, especially over something that can land her in jail.  

You should have hired a PI, as many people suggested.  You would have had your definite answer and peace of mind in short order.  

Now don't sit on what you know or you could be legally on the hook yourself-- this is a potential crime against a child.  You need to lawyer up and do whatever your lawyer tells you.
I am sorry but why are you not reporting this to the Safeguarding lead for whatever sports club/ school she is a coach for? There is enough of a red flag here that it needs reporting and investigating as this young person could be at risk. I realise this is your wife but as adults we all have a duty of care when it comes to safeguarding young people.
Tell her you’re taking her out for a nice meal but actually drag her ass to a police station comes to mind.
The big giveaway in this is that in your original post you said that her reasons for staying late were about extra paperwork, or just finishing some extra work. It sounds like she never stated about private 1-2-1 training. If it were innocent, why lie or hide that?
Please notify the boys' parents that you suspect your wife has been grooming him and that they are engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a power dynamic that is wildly unbalanced. Notify your wife that you think divorce us the best option because you don't believe her and her behaviour is completely unacceptable. Try to keep things as calm and professional as possible.
I commented on your last post OP.

Red flags.

Look up DARVO.

Her communication with him is so inappropriate, she won't tell you anything and is attacking you.

This is all the proof you need.
So she’s cheating on you, gaslighting you and a pedophile? Bro just break up and call the police.
She ran away with her phone so she could delete the conversations. I would never be able to trust her again. 
When I was young, even when I was a minor, I had I had adults propositioning me. Woman and men. Some people have very little self control.
Not being funny but she is likening a relationship (of any kind) to your actual brother. Is she dumb?
Her acting to much difensive raise a red flag to me and I would call her bluff about the divorce tell her uou already have spoke to a lawyer and would request to subpina her phone to recover mesage as well.
Screenshot all the messages and message them to all her friends and family telling them the person is 17. And of course break up with her afterwards
Op, this is how my abuser started with me. What she is trying to claim is normal, is indeed normal, if you are grooming someone. 
Hey OP. I have thought about the perfect solution. You go to the boys parents and tell them. THey will get his phone and take it to the police. Then when she is put in Jail you can divorce her skanky ass.
Pulled from another site: 
I'd file anyway and retain several lawyers to slow her down.

Then I'd call safesport and LEO and the parents. 


Open the Instagram app
Visit your profile page and click on the top-right settings menu
Select “Your activity”
Scroll to the bottom and click on “Download your information”
Press “Request a download”
Meta will then send you a file of everything you’ve ever done on Instagram, from posts to messages. When you receive your file, you’ll have four days to download it. Although your messages won’t return to the DM chat box they came from, this is a great way to retrieve data if you want to reference an old message.

2. Use a third-party app to recover deleted messages
Third-party apps such as U.Fone and FoneLab can retrieve deleted data by accessing the cache files on your iOS or Android device – the sneaky Instagram backup you didn’t know you had.

These apps can recover deleted messages on Instagram, as well as files, texts, and audio. Both U.Fone and FoneLab have simple user interfaces and easy-to-follow instructions that guide you through recovering the specific data you’re searching for.

Although using third-party software is a common way to access old data, it’s best to do your own research before downloading and using any apps. Hackers sometimes create custom applications enticing users to download their software unwittingly, which means they could gain access to your personal data and use it without your knowledge.

Stay alert and cross-reference numerous sources before downloading any new applications onto your device (or offering up your account information).

3. Try Notification History on Android
Viewing Notification History may work to retrieve deleted messages for users operating with Android 11 and above. If you had Instagram notifications and Notification History enabled on your device before you deleted your messages, you can follow these steps:

Go to your settings
Click on “Notifications” and then select “Advanced settings”
Select “Notification History”
In Notification History, you can review all original messages received from Instagram, even if the sender has since deleted them. Just keep in mind that this only works if you had Instagram notifications turned on when you received the messages, and you can only see ones you received, not sent.
Call the administration of his school and voice your concerns.  They will do an investigation and find out if there is anything going on.  I knew a woman who did this same thing and she got caught because another teacher voiced their concern to admin.
Why are you focusing on your wife instead of the teenager she is grooming? Report her to the police and tell the kid’s parents! Put the child’s needs first, and let your pedophile wife experience the consequences of her actions. I don’t understand why you called your friend instead of CPS and the police. Whatever group she is coaching needs to be informed too! Whether she was a cheating on you is LESS important than the fact that she is grooming a teenager.
About 15 years ago my daughter’s (then 10) bff’s parents got a divorce leaving their entire family a wreck. J became like our second daughter. J’s father was confused and needed to talk so he started calling and texting me a lot for advice. At some point my husband mentioned nicely that all our communication was making him uncomfortable. I considered his feelings and immediately texted J’s father explaining that our communication needed to come to an end. PERIOD. he got the message and I handed my husband my phone with every single line of communication for him to read. I had also always stayed in the room while conversing with J’s father so there would be no hint of impropriety. My point being, although our conversations were strictly about J’s mental state and her crazy mother, it took only the most minor of comments by my husband to put an immediate end to those calls and texts. J’s father was astute enough to get it and we’ve never talked since and that was 15 years ago. J is now 24 we we love her so much and she’s very much part of all our lives still. It simply never even occurred to me to not take my husband’s feelings into account.
Call the police and notify the parents.  Make sure you have all of your evidence ready.  Your wife has made her bed and now she's going to have to lie in it.
1. Talk to a criminal lawyer not a family one. This largely hinges on your inability to know what is actually being said and more importantly, done

2. Following his advice will make it easier to determine whether it makes sense to go through her phone or hire a PI or not

What she is doing and how she is reacting is shady but may or may not amount to a crime. Determining that may impact you legally when it comes to a divorce, and yes also if you were DMing a 17 year old girl your world would be in flames by now, but it’s not for her because she’s not a guy

Third way: reach out to the kid’s parents, tell them you are concerned about their kid having private message conversations with your wife and describe her reaction, tell them that it has triggered red flags for you and that you have consulted a lawyer but that as of now you have only been able to confirm that the messages have moved beyond coaching for some time so nothing actionable for law enforcement. Tell them that if it was your kid, you’d like to know, and that whatever they do with this information is up to them

I would make sure that you brush up on defamation and harassment before you do this because if she ends up losing her job over it then you have a legal needle to thread as I doubt the parents will leave you out of it

This is not legal advice and I am not an attorney
Wait…she compared this to you talking with your kid brother? Lmao she is cooked
I’m going to go against this sentiment that people can’t be friends with a kid. We live in a very ageist society where people fight hard to keep different age groups segregated. This is easy because most people don’t take part in activities, usually sports, where it’s common to interact closely with a diverse group of people from different ages, races, and walks of life.

Do you think that she FUCKED this kid? If not, then you don’t really have anything here. It’s not inappropriate to just talk to someone.

You claim she makes strange comments, but you’re already incredibly biased. Give examples.

It is perfectly possible that she just likes talking to this kid but has no plans for it to go further beyond that. If that’s the truth, then it is YOU who is in the wrong and blowing up your marriage for nothing (maybe you even want it to end and this is just your excuse).
Run to Reddit and ask a bunch of random autistics what u should do about a very serious problem 🤡 
Get in touch with the authorities. Pedo should be stopped no matter what
Turn her in to the police. She’s in a position of power and also a pedophile.
In my opinion you've handled this the wrong way and been way too lenient given that the suspicion is with a minor. You should have hired a private investigator or you should have went through her phone without her knowing. You felt the need to go to a public place and ask nicely giving her the perfect opportunity to ditch you and delete all the messages. Unless the police can scrounge up some incriminating messages your wife will probably just lay low with him for a while, or maybe even call it off entirely. This is going to cause you to doubt yourself. But the whole situation doesn't even make sense, she's coming home doting about how athletic and skilled he is for his age but then saying that she had to stay after practice with him because he wasn't getting it. Her threat to filed for a divorce just because you have suspicions about something that she has partially admitted to is extremely telling.
"Ok, maybe the texts aren’t just about soccer anymore, there’s nothing wrong with being friends with a kid, you’ve always been super close to your younger brother and I’ve never called you out for being “weird”."

Your wife being friends with a kid and you being close with your younger brother are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT dynamics. The fact that she even thinks they are comparable is scary. Something is definitely up.
If they were just talking as “friends” she would have handed over the phone. I have had gamer friends under 18 and not a single message I have ever had with them would I not happily post to the public
Get a private investigator
She ran to her friend rather than work through it with you. That alone tells you where her head is.

At BEST, this is an emotional affair. 
…with a minor. 
…and she’s 100% defending it.
…while trying to paint you as the asshole in the situation.

You know what needs to be done.
I honestly think you couldn't have handled this worse
If there was nothing going on she would have been open with you and showed you the messages. She’s being super defensive for someone who “isn’t doing anything”. Honestly, maybe I am terrible, I would go through her phone. 
My son texts with his coaches and will openly share the messages with his father and I. I suspect if there was something shady going on, he would not.
Didn’t see this part… Did you tell the kids parents? 

Sounds like he’s potentially a victim of grooming. Although you’re not a mandated reporter, you are morally obligated to loop them in.

There’s no way her version is true. I have coached 20 seasons of youth sports, destination imagination, and am a Cub Scout and Boy Scout leader. An adult leader texting a youth one on one violates every single youth protection training I’ve ever taken. There is no gray area.

She’s committed emotional infidelity (at least), lied to you, and it’s probably a pedophile. Telling the kids’ parents may trigger them talking to the police. Marriage is over either way. Full speed ahead with divorce lawyer.
It’s not normal at all.  But Why are you not concerned at all about the 17 year old minor? I don’t get your response nor the advice you’ve been given. She could be raping him for all you know. You need to report to police and Child services. Tell them she erased the texts when you confronted her. When you speak to child services you’re fact based. Don’t give any theory or suspicion. It’s their job to investigate.
Ask HER to explain the things you’ve observed that have changed. Tell her if something is going on and the police get involved they will be able to access her phone history including Instagram as well as the boys phone and accounts. If he is the person she’s been talking to, it’s inappropriate. She should not be talking with a student that much. Is there someone else she’s talking to? Why did her comments progress from telling you about the kid to saying things about how attractive his eyes are and such. I get the feeling that something is going on that shouldn’t be, either with this kid or another person. If you imply that the police are going to get involved (not necessarily by you) it will destroy your marriage and her career and as much as you’d like to believe her, there’s been a distinct change in her behavior (secretive about who she’s talking to, the amount of time spent which is inappropriate with a student, and the ways her comments about this went from professional to personal. You can’t hide your behavior, especially to someone so close that knows when something has changed in their routine demeanor and/or behavior. Even if you looked at her phone, she might have deleted the messages (the police should be able to get them though) so that’s not going to be much help. She’ll either have to confess, you’ll have to go to his parents or the police all of which could lead to problems with her and possibly divorce. If nothing is going on, why the distinct changes in her behavior and her personal comments and the amount of time on her phone with someone?
File for divorce and report her to the police
If you know, or can guess or if she writes her passwords down, you can access her cloud account backups. There may be something there. 

The whole "secretly" thing is what makes this suspicious.
The 17 year old can, at any time even years from now, report her to the police. If she is found guilty of having any sexual relationship with this kid, she *will* go to jail. 

Someone from my high school took a very weird path in life, and she went to jail for 3 years for having sex with a minor. 

If your wife had nothing to hide, she would have handed her phone over. You'd know her phone code. It would have been something you would have laughed about together. 

She sounds guilty. I'd divorce. 
YTA…Where is your sense of duty to protect this kid from someone running off the rails? You have an absolute duty to determine whether you are supporting someone criminally victimizing a minor. Besides none of her responses are rational, mature adult responses. It’s all just cover and it’s gone much further than you are seeing. You are heading for being on the hook for criminal charges yourself.
NTA. Anything innocent would have been immediately shared with you. Her reaction is a form of guilt, and you need to respond with continuing with your divorce. She has had time to delete all the messages, and a person that was not guilty would have no need to delete anything, so your answer is there. And, you need to inform the parents of the kid involved that his coach is giving him extra special treatment that the coach has deleted the messages between the two of them. 

She can not give you those messages, but as an adult, you have an obligation to the parents of the minor child to make sure they are aware of the interaction between their child and an adult coach. You are not overstepping your place in making sure the parents are informed. If it is nothing to see here, great, but you are not in the position to be sure of that as your wife has not given you the option of viewing the messages, so you are morally obligated to inform the parents. That is what a good person would do.

Again, anyone who invokes privacy in a committed monogamous relationship is displaying signs that the relationship is no longer a committed monogamous relationship. She can say whatever she wants, but her actions show different, and you can remain in a one-sided relationship if you choose, but she definitely is. Her actions show she has put her interactions with this other person before you and your marriage, she has, not you. Do not feel bad for asking, her actions impact your marriage, and her inability to be transparent shows she has something to hide and has gone to lengths of leaving the home to keep hidden.  That is the crux of the disagreement. And, then, she doubles down with saying that YOUR actions are making her consider divorce. She has pulled out all of the signs of a guilty person and someone not to be trusted.

Protect yourself and let all parties interested understand that you want to know about a relationship she has with a minor child that she coaches, and she refuses to let you see their messages, so she won't try to spin it into something else. Get ahead of this so you won't be the bad guy, which her actions so far has shown that she will go to any length to protect her secrets and that is a dangerous person.

Be Well my friend and let the parents of the child know about their correspondence. Any parent would want others to do that for them.

Updateme!
She's clearly gaslighting you. She's likely deleted all traces of communication and she's likely going to try to tone down her behavior to "prove you wrong" and label you as the bad guy. But, long term, this is likely a pattern that won't be broken without some SERIOUS intervention and life changes. That's on her to do it. You can't fix her. 

It's probably best to view the relationship you once had as lost, and you likely won't be able to mourn it until this craziness is in the rear view. Your top two priorities are your and the minor's well being. Get that specialized lawyer and they should be able to help you navigate these rough waters, especially when it comes to your legal responsibility in all of this. Their advice may match a lot of these comments here, but follow the pro.
For what it's worth, the US Safe Sport rules (that I'm certain she has had training on) very clearly say no private contact between a minor and a coach. The kids parents should be CCd on all communications. If you are a safe sport coach yourself, I'm pretty sure you have an obligation to report this (you can do so anonymously). They'll investigate and determine next steps.

As for the marriage, I can't offer advice there. These are never easy situations and a lot hinges on just how much she's said or done with this child.
I have a 17 year old nephew and i have to warn him about women like your wife all the time. She is wrong 100%. Trust your gut.
She couldn't look more guilty if she tried.
She’s in a position of trust. What she is doing is not ok.
Police
No matter what, you can never get around how liars react when they are questioned. They either admit it. Or they blow up. Invariably, they blow up. Innocent people may be angry but they don’t hide anything because there is nothing to hide. 

And now you have to process that gut-punch of trust that is gone.
Turn her in
If I want to look at my wife's phone she just hands it to me and the reverse is also true. Privacy isn't a concern when you've literally done nothing wrong. But that's not the issue.

It's that she became emotionally violent, tried to deflect heavily, made this a completely different issue than what you were concerned with, began name calling and accusing you of doing wrong, played victim, exonerated herself without providing proof, and made you the villain.


Get out.
Your lawyer friend did not, unfortunately, give you good advice. This boy is still a minor. Regardless of your wife being this child’s coach, it is a little odd that she has access to his own private phone. Sorry, but as a parent, that’s just a no for me. I know we live in an age where most kids have their own mobile phones now. But the parents should still be involved with any of that. From a psychological standpoint, she was defensive because she got caught and sadly she’s looking pretty guilty right now. Then she pulled the classic gaslighting move on you to try to make you feel like you are paranoid.

If she IS guilty (of any suspicious activity with a minor) then, Sir, I hope you find a way to come to terms with how serious this is.
As a coach there should be no private communication with athletes that aren’t sent via email. I coach and refuse to accept anyone on any social media or text with them. We have an app and email that all communication must go through. Is this a club sport or school sanctioned?
Yep she's trying to gaslight you into feeling like you're overreacting. 

You're not. You will have a harder time proving this now with deleting messages etc but you should get this proven and reported. 

I'm sorry how fucked this must be
She's doing serious damage control and trying to throw the carrot of I'll let it slide this time but I'll divorce next time. She's panicking because this will destroy her life. She's a ped@phile and she's gonna get caught. Deleting the evidence on her phone is futile because telcos are legally required to keep records of texts and phone calls for seven years. It can be subpoenaed by a lawyer or court
You could call child protective services and provide them with the information but request to be anonymous to other people viewing the case including her
"you’ve always been super close to your younger brother and I’ve never called you out for being “weird”. this is it. this is everything you need to know. she is making an absolutely irrational comparison. being close to a sibling of any age is NOT the same as being close to a minor.


>Her long message didn’t actually explain why she had been messaging this kid so much and for so long, or why she had been spending literal hours every evening locked in our bedroom or on the sofa just on her phone.



>She started making strange comments about his looks, athletic abilities, and personal qualities that went beyond her usual enthusiasm for coaching. Meanwhile, she’s become much more secretive with her phone and is often late home from practice without clear explanations. 

Do not be gas lit. Contact his parents, explain your suspicions. Have then check his phone. Get a lawyer.
I am so sorry that you are dealing with this kind of drama.  I wanted so badly to believe that your wife was innocent and just truly trying to offer assistance to her student but with each update that is getting harder to believe.  I hope you get a resolution and find some peace soon.
Updateme!
I didn't originally see your first post (clicked the link), but reading all of this from an outside perspective and one familiar with abuse - your wife is showing no signs of being innocent. I don't think you should try and look at her phone (most anything that doesn't fit her narrative has been deleted anyway), but please do get yourself a proper lawyer for this. You don't deserve to suffer the blowback for her actions. I'm sorry this is happening to you, OP. I'm sure you're still reeling.
!updateme
That lawyer gave horrible advice. Now that you confronted your wife, I’m sure she has deleted anything incriminating and covered her tracks. You should always act normal and gather as much evidence as possible before confronting them.
Sounds like a female pedophile will blame her dad for touching her when she was 5 and you’ll be in trouble for invading her privacy. The outcome is men are wrong
I'd encourage your wife to seek counseling.  Communicating like this with any student, even if she were single, is inappropriate.  Hiding texting for hours? Wtf.  It's mind blowing how people don't understand professional boundaries.  She should be very worried about losing her job or getting sued.  
Now do you want to be Will Smithed? I couldnt share my life with a Jada. Good luck brother
She's definitely doing something. Nails all the steps of being a lying douchebag - denial, blame, denial, admittance to lesser thing, denial, blame, gas lighting, and then the all important 'I'm angry with YOU for being concerned about something most normal people would be concerned about, but I will forgive YOU'. 

File for divorce ASAP my dude.
It’s ok if you leave her. I’m thinking of leaving mine. It’s totally normal. 
Private investigator private investigator private investigator your free lawyer royally screwed you allowing any and all evidence your wife had of the fling to be deleted. 

Your story has been covered on YouTube strong successful male. 
Some good advice there.
Call the parents anonymously, claim you are a parent of one of the other kids on the team, tell them their kid has been saying some concerning things about their coach and you've noticed they seem way closer than any of the other players and as a parent you'd want to know if your kid was in a situation like that. If they are half decent parents they'll immediately jump in and find out what's going on. Protects the kid and yourself.
UpdateMe
Go to his parents. Go to a lawyer. If this does reach the police, deleted comments can be retrieved. Do not take her word, you are right in being concerned.
Double down on seeing the messages, nothing seems normal and her defensive reflex is super suspicious. If there was nothing to hide she’d have thrown the phone in your face and told you to knock yourself out and just been super pissed at you. 

That she ran away, stayed at a friends house and then gave a long ass message in the middle of the night just screams “damage control”

By now she’s probably deleted everything though since she knows you’re suspicious.
Sounds like she is trickle truthing. Followed by believe me or accept the consequences. Truly manipulative behavior. In my opinion. Will need an update I hope all turns out well for you or at least as well as it can be.
Wow, her blowing up, and you took the least antagonizing route possible...
If she uses an iPhone, check the files on iCloud.
I still think this whole thing is made up
Updateme!
Damn … the fact that she compared this to you being friends with your little brother … wtf
>Ok, maybe the texts aren’t just about soccer anymore, there’s nothing wrong with being friends with a kid, you’ve always been super close to your younger brother and I’ve never called you out for being “weird”.

Um - is she really trying to make an equivalence between you being close to your *brother* and her being close to a kid she coaches?

Tell her if it's not inappropriate - would she disclose to the other coaches the nature of her friendship? Would she disclose to the kid's parents?

It's really time to start considering telling on her.
This is clearly gaslighting, someone who has nothing to hide, could be outraged but show the messages, but she ran away like a coward, delete the messages and say there was never anything weird.

Please this is over, find a good divorce lawyer
Report her to whoever she is coaching through (like her employer) and/or the child’s parents. Your marriage worries aside, this is a child and potentially a massive breach of trust and power. Also, if you are aware of the situation and do nothing.. when the shit hits the fan you will be dragged into mess you don’t want to be part of.
I really hesitate to say that she actually did cross a line with the kid from what I've read. You say your suspicions are correct, but where's the proof? This is a pretty serious accusation.

I'm 37F, considered by most to be attractive. I've had old AND young men shoot their shot. I was surprised by how many young ones, believing the tropes that women are no longer considered desirable after their 20s and that men would aim younger most of the time. Not true! They don't care nearly that much.

I was a community worker and recruited lots of college-aged volunteers. Some of them I bonded with, I would consider one or two of them to be friends. I had got them doing personal assistance tasks for me because I trusted them, and they liked me enough to do it. We talked openly about controversial topics, including sex.

I was frank with them, saying I'd never dated anyone more than 5 years younger and had no plans to; I have qualms about age-gap relationships, I think it speaks to being psychologically stunted somehow for the older person. But if you ever heard the wrong conversation, maybe you could get the wrong idea about the nature of the relationship.

She absolutely could be gaslighting you. Or, she could be feeling conflicted herself for her feelings of admiration and temptation with someone she shouldn't. It's hard to say because you don't have concrete proof. That said, I would 100% hand over my phone to my partner if they ever questioned me about my relationships with my students. I would pour out all the honesty I could think of to clear my name with you. That's how I would handle it. But people respond imperfectly sometimes. I don't know how to dig to the bottom of it. It would really suck if she were accused of that and innocent of misconduct.
Your wife is a predator, dude. Case closed. Contact that kids parents and divorce that bitch. “Making friends” with a teenager is NOT FUCKING NORMAL
Speaking as a professional coach, even if it were just friendly Instagram DMs, that would be professionally unethical and entirely inappropriate. Just like it would be for a teacher, or something similar. Others have mentioned the other elements and huge red flags so I won't bother pointing those out as well, but if she cares at all about her job (or you still care on her behalf, or for the kids she's jeopardizing even) this is a problem.
Okay, I hate this but I don't see anyone else doing it here so fuck it, I'll be the Devil's Advocate.

Someone has to, I guess.

OP, is there any merit to what she is saying regarding you and your closeness with your brother? I don't mean conceptually, I mean "are the age gaps similar between you and your brother, and she and this kid she tutors"? 

If so, then perhaps she-

No I can't do this.

OP.

When I was in HS we all had a favorite teacher, he oversaw a club. 

Young guy, married, had a fresh kid, and he befriended some of the seniors (had them over to watch movies and stuff with his family).

He was also grooming the fuck out of one of us. His wife noticed, called him on it, *and he used almost the exact same reasoning as your fucking wife did to justify it*.

He saw us as "younger siblings".

One day she leaves him and takes the kid.

A year later and he's dating the (freshly 18) kid he was grooming.

Four years after that and he's staring down a 25-year prison sentence *because he eventually stopped caring about age*.

OP your wife is on a path that will lead to her ruination, and you can choose to stomach the burden of knowledge silently, or you can start talking to people. Was she groomed as a teenager by anyone?

Hurt people hurt people, after all.
Bro don’t fall for her reverse psychology narcissistic bullshyt.
She sounds like the teacher from that "Teacher" movie
My husband is a youth soccer coach and has coached different age groups...
His communication regarding players or the team as a whole goes thru a group chat directed to the parents; he NEVER for any reason msgs the kids directly regardless of age... 

If she's to stupid to see what she did was very inappropriate, even if the msgs were innocent (definitely not), then you should divorce her asap. 
She is opening herself up for legal issues and you shouldn't have to be dragged thru that because she's a moron talking to a minor. 

My step daughter just turned 18 but played soccer for a different team a few years back. She had a male coach and you best believe, if I had ever found any conversations like your stating between them, I'd be going to his ass....period! 👏
As the mother of a son the same age, please tell the police and the parents.
Man, if my wife was doing this, the last place I would go for help is reddit.  Now, if I was trying to get some quick karma...
Private investigator.  Gather all the evidence you can.
Do not involve the police unless you have hard evidence.  

Look, let her get busted, just sit back relax and watch.
Oh that evidence is loong gone you should have snooped and sent screenshots to your phone when you had the chance.
I think you messed up by confronting her like that. Pay a proper attorney who will help you with a legal strategy, not just a one-off “hey, try this” by someone who isn’t really invested. This may be very hard to prove now after she deletes everything and gets the boy to do the same.

Whatever the case, her reaction showed a lot of peculiar sensitivity. She may not be physical with this kid, but whatever it is, she knows it to be inappropriate.
\> Should I still try to look through her phone anyway, despite what she’s told me?  

That would be pointless. She has had time to cover her tracks and delete incriminating messages.  

Honestly, just agree to get a divorce. Whether or not she is cheating on you and raping a teenager (she is probably doing both), she is treating you poorly and threatening you with divorce for *questioning* her is a fairly transparent tell. I mean, seriously, she compared starting to date a kid that she's coaching with you being friends with your bother? C'mon.  

The only thing I don't know how you should approach is how to protect this kid. You don't know for sure that she is raping him, but surely someone should talk to the kid and make sure. Maybe you can speak to the police about it and leave it in their hands? At least then there will be some kind of record if anyone else happens to see and report something.
Updateme
Go to the police 🙏🏻🙏🏻
You need to tell law enforcement because it sound very inappropriate. Her text (unless actually written by her friend) shows you she is not the person you married, not the person you love. divorce her
This is why you gotta dive into the phone FBI style straight away.
The best defense is a good offense, and your wife is excelling at it.  The fact that she's sooo freaked out about your questioning things tells me she knows damn well that this relationship is inappropriate.  In a healthy relationship, she should have set professional boundaries with the kid at the beginning.  If the kid needed psych counseling, she should have referred him to the school psych.

People who have nothing to hide, hide nothing.  I know this hurts A LOT, but is this really what you want in a wife/partner?
You showed your hand too early. YOUR bests bet, is getting the fuck out.

Good luck, OP. You need it.
Maybe she was “just flirting “ and nothing happened physically. I’m not sure what happens in that gray area. (Is that legal? Idk but morally definitely not) But if so, would you still want to stay married to her?
If she is a coach under the USOC, it is generally monitored by SafeSport.  Baring in mind you're in the US. 

You can file a SafeSport complaint here:  https://uscenterforsafesport.org

They will conduct a thorough investigation, and as a part of her coaching agreement, she has given SafeSport permission to do so. 

Whether you begin with SafeSport or the police is your call.  Just adding a tool to the toolbox.
Report her to the police, he is under age. Also the divorce will be easier for you if she has criminal charges.
Hit up the fucking kid.
Too long to read. Don't care

Would you consider reaching out to the kid’s parents? Maybe the organization that she coaches through? You could probably do so anonymously. As a former child athlete, there are many relationships that I and my friends had with coaches that seemed friendly and fun that ultimately crossed the line looking back (grown adult men snapchatting underage girls, commenting on our bodies, etc.). 

There is no reason for a married adult to be constantly and secretly messaging a 17 year old, even if nothing explicitly sexual is happening.  Even if she isn’t doing anything illegal, this doesn’t seem like the type of person you want to be married to. Freaking out at you for “violating her privacy” is sign enough that she’s got something to hide.
Report her to the organization she coaches for. Be matter of fact and direct describing her comments about him, and send the text she sent you with the part about it being more than just coaching soccer highlighted/bolded. Suggest they investigate and inform the boys parents. 

Chances are just having private Instagram contact crosses their official conduct standards. Also because it’s children involved, you’ll get the eyes of mandated reporters involved and they will make the call on informing the police or not.
Bro don't be a lame, just leave. She's obviously gaslighting you. 2 years isn't that long, you got off easy.
You blew your chance to get the truth from her. Next, I would contact a divorce lawyer and then this kid’s parents if under the advice of your attorney. They can confiscate his phone and look through it.

Your marriage is over. Her reaction and message are all so far from normal you know the truth even if she won’t admit it.
Damn they will walk all over you given the chance. I would take her up on her offer for the divorce on principle alone. Besides if she did do something with the kid, she’s up the creek once the word gets out.
If I ever strongly suspect someone of grooming I will violate their privacy and look through their device . IDGAF
Don't minimize this, she is grooming that young man.  It's tough b/c she's your wife but this is at best wildly inappropriate and most likely heinous behavior with potential legal repurcussions.  I'd divorice immediately and get your half of whatever before that kid's family sues for everything you have.
Get out now while you can. If you stay with her it's going to be hell for you and you'll be stuck in a marriage with someone who most likely has some type of personality disorder or something. It's not your fault, she played you and got you to think she was a good person and now the mask is off. It sucks to be in your position, I've been there myself but trust your instincts and run from this woman.
Updateme
I would know all I need to know to be out.
Hummm…you could go quiet with her for a bit, to give her the impression you have cooled off, and hire a good private investigator to follow her and gather evidence.  Hopefully there is none. Eesh tho.  Good luck hon.
You have to accept how crazy this whole situation is. Get perspective.  You right now cannot see the forrest for the trees as the saying goes. Like others have said: Contact a lawyer first and share your suspicions with the parents(unless your lawyer advises you not too).  Also remember she is not just cheating...she may be committing multiple felonies. Protect yourself. Now. Not tomorrow. Not in a week. Immediately.
Should’ve looked through her phone.
Call a lawyer and get your shit together cause it’s time to leave. You cannot trust her and she is a predator!
Your best bet. Go to the kids house and talk with the parents. The evidence will be on the kids phone as much or more than your wife’s.

You have strong suspicions. You need to take strong action because this is serious and at a minimum they need to NEVER see eachother again.
Not collecting evidence first was a massive mistake.
My initial response on your original post was that you may have been overreacting. Her reaction gives me pause.  There's something she's not disclosing.  But your title makes it sound like there was an admission.  There's still nothing concrete here. She may feel guilty of something that hasn't happened.  She may feel guilty or have a fight or flight response because she's entertained some forbidden thoughts. She may feel flattered or aroused and doesn't know how to handle it.  Or something did happen.  

Her reaction is a little extreme for me. In the face of possible criminal accusation, running away isn't a reasonable response. I would do what you can to gain her trust.  "We're in this together. I'm here for you. We need to get our story straight. Etc."  so that you can get to the bottom of it and know what you're dealing with.
Updateme
Ggs in the chat for you my boy. That 17 is going to turn into 18 and there goes your marriage.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but she is gas lighting you. That and you shouldn’t have shown your hand before having proof. You just gave her time to delete every piece of evidence you had against her. 

The comparison between you and your brother and her and this random kid is absolutely appalling. That’s your sibling, this is some random teenager she’s been messaging outside of practice and spending alone time with. 

Do you have any other Apple devices her account is synced up to? You could access her texts on that device if so. You go through your phone carriers call and text logs for each line on your plan. You can easily piece together a timeline of calls and texts made to this kid to get an idea of how much they’re talking. 

I would be on HIGH alert if I were you, all signs leading to her having inappropriate relationships with this kid.
Nah bro your gut is right
I would jump straight to marriage counseling.

Let her know that her reaction was irrational and not remotely reassuring and if she wants to remain married she'll agree to counseling.

Let her know the counseling will require increased transparency on her part. Her privacy outrage is bullshit.

The other threat you have in your back pocket is that you'll tell the kid's parents why your marriage is in crisis. That seems like a real nuclear option so maybe if you got to a point where you'd threaten that, you'd already be at the point of giving up on the marriage.
I just read the original post you made and I find it interesting that she commented multiple times how he's so much more athletic and "developed"  than the other kids at soccer but now she's saying he needed extra help? That's odd. Is he great or is he struggling? She can't keep her story straight. 

Honestly, these things are kinda innocent on their own but all together scream something is going on.
I see people mentioning speaking with the 17yr old.

Did you discuss this with your lawyer friend??

I would be super concerned that I would get into trouble somehow for talking to the kid without another adult present, and it seems especially sketchy to approach the kid with 'She confessed everything' and record him like this a cop show.

Depending on what has actually gone on here, this kid is a victim....
She probably has already tried to get rid of evidence now
If you have suspicions then you have every right to protect yourself.  Show up to a practice and see if anything feels off. Or track her car and see if they are practicing anything else after practice.
[Reminds me of this.](https://youtu.be/PfDX6EEI5IE?si=-jF6z-a24Hi-HK24)
God, but at what point is he failing to be a mandated reporter? In a lot of states you are REQUIRED to report, no matter your profession, if you suspect child or elder abuse. He's really in a fucked up position. I would obtain an attorney in the correct space IMMEDIATELY and proceed with their advisement. u/max_Manford

**EDIT: Since people are not bothering to read further comments or do a quick Google on the matter, yes, you as a layperson, can be a mandated reporter. I will address US, UK, Canada.**

**MANDATED REPORETER:** In several states, EVERYONE is required to report suspicion of elder and minor abuse (ex: [Florida](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099/0039/Sections/0039.201.html)), in [Canada](https://cwrp.ca/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#:~:text=Do%20I%20need%20to%20report,suspected%20child%20maltreatment%20by%20law), EVERYONE is a mandated reporter except in the Yukon Territory, in the UK it is said that everyone SHOULD be a mandated reporter, but there is no legal consequence (they have suggested [legislation](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/news/2024/may/mandatory-reporting-child-sexual-abuse#:~:text=The%20duty%20to%20report%20child,they%20witness%20the%20abuse%20happening) to change it to everyone) and it is blurry whether there are protections in place for spouses.

**The AGE.** In MANY states, it does not MATTER how close the child is to 18, as long as the child is under 18, they are therefore a minor, a child, there are [exceptions](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cb/capta.pdf), but I will not list all 50 state laws. In the UK, it is the [same](https://nya.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/position-of-trust-guidance-1.pdf), they are a minor at 17, and in Canada, it is the [same](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/clp/faq.html), they are a minor at 17.  
**Now, REGARDLESS OF AGE and/or age GAP** (which can matter in some US states), there is still a potential crime and/or reason for termination when in a coach/teacher role and engaging with a minor. I do not think this applies to a spouse of the coach/teacher when the student is either a minor in an unprotected state or not a minor. HOWEVER, it can lead to issues legally, where the spouse may appear prejudiced.

**WHY OP should speak to a lawyer in the correct field BEFORE taking action.**

1. If everything is above board and legal, in a potential divorce, his actions could look like prejudice and be used against him when dividing assets/property/spousal support/etc
2. If they were considered a mandatory reporter, WHY did they wait? Have a lawyer walk them through the right steps to carefully explain WHY they waited, how they waited for legal advice to know how to report, etc. Protect themselves legally
3. The lawyer should then suggest the action that most likely provides protection for the minor, with or without proof from the coach. Is that warning of the parents? (What if they don't care), report to the police? (what if they want more evidence), report to the school/coaching team? etc.

**Now, stop replying TO ME with your dumbass responses** about **how this isn't possible.**
The police have been contacted, but as of now, there aren’t any legal grounds to pursue anything. I’ll provide more details in the next update, but I want to approach this carefully without completely destroying her trust. I haven’t gone through her phone, but I did reach out to our shared network provider, and after explaining the situation, I was able to get some limited information on her recent contacts.

One challenge is that I actually don’t know who the kid is. I’ve never met anyone on the team she coaches, and I don’t remember any specific names she’s mentioned before. Without knowing more, it’s tough to involve his parents directly, though I’m definitely trying to make sure I’m doing everything right. Thank you for the advice and concern, it really helps to hear different perspectives.
If there is any evidence left, this is most likely way to obtain it.
OP, this is your answer.
Yes!!! Absolutely reach out to the parents or if it feels too weird to idk. Get your friend or a friend to do it.  I know the conversation could be very awkward but they need to know.  They can decide how to proceed on the part of their child  which takes that off your shoulders and might get you an answer. Then focus on what to do next.
Serious question, what if he's deleted everything from his phone? 

Also OP: your wife has certainly deleted anything incriminating if not all communications with the kid by now. Try going directly through your phone provider to get details if you want to try and look at her phone.
Thank you for the advice.  
To be completely honest, I worry that somehow this will come around to bite me if I get the parents of the child involved. I realise this sounds crazy and I should probably tell them immediately but I don't want to be blamed for something I am not at all involved in. At this point I am just trying to sort some stuff out before filing for a divorce. My plan is to tell my parents of the child as soon as the divorce is final.  
I also have no way of contacting his parents as of now as I have no idea who the kid actually is. I have only seen his name on instagram but have never met him personally.

I will be updating soon for the most recent developments to the situation.
Then ask her why she felt so guilty that she had to delete the conversations. OP knows of at least one particular time that she was likely talking to him (when she was on the couch smiling that smile). If she claims she hasn't deleted anything then if that conversation is missing...
Look in Deleted messages and photos. Sometimes they forget those folders
I don’t understand why OP told her his suspicions before he got evidence. In his first post, we were all telling him to go through her phone first to get evidence cause she’s going to delete it after he confront her.

Confronting a cheater there’s like a 20% chance they admit it. If it’s with a minor, there’s a 0% chance they admit it & 100% chance they delete all the evidence. It’s possible to still find evidence, but now it’s a thousand times harder & you’ve got nothing to tell the cops other than a hunch. OP is either a total fucking idiot for giving her the heads up - or he wants to know it’s true but didn’t want to report her so he didn’t actually want the evidence
Your phone carrier often has a record of text messages online and they can be accessed either just by logging into your account or you need to contact their support sometimes but just because it's deleted from the phone doesn't erase its existence. Just need to be an authorized user on the account
Many people may not know that deleted conversations, go into a “recently deleted messages” folder on iPhones. It was a feature that was seemingly released silently.

If the wife isn’t used to being secretive, then she may not have cleaned out that folder.

Regardless, I wouldn’t recommend going thru it. Where there’s smoke there’s fire; and the only thing that snooping will do is cause scars.
Yeah. It is probably time to reach out to the principle and the kid's parents. He may not have deleted his messages.
I really don’t like jumping to conclusions like this but it really does seem that way. If there was nothing untoward going on she would’ve just shown OP the messages and said ‘see? Fuck you for thinking I was a creep’.
Dead giveaway #1 is her being "noble" and telling him she would forgive him if he never questioned her again. Dead giveaway #2 the bogus comparison to him having a good relationship with his brother. OP you should move forward with divorce and inform the parents of the boy you believe there could be an inappropriate relationship and let them handle things legally if they want.
If it were what she says she would have shown OP the messages. If it were just that they got a little too friendly then she would totally understand his concerns, and show him the messages that prove there isn't anything actually illegal going on.

I would put money down on something inappropriate beyond just being 'friends'.
If it had been so innocent, she wouldn't have reacted like he'd just murdered a baby right there in front of her. She's guilty as fuck.
And she compared him having a relationship with his younger brother to this…INSANE!
Im 34 and hard fucking pass. I don't want to talk to 17 year olds. Not even because of the implication, just we have nothing in common. The wife is suspect.
Me too. And I work with a bunch of kids. I would NEVER. They are so young
I am a 56 year old guy, and any time I hang around teens or kids that are not my own, I make sure other adults are present as witnesses.
I'm 23 and have no desire to be friends with children. I am kind and cordial with my brother's friends, but I don't even want to be in the same room with them when they're over. They're too loud. This is definitely not normal behavior from his wife.
Exactly, it’s fucking gross
Yeah especially ones you’re supposed to be in charge of. This is fucked.
Shit I havent made a friend or even willingly talked to anyone under the age of 20 since i was in highschool and im in my early 30's.
It doesn't have to be skeezy, but you as the adult have to careful with boundaries.

I'm in my thirties and I have some teen friends through online gaming. Number one rule is, if their parent looked through our occasional talks, would they have a reason to worry about them talking to me? It's not that I'm close friends with them, but there have been times where came they to me with relationship problems and stuff like that, I guess things they needed advice with, but didn't want to ask parents or friends. I was there for them, but I was VERY careful of how I talk. I'm happy to be a supportive adult for any youngster that needs one, I wish I had one as a teen, but it's my responsibility as an adult to ensure the kid is safe around me.

The wife not only failed that, she exploited the power dynamic between them.
or 2+3...  maybe the kid's parents can get you evidence from HIS phone assuming your wife didn't get him to delete it already, but if there was any sexting it's likely a 17 year old would keep those photos...
I think after everything that has occured, I don't see anyway of forgiving her. Unfortunately, she has deceived me and I am grieving the loss of the person who I though i knew so well and have loved for so long.  
The relationship is over, lawyers are involved.  
At this point, there are no legal ground for the police to act on anything, she is even still allowed to coach for the time being  
I just wish I could go back in time and undo everything from the moment I met her because this all just feels like way too much to cope with at the moment.  
Everything I thought i knew in my life is falling apart and I'm a huge mess at the moment.  
Through contacting our shared service provider, it's been revealed that there is even more that shes been hiding from me.  
I will give more details in my next update.
Well said, but IF he does #3, his wife is going to hear about it & she will be beyond furious at Op for 'going behind her back, embarrassing her & possibly ending her career'. In her eyes, it would probably be unforgivable, whether she's being inappropriate with this kid or not, so I'd only do #3 if I'm also definitely doing #2. I think it'd be best to go with #2 for now & get the lawyers opinion on if Op should be notifying the parents, that'd be a big, big deal.

Personally, if I were in Op's shoes, I think I'd be done with the marriage. The trust is gone & if there's no trust, there's no marriage. She obviously ran off to go deep clean her phone & get the kid to do the same, hopefully there's still info in a deleted folder. What she did is NOT the reaction of an innocent person who's being falsely accused & wants to clear their name, it was a fight or flight response & she had to get away from Op & try to justify her actions later. 

When she finally wrote that long message to Op at 3am attempting to cover her ass, I believe that's when she had just gotten done sanitizing her phone of all evidence of sexting / diddling / grooming this poor kid. Unfortunately, I believe the only way to get Instagram to pull transcripts of the conversations between Op's wife & the kid is through the police. I feel so bad for Op, what a messed up situation he's in, it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. If he tells the parents, his marriage is done for sure because he may be wrong. If he doesn't tell the parents & she is fooling around with this kid, the abuse could have stopped at a sooner time. Additionally, you'd think if there's something going on, the parents would be suspicious as well on their own.
2. and 3. together seems like the perfect solution to this entire situation
OP's wife most likely deleted the messages on her end. Telling the kid's parents about it could secure evidence from the other side of the conversation.
This op
I agree with this response. I am someone who wants to believe in the good in people but no one falsely accused of something as serious as this would react in the same way as your wife did. If unwarranted, sure I could see why she might feel in the right to be angry. But that would only apply after having done everything on her end to clarify the situation. Which she clearly has not.

Next steps. Either offer her to talk to a couple's counselor together ASAP or retain a lawyer to start the divorce process.
While probably the correct answer long term, I can understand OPs hesitation. His life just got flipped upside down. They need to take a breather of a long weekend, and calm down, and then take the next steps.
Yeah. At this point does OP really even need to know the details? The trust is gone regardless.
[deleted]
Yeah I just read this saying “why the fuck would you…” 
And you know she texted the boy, “He knows, erase everything in case he tells your parents.”
Agreed. One more option is to play along, “I’m so dumb”, let wifey resume sketchy activity (she eventually will), then get evidence 
He’s a pussy for not making her hand over her phone
Honestly, that was terrible advice.
He should've had some evidence before confronting her. I would have gone thru any iPad or MacBook that is connected to her imessages. If that wasn't available absolutely find a way to go thru the phone and read thru messages. Played his hand too early and now any evidence is definitely deleted from her end.
That evidence is NOT gone. Authorized users and especially the police or other authorities can access deleted texts.
I wrote this to OP on his first post, but there were so many, I assume he didn't see it... hopefully, he'll see it now.   

She's still doing *something* that she feels guilty about... or should I say, *someone*?    

She's got a PHD in gaslighting, my friend, and that’s a *major* red flag.   

She’s now told you that she's actively concealing something... how exactly are you paranoid??
Someone determined to cover their tracks will know how to erase texts, use hidden messaging apps, or otherwise stay off the radar.

**One approach might be to discreetly check in on her practices?**  

Just watching from your car could give you a sense of what’s going on without making a scene.  If parents are allowed at practice, she’ll likely be on her best behavior, but what happens after practice could tell you a LOT more.

**At this point, hiring a private investigator would be a very smart and proactive move.**    

**Yes, it might feel like a drastic step, and if you thought she was simply cheating with an adult, I might never suggest it.**  

However... considering the circumstances and the ramifications you/she could face, it could protect you from much larger consequences -- legally, financially, and reputationally.    

If she’s crossing lines with a minor, this is a **criminal offense**, not just a personal betrayal.   
She may not be his teacher per se, but she's still an adult who's in a position of power, and he's a minor.   This seems like a clear case of grooming. 
If this got out, her name would make headlines, and so could yours, dragging you into legal, financial, and reputational trouble.

A PI can discreetly gather facts and give you the clarity you need, as the stakes are incredibly high.   
Taking a proactive step now could save you a world of legal issues and a nightmare fallout down the line.   

*** FYI, a PI may not cost as much as you might think (could be anywhere between $200 - $2000 for surveillance).   
Plus, if they charge your credit card, it won't be listed as "Ray's Private Investigative Services", lol.  It will say something very ambiguous and non-descript, such as "Westfield Group",  "Paramount Solutions" or "Harbor Logistics".  Something like that.
Makes me think this is all bs. Plenty of people were advising him to hire a pi and stuff. Him following her himself would have been better than what he did. Doing what he did just allowed her to start hiding evidence.
It sounds like very shitty advice from the lawyer friend who suggested a confrontation before gathering evidence.  I’m feeling very frustrated on OP’s behalf for having such an idiot of a friend.
That was his evidence, enough to leave her at least
One of the only mature responses.
Granted I work with younger kids, but I am very aware that even the slightest inkling of impropriety and my career is over, proof of not. So EVERYTHING is transparent: every conversation, every moment spent together, etc so that I can cover my tracks if someone even thinks of making a false accusation. I don’t even have a moment where I allow myself to be alone with a kid. Putting myself in a vulnerable position doesn’t ever “slip my mind”, and I always have receipts god forbid. 

The fact that she is doing the exact opposite is shady AF.
why am I the only person in this thread that knows if you share a cell phone account with someone and you know the log-in info that many major carriers keep an online record of when texts are sent and to what phone number. It wouldn't give you the content, but it would show you the frequency, and the times. Maybe different if it's through imessage or DM only but I would at least freaking check.
Exactly. The OP opened the barn door, and now the cows have fled..

OP should now retain a divorce attorney and possibly hire a PI. Once the divorce papers are filed, the wife will double down on her relationship with the 17 year-old. I have a sneaking suspicion that she's waiting until the kid turns 18 to physically consummate their relationship, but she'll be grooming him in the meantime.

OP already knows that his wife is up to something but continues to hold out hope. Now that he foolishly informed his wife of his suspicions, she'll continue stonewall and gaslight him while consulting her own attorney.

OP should be advised to proceed with great caution. Any attempts to gain access to his wife's phone may be eventually used against him as a pretext to a future restraining order and accusations of psychological abuse. 

Based on OP's actions so far, I foresee a lot of grief and legal difficulties in his future. Hopefully, he'll see the light before it's too late.
She needed a lot of time to draft and edit an "appropriate" response and to avoid having to answer any further questions. She's trying to sweep it under the rug.
I know, poor guy... If she's normally as OP described (kind, respectful etc) this is a MASSIVE red flag. Like, car-dealership-American-flag massive. That all by itself is as good as an admission to me. And I know that smiling like you're talking to a new crush smile. It's not exactly subtle. 

I may be biased here. I regularly leave my phone unlocked and walk away for extended periods of time because I know everyone gets insecure on occasion and I don't want a partner to be afraid I'll bite their head off if they ask. So take it with a grain of salt, I guess. 

The part about this that really gets me is the fact that she admitted she was having some sort of inappropriate relationship with this kid but *still didn't show him the phone*. Like, she acknowledged his suspicions were valid and then had the audacity to still turn it around on him and refuse to prove whether is was sexual or not.
Can confirm, it’s in my employee handbook not to contact students outside of school for any non-school related things. We (meaning teachers) aren’t even allowed to be alone with a child in a room with the door closed. OP’s wife definitely overstepped some boundaries
"Plaything" is the most perfect and also most horrific word choice there, holy shit.
He could approach her friend for information. Could go any way.
Yeah. He can still get a copy of the messages from the kid’s phone with his fam’s assistance
that part weirded me out too! comparing to his BROTHER is just so so so weird.
I also can’t believe he chose to confront her. What else did he expect? For her to confess statutory rape and show him the evidence in the palm of her hand? I wouldn’t be surprised if she also has asked the kid to delete his messages too.
At the very minimum, she was grooming a student. 

There's just no debate to be had about this.  Objectively, she is aware what she is doing is very wrong, and that's showing in the way she has responded.
And if this is real, you are in legal jeopardy, playing with fire.
This exactly! I don't care if they're texting about what they had for lunch (which is certainly not the case here if they're texting all day), a 33 yo should not be sending little friendly texts to a 17 yo.
It's even written in the same dramatic format as all the fake Reddit posts. I am entertained though.
It probably is. OP hasn't made one single comment.
This is exactly what I thought of as well. Very clearly would *already* be reportable inappropriate behavior for safesport with no additional evidence other than the text she sent.
As far as advice to OP goes:  yes, you should go ahead and try to examine the phone, on the off chance she didn’t clean it.  (Who am I kidding?  Yeah, best of luck with that, pal; either that it hasn’t been scrubbed, or her allowing you to get within ten feet of it now.)

At this point you’re going to have to resort to tailing her after practice.  And she’s probably going to back way off for a while until she thinks things have blown over.  Don’t be surprised if the late hours after practice come to a sudden unexplained halt.  But look for other absences.
I just watched it
Lawyer first, parents second. NEEDS to know if he is a mandated reporter in his state, or he can have charges filed against him for child endangerment by not involving the police earlier.
Pretty much this exact situation happened with one of my best friends growing up & a teacher, it’s really not that far fetched
Sadly this situation is pretty common. I'm not saying OP is legit but this for sure happens.
Long exposé, not following logical next steps, not responding to comments... check, check, and check.  If it looks like a turd and smells like a turd, it's probably a turd.
Updateme
It’s absolutely made up. No lawyer would do or say what he described lol
Sure, but her phone has been wiped. The only way to preserve his, maybe, is the element of surprise.
At this point he lacks proof of inappropriate behavior having taking place. This might be loophole to mandated reporting.
YES this 100% - even being proxy to kids and an instructional setting via your wife - this definitely falls under mandated  reporting! Absolutely absolutely
In my state he wouldnt technically be a mandated reporter so yeah ask the lawyer
In the days of social media, I'm sure there is a Facebook page for the team, school etc.

Pull your phone records, you'll be able to track back the phone number.

Kids are stupid and attach their number to their social media.

Good luck man
you said she accepted him on her instagram! she’s probably removed him but it doesn’t hurt to look for a 17 year old in her following and in the likes/comments of her recent posts.
Can you figure out who he is by looking through her instagram contacts?
No, tell them now.

There is a minor at potential risk.

Have to be a little selfless here.
You need to tell his parents now
This is such confusing logic. For one thing divorces take years usually to be finalized. Do you mean finalized or after you file for divorce? If you wait years to report this or tell the kid’s parents you’re just as bad imo. I think the thing that would bite you in the ass most would be knowingly withholding this information and letting a minor be abused. Does that not make you complicit in some way? Either way best bet is to talk to a lawyer about it.
The only way you’ll be blamed is if you do nothing. There could be a legitimate crime against a minor happening. You could try reporting to the organization that your wife coaches through, I’m sure you could find a way to do so anonymously. A divorce could take months or years to finalize and since your wife has been tipped off I’m sure evidence is already being deleted on both ends. I know this is a terrible and unfair position you’re in, but waiting to report it is definitely not the smartest or most moral solution. I understand wanting to protect yourself in a divorce, but if your wife really is guilty of a crime, you could face consequences for not reporting it.
Your plan to tell the parents the minute you get a divorce protects you but it doesn’t protect the child. A lot can happen between him and your wife in the next few days and months. He needs to be protected. He needs an adult to be looking out for him. While I get that you are tremendously hurt by what is taking place you are an adult. You have resources and the full mental bandwidth to think through what is best and right. The boy has neither of those things. He has NO ONE looking out for him and his best interests in this situation.  Rest assured when I tell you your wife grooming him is NOT in his best interest.

Frankly, if you have knowledge of sexual abuse of a minor and you hold on to that knowledge because it best suits your personal interests you ARE culpable. Morally as well as by law. It is much more likely to come back and bite you if you do not tell than if you do. You think those parents aren’t going to ask why you didn’t protect their son as soon as you had suspicions? You think they’re not going to go to the law and tell them that you didn’t report that you had suspicions until after you took care of yourself? Because if I were a parent in this situation I absolutely would do that. I would be finding every mandated reporting law on the books and making sure you were arrested for breaking them all, if at all possible.

What your wife is doing to you is horrific but what she’s doing to this boy is evil. It has the ability to impact every single thing about his sexuality for the rest of his life. It has the ability to cause significant emotional trauma that will follow him the rest of his life. He’s so young. You are giving him a life sentence of so much pain and dysfunction.

There is no doubt you will be impacted emotionally as well. There is no doubt that you need to divorce this woman. There is no doubt you’re going to need a good therapist and a good lawyer. However, this is a situation where your needs to be placed on the back burner. A child is involved. The child is the priority. Trust me when I say by looking out for him you will be looking out for yourself. Legally and morally. 
Honestly you’re being extremely irresponsible at best and at worst, negligent and complicit. 

This isn’t some situation where she might be cheating and that’s all.

This is a KID. If you continue down this path, I’d say you’re even partially to blame. Be a responsible freaking adult. Holy shit.
In my mind, deleted conversations is an admission of guilt. 

And I would have confronted the kid by approaching him and telling him "she confessed to everything I just want to hear it from you" and then seeing what he tells op.
>  Sometimes they forget those folders

*scurries off to delete these folders*
Yes, look in messages trash.
They were talking on Instagram though, idk how easy those are to recover.
Yeah or any other device that would have access to her messages like a tablet or laptop. Apple really doesn’t seem to like cheaters and makes it pretty easy to catch them. Also if he’s the plan owner for the cellphones he could get records from the company. At least call/text counts times etc which he should get for his divorce.
Seriously. Or have someone stake out the late sessions, get pictures, ask her what she was doing, and catch her in a lie. 

Before confronting, always try to gather irrefutable evidence that they can’t wiggle out of. 
Exactly...he went to reddit for advice and then did the exact opposite of the advice but then still keeps posting updates. At the point wife has plausible deniability because he tipped his hand and most likely he will never know the real truth at this point
Because he doesnt want it to be true. All of the soft hands bullshit is him trying to avoid his feelings and/or suspicions. He doesn't seem to care there is a kid involved or any thought of illegality. 

He should report it to child protective services and let them conduct an initial investigation. This might kick the beehive with the wife...but she has already checked out anyway!
Came here to say this. Text and call logs are available upon request for authorized account holders.
Unless she gave him a heads up. OP royally fucked up tbh
Her ultimatum of "never bring anything like this up again or else divorced" is a dead giveaway
She IS a fucking creep and she’s projecting bc she got caught. He needs to report this immediately. She’s fucking repulsive.
I believe I said on your last post that I've never seen a case where someone exhibited these behaviors and didn't end up cheating.  The fact she not only snapped but ran away with her phone makes me think this is much, much worse that simply being a little inappropriate.  It was so extreme that it makes me think she knows she's looking at jail time
  Shes going to destroy all the evidence and have the kid do the same.  You may have to do some serious acting and pretend you've "come to your senses" and apologize and get her guard down.  That or some serious sleuth work.  I don't envy you.
She spent hours at her friends house deleting and manicuring that chat for hours for sure. He has no more opportunity to get anything from her phone.
Don’t 100% agree with this thought. If the cops came to investigate you would you let it happen since you have nothing to worry about? As for OP you have to catch them red handed. 

Any false accusation can ruin your wife’s life for a few years. I would tread lightly. Curiosity killed the cat.

Do I think she’s suspicious? Yes but you don’t have solid enough proof. Looking through her phone isn’t an option. You could hire a PI if you really want to know. If the PI doesn’t find anything then drop it.
The fact that she stormed out to stay at a friends place as HE was in the wrong but then spent hours thinking of a way to excuse he behavior while still offering 0 real information to ease his nerves……..
Also the whole "there's nothing wrong having a relationship with a minor..look at you and your brother" what is that?! Of course he has a relationship with his brother. It's not even almost the same situation. My son (13) had a woman add him on tik Tok and when she started passively dropping the "I'm going to shower now *kissy face*" or messaging him FIRST thing in the morning about her routine with her kids and stuff or telling him to lie to me to stay home from school because he was worried about a test. I was like NOOOOPE (she was the wife/mod for a guy he was friends with and played games with). She tried asking how close he lived to x city. I was like look if I was talking to your friends like that what would you think? If her husband/your friend read those messages what would he think? I watched the pieces click together on his head. Yeah no, she's gross and inappropriate as hell block that ish immediately.
This is the only right answer.

She might not have done anything yet, but she's grooming a minor/child.

Sorry OP. Your wife is unhappy in your marriage and is trying to feel young and wanted again.

Your marriage is over. Get ahead of it or she will fuck you over.

Edit - It boggles the mind that people are defending the wife here and trying to downplay this shit.

Roles reversed and it was a man in the position of power speaking to a 17 year old girl there would be a lynch mob in the comments calling him a pedophile.
Dead giveaway #3

>She said the fact that I would even question something like this means there’s probably something wrong with me and that I must be the one hiding something.

The old blame flip
I wouldn’t be surprised at all it happens but the thing is you can’t just falsely accuse someone. Being friends on Instagram is already inappropriate in my opinion. And him DMing her and her entertaining it is inappropriate.

OP needs solid proof. If they are doing anything sexual well then OP can easily find out by hiring a PI. It has to happen outside of both their homes if it is happening. A car, hotel, or when OP isn’t home.
Agreed
Exactly! I gasped at that. Apples to oranges, Lady!
Because she's a weirdo when you think about it.
Yeah….that’s a no…oof
Even called him weird and tried to make him feel
bad for having a loving relationship with his younger brother. The gaslighting is very strong with this one. Oh wow , that would’ve been the straw that broke the camels back for me. Doesn’t even respect family boundaries. I’d be out.
Where’s the guy with the list. Let’s add “Has relationship with kid brother” to it.
Dude I remember when my friends and I were all like 25 we were talking one day like "Would you ever date an 18 year old girl fresh out of high school?" 

and we were like nah - totally different world between then and now. 

If it's something 99.9% of the population doesn't do, it safe to consider it *weird* if your wife does it.
Exactly! I'm 32 and IMO, all teenagers excluding my kin are little shitheads. 

I lied. My kin included as well.
I vote for 2+3. If you live in a no-fault divorce state, just file and tell her “I don’t believe your explanations; and by not sharing your texts to back up your story, you’ve ruined my trust.” Then you could contact the parents and say that you aren’t sure what’s going on but that you know your wife has been having an inappropriate texting relationship with their son. Let them be the ones to involve the law if they discover something untoward. But you should take care of yourself by getting her out of your life. This must be absolute torment and I’m really sorry you’re going through it.
Is there not a governing body for coaches? This should be included in one of the options too. The club will not look kindly on the issue and will also perform an investigation that may be more thorough than OPs
mind you, I'm about to toss around political jargon I barely understand, despite a BA in Poli Sci. I read that the only way you can get a cell phone company to provide you with copies of texts that have been deleted but were sent on their network is to get a subpoena. (I also heard this echoed a bit when I went to my cell phone provider and tried to get logs of my incoming calls to find someone's number that I lost- they said they couldn't release them without a subpoena). My point is, even if they delete all the texts, messages, pictures.... there's still a way to obtain proof, though you'll have to go through the police in order to get a subpoena. GL OP. As someone who's been SA'd and know many others who have as well/seen the effects it can have, thank you for risking it all with a tough conversation and not just sweeping it all under the rug.
OP, if you go this route and contact the parents of the kid eventually - clue the parents in that kids can download apps meant to look like a mobile game but they’re used to often hide photos. (English not first language but hopefully I made sense?)

And yes, the kid will probably keep all the messages and any lewd photos 
Hang in there buddy.   It probably doesn't seem like it right now,  but your life will get better.
Updateme
Updateme

Nothing is ever deleted my friend.   Those texts exist and if the police know about the case, they can get them from the cell phone company easily 
Yeah, they can easily contact Insta for a report of suspicion of Abuse, and Insta has been on thin enough ice with predator stuff it's probably something they go through regularly 
This this this. 
As someone currently taking a class in Computer Forensics, you have to do a lot to get rid of that information. Some apps are more difficult to pull from than others, but if it was ever stored on the device, there is likely information still there.
Her reaction is also what sealed it for me 
Yes but now they have to go through the channels of getting that evidence which isn’t a guarantee. It was terrible advice. He should’ve spoken to the kids parents, kept complete discrepancy, built a massive case, and won in one decisive stroke. Now he’s in for a grind.
In her defense she might not be fucking a child yet, but there's a very good chance she's grooming him. Whatever it is, it's clearly not some innocent misunderstanding 
I also find it weird that they didn't respond to a single comment.
Yah, following her to see what’s going on after soccer practice should have been the first move.
I was 95% sure it was BS when he went into a long description of the lawyer he talked to. Nobody looking for actual advice online goes into that detail. It's pointless, unless it is some fantasy. 

So yes. I would say it is complete fiction.
What, his friend that just so happens to be a lawyer just so happened to be in town. Also, I won’t say it never happens, but a varsity boys soccer team having a woman coach is a little odd.
Awful advice at best.
And delete evidence.
Ghoulish overkill i found, has been very effective in getting a point across 😅
I definitely would recommend the same, but my guess is she told him to delete everything.  But I will also guess that this is a dumbass kid who probably saved all his messages to show his buddies.   

Maybe give them a heads up and say he knows they’ve been texting each other frequently and she has admitted that it may have been a little excessive.  But you also don’t know the extent of the texts because she proceeded to delete all the messages and not share their discussion with him.  He can state it may have been too friendly of a conversation but he doesn’t know the extent of it.  It may be wise to look at their son’s phone and if they notice anything incriminating to notify him and then bring the evidence to an attorney.

I’d definitely notify the parents, so this relationship can be handled from both sides. It needs to end immediately.
In my experience people say, “they’re like my brother” when something weird is going on. They want to cover it up making it sound familial and non-romantic.
I think many of these stories are ChatGPT or creative writing exercises. I read AITAH and it feels like fake stories are taking over.
Text messages and other data can be recovered by law enforcement to an extent. He absolutely must not put himself at risk over this shit because of her bad decisions. Lawyer first.
Mandated reporters don’t need proof.  Just suspicion of abuse.  CPS determines whether something warrants an investigation and then investigates and looks to see whether there is proof or if it’s unfounded.  (Mandated reporter here, not everyone in my state is, and I’ve attended extra trainings on it when family/ friends go because idk I’m a nerd or something, refreshers are good though!)
Great question to ask the lawyer!
It’s not. I’m a former Youth Protection trainer for the BSA. It is not the role of the reporter to investigate.  Leave that to the police.  Also the reporting may hinder the police investigation.
Regardless of proof, I *guarantee* her school has rules against adding students as friends on social media, let alone texting them directly about non-school related things.  The student is also a teenage boy. He *will* eventually tell his peers, so if she's not doing anything untoward, it's better (to protect her marriage and job) to just fess up and knock it off.
He’s NOT a mandated reporter, as far as I remember. 
He’s plain-old, John Q Public,  like you, me and the raccoon in the back yard.
And I’m sure your wife had to sign some sort of policy and take training on this stuff - so it absolutely needs to be reported (even without proof) that’s the point of being a mandated reporter - you report suspicions then let the people with this training iron out the details. REPORT
Yeah, he’s NOT her proxy.  He’s NOT a mandated reporter.

The big words are confusing, but read the legal definition.
And how exactly is he going to find out the kids name, who his parents are, and how to contact them
⛔️DO NOT CONFRONT THE KID. 

DO NOT SPEAK TO THE KID.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MESSAGE THE KID.

THE KID IS STILL A MINOR AND YOU SHOULD ONLY DO SO AFTER YOU HAVE:

F. A. C. T. S. 

And then you involve law enforcement and/or the school.⛔️

OP’s wife may have only engaged in inappropriate behavior at best or at worst statutory rape. 

At this point he needs to meet with a divorce attorney for a consult and discuss the possibility of hiring a private investigator. Depending on what is found the attorney can advise as to next steps.
This is such bullshit advice. You don’t go confront a kid ffs. wtf is wrong with you people?!

OP - maybe she didn’t wander, but she may have thought about it. Maybe she did get too emotionally involved with the kid, but nothing actually happened. Maybe. And her violent reaction is to having to confront that she started to slip. 

It’s a possibility. 

How you approach it is up to the two of you. Tend not to listen to the insane Redditors. They’re frigging nuts. And they hate when couples survive, so they always try to turn OPs against their SOs.
Yep, in the law (just as an analogy) it's called spoliation.  If someone let's relevant evidence get destroyed and they knew it was important and could have saved it, then a court can infer that the evidence was damning.  Its a way to make sure someone doesn't destroy evidence and then say "now you got nothing on me."  No, the destruction shows the evidence was bad for you!
She'll be extra careful now that she's aware of the suspicion l.
Shit even he could have called into work or something and done it.
This 1 bajillion percent. She was having a fight or flight response, and some people automatically choose fight regardless of the circumstance, innocence, or repercussions. If a person with that type of personality isn’t a natural manipulator but happens to be guilty, there’s a good chance they will skip all the steps on the escalation ladder and go straight for the jugular.
> She said the fact that I would even question something like this means there’s probably something wrong with me and that I must be the one hiding something.

This was textbook to me. Serial cheaters always suggest their partner is.
Exactly. I’d play it cool for a bit so she lets her guard down then look in her phone. I’m not a person that would normally do this or even recommend it. But this could be serious. My aunts husband did this same shit to her with a younger softball player (college aged)and got her pregnant- and it was absolutely devastating to my aunt. That was enough for her, she hasn’t dated since. And that was YEARS ago. 

OP absolutely needs to look at her messages and pictures. 
[Dead Giveaway!](https://youtu.be/nZcRU0Op5P4)
Exactly what I said she’s trying to use his innate belief in her former behavior as credibility in this bs she’s pulling
Yeah I agree, and to go stay with a friend because she can’t look at OP and his accusations? NOPE she went to wipe the phone and cover her tracks. I’d hire a PI, when her guard is down OP
He needs to hire a private detective. He needs proof in hand before going to the police
Also her messaging and befriending a minor is inappropriate. She coaches and has a power of authority. She shouldn’t have a job if she’s befriending her athletes outside of training. Messaging on Instagram is just weird. If he had questions about the sport or anything to become better in it he would text her and she would keep it professional. I had a teacher who called me and texted me outside of school because she was helping me obtain an internship in high school. She kept it professional and knew I was a nervous wreck for my interview. She became a mentor for my career and nothing else because that’s how it should be if a teacher or coach ever helped someone outside of private sessions or the classroom
OP is not a cop, he's her husband. She has trickle-truthed him already, first denying everything and then admitting okay they've been exchanging messages that have veered away from the subject she's coaching for. There is enough probable cause for OP to expect to see all of the messages— though of course by now she's had some time to cover her tracks.

If the discussions were truly innocent— or at least did not cross the line into sexual discussions—  then she owed it to OP to clear up his misconception. Her refusal to suggests she's still not being entirely honest about the nature of her relationship with the minor. 

OP is also not a criminal court. He's not required to have proof beyond all reasonable doubt or to honor the Fifth Amendment. He gave his wife an opportunity to prove his suspicions baseless and she refused.

If OP were a school staff member, or someone affiliated with the youth league, etc. he would be mandated to report his suspicions to the authorities— what he's already described is grounds enough for that. If OP told a mandated reporter what he has written here then they would likely need to report her. The police can decide if there's probable cause and perform the legal investigation, with OP's wife both entitled to her constitutional rights but also with investigators entitled to subpoena materials as needed.

Anyway, at the very least she needs to cut off all contact with this student and end her coaching for the youth league. That should be the absolute baseline course of action.
Not really the same thing. Cops and partners have very different agendas.

But it’s academic now anyway, if she was doing something inappropriate she’s deleted the evidence and told the kid to do the same, and if she’s not stupid she will also break off anything going on with the kid. Even if nothing was going on, there’s a good chance she’s deleted the DMs just in case they look bad.

So really it now just comes down to whether op feels in his gut whether she’s telling the truth or not. If he doesn’t, then it doesn’t matter if she is or not, because he won’t be able to trust her again either way.
>Sorry OP. Your wife is unhappy in your marriage and is trying to feel young and wanted again.

What is this? The rest of the comment you are clearly siding with OP but this comment just makes it sound like you're victim blaming on her behalf? 

The woman is a paedophile. Nothing OP has done or not done is to blame for this and there's no evidence that he neglected her or didn't make her *feel "wanted"*...
Classic DARVO. She's pissed at him because she got caught.
Deny attack and reverse. The good old  Roy Cohn tactic...
I agree IG is already inappropriate, when I was a coach I had a separate Facebook "coach" account, because we would sometimes post our events there. Kids did sometimes contact me on that but it was strictly like "What time is the bus tomorrow?"

There's no reason to be IG friends with a student though. I'd think she'd want to prove her innocence if there was any since it looks bad already.

Most schools have a social media policy on this also, so she's probably breaking that no matter what.
OP doesn’t, imho, need absolute proof of anything sexual for any reason other than a misguided attempt at covering his own ass in the case of a nasty future divorce. But even in that case, I wouldn’t say that is the correct move. What this thread seems to be missing is that a minor may be being abused and that’s the first priority here—and would be what any judge would consider the most important point. There is no way any court would tell OP, “you tried super hard to make sure a minor couldn’t be abused by your wife, screw you.” They might, however, say, “you suspected your wife of abusing a minor and did nothing, screw you.” I’m not an attorney, but that may veer into the realm of being a complicit accessory to a crime. Even if he’s wrong and no sexual/legal boundaries have been crossed YET, preventing a minor from being victimized as soon as possible is the right thing to do and would also happen to have much better optics in a court room. Waiting for “solid proof” just creates more opportunities for something preventable to happen and potentially brings liability upon himself for his inaction. And inappropriate communication leads to other stuff. That’s why schools prohibit it.

Someone else mentioned that there are people who would be legally required to report this situation if they became aware of it. An anonymous tip to an administrator as soon as possible would be appropriate; policy would require discreet investigation (they wouldn’t want any unnecessary scandal) and the child would be protected. OP could have someone else call it in if he really wanted to. “I strongly suspect a coach of inappropriate communications via Instagram with a minor participating in your sports program.” Done. If they find no fault, then that’s great, everyone is safe and at least then staff get a clear reminder that will possibly help his wife get her boundaries in order.

OP, do not get sucked into self-protective mode to the point that you actually do something wrong (morally or legally) by failing to report this. When it comes to protecting kids, there are very clear boundaries and as an educator myself, I cannot fathom anyone suggesting the person reporting a suspicious relationship is the bad guy. Don’t let your wife gaslight you into thinking you’re the one at fault here.
She was grasping at straws. She’s guilty af
Why can't you compare apples and oranges? They're both fruit!
Don’t have kids. Have teenage siblings tho. All teenagers are shitheads. Especially my siblings but I absolutely love my siblings. They’re my shitheads
Yep, they're on the phone company's server.

Edit: As pointed out, it depends on what she's using.
and, just a theory, made OP out to be the pedo
“they’re like my \*step\* brother”?
I agree. Also, the simplest solution hasn't even been mentioned by OP which would be contacting the parents. I guarantee the kid will break when confronted by his parents and they take his phone away.
Yes, but unless there's any other proof, it's extremely unlikely that law enforcement could get a warrant to do so. They likely wouldn't even try.
>Mandated reporters don’t need proof. Just suspicion of abuse.

How does that work? If it is mandatory to report any suspicion of child abuse, how much suspicion do you need?
I'm glad you added this. I called CPS on a family once, after the preschool refused to. They said we didn't have proof, but like you said, mandated reporters are supposed to report suspicions.


The children were removed from the house. It was one of the hardest calls I ever made, the mom was truly doing her best with 3 special needs kids, but there were things that weren't lining up right. The preschool got into a lot of trouble for waiting to report, and the mom showed up looking for who had reported.... I think about those kids a lot still, I hope they are doing okay.
I get mandated reporting but if he has doubts it would be hard for him to feel repercussions from not reporting. Of course he can report but he said he doesn’t want to, right?
That is true but they are not going to investigate a claim that there is inappropriate texting. Not even close to what they will look into. The responders comment to contact the parent of the teen may be the best bet
I highly doubt ops situation falls under this. Yes, he could report, but there is basically zero chance he ever could get in trouble for not reporting.
You are correct. I’ve seen two lives ruined by hunches from nurses that they were legally required to report even though there was no abuse. None at all. 

Both were men and both lost their jobs, homes, and families. 
Furthermore, you’re not supposed to share your suspicions with anybody else, because they might try to convince you not to report.
how is this abuse? The only thing it might be is statutory rape, but not if they live in one of the states where the SOL is 17 or even younger. As gross and disturbing as it sounds, even if she is engaged in a sexual relationship with the kid, it may be 100% legal.
He could easily (and anonymously) contact the organization that she coaches through. They would obviously be able to and legally mandated to inform the parents.
Get the proof and then contact the kids parents, maybe. And the police. But definitely not the child who is being groomed and abused, never that.
Smartest response I haven’t seen anyone else suggest a P.I.
Almost Every single relationship advice on Reddit is divorce lol.
Yep, that's much the same reason as how you can't (or shouldn't) try to plead the 5th in a civil trial. In a criminal trial, yes, the 5th amendment protects you from self incrimination, but in a Civil trial, pleading the 5th basically tells the Court "assume that the worst case scenario is what occurred".
She's probably reached out to the 17 YO and instructed him to delete messages.
 BIG TIME! It’s a telltale sign of a bad liar.
Good point
But was she really with the friend? And if so, what time did she get there, was it after she called her young bf to meet and get their stories straight? I'd want to know what time she got to her friends house to stay the night. CALL THE FRIEND!
Oh damn she probably did wipe her phone. Probably changed the boys contact name too.
I would also get a voice activated recorders maybe put a security cam in the house.

UpdateMe
You are 100% correct. I was a referee for youth rugby and had to complete [https://uscenterforsafesport.org/](https://uscenterforsafesport.org/) training related to adult interactions with youth athletes. My son's coaches only sent messages to the whole group through an ap that sent all messages to every athlete and coach. No one could send a message to an individual. This protects both the athletes and the coaches. Lots of other rules like never transporting an individual athlete to practice or games (unless the athlete was your own child).
literally comparing OP being on good terms with his own brother vs. her messaging a kid she coaches about stuff unrelated to their professional relationship is such a ridiculous stretch and gross  
it's normal for kids especially teens like that age to have admiration for a coach/mentor turn kinda romantic/sexual but it's totally different for the mature adult to go along with it and encourage it
Agreed. I work for a college and our students are typically older than 18 all the way up to age 99. I'm not allowed to "be real friends" (as I jokingly put it) with any of them until they graduate. All comms are through school email and I'm not allowed to accept requests on gaming systems (a lot of them are gamers like me) either until they graduate. I even changed my name on social media so they can't find me.
100% agree he’s not a cop and the way she’s acting is inappropriate and shouldn’t be happening. If the discussions were innocent she still doesn’t have to show it to him. Her reaction is suspicious but at the end of the day id take it with a grain of salt.

Yes a mandated reporter would have to but from personal experience at my school they did an investigation and found nothing. Which is crazy because it happened with 2 students. Idk if they didn’t see the clear as day evidence or they swept it under the rug.
Shes obviously not telling him the truth.
Yeah my brother Coach’s and his only text with players would be them asking about what time something was. When I played my college coach would only text very important stuff. 

Yeah she definitely is breaking a social media policy. She should have not allowed him to follow her personal account. Highly inappropriate in my eyes.

That is true if she wanted to show nothing going on she would have shown it but I also think she has every right to be pissed for such an accusation. OP needs solid evidence and they will get caught eventually.
Most schools have social media policies for good reason—it protects both students AND teachers. Guilty or not, OP's wife put **herself** in this position.  

She is playing a foolish game if she thinks demanding the unconditional trust of her spouse outweighs providing easy proof she's not guilty.  She's either digging a deeper hole for herself and the relationship or she is hiding things.

OP doesnt need to doubt his actions or feel guilt for not trusting her enough.
I mean, with that one, she's grasping at shadows of straws.
That’s not how iMessage works
Again. It’s doesn’t matter! Everyone is suggesting a lawyer. This is the call!!!! The Lawyer will tell OP how to proceed and will protect HIS interest not his wife’s. Stop commenting dumb stuff. OP needs to lawyer up like weeks ago.
Be a sensor, not an analyst. It's not your job to investigate. You simply need enough suspicion to feel personally that there's a chance a child is being harmed. If you're acting in good faith, then you're doing it right.
Mandated Reporters are typically given training that helps them decide this. For us, it was knowing what signs of abuse are. Teachers are one of the most common mandated reporters because they see the kids daily, and notice a lot of their behaviors.


I called as a preschool teacher after a 3rd child in 1 family reported a monster that woke them up at night. They'd also started having issues using the bathroom, something they'd previously been fine doing. They were only 3 and somewhat delayed in speech, so we could only go off of their behaviors. Since they were similar to their sibling... well I called CPS and all 3 children were removed from the home.
Unrelated to this story, but anyone can literally make up a situation, call  and CPS still has to investigate. Currently dealing with a revenge report type situation from an ex-step-grandmother. Even if there is no merit, they still will investigate. Still will have to go to court and  it's a nightmare because you have to prove yourself innocent thru invasive home visits and court plans and drug tests. 

Don't get me wrong I totally understand that it's better to inconvenience people that aren't abusing kids so that they can catch the people that are abusing kids but when you're in the middle of this it sure doesn't feel right.
A good case would be, if you are questioning enough to make a few Reddit posts about it, you should go to the police if you are a mandated reporter.
I was a teacher for 17 years. If I thought a student was being abused, neglected, etc., I didn’t need proof, like the above stated. I have had students give me cryptic clues so they weren’t ’admitting’ anything or ‘snitching’ on anyone—or they’re not ready to deal with those emotions yet—but they’d leave breadcrumbs for me. I just had to be able to read between the lines. Better to report (even anonymously) and be wrong than not report and be right. That could leave YOU vulnerable bc if it comes out that you knew anything, you could be painted as an accessory. We know you aren’t, but THEY don’t.
Private DM’s and adding them on social media is suspicion enough. Private coaching sessions is a massive red flag. That’s enough right there. Nearly every coaching/training Safe Haven Training material spells it out quite clearly that they are never to do any of those things.
Yeah, that was stressed in my training, that I can straight up face charges for not reporting.  

And I’d much rather report someone just struggling sooner to our GPS line (general protective services) that literally exists to get struggling parents resources and see things not escalate to abuse or neglect than see something go downhill when it doesn’t have to!  (And I have friends who personally have been GPS cases and needed the resources and only gotten shit together because of GPS)
I mean, after that message, I think that’s the line. 

Before she admitted to messaging him about other things there’s room to argue. ‘There was nothing to really suggest they talked about anything but soccer’, ‘I didn’t know definitely that she was texting him when I saw her texting’, ‘I thought they were texting in a chat with other players/parents’, ect. Like there’s enough there to where even if he was suspicious, there’s enough reasonable thought for not jumping the gun. 

Now though? I don’t think so. She’s admitting to texting the kid one on one frequently about other topics, and now justifying a relationship beyond coaching-player. 

At this point he should report it, even if it’s only “hey, my wife and X player are talking a lot outside of soccer and about other things, and she’s said things that make it seem like this is more than a player-coach relationship. I don’t know definitively that more is happening, but I feel like this is something I need to make you aware of.” 

Mandated reporters don’t need like ‘this is an open-shut case no way the jury doesn’t believe it’. The exact wording is “when they have reasonable cause to suspect abuse”.
Hi, teacher here. In my profession we are obviously a job with “mandatory reporting”. The way the teach it to us is that if we have “reasonable suspicion” that a child may be experiencing abuse in the home, we have to report it. We don’t have to wait for a kid to walk in with a cigarette burn or black eye. But if we notice behaviour that lines up in patterns of abuse, we HAVE to call CPS. I don’t know the scenario for OP here, but CPS will never yell at you if you are doing it in good faith, which I believe OP would be.
Nobody wants to report. But it's an obligation to report. I spent a year wading through an sickening mess that an entire small town knew about including police, ambulance and the hospital but nobody "wanted" to report because they didn't want to harm their personal relationship with the person. At least 2 people died in this multi-year abuse situation and uncountable numbers were harmed.
It’s different if the adult is a coach or a teacher. That means they have some authority over the kid. For instance, in our greater metro area an SRO had a relationship with an 18 year old student at the school in which he works. It is against the law because of his authority over her.
Apart from the fact that she is in a position of trust over him you mean?
Grooming is abuse.
Just because it's legal, doesn't mean it can't also be weird.
She's his teacher, it's completely immoral and against school policy. Possibly illegal.
It was suggested a lot in his original post but he didn't heed/take the advice and decided to confront her directly... sigh.
It’s too late for a PI because op rushed into confronting his wife after following Reddit advice.
That's because by the time most OPs finally post on Reddit, the situation has gotten so bad they can no longer pretend it's tolerable.
Definitely call the friend. And if she stays over there again maybe drive by and check. Maybe look at motel parking lots too.
If they have a shared cellphone plan he can 100% get the call records.
I'm a coach at a public school, and all of our interactions with students have to be through school email or an app managed by the school where messages can never be deleted from the school servers. I'm not supposed to interact with them on any social media. I'm definitely not supposed to be alone one-on-one with athletes or students ever. In practice, this isn't entirely practical, but there's a difference between a 30 second to a minute conversation in an office with a door open and hours alone with an athlete in "extra practices" would raise eyebrows if reported to my school. All in all, I had to do about 20 hours of training (I think, didn't actually time it) with regards to interacting with students and athletes, and every single one of those trainings basically said do not interact with minors you are in control of the way she is interacting with that boy.
SafeSport is THE answer here.

Soccer is governed by US Soccer, and part of SafeSport.  The wife is breaking SO MANY rules put in place to protect young athletes as well as coaches.

If actual ‘abuse’ is happening or not, the ability for that to occur here is ginormous.  The rules being broken should see the wife removed from her position as coach, and working with youth, regardless.

If the messaging is going to far, it could be considered grooming.  If there is ‘abuse’ happening, and illegal activities, that leaves the wife open to criminal charges and jail time, as well as a civil lawsuit for financial compensation.  The husband could be considered in the civil lawsuit if they thought he knew, but didn’t act to stop or prevent the abuse.  Not that a jury would find him guilty…but he could be named.  Disclaimer: INAL.

There is A LOT to consider here…
Exactly I work for a nonprofit helping youth. We take trainings to protect the kids and ourselves to make sure nothing like this happens. Obviously it does happen but a lot less often since we’re always keeping an eye out for any suspicious behavior that we’re trained to look out for.
Just did this myself this sounds like grooming at its finest
Yup when you have power of authority it changes things. You’re in a position where teens and what not look up to you and trust you. 

My job at a non profit we have training to notice when something like this might be happening and how to prevent us from being falsely accused.
Yeah, having been there and been gaslit pretty much the same way that’s my assessment as well, as much as I try not to let my own bias and anecdotal experience sway my opinion. It could be innocent, but it very much doesn’t look it.
The problem is, I think, now all parties involved have a heads up to delete evidence and cover tracks.
"be a sensor, not an analyst" that is a really great way to put it.
Cool, thanks. I'd misunderstood - from the earlier comment it seemed like mandatory reporting applied to everyone, not just people in certain roles.

I can see how a teacher not reporting reasonable suspicions is a failure of their duty of care. It was just the idea that *anyone* could be punished (otherwise it's not really mandatory) for not reporting suspicions seemed unworkable and open to abuse.
Thank you for caring enough to notice and do something about it.
Absolutely. Our preschool was investigated after I reported this family, mostly because it was seen as a huge issue that the preschool itself hadn't reported anything. 


But ultimately, they decided not to further pursue the investigation since no one really knew anything. This is obviously a one off case, but I know the burden of proof can be pretty heavy in charging mandated reporters. 
What do you think constitutes abuse? Adults are allowed to DATE minors as long as there isn't any sexual contact - I know it's hard to believe, but look it up. Ready for more bad news? The SOL in a lot of states is only 17, and in some states it's even lower, which means even if she is having sex with this kid, it may be entirely legal. He can certainly try reporting it, but I don't think there is any guarantee that she ends up in trouble over this. It would really depend on the state.
THIS, OP.....AND THEN CONTACT THE BOY'S PARENTS.
This. I know longtime, Hall of Fame type coaches who were found to be texting kids individually, and not even about weird stuff but were immediately fired for breaking the protocol.
I'm going to second this.  High school teacher, and we are required to file documentation about contacting students outside of our district-mandated channels.  Like, I can add students to a Facebook message group, but I have to tell my admins we are doing that first, just to avoid any issues.

Also, if a person is using their own phone to contact students, those conversations are supposed to be considered public record and easily accessible case anyone has questions about propriety.  

(My state guidelines might be different than OP)
Good thing phone forensics are a thing and nothing is ever truly deleted.
Teenagers don’t have much foresight and this lady seems in denial about getting “caught.”  Her phone has been wiped for sure, but if something more is up I bet the parent could find something on his
If the teen is on his parents plan they should be able to get his text and call history, if not the texts themselves, by going through the cell phone carrier. The police can do even more to recover it.
That's a common misconception, but Mandated Reporters is a specific class of people, usually teachers, coaches, school admin, first responders, etc. This husband would certainly would not fall under a Mandated Reporter (though his wife is...).


The punishment idea is also not really accurate. If a Mandated Reporter has 100% proof that abuse is taking place and doesn't report, they will for sure get into legal trouble, but for the most part... well abuse hides in the dark. MR is mostly to empower and encourage people to protect children.
But to get that, you need a warrant which would require more than just a suspicion. You have to get to the level of probable cause, which is higher than reasonable suspicion, to get a warrant for electronic devices.

And from what OP has said so far, I don't see enough probable cause to get a warrant for either of their electronic devices. The cops, in this case, would be relying on the account owners to freely provide the devices for forensic analysis.
Plus, isn't it more specific to your job whether you're a mandated reporter or not? (at least in states where not everyone is automatically a mandated reporter). 

When I worked at a university, I was a mandated reporter about my students specifically. They were all adults, but there were still things I was a mandated reporter about, like if they said they were being sexually harassed, I had to report it to my university. And I was given training on the "chain of command," which I wouldn't know if I were just a random person. 

However, my status as a mandated reporter at my job didn't mean I was a mandated reporter other places, I don't think? Like, if I suspected my neighbor of child abuse, I wasn't a mandated reporter because my job doesn't involve CPS at all. (Not saying I wouldn't report suspected abuse, of course! but I wasn't required to).
And anyone in the medical and psychological fields. Mandatory report.
This varies by state.  In my state, everyone is a mandated reporter. Everyone.
I did a quick Google to confirm! In Indiana, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Wyoming everyone is considered a Mandated Reporter.


Honestly, I just encourage everyone, especially those who interact with children or the elderly, to educate themselves on what abuse looks like in those protected class. It is important information to understand. 
I think my wife might be cheating on me with a 17-year-old she coaches... but I don’t know for sure. What should I do?


Alright, I never thought I’d be in this situation, but I’m completely at a loss here and I need some advice. My wife (33F) has been acting really strange lately, and I’m starting to think she might be cheating on me… with one of the kids she coaches. I feel sick even typing that.

Some background: my wife is an accountant by day, and in the evenings, she volunteers as a soccer coach for a local youth team. She's always loved soccer, and I thought it was great that she was so involved with the kids and the community. But recently, she’s been dropping weird comments that are starting to really concern me.

It all started about two months ago. She casually mentioned one of the boys on her team — he’s 17, and I won’t say his name for obvious reasons. At first, it was harmless stuff, like “He’s really talented for his age” or “He’s a natural leader on the field.” I didn’t think much of it because, well, she’s a coach, and it’s her job to encourage the kids, right?

But then the comments started to get...weird. Like one night, out of nowhere, she said, “You know, \[kid’s name\] has really pretty eyes. They’re so striking.” I remember thinking, "Uh, that’s an odd thing to say about a kid you're coaching." I kind of brushed it off at first, but then more things followed.

Another time, she came home after practice and said, “He’s so much more athletic than anyone else on the team. It’s impressive how developed he is.” Again, I tried to shake it off, but my gut started nagging at me. Why is she talking about him so much?

Then there’s the fact that she’s been getting way more secretive. She’s always been open with her phone and emails, but lately, she’s been turning her screen away from me when she texts or checks messages. I asked her about it, and she just laughed it off, saying I was being paranoid.

She’s also been staying later and later after practices. At first, she told me it was just because they were prepping for some tournament, but now, even with the tournament over, she’s still coming home late. When I ask, she gives vague excuses like, “Oh, the team needed extra help,” or “I had some paperwork to catch up on.”

Here’s the thing that really has me spiraling: Last week, I came home early from work. I expected to have the house to myself since she was supposed to be at practice, but when I walked in, I found her sitting on the couch, texting someone with a huge smile on her face. When she saw me, she quickly locked her phone and got super flustered. She said it was "just one of the parents asking about game schedules," but it didn’t feel right.

I don’t have any solid proof, but something just feels *off*. Why would she be talking about this kid’s looks? Why is she suddenly so secretive? I haven’t been able to shake the feeling that something more is going on.

I don’t want to accuse her of something so serious without any real evidence, but I also don’t want to ignore my instincts. I love her, and I really don’t want to believe she’d do something like this, especially with a kid she’s supposed to be mentoring.

So, Reddit, what should I do? Am I reading too much into this? Is she cheating on me with this 17-year-old, or am I just being paranoid? How do I even begin to confront her about something like this?

Any advice would be appreciated. I’m honestly feeling lost right now.

**Updates:**

Hi everyone,

First off, I want to thank all of you for the overwhelming amount of comments, advice, and support on my original post. I really needed some sense knocked into me, and I genuinely appreciate the community’s input—it has meant a lot during this confusing time.

After reading your comments, I took some of your advice and contacted my lawyer on the evening of my original post. I’ll go into more details about that shortly, but before diving into the updates, I’d like to clarify why this post is coming out now and in this format.

Unfortunately, after posting, my original post was taken down and I received a three-day ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was later restored, but I had to wait until the ban lifted to share updates. I did keep track of each development and wrote them out as they happened, so I’ll be sharing them in chronological order, just as I intended from the start.

I am posting the updates on a new post because there is so much to say, and I think creating a new post is best for organising all of the updates in a clear manner. In the update post will include a link to the original post for those who may not of seen it.
Ask to see her phone. Her answer will tell you all you need to know. Her behaviour has given you many reasons to doubt her stories.
Honestly never thought I'd be giving this advice, but you need to look into her phone without her knowing and check her messages, if you genuinely believe there's a chance she's being intimate with a kid.
If I were in your position I would probably hire a private investigator to check it out. The seriousness of what is potentially happening makes it worth the cost. You don't want to get this wrong. You also don't want to ignore what you're feeling. You could be right. You could be wrong. Having a professional looking into it makes sense. If he finds out she's doing exactly what you think, it's going to help a lot with the potential divorce case. It will also protect you from anything that could happen legally. If you're State has set the age of consent at 18, she's in big trouble. Even in states that set a lower age of consent there's likely a provision that excludes consent if the adult is in a position of power. Like a coach or employer or teacher. Accusing her without proof could make proof impossible and always leave you guessing.
This is easy enough...do your best private investigator impression and follow her after soccer practice. You'll find out everything you need to know.
If true, your wife isn't cheating on you, she's a child molester.
IM GOING TO ASSUME SHES CHEATING. Just based on what has been said here.
So this is my advice to you. You need to look in her phone, email, and social media before you do anything. Make sure you check her camera roll as well, and deleted messages and picture folders. You will be surprised at what people don’t double delete. Go through convos with her closest friends as well, they could know. 

Do not say anything to her about it. Do it when she is busy and not paying attention, give it time and act like nothing is wrong. When you find what you’re looking for, screenshot and send to yourself, and delete the fact you’ve done it. Get your ducks in a row, accounts and all, lawyer up and leave. THEN YOU GIVE HER THE REASON. Make sure you let his parents know, as well as the organization she volunteers for. Go ahead and speak to the other coaches if you can. If she is cheating with a 17 year old, your marriage is over, proceed as such. But protect yourself.

If she’s not cheating, keep it to yourself and never mention you thought this and examine why you felt this way.
Plot twist: She's shagging his dad
Wait til she’s sleep and go through that fuckin phone
So go scope out the practice from where she can’t see you
Is it possible she’s maybe seeing the kids dad? That might explain the sudden interest in the child.

All in all if you think something is up I would definitely bring it up and don’t let her blow it off. 

Tell her you think something is up and give her your reasons why, if she denies, ask to see her phone. 

I find it so strange that not all couples have their partners phone passwords. It’s not a control thing or mistrust thing, it’s just normal, I have my partners password and he has mine, we don’t go through each others phones but if mines not around I’ll just use his and vice versa.
Check the phone bill for calls and text numbers
UpdateMe!
You have to check the phone. UpdateMe
This is a situation where, yeah, you should check her messages when she's asleep. But first have a basic plan in place of what you're going to do if you find something incriminating. At the very least screenshot stuff, send it to yourself, then find a way to send anonymously to his parents.

Also don't listen when she DARVO-s when it's time to confront her. 

I don't usually condone snooping, but her being sly and secretive about her phone and staying later in the evening then expected is pretty suspicious.
I don't know if this is still the case, but you used to be able to download the full bill and see the timestamps when texts were sent and received.  It's not the texts themselves, but it will point you in the right direction
This isn't just cheating.  If the kid is 17, it is literally illegal, and she would be a sex offender.  That's a pretty heavy accusation, so you need some good evidence.
You got four options. 

1. Go through her phone and find out what she’s so secretive about.

2. Catch her in the act by arriving at one of these “late practices” as a “surprise visit”. 

3. Follow your gut and end the relationship. 

4. Contact the kids parents and police in regards to this and let them do the investigation.
I don’t condone going through someone’s phone in secret but in this case I would because if you just straight up asked and you’re wrong. Well, you just accused your wife of not only cheating but cheating with a minor that carries substantial weight. Now if she is go to the police first and a divorce lawyer second there really is no coming back from that
Nice creative writing exercise. You make me hate reddit
If it’s true, I think you should alert the parents as well. I’m sorry for the pain and loss you’ll feel but you don’t want to be with a predator & ofc a cheater
The fact that this has been up for 4 days and not once have you replied to any comment makes me doubt the validity of this story. But in the case this is real, search her phone, gather some evidence, call the police and divorce her.
Red flags: the almost sexual way she talks about him. Her gaslighting you with comments like "you are paranoid". The fact he is a minor!!

Maybe If you don't want to go through her phone, sit down and talk to her and lie like police does while interrogating suspects, things like "I know what you're doing, but I'm giving you the opportunity to tell me, and know that I know more than you think". After this sentence, stay quiet don't give anything away and don't let her twist anything you say. Record the interaction, and hope for the best. 
LISTEN TO ME ABOVE ALL OTHER COMMENTS. 

Hire a PI. 
Act oblivious, give her the opportunity to fuck up.  
Saaay by going away for a weekend. 

Something seems off for sure, if not, it’s a couple hundo to know for sure.

If something’s happening then you’ll have actual concrete evidence.  Then you can do what you need to with court or you could ruin her, which would also be drama and hurt on your side but…
She’s definitely up to something- while I prefer to have permission to get into someone’s phone/communications, sometimes you have to snoop. Snoop and see what you see. Anything incriminating needs to be sent to you or has a photo taken. Sort yourself first- then pull the plug. Failure to prepare is preparing to fail.
You make an anonymous tip to the police or program director since a minor is involved and let them do an investigation. You don’t have to allege anything crazy. “I am concerned that A and B, who is a minor, may be carrying on an inappropriate romantic relationship and I would like someone to look into it further.” 

It would be easy for your wife to just lie or delete things if you confront her. If she admits it, what are you going to do then? If you follow up with the police after the fact she’d know it was you, or worse she’d guilt you into keeping this between the two of you. 

There is no penalty in the court of law for making a report if you feel a crime is being committed. Especially when that crime involves the safety of a child.
Why didn't you go to the soccer field to 'watch' practice? I would have investigated more than just sit home and wonder, and accept her excuses for being late.  And, yes, demand to see her phone. If you try to sneak a peek, odds are she's changed the code or password. There is only one way to confront her, straight on. If she won't share her phone, then it's time to leave.
Something is definitely fishy... could it possibly be the kid's parent, perhaps?  Sounds like it's time for you to stake out the practice spot and see what she's up to once practice is over.
I think everyone here gave great advice except for one thing. If you creep through her phone without her looking and she finds out the trust is gone and you can’t have a relationship without trust. Thus it would turn into **you** ruining things.
I think you should write her a letter just like you did this post, throw it away and rewrite it and calmly list the reasons you have for being shaky in the trust you have currently. Then ask to go through her phone in front of her. If she says no then ya, back to the no trust = no relationship and good luck out there pal.
I think the bigger question is if you find out she’s cheating with a child are you prepared to call the police, you know because that’s what you do to pedophiles. Idk I do not envy you friend. But keep us updated and good luck. Take care of yourself
OP, this isn’t just her cheating on you, this is potentially predatorial behaviour. 

Play PI for a few weeks, follow her to soccer practice in an unmarked vehicle or a rental or a friend or family members car, keep your distance when doing so. Sus it out.

But when push comes to shove, if she is hooking up with a minor , in this case the 17 year old, you need to be prepared to notify the correct authorities, including the minors parents. No matter what your wife says, you NEED to do the right thing here. Be safe and good luck.
Ask his friends.
Go watch a practice from a hidden view. If she engages in sex with the kid or someone else she is probably cheating on you.
A lot of people are suggesting OP goes through his wife’s phone. 



Here’s the outcomes of that… 

A) OP finds evidence or no evidence acts accordingly.

Or 

B) Goes through phone, finds no evidence, but Wife finds out now OP is a dick and the trust of the relationship is tattered.

Both of those are bad and self-destructive to OPs cause. 

I recommend just asking her. Say “hey lately I feel like you’ve been acting a bit differently. Is everything okay? Are we ok?” Communication is the best course of action for these types of situations. Cheating usually stems from either a compulsion or a lack of communication. More of a lack of communication is just going to make matters worse.
This isn’t even about cheating. You suspect your wife is committing a crime. I’d definitely investigate this.
If you have kids just hire a PI and be done with it. 

Don't drag the kids along for snooping endeavors.
It could be the parent she's messing with. But ask to see her phone for a moment to look up something. You left your phone in the other room. 

Or just simply ask her what's going on. Tell her you've noticed somethings and you've been feeling insecure and need reassurance. Her answer will tell you everything.
Too bad you can't see the kids phone, gaurantee he ain't deleting any evidence
Whatever anyone else is saying is wrong, unless it is report this to the league and it's SafeSport coordinator, or directly to the authorities if 17 is illegal where you are. Even if it is not, they will investigate this or coordinate the investigation with authorities as it is inappropriate in this power relationship. Do it anonymously.

Look up SafeSport for more information. If your wife is a coach at this level she would have been required to do the online training.
This isn’t just cheating if she’s fooling around with him. It’s grooming. It’s potentially rape, child abuse, et cetera. Whatever you find file a police report asap.
OP, this is serious. You’ve got to nip this in the bud, for her sake and the 17 yo kid’s. If this is true, she’s about to screw her life (no pun intended). She can’t come back from having a relationship, or what even looks like a relationship with a minor. This is a NO GO. 

While not your responsibility, I would do whatever you need to do to prevent this from going any further. 

What you do regarding your marriage is secondary to making sure she doesn’t molest some underage kid. I’m so sorry.
Look up your wireless provider account and see if you can pull up the phone number from the logs
This isn't a child here as others have said. Having been 17 once, he's old enough to make his decisions.  He's old enough to know what he's doing.  He's an adult in all but an arbitrary number on a piece of paper, and your wife certainly isn't a predator.  There's no sense in destroying their lives.  Just walk away if you're certain. Start over with someone who loves you and would not be having sex with someone else without getting your consent first.
Someone please come get me when he posts the update
Hire a private investigator. You’ll have your answer soon.
!remind me 14 days
#I feel like I’m about to see this story in the news.
Hire a pi.get photos. Otherwise YOU will get reamed in court.
I think maybe drop by those practices with something nice for wife- like- oh I thought you might want this smoothie- I got myself one, or something like that.  At least do some rudimentary investigating.  The other thing is, and this may be an unpopular opinion so don’t hate me- but sometimes people develop crushes- that doesn’t make it right, especially in a situation with someone underage etc- but that doesn’t mean she’s doing anything awful either. One would hope that op’s wife would have the good sense to not break the law.  I dunno- this is rough- good luck OP- definitely investigate and find out what the heck- both for yourself, but also for this kid.
i feel like a lot of people are assuming that something verrrrry serious is happening without any real evidence. you obviously don't trust your wife, so whether she's doing something or not, the relationship sounds like it's gone to shit. go surprise her with flowers at the end of practice one day and see if you stumble on something inappropriate...seems way less intrusive than snooping on her phone with nothing but a long-shot hunch. once you do that, there's no going back.
Ask to see her phone immediately.Check the phone bill records to see what numbers she is texting or calling.Show up at the practices unannounced.Any numbers you don’t recognize on the bill call or text.Or get her phone when she is in the shower.Hide a voice activated recorder in her car.Do not allow her to go out of town to a tournament unless you go.
Check the phone bill. You can see who she is messaging.
If you can’t access her phone, go to your cell service provider and ask for the logs. It should have all messages and internet searches, I believe. This is super sketchy and with a minor being involved, normal boundaries don’t count
As the mother of a 17yr old BOY i would really not appreciate your silence ie ACCOMPLICE to your wife's crimes.
You do one of two obvious things, maybe both: (1) you secretly check her phone and/or (2) hire a PI. Or, if you have the discipline to control yourself, do your own PI work by following her to "practice" and doing surveillance from a very safe distance (STRONGLY recommend against this, but in your situation, I would have already taken this step before you got to this point).

If neither of those options work for you, you go absolutely nuclear - you anonymously report an inappropriate relationship to the police. The problem with this option is it is going to destroy your life along with your wife's, no matter if you are right or wrong about the affair (spoiler... you aren't wrong. Your wife is doing something shady... she's either contemplating an affair with the the kid or she's having a full blown affair with the kid or the kid's dad).
Everyone is saying “go through the phone”. Nah, play it cool, show up to a practice (towards the end of course), don’t let her see you, then after students start leaving-go meet up with her. Say you had some errands and were close by so you wanted to surprise her.
 Any you ask your mobile provider for a copy of the texts? I know this used to be easy to get however I haven’t needed that for years now so I’m not sure they still do that but I would think they do.
I really hope this isn’t true omd 💀
I think you can call your cell phone company and get a detailed bill of the phone number. She has texted and maybe from that you could figure it out.
Just some general questions here because I wanna get a better grasp with our "characters",
How old are you? Do you know the parents of the 17 year old/has she spoken about the kid's parents? 
Because one of the comments below mentioned that IF SHE IS CHEATING, she could be cheating on you with the dad of the 17yr old. Which is a little far fetched seeing as she doesn't seem to be mentioning a parent?? So.
But extra info would be nice

In the mean time you might want to go with her on one of these practices and see how she acts around the team. Especially the 17yr old. If you can do it, maybe even go to where she coaches them but dont tell her you're going.
Where there is smoke. There is fire. You seem to have reasonable grounds to be curious. Play it cool and go watch her coach by surprise a few times. You know since shes such a cool coach and all and inspires you. Nothing like seeing things yourself to get some perspective.
If she’s indeed having relations with the player, then she is a predator and a pedophile. You’re going to need undeniable proof it’s that’s the case. 

Get ahold of that phone and/or see about any emails possibly sent. Log in and connect data. And if you find irrefutable proof, report her ASAP.
I would go watch a practice. Don't tell her you are going and be very open about being there once you are there. 

1. If she smiles and is genuinely happy to see you (as most spouses would be), you might be overthinking it. 

But, the flip side, if she's being weird and dismissive, tries to get you out of there quickly, ignores you... her reaction to your presence, I think, will tell you what you need to know. 

It would also be interesting to see if she has to stay late that day or not.
UpdateMe
Are you on a family phone plan? If you’re the primary person on the account can you request text message records? No idea if they would release them but maybe because you are married?
Updateme
Whoah. Great advices from the comments. Hoping for follow-up.
Just tell her how you're feeling, and don't let her just say you're crazy! Tell her all of the things that you see her doing and saying. Then say can I check your phone. Good luck!
Could also be a parent 🤷🏻‍♂️
Demand to see her phone immediately and tell her why.

If she refuses, approach the kids parents.
GAME SCHEDULES?

BITCH THE COUCH IS SOAKED
Dawg imagine if you started saying a 17 yr old girl had “nice legs, really striking features”. WE WOULD ALL
BE VERY ALARMED.
You ever think she's cheating with a parent and not a kid???
She will get caught especially if shes cheating with a child. If you find out, you need to get proof and go straight to their parents and the cops
Updateme
*I think my wife might be molesting a 17-year-old she coaches

here, I fixed it for you
Under no circumstances,  do not give her any reason to be careful, do not ask her. Have an initial conversation with a lawyer and have them tell you exactly what kind of evidence is admissible in court. Then take time and gather evidence. She may also be abusing a child which is not something to brush away. 

Pause your emotions for later but meticulously gather evidence and then when it is undeniably in your favour, expose or confront in a way that will satisfy you and get you the closure you would need. I read in reddit someone had exposed the spouse in front of their parents etc.
I think she has started at least a flirtation with someone.
Can you check to see what number she is texting through phone records? Might have to make the drive to the store in person but if you two are on the same phone plan, you should be able to get access to the phone numbers she’s texting. Assuming she’s cheating, the number would be very frequent and you’d be able to google the phone number to get a name associated. Since the guy is under 18, his phone number would show as his parent’s name.
This isn't "cheating", it's predatory, grooming, child abuse. Kid is a minor. Your wife is in a position of authority and power. This is a crime.
Is it possible she was telling the truth about it being a parent she was talking to? Hear me out...

Something similar happened in a friend group I was a part of a ways back. The child was being used as a cover for the time the husband was spending with the mom of the kid.

I hate that stuff is possibly really bad in your marriage atm. But maybe it is adultery only, not that AND not pedophilia. Either way you have to force a confrontation.
How many inches is his development?
Alot of you in here are acting ridiculous. Hire a PI? lol. Look man, she’s probably just smitten with the kid and just because she has a small infatuation with him doesn’t mean she is or will act on it. The smiling at the texts could be something as simple as a group team chat she was pulled in to. In the chat, maybe it’s a bunch of teens posting stupid immature memes or making comments on a hot coach. She probably just doesn’t feel the need to show it and create unnecessary drama. I wouldn’t stress anything yet.
If she’s doing that he prepared to call the police
[deleted]
Also, let's not forget that the actual victim here is the fucking child.

This is bigger than your relationship. Get a PI, don't tell him the details, let him find them, and he'll turn her in if it's statutory.
Can you slip a key logger in her phone?  Also might want to get a PI on the case.  If you get evidence that she’s doing illegal stuff, that’s pure gold in a divorce.
You could always hire a PI to follow her
I will tell you from personal experiences, your gut feeling is usually spot on. 
Stay strong !!
The only good advice here is to secretly hire a PI. Everything else is typical Redditor burn it all down behavior.

If you snoop through her phone, and going through each other's phones isn't normal for you. Then you poison your relationship if she finds out.

If you accuse her directly, then you poison your relationship.

If you accuse through official channels, then you destroy your relationship.

You don't have proof. You're not sure. Something *feels* off. Hire a PI. There is no other option that doesn't guarantee an end to your relationship.

Of note, maybe she's not cheating with the seventeen year old. Maybe she's using soccer to hide a completely unrelated affair? Hire a PI.
I may be in the minority here, but I really think this seems innocent and you will come off as insecure for questioning her about this. I say this as a person who has been cheated on (also caught multiple partners cheating in the act) so I am very sympathetic to the insecurities that come with that. The comments she has made can both ways. If you are thinking about it through the lens of cheating, it would be easy to think this is a confirmation- aka confirmation bias. If you look at it through the lens of a coach, I think you could/would easily come to a different conclusion. In my opinion, I would guess it's the latter since it would be the minority of coaches/teachers who are attracted to or sleep with their students.
Always trust your gutt instinct,

If she truly is doing this , become cold as ice and rip her a new one...

Good luck ...

Hope its a dud....🫤.
Get all the information you can if your gut feeling ends up being right don't get counseling in forgive her get a good lawyer in prepare yourself for a divorce HOPEFULLY SHE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THAT 😉
##In my experience, your gut instinct is usually spot-on—if something feels off, there’s a good chance it is. While she may not be physically cheating, it’s possible she’s emotionally involved with someone else.

###If you’re on the same phone plan (or even if you’re not), you can check her call and text history by logging into the main account holder’s portal. While you won’t see the actual messages, the timing and frequency of calls, texts, or photo messages to a specific number can be telling. This is how I gathered evidence when my ex was cheating. It wasn’t about reading the messages but connecting the dots based on consistent contact. Or just go through her damn phone.
Hire a private investigator
"I know what you're doing!". Say that, arms folded as she comes through the front door from soccer practice. Look her straight in the eyes. Watch the blood drain from her face, be validated as her face turns from a smile into shock. Listen to her stammer, and please. Say nothing else. Let her writthe. She will tell you everything.
Hire a pi,  she at a minimum is having a EA
Recent law makes it illegal to go into spouse phone... i say start being active at practices and her life in general or hire a PI
Pretty simple- rent a car and go see what happens after soccer practice or hire a PI..
Never ignore your instinct. You’d rather be wrong than be right. Plan everything because women nowadays are much smarter when it comes to infidelity and affairs. Take notes on what she does especially the unknown behaviors you see. Check her phone when she’s asleep and go see her at her practice.
My husband slept with my niece and my daughter told me. That was something I never wanted to know and wish she would have kept it to herself. In his defense she was an adult but didn’t want to know that. Ignorance is bliss sometimes
Honestly, he should contact law enforcement. They will investigate. They be do so stealthily at first. This IS illegal. I know you love her, and don’t want her to go to jail, but just think if it were a 33yo male and a 17yo girl! From your story here, this is very suspicious and again, if the genders were reversed,  there would already be a hanging planned. IDK why this is so overlooked by society. There are just as many female predators as males! People just look at it differently.
Coaches should never sleep with players report her to the governing authorities. Let them sort it out and do it anonymously.
There is no doubt she is either cheating or thinking of doing it. I had the same situation happen but it was with one of my wife’s coworkers. She was doing the same stuff. I got to the point of borrowing a car from a friend and following her so she wouldn’t recognize it. I followed her straight to a small hotel where she went to a room and I watched as the person opening the door was the guy I expected. I had really bad thoughts about what I would do as I do carry, so I left. Later the next day I confronted her about it and she told me that she had went there for a get together with a bunch of other coworkers. She was 30 at the time and we had been married for 10 years.
A friend of mine (F) was a caterer for Hollywood. They hired lots of staff in the kitchen that weren't legal and some were 17.

She got this crush in a 17 year old working the kitchen.  She told her husband about this kid and how his family was poor in LA and how she'd like to take him to a Lakers game so he could experience one for the first time. The husband took her at her word and she had to stay in a hotel that night because they had a big awards show to prep downtown all day the next day.

What he didn't know was the 17 year old also found his way to the hotel room that night. And then again to their marital bed when the husband was out working.

He hosted them for dinner. He paid for the Lakers game.   He never knew.   They left LA shortly after but all this to say ...

She was also early 30's. Beware the logic some people will use to justify a 17 year old and an extramarital affair.
If you are suspecting this it is probably true. If this was me, I would hire a private investigator. I would start getting all my Affairs in order if my suspicions were strong. If you've got kids and own property or have shared Investments I would definitely consult with a divorce attorney before this blows up. I would start rifling through all the paperwork and computers to make sure that you have a clear picture of where all the money is. You want to be particularly careful with an accountant because they're going to know how to hide money. If they are cheating on you with a minor they are 100% hiding money somewhere. You also want to be prepared that your ex is going to jail if 17 is not an age of consent in your state. This is going to piss a lot of people off including her family and your family. I wouldn't tell a single person until again all of your Affairs are in order. Good luck to you and I'm really sorry this really sucks.
Hire a private investigator
We need to get into that phone.
My first step is to place a tracker in her car. When you see the car in unusual places ask questions.

Don't know the age of consent where you are but this screams grooming to me. Your wife, if cheating, has broken every safe guarding rule. In my mind, it's a police case if/when you get proof.
Quietly get your ass to a practice and game. See for yourself...
Echoing everyone here, but hire a PI to get evidence, meet with a lawyer, then go to the cops. She’s committing crimes.
Man you need to get to the bottom of this ASAP

And buckle up for the shit storm that is about to happen
People only hide their phone when they have something to hide. Hire a private eye or do some snooping. Go to practice and park ur car in the back and watch. U have to follow ur gut. Hopefully it's nothing.
It may not be the player possibly the parent nevertheless tell her your thoughts & how serious of a matter it is if she is cheating. Don’t give ultimatums!!! Just let her know you’re aware & your marriage isn’t a game
You absolutely need to find out if this is what is going on it sounds like she's grooming a teenager. As something awful could be happening to this child 


(If this is true) To clarify she's not cheating on you with him she is a predator grooming him abusing her position of power 

I'm 26f and I can't even imagine looking at a 17 year old anything more than a child
RemindMe! 7 days
UpdateMe
Check phone log via wireless bill.
id go to the kids parents and let them go through his phone, cuz she didnt let you go through her phone but when she was away from you she was then ok with saying she has him on ig? like...
Any updates
This is nuts OP, on the very day you came home early to find her propped up on the couch giggling at her phone, I would’ve 100% snatched the phone out of her hands and taken a look for myself. My wife is Egyptian, the culture is much different, I’m definitely skewed here but COME ON - she is literally TELLING you she’s screwing this 17 year old at this point.

Plus, I’m all for extracurricular activities but staying late beyond practice to hang around  with a bunch of sweaty 17 year olds is a red flag in itself. I would’ve cut that shit so quick, take it from me, I’ve been cheated on in past relationships…  If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a fucking duck. The story literally frustrates me for you my guy :/
Dude clearly nothing is going on.  Why don’t you trust her? stop being paranoid

for the record, I’m 17 and  she’s the best soccer coach ever.   Plus she tells me I’m way more experienced for my age.  At soccer. 

so yeah chill bro nothing to see here
Normally, there's certain levels of trust and boundaries you shouldn't break unless you're ready to end the relationship. 
Normally I would say if you're getting to the point of snooping then there isn't much trust, but in this case, there's a minor involved with possible legal ramifications.

You need to go through her phone for evidence.
I know your mind is on the cheating and the marriage maybe ending and all these thoughts, but there's a minor who's possibly getting groomed.
Im afraid you right, this situation looks so damn suspicious. I agree with others - you should check her phone if you can. Or ask her to give it to you with any general reason, like pretend that your phone didn’t boot and you need check something. If she refuses to do that - you may ask about what happened and why things are changed. And that conversation may answer your questions.
Maybe a way to be near the soccer field when game ends to see who leaves with who.

Might be a little fraught with bad outcomes, but may answer a few questions.
Check her phone for sure.
!remindme 1 day
Sit down and have a heart to heart with her.  This situation could blow up in a very big way that would destroy her, and by extension you.
Express your concerns.  Gauge her reaction.  You know her best.

Where there is smoke, there’s usually fire
You can always add a gps tracker and hide it in her car and install it to your phone. If found, you can always say it is for just in case your car breaks down.
You’re not gonna know the truth until you go through that phone
You can always add a gps tracker and hide it in her car and install it to your phone. If found, you can always say it is for just in case your car breaks down.
Get some proof. With out confrontation. If she thinks you’re suspicious, she just hide it better. Yes, check the phone. May think it’s wrong to invade her privacy, but this is the very future of your life you’re talking about here.

Maybe check out practice when she’s running late. Yes maybe even spy on her.
Maybe hire some to do it. But get the proof.

But most importantly, if you do go down this road, prepare yourself for the possible truth. If she is having a physical relationship with this kid, what are you prepared to do. Are you prepared to leave her. Are you sure you can possibly reconcile with a predator for a wife? Would call the authorities on her?

It’s a lot to deal with. That’s for sure.

Best of luck sir ✌🏻
This sounds like a watt pad story. If this is real I think u know the answer
Buy a small wireless camera and set it up in her car or a  voice recorder and hide it.
I personally would hire a private investigator to collect evidence on her and tell me why she’s acting like she’s cheating. 

If she was, I would confront her with it, and tell her she needed to stop because what she’s doing is illegal, and she could get jail time. I’d also tell her that we need to have a serious discussion about our future and what she wants with her life. I don’t want to be with someone who’s leaning into pedophile tendencies even if they’re just on the fringes of it. Additionally I want to be with someone who loves me and prioritizes me, and does their best not to dedicate themselves with not hurting me, and improving our relationship instead of choosing alternative solutions that don’t involve me and what we’ve built together. 

Everyone’s different, but I demand and deserve respect and love, and if my partner doesn’t feel like giving me either anymore, that’s fine. But I’m not going to accept a legally dangerous situation and I’m also not going to accept someone disrespecting how much I give myself to them by being secretive and sneaking behind my back with things. I try prioritizing communication and openness about desires and needs with my partners, and I try not taking things personally when they find alternate and unexpected wants. I try to face things head on, and I appreciate and respect directness, and I give flexibility and a degree of acceptance for my partners when things happen. But I don’t appreciate nor respect when ppl act immaturely and unkindly to me.

I would just confront her.

Or if you’re pretty sure hire a PI and divorce her with that evidence
She's doing *something* that she feels guilty about... or *someone*.   

If she’s actively concealing something, that’s a *major* red flag.   
Someone determined to cover their tracks will know how to erase texts, use hidden messaging apps, or otherwise stay off the radar.


One approach might be to discreetly check in on her practices.   
Just watching from your car could give you a sense of what’s going on without making a scene.  If parents are allowed at practice, she’ll likely be on her best behavior, but what happens after practice could tell you a LOT more.

**At this point, hiring a private investigator could be a smart move.**    

**Yes, it might feel like a drastic step, and if you thought she was cheating with an adult, I would, never suggest it.**  
However, considering the circumstances and the ramifications you/she could face, it could protect you from much larger consequences -- legally, financially, and reputationally.    

If she’s crossing lines with a minor, this is a **criminal offense**, not just a personal betrayal.   
She may not be his teacher per se, but she's still an adult who's in a position of power, and he's a minor.   
If this got out, her name would make headlines, and so could yours, dragging you into legal, financial and reputational trouble.

A PI can discreetly gather facts and give you the clarity you need.   
Whether it’s an affair with a parent or something more severe involving a minor, the stakes are incredibly high.   
Taking a proactive step now could save you from a world of legal issues and fallout down the line.   

*** FYI, a PI may not cost as much as you might think (anywhere between $500 - $2000 for surveillance).   
Plus, if they charge your credit card, it won't be listed as "Ray's Private Investigative Services", lol.  It will say something very ambiguous, non-descript, and discreet, like "Westfield Group",  "Paramount Solutions" or "Harbor Logistics".  Something like that.
Trust your gut instinct on this. 

"I feel like we're drifting apart, are we ok?". "your behaviors have changed recently, I'm concerned, can we talk?". "You seem infatuated with \[kid's name\]". 

That she attacks you and calls you paranoid is a red flag. Can you surprise her at a game, since you don't see her as much now that she's putting so much more time into coaching? 

I'm sorry you're experiencing this, I can't imagine how hard it must be but ignoring it is a mistake. I strongly encourage you to trust your instincts.
Call the cops☠️
Updateme
I was gonna say “what if the comments were innocent and she’s actually having an affair with a parent?”, but if it was a man making these comments about a girl’s body I would be worried, so you should definitely try to sneak into her phone and check.
Considering she could be fooling around with a MINOR.... you should definitely look for an answer
What you are really saying is you suspect your wife is sexually assaulting a child.

A 17 yr old does not engage in affairs with a 33yr old. 

If this were a male coach and a female 17yr old......

You need to find out and act as soon as possible.
try to ask the kids on the team or the parents. see if they see or suspect anything 
I would never encourage someone to go through their partners phone… until today. Go through her things. Check deleted folders.
**IF YOU SUSPECT THAT SHE IS POTENTIALLY INVOLVED WITH A 17 YO, CALL AND MAKE A REPORT.**

You can call in reports and remain anonymous (I think.  I could be wrong).  Let someone else do the investigating and stay out of it.  17 is still considered a minor and what she is potentially doing is illegal.  If an investigation is opened, you will see a change in her body language and behavior if she is.  She will seem nervous and agitated.

PLEASE do the right thing.  Just turn it over to someone else and see what happens.  At least you would be doing the right thing and protecting the young man.

EDITED TO ADD: Don't go through her phone.  If she is innocent, YOU will have brought dismay into the relationship and she won't trust you.  IF she is carrying on with his young man, there will need to be evidence on her phone, though there are otherways to obtain this anymore.  If she were to know you had gone through her phone, she is going to delete the evidence.
Interrogation 101

Tell her you know what she's been up to, and you're going to give her a chance to come clean. 

Then stop talking. Silence is painful in interrogations.  

If she deflects, refuses to answer, or becomes combative, stay calm. 

This is what you say next.

[Name] stop. I know. If you aren't willing to come clean, then I have no choice but to let your parents know.

The most terrifying thing to a person, more than being found out, is being found out and judged by your parents. I don't care how old you are.

Stay silent.

She will either double down on her behavior or she'll talk in a way that is desperate for you to understand. 

If she calls your bluff, call her parents with the intention of letting them know what you suspect. She'll break.

When she does, no matter how she delivers it, pay attention to the admission.
Okay so this is bigger than cheating. I suspect it is far from okay for a coach to have a sexual relationship with a 17 year old where you are. Quite possibly illegal (would be where I am) and a clear safeguarding issue.


If you can get further info then do it.
UpdateMe
If someone was cheating or committing a crime like that, wouldn't it be more likely that they *avoid* mentioning that person?
She’s cheating all the signs are there and depending on where you live she could be committing a criminal offence-does she know that.  

She’s a predator.
Go to one of the practices she stays late at, or at least drive by the field and she if she’s still there. 
Time to hire a PI.
I would hire a PI. Your wife’s activities are scheduled and fishy stuff should be easy to track. 

If illegal activities are observed, I believe the PI is obligated to contact law enforcement. You can also contact the sports team manager and the kid’s parents. And get an attorney for yourself. If this is really happening it will be a big scandal in town.
The answers are on her phone, you can consider a VAR in her car or at home to gather information if you can't get access.

Hiding the phone is a huge red flag, if not the kid it's someone else.

You can start randomly showing up at practice, see how she and the kid react to your presence and see if they are actually there.

Make a CPS tip that this child is being groomed. But take care the be 1000% anonymous and hidden.
Updateme
I’m thinking you should leave out who you think it is but you should request a sit down conversation with your wife. 

“I love you very much and I want to be honest that I have been having a nagging feeling that you have been (distracted or whatever the feeling. )
I hate to admit it but it’s crossed my mind to snoop around in your phone and whereabouts.  This is a sucky feeling and I’m just hoping you could provide me some tangible reassurance like look at your text messages with me. 
Again I love you and want what’s best for us.  

Or something like that.  You have to do it in a way that doesn’t feel like an accusation.  If my partner needed tangible reassurance I would give it to him.
I think people who look through others phones re crazy, but I think you need to look before approaching her. Chances are she’ll keep denying it, and if she knows you’re onto her she may delete the proof. I hope you’re wrong and it’s like his dad or something she’s cheating with, but agree the shift in personality says a lot.
I would just snoop at her phone at this point. In your situation something wouldn’t feel right to me either. Hopefully it’s nothing, but I’d be suspicious too.
Call Dr.Phil and get an attorney on standby.
Next time she is smiling like a school girl with a crush at her phone. Simply ask her.  "Hey right now, I need to see your phone please". If she refuses be honest  tell her you gave reason to believe she may be having an inappropriate relationship with a minor and you need to make sure  she isn't. So please right now can I see your phone.  If not now I'll be forced to approach his parents and talk to them. 
 Don't argue, don't justify, if sge tries to leave the room with her phone, tell her you believe if she leaves she will delete things, so you will consider it confirmation of her inappropriate relationship.
Screwed
Yup and yes. I’m sorry. They be crazy Bs
I have said the things that your wife said, if l notice beautiful eyes l will say so usually to the person with said eyes. You may very well be over reacting at this point, just keep your ear to the ground and until you have solid proof say nothing and more importantly don't act like the jealous man.
It may not be the kid but the parent, look through the phone and be sure
Updateme!
Def cheating but I wonder if it's with the kid or possibly a parent... someone for sure. I hope it's a parent. You need to get in her phone or something but don't let her on to you or she will delete evidence. Have to find this without her having a clue. Is there anyway you could follow her after practice? Maybe with a different car?
it’s so painfully obvious that this was written by chatgpt
If you want to snoop look at phone records, see if her credit card charges comport with her stories, look for the kids socials.
It’s his dad. Does his dad come to games ? 
She’s flirting w his dad is my hunch
Nothing certain within this but still questionable. Either you are misreading this because of your own insecurities or there is more going on than she admits. Both would need to be addressed for this to go forward in any kind of healthy manner.
!remindme 4 days
Maybe go by the field one night?
Don't wait or let her suspect you're onto her. Check phone records to see what numbers are being regularly texted or called but get in that phone like your life depends on it and document everything with screenshots as she will try to lie and deny it.
UpdateMe!
Confront her. 
Follow her after practice. Or hire a PI. Get a hold of her phone when she’s sleeping.
Raping a child. Not so much cheating. But I would leave a child rapist even faster than I would leave a cheater...personally
This is just 100% coming off as a short story lol
Demand her phone and don't take no for a answer.  If she refuses you will have your answer
It's a kid, and she is in a position of authority over them. There is no age of consent that is illegal everywhere. If you don't want to confront her directly and deal with what happens, call the police and leave an anonymous tip of what's going on. When someone with authority over a child (coach, parent, teacher, counselor, etc,) has a sexual relationship with a minor, there is no age of consent protections. They can subpoena her phone and recover any deleted messages if something very wrong is really going on, and if not you're not on the hook for accusing her, it was "probably one of the other parents"
She could fully just be cheating with one of the parents and using practice as cover up.
What are the statutory laws in your state? You can be married to a rapist.

Easiest would be to get her phone when she’s sleeping.

The next think is set up a hidden camera.

Then I would just tell the kid “I know everything” and let the little kid run his mouth
!remindme 1 week
Updateme when you get to the bottom of this. TBH it’s not looking good.
Time to blow her up and snap her back to reality. All the signs are there. Maybe nothing is happening and she's just fantasising at the moment, but she needs a reality check that if she wants to fuck children she can do it as a single person
It's over, report her to the authorities and divorce her.
Go through that phone, install some spyware, cameras, follow and watch her at practice. Be secretive about it and get the answers you need. This whole situation smells fishy
UpdateMe!
Just gonna say this, if she's hooking up with this kid then preventing rape of a child by an authority figure is the priority here. Obviously you don't need to blow up your relationship, but just her description is inappropriate. 

I'm not usually one of these people, but if a wife was writing on here about her husband commenting on how developed and pretty a 17 year old he coaches is, the top comment would be to call the cops on him then sort things out, and rightfully so.
Get a private detective and a lawyer, don't confront her about it before having any evidence
!remindme 2 days
One way or another you need to find out what's going on. This is serious and could result in some serious ramifications.
Updateme
Check her phone. Don't ask her, she'll just delete shit and lie if she's hiding stuff
Call the cops.
First. Locked her phone? First yous should already have each other's passwords. Even if you trust her 100%. Its just a way of saying "hey i got nothing to hide." Ask her for it.
And with a minor. Yikes.
Updateme!
Updateme
If you think something’s off, try to keep things calm and don’t let her know you’re suspicious. You could follow her one day, maybe grab an Uber and see what she’s up to after practice if you’re really worried. It’s better not to go through her phone because that could create bigger problems. Instead, act like you trust her completely and keep things normal. Finding her password might help, but honestly, following her is probably the better way to find out what’s going on.
I would either try to get into her phone when she's sleeping or I would go to wherever she practices at night whenever it's supposed to over and spy on her.. try to catch her in the act. 17 is still a minor. And you can't call the cops without any evidence.
Show up to practice to "support her" but be late.
Your wife is potentially grooming or sleeping with a minor. Its time to go through her phone buddy. Sorry you are going through this but major red flags and its gotta be addressed ASAP. If it is with the kid, she needs to be away from that youth team immediately and if its with someone else, you still deserve to know. Non optional.
Trust your instinct.
My wife slept with a 18y/o kid..... Your not far off with the same wierd shit.... Next time she has to stay late.... Drive to.the school with dinner and see what's actually going on
Idk if this has been said, but wait till she's in the shower and go through her phone
Phone check time
I think you’re blowing out of proportion that she’s being “secretive”. I felt you were stretching to make that a point. If she was texting her 17 year old boyfriend that she could lose her job over and potentially be marked a pedophile, do you think she would really text him in your presence? Is she that bold? And she’s just fucking him and acting like everything’s so casual and treating you as if you’re a moron? 

The whole thing sounds fishy to me from your end. Maybe she is texting him because she does like him but I highly doubt there’s anything physical going on. 

Why not just be blunt and ask her straight out “you would never get with one of your students right?” Maybe play it off like a joke if she has a really bad reaction. Only ever ask once and maybe lube her up when she’s feeling happy or tipsy so it doesn’t come across as an accusation or paranoia. 

Never ask this more than once and don’t ask any follow up questions. Last thing you want is to push her into doing something like that. If she asks why you would ask that just say idk you’ve been telling me how pretty and athletic some of your students are and I feel like I have to compete now. That’s what I would do.
Here's the thing, he's 17 so it won't be hard to catch them if it's happening. I would try following them around
Maybe she’s cheating with a parent of one of the kids she coaches. Who knows. Hire a PI, you’ll get your answers there.
This is crazy, I want. Update me in 24 hours!
I think you are making this up.

A 17-year-old is really talented for his age? Players that age play for their high school and/or traveling teams and/or U-17 teams.

Come back with an account older than two hours and try again.
If your suspect your wife of being a pedo. You need to find out the truth, not respect her boundaries.
DO NOT CONFRONT. This is a time where hiring a PI could seriously save you.
This is serious shit so slap a GPS tracker on her car.
!remindme 1 day
Your wife is being sketchy. I agree that you should get your hands on that phone one way or another. You can’t give her an opportunity to delete everything. I really hope you’re wrong but…. Probs not. 

Update us tho plz
go to the practice and do some recon....
There's two aspects to this.
1. The potential of cheating, which based on what OP has posted, doesn't look good. At all.
2. The age issue. I'm assuming that the use of the term soccer means OP is in the US, but even is the kid is 17 and above the age of consent, in many countries, for those in positions of influence (teachers, sports coaches, religious leaders, etc), the age of consent moves to 18.
If this is the case in this situation, then there's a far bigger issue to deal with, than just the infidelity. Albeit OPs primary concern is obviously going to be whether his wife is cheating or not.
Private investigators
Just a perspective, no one who loves and respects you gaslights you. 

> "Stop, you're being paranoid"

Trust immediately lost, if I were you.
Mouth closed, eyes open. Do NOT confront until you have hard evidence. Don’t for a moment think you’re committing the unforgivable sin by snooping on her phone. A married couple should be open. If you can afford it, hire a PI.
updateme!
Are you acquainted with any other coaches on the team and would you be comfortable talking to them?

You don’t even have to ask to get some information. It’s possible they could get super nervous and evasive right off the bat and then you’ll know to ask more questions. 

Could even makeup a good excuse. Tell the other coach her birthday is coming up and ask about including the team in some sort of celebration. Just anything to get them talking about your wife and the team. See what develops.
Please work on your creative writing abilities.
If she's actually doing this with a 17 y/o, what she is doing is a serious crime.  No doubt about it, people who are in responsible positions (like a coach) over minors and abuse that position go to prison.

If this is happening, it's going to come out.  She's going to be disgraced, probably never coach soccer again, lose her job, and go to prison.  It's likely not going to go well for you either, unfortunately.

My kids swam in high school and one of the neighboring schools that we regularly swam against had a male coach who was involved in a sexual relationship with a 17 y/o female swimmer on their team.  It doesn't matter if it's consensual or not, the law is clear.  He spent 10 years in prison.  His wife waited on him though and I believe he's putting his life back together, but without teaching or coaching ever again.

My recommendation is that you need to get to the bottom of this.  I agree that an accusation is likely to just be met with an angry response.  You may need to do some detective work and find out if what you suspect is actually happening or not and then confront her.  Get into her phone, be in the area when she's "working late", follow her actions.  Not a great prospect but this is a serious matter.

But whether you discover the truth, the boys parents discover it, or someone else finds out accidentally, she's likely in big trouble.

I hope that this is all just as she says, but the warning signs are all there at this point.
I’ve been in this situation. OP, you need to try to see her phone before she deletes all proof. It could be hidden apps, messages, or even a secret email account that you don’t know about.
Dude. You already know,, check that phone.
I went through something similar enough to straight up say she is 100000% hiding something. If you ask to see her phone and she says no and starts accusing you of being paranoid etc… she is lying to your face bro. I’m sorry. Maybe first hide out at her practice and she what she does after… that’s what I did. Caught her in the act. Just sayin. You want answers? Then get them.
Your gut it never wrong. Check those messages
I would be upfront and let her know something seems off between the two of you. Tell her if she has anything she wants to talk about. Give her a chance. It’s her choice if she wants to dig herself deeper or come clean if she’s cheating.
Everybody going straight to the phone theory. I'd just surprise her with some treats at the end of her practice.
UpdateMe! In 7 days
In my experience, if you suspect something is off, something is off.

OP, if she is cheating, this has NOTHING to do with you. This is about her. You did NOTHING wrong. You are good enough, worthy of love, etc. Please see a therapist for the jealousy that will follow. Things get better.
Hire a private investigator to gather evidence, then go from there
Sometimes you gotta trust your gut.
!UpdateMe 1 week
I would put a voice activated recorder in her car, or a burner phone so you can track it's location.  If she's getting home late she is likely going somewhere after practice
Private investigator. Not only will you find out, but most likely obtain evidence. 

If she is… straight to jail.
If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck….

Just get one of your friends or you go to soccer practice and see what’s going on
If your wife is gaslighting you about her extremely sketchy behavior when you ask for transparency, your marriage is already over whether or not she is abusing this child. Start by calling CPS.
I feel for OP. I remember the moment I realised my ex was smiling at her phone, in that certain way you do, when you first meet someone you have a big crush on. 

It’s instantly recognisable (even though I was blind to it for a long time), and it really sinks your stomach when you see your spouse doing it whilst on the phone. 

Ops instinct and gut his telling him everything he needs to know, but accepting it and acting on it is heartbreaking, to say the least.
Don’t ask her. Do it.

If you ask her, she will delete everything before giving it to you and it will endanger the teenager more. 

Be smarter about this.
If she is having sex with a minor, she will NEVER show her phone before deleting everything. Never. She will risk divorce before providing evidence that would put her in jail. And if he asks, she will delete all evidence.
OP, 

PLEASE,  immediately remove your head from your anal orifice.  Check her devices. Pop in at practice.  Do what you need to do. Odds are, you already know the answer. Trust your gut and follow through.
As soon as she said how "developed" he is...like nah, she's a pedo
OP, don't ask. If you do, then she'll know that you are onto her. Then she'll likely go to extra lengths to hide her tracks and you'll never know the truth.
Yeah if ahe can't had him her phone unlocked without protest then she is most definitely hiding something.
Others have already given advice.

If you’re going through her phone, put her phone on airplane mode first. It’ll hide some potential footprints. Check her battery usage and see which app she’s using the most. Lookup the last downloaded app.

Take photos. Lots. Everything possible.

Don’t callout her strange attitudes. 
Act normal (if not calm, so go masterbate or someshit beforehand). 
Find out asap and find a friend you can go to.
Normally I would never advocate for this either, but there is a child's safety at stake. Snoop.
COMPLETELY agree. Normally this may be toxic but this situation is extremely different. Don’t worry about her reaction, just worry about this kid :( you’d be doing him a favor.
I just said the same thing. OP, needs to search for evidence. If he finds it he needs to document and go to the police.
Be careful what you think you want to do here, or you may not like what you learn. 

If you pay the phone bill, you can get details of every call online. Call details is what to look for. If you ask your cellphone provider, you can probably get step by step instructions. 

Do you really want to know, and are you willing to put your marriage and your life on the line for that reason? 

Once you look, you have no right to privacy for your own calls, and you will forever lose any trust that you and your wife have now, before you look. If you can look at her calls, don’t be surprised when she wants to look at yours.
R*ping a kid. 
Is there a way he can call the phone company and get a list of logs and text messages sent from her phone?
Yes this needs to be done asap.Years ago when I was in a bad place, I would cheat on my boyfriend. With a guy I was friends with but I would talk about him to my bf, just the exact way your wife is doing. I did this often before I had actually done this cheating and still a bit after. She may not have cheated yet but she may be having a flirty relationship with him which may be the beginning.
Agreed. I might also not tell the PI who exactly you think she's cheating with either, just say you "don't feel right about her being out for so long after these soccer games should be over, if she's even attending them at all" or some such.   
  
Keep your worst-case fears between yourself and this reddit post for now, there isn't a worse accusation to make falsely. The PI will go get you the facts, then proceed from there. But for the kid's sake, don't wait long.
Plus a pi is a third party source and the evidence that is collected is not considered tampered with so it is all totally admissible in court. Definitely have your facts straight before you do anything too crazy. These are serious accusations and making the wrong ones could make you a huge AHOLE but if you're right you'd be putting away a pedophile which I'm so sorry if that's the case. I know she's your wife and you love her but if she is around your age and he is 17 that is not okay. Age of consent is usually a three year window every state is different im sure. In arkansas it's only three years difference.
This would be what I would do. 

Also, as a teacher, it’s a huge no-no to even suggest a close-r relationship with a student. When I coached it was very clear to only be alone with a student if they were waiting for parents or if they were on the phone with a family member. There was no “hanging out after practice” or “helping pack stuff up”. Hate to have those rules but as a male teacher coaching a girls team it is what it is. I also tell every teacher, period, to always keep a door open with a student if you are alone with them and keep something between you.

Edit: I have no stats to back it up, but it always seems in the media it’s both genders who take advantage of kids in a position of authority.
Solid advice
This is more effective than the phone, which can be pretty easily wiped. Keep your distance, borrow a friend’s car if you can. Or hire an actual PI (preferably a female, no one ever suspects a female PI).
This is what I would do.


Play PI over a couple week period. Shouldn't be too difficult if yoy know where the practices and games are.
Ooh, have a very very close friend, like a guy friend who you can explain this to, to drive you. Go to the practice, and wait. And see what happens 🤷‍♂️ better then driving your own car. If it's nothing, you can wipe the sweat off your brow but if it's something, you've got a witness come court time
This is what I would do. I view going through your partner's phone as a gross violation of privacy... However literally every court in the USA has ruled that you have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public and I'm inclined to agree. 

At the same time; I'm also inclined to believe that if you think your partner capable of something like this in the first place; your relationship is already on life support.
Finally someone says it. This isn't cheating, it's an accusation of being a child predator grooming someone while in a position of authority over them and molesting as well. Way more serious.
This! If she is, in fact, in a relationship with this minor, she is absolutely a predator. I wonder what age the boy was when she may have started the relationship. 

I was the victim of something similar when I (29F) was 15/16. My coach (25M) manipulated/groomed me. He was arrested and convicted of 10 felonies. He was also married at the time he started the "relationship" with me. I had never been with anyone else before that, so he absolutely took advantage. I'm still going to therapy for the trauma I went through back then. 

If you really think your wife is doing this, then you absolutely should snoop and find out for sure. And if you find solid proof, you need to divorce her and turn her into the authorities if the boy is under the age for consent in your state.
Technically in most states this wouldn’t be illegal unfortunately
Too many people don't see it that way when it's an adult woman and a teenage boy.
Why isn’t your comment higher???
Rapist*
That’s correct. I had to scroll all the way down to find this.
I had to look way too far to see this comment!
But obviously don't screenshot any explicit photos he may have sent her, you don't want csam on your phone, that'll be a whole other can of worms.
Don’t forget to search your name in her messages.
> If she is cheating with a 17 year old, your marriage is over, proceed as such.

Where were you when Will Smith needed you the most?
Do all of that except the "leave" part. Follow your lawyers advice for your state. You may need to stay in the house until a seperation agreement is filed with the court (or risk losing it)
Man, if she is cheating, that's the hope ain't it
This is what came to mind for me. She could be just appreciating the son because she’s attracted to dad.
That’s what I thought too. Which is better, but still not good for OP.
That would be preferable
Fucking ay.
For all the people saying go through the phone—there’s a good chance if this is legit she would have changed her password.
Do you people just not have passwords?
Yup. See what happens when practice ends
Same here. We've always had fingerprint or passkey for each other's phones just because it's easier. We almost never touch them but when we need to we don't have to faff about it.
Won’t help if they WhatsApp or Snapchat which is the most likely form of communication
Easiest way to

> I don't usually condone snooping, but her being sly and secretive about her phone and staying later in the evening then expected is pretty suspicious.

That's the thing. 

All these people saying "Oh don't snoop just ask her" are probably the people who get cheated on constantly throughout their life and can't figure out why...

It's not "snooping" if you've seen so many red flags that you are starting to suspect your spouse is banging a kid... He would be acting on a strong suspicion and not just doing it to be controlling or  invade her privacy for the sake of doing it. 

I've been married 7 years and have never once felt I needed to search my wife's phone because I suspected her doing anything. If you strongly suspect it usually where there is smoke there is fire.
Screenshot everything but for the love of god, if she’s being sent explicit photos please do not take a picture of it, as that’s CSAM and can get you in trouble along with her.
WhatsApp, iMessage, Facebook messenger etc wouldn't be included.
In most states this wouldn’t be illegal unfortunately
Tbh this is the order in which OP should proceed. I’m sure by the end of step 1 OP will know.
5. Talk to your wife
No replies at all. Smells smelly.
This is so rage bait
I have also been thinking this. No update? No reply? Sus af and when I looked at his page, it was only this post on diff subs some of which had been removed sooooo...lame if it is fake. Lame if it's real too, but a different kind of lame if fake.
This is terrible advice.  Most women are very good at lying and you can't even tell that they are doing it.  If he needs evidence he should collect it in secret and then move on with his life...get a lawyer, divorce it up.  If he's in a no fault state, it doesn't matter what she does, she can't be held liable for her romantic indiscretions.  There's no point in confronting her.  That will just make her more careful about being caught.
I like this approach because once an investigation has started and they begin to question your wife, it would be VERY telling if she never tells you about it, never mind the investigation actually turning something up.
100% hes 17
How would that go lol? Hey young man, is your underage friend fucking my wife all the time?
sex on the field with a child is wild
Fair assumption.
Surprised I had to scroll down this far to find this.  If it's an accredited US Soccer club team, they definitely have some sort of oversight by safesport.  At least in Swimming this is taken very seriously.
but it'll be under the father's name, not the boy, so it wouldn't prove she was communicating with the boy.
18 is the legal age of an adult.  I agree he's making his own decisions (probably even bragging to his friends), but legally he's still a child.
This is Reddit...it's a separate death sentence for every year under the irresponsible adult's age!
That's advice from like 2006.   All the messaging services people actually use like iMessage, WhatsApp, snapchat, instagram, Messenger are over the internet and not on a phone bill.
This is one of the least intrusive things you can do, still yielding enough information to let you know if you need to dig deeper. 

Take a look at your wife’s text and phone message details starting with the last couple months, and going further back if you start seeing a solid history of repeated contact with a number you don’t recognize. 

If you find repeated contact with a specific number, you can Google it. People’s phone numbers may easily be in a database that’s picked up by a ‘people finder’ website. 

You could also grab a burner phone and call the number. A lot of people don’t pickup calls from unknown numbers, but if he’s a high school kid, he might think someone passed along his info to someone else. 

Check your bank and credit cards for charges that coincide with times she’s “at a team function” you suspect may be a cover. 

Last shot is to hire a private investigator and have her followed on a couple of afternoons you know she has some plan, but it seems bogus. If you feel like that’s too expensive, consider renting or borrowing a car she’s not so familiar with, and follow her yourself. Cheating in general is one thing. If she’s letting this kid get in her car and taking him anywhere but straight home, that is inappropriate. 

It’s important for you and your marriage to have some kind of proof before you accuse her or go to the school or police with the suspicion she’s having inappropriate contact with a minor. Doing that will almost definitely end up with your wife being questioned, and it is likely to get out. She could lose her day job, and you will definitely blow your marriage up. 

I agree with you that she’s acting like someone who is cheating. Been there, and what you’re saying is quite familiar. If you confront her before you have proof, she may still cheat, but you can be sure she’ll cover her tracks better than ever, so act a little clueless for now. 

I hope you’re wrong, but thank you for making sure this kid isn’t being molested.
Is your son a gifted soccer player with a female coach? If so, that might speed things along.
Yeah, but based on what he shared I feel like this could be extremely damaging if he's wrong. It could cost her reputation, coaching, marriage and possibly career. I would keep snooping and dig deeper before you question his parents. EEEK!
[deleted]
I'm thinking (,hoping really) it's the kids dad
This is one of the best advices I’ve seen here, you’re a smart man
And don't be part of the coverup whatever you do. Get this thing sorted quick.
It's actually illegal to do that unless the vehicle is in OP's name. Served on a jury once for that very situation.
Depends on where she lives for it to be sexual assault.

31 US states have age of consent at 16 years old.

  7 US states have age of consent at 17 years old.
I agree. I think it’s odd he can’t go through her phone. I took a nap today but had a grocery delivery coming. So I gave my phone to my husband and he had it with him in the living room for 4 hours while I napped in the bedroom. And he has my password. And he opened my phone to track the grocery order. If he wanted to go through it he totally could, but there’s nothing on it 🤷🏻‍♀️. I have his password too so 🤷🏻‍♀️
This probably isn’t the time but I want to say one time my ex & I were going to pick up some food and he caught me smiling like that through the windshield of the car as he was walking back. He immediately came in and said “talking to my replacement?” And I proceeded to turn around and show him the photo of the octopus meme I was dying about. He actually looked disappointed by that lol! Just wanted to add a dash of wholesome to this conversation 😂
I’ve been there too and I wouldn’t wish that pain on anyone. I just got out of an insanely abusive relationship where she cheated on me constantly so I feel that hard.
Jesus fuck this comment was triggering, having been there too 🤮
Completely glossing over pedophile
I think I’ve seen that smile recently …,,
Honestly he should hire a PI. If she’s really doing this, she’s probably covering her tracks. Something this big needs concrete evidence. OPs emotions are too high to see anything, he may react before having proof, giving her a chance to shut everything down, this should probably be done quietly so she doesn’t suspect a thing.
Document it all. Forward screenshots. Get lawyer.
Law enforcement can recover any deleted messages through service provider servers going back at least 12 months.
Or hire a PI
And then let the school and his parents know.
Yup, when your gut is screaming at you, you’re right
I'm hoping she meant his skill development. Like when someone says "So-and-so has really developed as a musician."
A pedophile is actually a person who is attracted to pre pubescent kids.  A 17 year old in most cases looks like an adult physically and is mostly done with puberty.  I think you mean Ephebophilia which is actually being attracted to 15-19 year olds and that is legal in most states.
Ok not to defend the cheater, but fancying a 17 years old isnt pedo. Having sex with person below 18 is illegal in US sure, but 17 years old is not a child anymore. 

And in most of a world that 17 years old would be legal too.
Why would a pedophile be attracted to a developed 17 year old?
Video. Video records of everything that you pull up, *as you’re pulling it up* from unlock to close
I wish I had you with my child custody bullshit. You’re very intelligent
And if you can't get to her phone.   

Just check her bills.. if she is cheating one number will stand out like a dog's ball.

That will be the catalyst to get a PI to grab further evidence.
Just don't be taking photos of any sexting he may have done. Otherwise you could be charged for possession of kiddy porn as well !!
Also I think if you’re wrong you need to confess your snoop.   

Blame Reddit and some beer but you need to come clean if you’re wrong.
Exactly! We aren’t just dealing with a potentially unfaithful spouse, we are also possibly dealing with a sex offender
I think cheating outweighs the toxicity of going through someone's phone by miles.  
I remember I when I found out my boyfriend (10 years) cheated on me. He was leaving for his shift earlier than usual, coming home super late (he always told me it was to hangout with his co workers and go drink with them. I would be invited but I just don't enjoy drinking too much or the atmosphere at the time), and he would just always snapchat them all the time. Did I ask if something was going on first? Yes.

Well, I went through his phone and found out. A few of the girls knew about me because I would sit at the bar he worked at often (they all worked together). And one of them posted on her story (for me to see), "It's so disrespectful to invade your boyfriend's privacy by going through his phone. You should just leave him if you felt you had to do that."

GIRL he was CHEATING ON ME and the most disrespectful thing out of this entire situation was me going through his phone?
I would be dismayed to be cheated on. 

I would be concerned to have my 33 partner cheat on me with somebody 17 who they plausibly thought was older because they met at a bar.  

I would be ALARMED and DIVORCING somebody who knowingly chose to date a minor, in her custodian care as an authority figure.  That level of judgement is not redeemable. With god maybe but he has more patience.   I don’t wanna get old with that person. 

On the other hand … if you snoop and are wrong you are now either going to confess that and deal with it, or you have become a villain. 

This is a rare case indeed.  I’d still advocate for asking her but, continued ignorance isn’t an option.
I mean, your partner is a potential pedophile... What fucking world do you just brush that off?
Not true. iMessages, WhatsApp, Facetime calls do NOT show up.
Not unless he pays the bill, AND it’s on a family plan, AFAIK.
It could easily be a kids parent and not the kid, but she sees a lot of him in the dad
As a PI this is the way. Just hire them and say you want to know who she’s spending time with outside of work. They’ll get pictures and videos for you so if she is cheating you’ve already got all the evidence for an easy divorce
I would not tell him anything other than "I think my wife is cheating on me", you're right. The only good that could come from telling him is that many PI's are ex cops and it might motivate him to catch a predator. Not to mention that a divorce of someone in jail usually goes 100 percent your way.
Not a lawyer. Much of the “legal advice” contained in this post is wrong. Just because evidence comes from a third party source does not make it “totally admissible in court” and no jurisdiction in the US has a “three year window” age of consent. Age of consent hovers between 16-18. There are other “Romeo and Juliet” laws in some jurisdictions that do not apply here.

OP needs answers, not bad legal advice.
Rental car, unmarked also works. 
Veronica Mars approves.
Ikr. Plus what if he can't unlock the phone.If it's an android OP can access it by connecting it to a pc using a USB cable. Idk about apple though.
I’m honestly surprised more people (even the husband?) aren’t more concerned about the pedophilia than the cheating
When I was in high school, I suspected a coach of "dating" one of the girls in my grade. I called her and him out on it and everyone ignored me or got mad. 


Then after we graduated, she posted pics of them married and together and I straight up called him out as being a pedophile and gross as fuck for having relationship with a student while he had an authority position above her. So gross. 


Anyways no one agreed with me and basically I was an asshole. 


Its nice to see others agree that this is not okay. 
My son is 17 and also plays soccer. They are still so innocent and naive at that age, I would be livid if an older female associated with his team was taking advantage of him.
I wouldn’t be too sure of that. Even if the age of consent is 16 or 17, she is still his coach, which could be seen as abuse of her position of power.
Well, yeah.  Because otherwise, it's statutory rape.
Yes, the son might have his father's eyes.
Theyre married do you people really have passwords that your husband or wife doesnt know? Im sure almost everyone has a password.
Generally partners know one another’s passcode
Or iMessage
It’s a start point

Honestly, thank you for this. I looked through my exes phone when I saw a message (locked screen but notification) “because you had a boyfriend on the boat”. This was after our cruise where she was talking and flirting with a guy while arguing with me nothing was happening. Yeah, there were messages. I tried talking to her about the message but she just lied. 
If you have to ask permission to see your MARRIED partners phone contents you have serious issues in the relationship already. Emphasis on married.
No, but whatever group organizes the sports team will have rules about this and while going to them first isn’t the right answer, if you find proof giving them a chance to protect the kids in their league is appropriate. Also, age of consent varies and often anyone over 18 who has a relationship with someone under 18 is only given a pass if the age difference is limited, often 3 years. This is way outside that. Of course, it may still be in the emotional cheating range but still a problem.
It actually reeks even worse when you realize it's a fresh account that doesn't imply itself as a throwaway that posted this same story in five subreddits at once.
i dont get why people post fake stories? what do they gain from it aside from wasting thier own time?
Agreed, this is definitely SUS!!!
Red flag for sure.
Good to know. OP, don’t do my recommendation
Yeah people reading my comment should be careful not to get too emotionally involved. For me it was a case where there were multiple signs, not just the smile. She was sitting at the other end of the bed, glued to her phone - among other things. 

I know maturity and forgiveness is the trend, but she can rot in the gutter, and we still wouldn’t be even.
Thanks for that. Sometimes that is really needed. These posts depress me, even if what people say actually happened it's not always going to be the case.
My husband got upset when he saw me smiling at my phone "like that" just the once. The smile and a long text chain. He asked what was going on. I showed it - it was me recounting the story of how I met him to any sister and I was smiling as I re-read it. Lesson learned for him. Now he just asks if he can smile too and I show him my phone.
Can’t believe you cheated with an Octopus. Unless you’re a marine biologist, you should be ashamed.
Yeah, but when he asked what she was doing, she didn't show any meme, she said she was texting with a parent asking for game schedules. And that's not the kind of conversation that is supposed to make someone smile like that !
I (40F) am happily married and I smile like that when I text with my girl friends- we crack each other up and I love them so much
Eh be careful. If it helps, she’ll be doing it constantly, so it won’t be a one time kinda thing. Think about how you get when you first meet a crush and hit it off. Big smile while on the phone, is something I catch myself doing. Hiding the phone, constantly checking it, reacting as soon as she gets a notification (if she doesn’t normally). 

For me that smile was the thing that tied it all together, as opposed to the main symptom. 

Don’t do what I did, which is then stay with them, just to get dumped and strong along 2 years later, just to catch them trying to message the same guy (and get rejected, because he was like “wtf do you not remember what happened?”), and then get in a relationship with some random guy on tinder two days later. 

Five years with a girl, who saved from an abusive ex, because I didn’t have the self respect to walk away the minute she showed her true colours.
I don't know why his 1st step wasn't to call someone to confirm the entire team is staying late for practice. Hell I'd drive over there and spy on them myself. He could crack it in a single afternoon.
He should get a PI on this. She is possibly having an affair with a 17 year old boy; what happens when he goes off to college, does she move on to a 15 year old?  

The possible cheating is one thing. The fact that she is attracted to a child is another. And the fact that she has put herself in a position to be around children is disturbing.  If this were a man that was being talked about, people would be focused on the possible predator situation.  If OP's wife is a possible predator, he needs to distance himself from looking into the situation but hire a PI to find out what is going on.  Then go to the parents of the boy if 17 is the age of consent in his state. Otherwise, he should go to the police- it's not about nuking his wife for cheating; it's about dealing with a predator if the PI finds this is the case.
Bro, just show up to practice 15 minutes before it ends. $100 binoculars from Amazon, and see what she’s up to! When she gets home before you, just say you had to do some paperwork/errand.
She's covering her tracks because she is commiting a crime.  Even if 17 is a legal age, most states have grooming statutes to protect children who are having sex with a coach, pastor, teacher, mentor, etc who is a position to coerce them.
If she's fucking a child, definitely get a PI involved
This is the way
Besides if its not the kid but some parents while he's looking left she'll be on the right. Its better to let a professional handle it and get the basics and from there he can then either find out the truth or find out he was an idiot. If its a legit thing she is doing, he should then follow up with a divorce attorney as Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck that shit.
Retention period is carrier specific and 12 months is being very, very generous. It also varies by content requested. Also, probable cause would already need to be established for these records.

The individual state's age of consent law(s) would also come into play. Many states have caveats for people in positions of authority like LE, teachers, coaches, clergy, etc.
This assumes the OP in is the USA.. In the UK and most of Europe (afaik), sex with the 17 year old is perfectly legal.
Lmao, yep. People think deleting a message will save them.
I can confirm other replies stating that this isn't necessarily the case, and depends on the provider.



The contents of your SMS message ARE visible to your provider, but may not be retained long-term.  That you sent a message may be retained for a different amount of time.


And the interchanges between providers may have different policies.
They can be recovered from the phone by running a recovery software.  No need for the service provider. Download a decent program onto the laptop and ask for her phone. Even if she has deleted everything the software will bring enough back to know. Just don’t tell her in advance and when she hands the phone over hook it up. If she then goes ballistic over it you have your answer even if you don’t get to run the software.
Definitely this because you can’t risk a confrontation without absolute proof considering there is a minor involved. As far as being brought up on charges, I think the age of consent is 16 depending on the state and circumstances. Considering that this is from a teaching type position it might have more bearing. 

My intuition is that the kid is a cover for his dad! There’s a plot twist. It makes more sense from the legal perspective. Either way, her behavior is very suspicious
Bingo.  That is much more effective.  From the sound of things, OP will known after one night of her being watched by someone who she doesn’t know.
My words exactly. PI are expensive, but in this case it is worth it.
Forward or copy/paste significant texts to yourself, from her phone.


If it’s an iPhone, remember you can text the contact information of anyone in her contacts list.

Remember to erase the PROOF you did it, though.
he's 17
“Sorry honey I just thought you were raping  with a minor so I snooped your phone, but I was wrong so it’s all good”

There’s no coming back from that. I would be gutted to learn my husband thought I would do something like this. But if he has good reason to think this he needs to find out o fully support the snoop but if she isn’t this is a relationship ending suspicion if she is then it’s more than just a relationship ender,
You don’t need to confess. In a healthy relationship though, phones should be available for either partner to use just like you might borrow each others laptop or keys. I dunno. 🤷‍♂️
I was thinking the same think ,is he does sneak look at her phone with out her knowing and there isn’t any bad text her should confess to her what he did . “Is there a chance she is guilty and deleted text before he looked ?sure “ but still gotta confess
Cheating outweighs going thru someone’s phone but having sex with a minor outweighs cheating. This is far beyond a relationship wrong this is a legal wrong
My husband was banging prostitutes who specifically advertised anal. 

Then he was banging me with no condoms. 

When I snooped he tried to maintain I was the bad guy. 

Such bollox.
I don't even think he needs to be secretive. Explaining your request and laying it out would help to make your request to see their messages more palatable and harder to refuse too. Something like:

*"I've noticed some unusual behaviour from you lately that has me worried. You've been texting someone frequently, been secretive with your phone, spending more time at training and more. You're exhibiting actions that have raised my concerns. I'm typically not one to jump to conclusions, but these changes are troubling to me. One or two changes would not be an issue but there are multiple changes I cannot explain.  If you want to ease my worries and show that I've reached the wrong conclusion, the best way would be to let me see your messages."*

Added: I wouldn't even mention it being about the boy. If pressed you could mutter something about "I don't know. One of the fathers?".
Similar thing here. Noticed the ex doing that big smile you do, when you first meet a crush and can’t stop smiling at your phone. It’s instantly recognisable (imo), and set off enough alarms that I couldn’t help but snoop. 

One day I had the clever idea to type in some guys name on Snapchat, to find a hidden chat with nothing but sexting and flirting.
I never understood why people get so upset about phone snooping. If you have a solid suspicion and you normally aren’t a paranoid person, it’s completely reasonable to do so
You're 100% right. A cheater deserves everything they get coming to them. Someone going through their phone is nothing compared to cheating.

But also, keep in mind that they might not be cheating. If they're innocent and you have suspicions, they don't deserve having their phone gone through. I'd want some kind of evidence (even if it's just anecdotal) before going through their phone.

OP needs to immediately ask his wife to show him her phone when she's caught out. If there's been a long list of things that make him creeped out, it's a fair ask. If she doesn't let him, then that's justification to look through her phone.

And if he does find something, he needs to take it to the school and/or police. The school need to take it to the police if he doesn't. Whatever the age of consent is where OP lives, there are quite possibly laws about teachers having relations with pupils.
I’d have to make a fake acct and her add for me to post to my story “it’s so disrespectful to sleep with someone else’s boyfriend AND post about it. You should go see a therapist for your obvious issues.” Or something even more smart *ss, bc what in the world kinda high horse you gotta be on to be knowingly cheating with someone and think their gf is in the wrong for getting some real answers.
Cheating far outweighs.
My ex partner cheated on me, all the signs were there and I asked them to come clean because I could tell something was up.
They chose not to come clean.
I snooped that night and I saw things that still upset me now when I think about them.

I woke her up and confronted her about it and her first reaction was "Wow you actually went through my phone? How dare you."

I left immediately.
I agree, I've done it (a few times 💀) myself. Like yes in a perfect world nobody would invade anyone elses privacy, but usually if you get to that point of wanting to look, you probably have a gut instinct telling you to and it's always right in my experience
That’s kinda what I was thinking/hoping, I feel like it wouldn’t even come to mind for the kid to be a possible option in this situation but OP knows his wife best so I believe it🤢
That had occurred to me as well, which is another reason not to tell the PI who you suspect, so they don't waste their time on unintended red herrings.
Also Nancy Drew
It's not pedophilia... in some states 17 is an adult... though the coach/mentor aspect of the relationship may have some impact on if any activity with the teen is considered 'statutory rape' or not.
Pedophillia refers to prepubescent children, not 17 year athlete superstars, while very inappropriate I doubt the kid will be in therapy because he banged the hot football coach.
[deleted]
I guess it's very dependent on the individual. At 17 I'd already had a part time job for 3 years, drove a car, went to parties & drank alcohol, had been sexually active for 2 years, and would absolutely have been 100% consenting if my (hypothetical) hot 33 year old coach was up for it. I'm also pretty sure the age of consent where I live is 16, so it would have been completely legal, too.
My 'extra' son (closest friends eldest) is 19 and boy is he a dumbass. I would be FURIOUS.
Which, again, isn't illegal in most states. A title 9 violation? Yes. A reason she'd definitely get fired? Hell yeah.
exactly, totally fuck her over legally and professionally
Yeah, let's hope she's just weirdly proud of her new steppish son.
Prolly not
On the flip side, if you never feel the need to go into your partners phone, you forget their password. I only remember my girlfriend’s password because it’s my bday and she forgets mine any time she tries to get into it and I need to tell her
Yeah, partners, who aren’t cheating on each other.
>Also, age of consent varies and often 

Often, but not most often. 17 is legal in the majority of the US. Regardless of how that makes you feel.
33 year old accountant becomes coach of unrelated Under 18 soccer team is such a bizarre starting point. At least have a made up child be on the team too.
It's to drive an agenda that women are hoe bags whose phones need to be snooped through. That's my opinion anyway.
Red *card* for sure*
Honestly, I felt that. And as someone who’s been deconstructing their Christianity and isn’t one anymore, I now understand and agree with forgiveness on your own time *if ever at all*. That’s for you to decide, if and when you decide to and if it comes down to *never* never, then *never never* it is. It gets drilled into our brains so much about being the one to forgive because it’s what the big man would do and want you to do, and it’ll make *you* feel better. But why should I have to forgive my abusive ex-stepfather who’s fucked me up so much at 15 it’s affects have lasted well into my 30’s? Why should I forgive my ex-fiancé for going and being with the woman who lived down the block’s date for her yearly formal family reunion while I was unconscious for two days in the ICU? For *my* benefit? If I wanna be mad and hang onto it for however long I intend to, then let me be. After all, *I’m* the one who decides IF and when I want to forgive because some things just don’t deserve it. I hope you’re in a better place these days. Forgive if and when you’re ready to if you haven’t already.
Sometimes, forgiveness isn't deserved. Just because some old fictional book says it is doesn't make it so.

Hope you've found happiness ☺️
Well either have a friend follow her or something like that if your guy tells you then follow the gut instinct, seriously do t just keep hoping or thinking about if she is going to be honest with you about anything. 

Unfortunately you may just have to lerk and follow her or do a hide out and Pictures if your able too. Hey I know those gut instincts and I always follow them not my head or heart!  (Keep us posted) hope you get some answers soon or it will eat at you).
lol, that’s how I feel about my ex.  Found a voicemail on his phone from a woman asking about my health.
My first thought was "so, drive over and see if you can catch them 'in the act'" seems logical to me 🤷‍♀️ 
Check phone for evidence while she's asleep, take photos of any evidence and make sure you check recently deleted. Then take a trip over to the grounds when she's "late home" and see for yourself what's going on. 

Alternatively, hire a PI
Probably because if she’s fucking a minor it’s A LOT bigger than just “cracking it”. She’s in a position of power with this kid, IF this is what’s really happening, OP needs to be careful as fuck. Accusations like this are huge. Sure, he could drive over there and catch something happening, but if he’s too emotional and riled up to get solid proof, it’s he said she said.
Agreed. It’s also a SafeSport violation — even just the texting component. Get evidence and go to the police. 

[How to file a report with SafeSport](https://uscenterforsafesport.org/report-a-concern/)
Police would interview 17 yo.  Parents would be informed and they would have him give up his phone.  They would want to know if he’s being sexually groomed by a coach.  If shit is there. We’ll see her on a front page somewhere.
Messaging apps differ too. I think Meta only has something like 90 days to officially wipe deleted data.
We don't really refer to football as soccer tho 🤔
This. My wife had an affair with the coach of my kids sports team, and she showed a great interest in his kids (his girls, through they were younger, she was sort of fawning over them).
Thought the same thing. To me, just as likely it’s his dad.

Also, get some proof first. Fuck privacy. Look at her phone. Look at “recently deleted pictures” and deleted texts. “Screen time” can tell you what apps she’s using.

Sneak by, or have a friend do it right at the end of practice. See where she goes afterward. Ask her why she was late when she got home and catch her in a bold lie. Take pictures.
Copy pasting is not proof. You need screenshots or, even easier, photos of the screen
What’s your point?
He doesn't have to say who he thought she was sleeping with. Just "I noticed some stuff that bothered me, and it was tearing me up".
I don't know that you need to confess, but I wouldn't say everything should be free reign. Yeah, you shouldn't be freaked out by your SO touching your phone or vice versa, but there's an understanding of privacy. I'm sure my SO has said things at points to friends that I wouldn't want to read, and I'm sure I've done the same. Some conversations are private, and that's ok. Hiding that you're fucking someone else is not.
Yeah this, you could leave your phone in the car and ask to borrow hers for a moment to google something or use the calculator or whatever and see how she responds to letting you borrow it which should be a normal thing. It's the response you are looking out for, if she doesn't want you to borrow it that could lead you to your conversation around what the issue is and trusting each other etc
Yeah, and the law frowns on adults having sex with children. 

If he turns her in, their marriage is over. She’ll go to prison and he’ll be a single parent with no friends. 

If he finds out the worst and doesn’t turn her in, he may face charges for not telling the police. 

He needs to gut up and talk to his wife without a word about the soccer players. If he won’t talk to her about their marriage, it’s all but over already.
Oh, absolutely, I just went off topic! 
In no way did I mean for my comment to signify a relationship is related to grooming. It was just an off-topic comment about “going through someone’s phone” part.
YES the shift of BLAME. Like, please tell me where I went wrong sir? Please tell me how I betrayed you so drastically?
I noticed it doesn’t say ex husband.
What a dirty bastard
When you are in a serious committed relationship his phone is my phone.. My phone is his phone.. I trust him and he trusts me. I don't know why people think it's weird to use their partners phone. If you arent hiding anything . What's the big deal?? We don't constantly have each other's phone but we definitely don't mind using each other's or handing them over to each other.
She will be outraged, saying he is insecure and controlling, threaten with divorce and make him the bad guy. She will probably refuse to show her phone, especially if the affair involves the kid.
I don’t think he should do this, because if she is involved with the 17 year old (or anyone else), then she’s going to erase all evidence if there has been inappropriate conduct.
I agree. If she gets angry, she most likely has something to hide. Years and years ago, my husband approached ME very straightforwardly with concerns because I had been working a lot and working late and texting coworkers more. We genuinely had a lot of out-of-the-norm stuff going on and I was exhausted. So I was acting differently. He thought, because one of the coworkers I worked with was an attractive guy, that something might be going on. When he confronted me out of the blue and gave me his reasons, I was completely surprised. But because I had nothing to hide, I validated his feelings and offered him my phone. I opened up every single text chain with everyone in the group. No reason not to. Think about it, if your partner asks for your phone and you genuinely have nothing to hide, there should be zero hesitation with handing it over. None. I bet if he asked for her phone to see if an app worked a certain way on her phone because it's glitching on his (or made up some excuse), she wouldn't hand it over either.
Been there. That smiling at the phone. Ugh. What I found changed my life.
Not necessarily. I frequently open my partner's phone for non-snooping reasons - e.g. when he's driving and asks me to change the podcast for him.
Yes most rage bait I see ends up with the consensus that "women bad."
Grieving the death of someone is the same thing. If and when you get ready to start living again and move forward, then it has been long enough for you. Until then, everyone else can grieve their own way and leave you the fuck alone!
Congratulations on your deconstruction. That must be incredibly difficult. I am proud of you.
Forgiveness doesn’t have to turn to reconciliation.  If you are ready to forgive the other person doesn’t even know they have been forgiven. That’s when it really is for your own peace of mind.  People seem to think that if you forgive then you have to let that person back into your life and that’s absolutely false. 
(I am not meaning you SpaceWitch)  your comment just made me think about that.
>I now understand and agree with forgiveness on your own time if ever at all.

*That* part. People hell bent on forgiveness at any cost are either a) perpetual victims or b) expecting to coast through life fucking people over without consequence
Thank you. As I’ve said to the wannabe zen monks: forgiveness and moving on, are two separate things. You can move on and not forgive. I figure most of the wannabe life advice philosophers claiming others, are just trying to role play as someone who has it all figured out, by giving unsolicited advice, based on their imaginary presumptions, built upon from the tiny slither of info they gained, reading the comment.
Same place my brain went. Why isn’t he being more proactive? I get there is shock, denial at points, and a slew of feelings, but I’d want them either out or put to bed immediately no matter the outcome. I know it sucks, and badly. Been cheated on, but certainly not this scenario …
That happened to me. I was the coach, and she poured it on, even with my wife right there at the games. Of course I didn’t reciprocate so nothing happened, but it was awkward.
Ding ding ding we have a winner! She’s fucking the dad
You’re right, in so far as forwarding it to yourself establishes a chain of custody.

If you copy and paste it from their phone, into a text message to yourself, and send it to yourself, from their phone, that should ALSO establish a chain of custody, or at least provide probable cause for a warrant.
It was a joke. The kid spoken about in the post is 17 also, and you gave a similar complement about that other commenter to what the OP's wife was saying about the 17 year old kid lol

I thought it was pretty good
i’ll be real, most partners still won’t like that if they aren’t cheating lol
unfortunately most states age of consent is 16.  With some being 15.  I've reported people to the police for having sex with 16 year olds and they just ask the age of the child and when you say 16, our state's age of consent is 16, they just say that they can't do anything.
17 is legal is allot of states
I did not entertain that nonsense whatsoever.
Exactly, she absolutely \*will not\* hand over that phone willingly if it contains proof she is having sex with a child.
Google that actor but where the fuck did I put my own phone. Yeah I use my partners heaps.
Thank you very much, friend. It’s… been a journey and a half and a lot of harmful realizations coupled with a lot of bargaining on my end only to say fuck it lol. The crazy thing is, I’m not angry with or disgusted with Christianity itself, it’s certain “Christians” or as my former pastor used to say, “Cardio Christians” lol, who make me angry with their constant display of un-Christian-like behavior towards anyone who’s different (I had questions growing up they didn’t like and whoopsies, surprise I’m bisexual, that’s also not good!) as though they’re just so “saintly” and “pure” in their lives. But again, thank you so much and if you’re commenting from experience, I’m happy for you as well. We can get through this💪🏼
The best jokes are lost on most people, well played imo.
Yeah this is over. If you think she’s cheating it’s over. You either give benefit of the doubt bc you are.. married and trust your wife or you leave.
Right? And if she hasn’t done so already, she will erase all evidence of anything inappropriate.
I absolutely completely understand what you're saying. I'm not deconstructing myself (I'm atheist since I was about 9) but I can definitely appreciate and see how incredibly difficult it must be. Literally life changing and potentially severely isolating. So I feel for you, but genuinely respect your courage. I'm with you, friend ❤️
my girlfriend drunkenly confessed to cheating on all of her past relationships 
i don’t drink, i simply don’t enjoy the taste of alcohol, however my girlfriend drinks every now and then, and every time she does, she gets super wasted and it becomes rather an.. interesting night. this time, we had stayed in, and she drank whilst i played video games beside her, i wasn’t too focused on her, she kept on babbling on, but then she said something that caught my attention so quick, i immediately turned off my PC and faced her and asked her more about what she had just said.

she simply admitted to cheating on all SEVEN of her boyfriends, and the cherry on top? they never knew, she was almost.. braggy about it in a way, prideful, and egotistical. i was taken aback, and shocked to my core (we’ve been dating for 3 years, she NEVER mentioned cheating on any of her ex’s, much less all SEVEN of them)

i held my emotions, and kept myself in check. told her i was gonna go to bed, and after i woke up in the morning, i found her in the kitchen making us both breakfast. she seemed completely sober and relaxed.

part of me was hesitant to bring up her confession, but i did, and once i asked her, her expression changed, her eyes widened, and she started stuttering, she then admitted to everything being true, and began crying, talking about how she wasn’t proud of what she had done and how she cheated on all of her partners.

i told her i needed space and left, it’s been 2 days since i’ve spoken to her, my mind is scattered and my heart feels.. heavy.

her cheating on her partners, and bragging about how she got away with it has me feeling violently sick, and now i’m stuck in my own paranoia

i keep asking myself, what if she cheated on me? what if im next? what if she played me too?

she keeps blowing up my phone, but i’ve been decking her.

any advice, please? i was just as recently as a month ago talking with my mother about turning her into my wife and taking that next step, and now i don’t even know if i want to be in a relationship with her.





IMPORTANT UPDATE: i just recently asked her to come over so we can talk about what happened, and i told her if she wasn’t going to be FULLY truthful about her past, and our relationship, then her and i are permanently done and over with.

and so… she exposed everything, and i mean everything.

i left out a lot of details, so im sorry about that, so let me make myself a lot more clear—

her and i are both in our early 30’s. she told me she cheated on all her boyfriends 10 years ago during her college years when she was younger, more reckless, and more selfish with her choices.

she also mentioned, when her and i got together, it had been years since her previous relationship, and that she went to therapy and did a lot of self reflection.

she also admitted to me that during the start of our relationship, she had been texting a few other guys, but DID NOT cheat on me, and once she realized she was falling deeply in love with me, cut them all off, and focused on our relationship.

i was hurting to core hearing all the words spill out of her mouth. although it’s been 10 years since her physically cheating on all of her past relationships doesn’t mean im safe with her, clearly i wasn’t when she was SO CLOSE to emotionally cheating on me in the start of her relationship, and even though she admitted to cutting them off, in that moment, i lost almost all my respect for her.

respectfully, i told her that i was done, and that i loved her, but i don’t love her enough to sit and wonder and have these thoughts chase me now every time i am with her now that i know the truth.

broke up with her right then and there, i didn’t allow myself to feel guilty for her, she simply was not the woman i thought i knew, it all feels like a facade and although it is tearing me apart, i respect myself way too much to be tied to someone who’ll have me questioning.

“is she cheating on me?”

“is she lying?”

“what if she does cheat?”

i’m 34, im way too old to be dealing with someone who’ll raise my blood pressure like that.

i rather deal with the heartbreak of our relationship ending then forgive her and have her possibly disrespect our relationship.

THANK YOU TO EVERYONE’S COMMENTS, TRULY, IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU, I CHOSE MYSELF FIRST. 🙏
It's like when the CIA says "We did fucked up stuff in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s but we investigated ourselves and we don't do that anymore!" 

Don't believe it. Maybe even ask her, what made you cheat on the last SEVEN guys but not me?
I found out my husband cheated on me before we got married and…yep. Apparently cheated on every ex too. My advice is move on before you’re too far in.
all seven? nuts 

you should probably let her know that’s a deal breaker but it’s your life brother
Mate.....not saying she's definitely cheated on you......but cmon. What a whopper of an admission. 

Chances are if she hasn't , she would.


Wow.
This is what I call a retroactive deal-breaker.  OP…my advice is to ask yourself honestly: If you found out (that she was a serial cheater) on your first date, would you have gone on a second date?  If your answer is “no” then you know what you must do retroactively.

My best advice is to cut your losses and move on.  So sorry.  Be safe and feel better.
Ask her how many times she cheated on you. Are you number 7? Or are you 8?
My ex wife told me this sober. Bet you can guess what happened based on my first sentence.
This is about forever. Probably best to not choose the girl who doesn’t know how to be loyal.
Yeah no, don’t believe those crocodile tears. Your relationship has been cooked and sautéed with a side of biscuits from day one. Leave.
She's for the streets bro. Don't be the next one in the long line for that 304
Given she's a serial cheater, she's likely already cheated on you. Since she cheated on all of her partners and you were one of them.

Dump her, block her and get full STD/STI testing done.

And make sure everyone in your friend group knows WHY you broke up.
I’m sorry, really sorry this is happening to you. But this is who she is.

Cheating on one person is horrible, utterly horrible, but it’s possible someone could learn from that and grow.

But to cheat on *every partner they’ve ever been with*? Sorry, but this is just who she is. It demonstrates that she’s incapable of being loyal to her partner. 

Do you really want to be with someone who’s incapable of being loyal to you? Personally that’s a deal breaker for me.

I think your two options are either break up, or discuss an open relationship.
Break up NOW
Run
Man, there are two major issues — serial cheating obviously and getting wasted every time she drinks, even if it’s just once in awhile. Wonder if some of the cheating happened during these drunken bouts. Yah, serious therapy at the very least, assuming you want to take this awfully big risk. Don’t forget, boyfriend/girlfriend stage is the easiest part of life. When you’re married and all the stresses of life — hoo boy. Choose wisely.
Once a cheater, always a cheater. This is mostly true. But let’s say it’s in the past; the fact that she never shared it with you and that she cheated on every one of her exes is a bit odd.
Serial cheater.  End that relationship and move on. Ugh
Jeeze, the bragging tone is what does it for me. That is a baaad sign. I would think long and hard about how to handle this, but you should hear her out and try to draw some boundaries around her drinking (limiting intake, maybe a few sessions with an addiction therapist). If she gets super wasted every time thats a big problem and could be a huge contributing factor to her past behaviour. Depending on how she handles those boundaries should determine whether or not you stay in the relationship. I would put a hold on any thoughts of marriage for now at the very least.
Yeah. I was very serious with a woman who was in the process of divorcing her husband.  Meaning she was still married but paperwork was filed. Which meant she was still married and at the time living with me and we were planning to be together long term (maybe married, maybe not). She asked me if I had ever cheated on a relationship. I told her that I had not. She was amazed. She told me she had cheated on every relationship she had ever had except for me. All I could think of was “so far”. Yep. That was the beginning of the end.  Funny thing was that when we ended things, she called off the divorce and moved back in with that poor soul.  Ugh.
Leave. She will absolutely cheat on you.
"in vino veritas" she bragged about it drunk it's how she really feels. Those tears mean nothing she just didn't want to lose her comfortability with you. My partner cheated on all of his exes and then guess what? SURPRISE! He cheated on me.
Yeah, you did the right thing. The thing she told you about the start of your relationship sounds like trickle truthing to me. She told you shocking and embarrassing details from the distant past to make you feel like she was being completely honest just so that you might believe her when she lied about the important part at the end. I'm glad you had the self-respect to move on.
Updateme
Move on. It happened to all of them, why wouldn’t it happen to you? It would be hard to trust her.

And let’s be clear, it’s a HER problem, not a YOU problem. It’s part of who she is until she is able to fix it.

Whenever someone cheats it’s always because they’re lacking something on the inside.
So she cheated on all 7 of her other partners and was proud of the fact that they never knew about it...and you think she hasn't already cheated on you? Have some self respect.
Do you think you have the magical mojo that will tame her cheating ways?

😂🤣😂

No, you don't.

Once a cheater, always a cheater.

UNLESS

They DO THE WORK to figure out why they did what they did .

You should dump her.

If you don't,  then you need to stipulate intense therapy for her and couples therapy for you both.

Good luck and I'm sorry.
This kind of cheater HIGHLY LIKELY won't stop. You might want to keep the space permanent
Drunk words, sober thoughts?
Maybe she changed and she won’t cheat on you, but if you trust her and stay with her would you really be able to work through the paranoia that she might cheat on you? Its not worth staying in a relationship if you’re just going to be stressed out and paranoid for the rest of your life

I’m sorry you’re in this position. Take some time to work through your emotions by writing it out, talking to a friend, etc.
Need to go your own way she has a problem and apparently she isn't ready to quit or own up to her problem with alcohol.
She bragged about it when she was on the Russian truth serum. Idk man, doesn’t necessarily mean she cheated on you, but do you want to spend the rest of your life stressing out every time she drinks or works late?
What a terrible situation. Maybe she has changed her ways, but damn, it doesn’t inspire confidence in the relationship. That would be a deal breaker for me.
It's time to move on. She will cheat on you if she hasn't already. She might be crying the next day, but she was boasting about it whilst drunk. This doesn't always apply, but they say a person's true feelings come out when they're drunk.
I’m sorry that happened to you. I have to agree with some of the others, red flag! It doesn’t mean that she’s cheated on you or that she necessarily will but u less she has done some work on herself to identify why she felt the need to- it is unprocessed and much more likely to reoccur. Good luck!
Leave her. Don't give her the opportunity to manipulate your mind and emotions. Once is a mistake, but 7 times and none of them found out. She's a pro. If she hasn't already cheated on you, she's going to. This is her M.O. This is her behavior. This is her character. This is who she is. That alcohol loosened all that up. Be grateful that you found this out before you put a ring on it. Bragging about it. She's for the streets. If you stay with her and she plays you then it's on you because she's literally told you who she is.
Her admission is a big red flag. Get yourself tested for STD,s because I highly doubt that you are the exception to her cheating. Then speak to your close friends and family before you decide what to do. If you stay with this girl, it should be on a number of pre-conditions: She needs IC to find out why she cheated and prevent cheating. Complete transparency and access to electronic devices. If you get married or live with a solid prenup or domestic relations agreement. Update us.
Fly you fools
Time to tell her cheating once on one bf is a mistake. Cheating on all is a lifestyle. A lifestyle I want my life to be no part of. Sorry but due to your background, I cannot risk wasting my time with you, and therefore I'm out. Loved you and good luck.
Friend of mine is currently going through a divorce after 8 years and this was one the the red flags they ignored, when they did find out they were stunned by how sophisticated they were at hiding it and it likely been happening for years. 

Also, getting shit faced on her own at while playing vids, not a great indicator either.
I have seen this as well. 
Some women I befriended in a dance class.  

They seemed braggy and prideful about cheating in the past. 

I've never seen this from a man, can a woman help me understand this?
I don’t believe in the axiom “once a cheater, always a cheater, too many counter examples.” But “cheating on everyone and bragging about it.” Does not instill much confidence
Yeah get out of this i had a similar experience with my ex she told me she cheated on this guy, that guy but tried to justify it and then she cheated on me and tried to justify it by saying at least she was honest and open which is fair enough but i honestly and openly told her to get out of my house and blocked her on all apps and havent heard from her since.
You know that saying; once a cheater, always a cheater? Well it’s a saying for a reason and you did well to move on now. 

I believe that she hadn’t cheated on you to this point. I even believe that she believes she’s changed and won’t cheat again. However, I also believe that the day will come where things aren’t perfect at home and an opportunity to cheat presents itself and she’d take it.
I wouldn’t trust her if I were you. If she cheat 7 times then I think she’d have no problem whatsoever doing it again as long as she saw a positive in it.
Once a cheater always a cheater.
i know you have been together for a while. you need to get out while you still can. i'm sorry this has happened to you. it's really awful how so many people are slimy cheaters 
In vino veritas...
Her mistakes were 10years ago when she was 20. She states she did therapy, understands herself more and spent a few years alone to understand herself/needs/wants. The issue however, for me, is her braggy approach, rather than crying and showing remorse. I believe given the right circumstances most people will cheat (the stats are quite high.....ive done loads of research) and its a difficult position to be in, as relationships are always a risk even with someone who has never cheated before. When it starts to impact your stress levels, thats the issue.
Bro, you left her after that long because of things she did 10yrs ago? And because she was talking to other guys before becoming committed to you? That is just crazy especially if she's never cheated on you. Maybe you need therapy for yourself because if someone's past makes you leave them, then you will never have a healthy relationship. Everyone has a past whether you liked what they did or not and this is a you problem, not your ex's problem
My daughter’s dad has cheated on every single gf he has ever had. Promised he wouldn’t on me and never on the mother of his child (his dad cheated on his mum) but alas.. he cheated for 9 months! 7 of those while I was pregnant. 
Has since cheated on his current gf and I don’t see that he will EVER change. 

I think it’s extremely rare that cheaters change. Serial cheaters that get away with it are even less likely to change. 

Personally I wouldn’t be able to trust her again after her confession.
Takes balls to hold firm to a boundary like that. 🫡 sir
I’ve noticed a lot of people arguing that the ex is a changed person and very different from how she was in college. However, if a person drunkenly confesses to cheating on all their previous partners and brags about never having been caught then I would argue that they haven’t actually changed as a person and are possibly even proud of their actions. I don’t believe that someone who truly changed and is genuinely remorseful would talk about their unfaithful escapades this way. But, hey, that’s just my opinion.
ABORT ABORT ABORT RELATIONSHIP
Statistically, someone who has cheated (even once) in a past relationship is 3 times more likely to cheat on you than a non-cheater would be. Considering that she's done this to 7 different people... it's not even a matter of "if" she will cheat on you--it's a matter of "when".
So something happens once, mistakes happen right? We all fuck up somehow somewhere and we learn from that mistake and make the appropriate changes to reassure it doesn't happen again. 

In this situation, I'm sorry to say but her cheating has gone past the threshold of mistakes and she has become a habitual cheater with as it seems, little to no remorse. That being said, she has a 100% successful cheat ratio in relationships. 

Question is what makes you special? What makes you the one she will not cheat on? If your a gambler, your chances are as good as getting a royal flush on a game of Texas Hold Em. Not very likely gonna happen right. But there is always a chance. At this point its risk/reward, pro/con. Is this one girl worth the risk of you getting hurt? When your cheated on that doesn't go away with the relationship. That sticks with you in your next relationship. You get trust issues. You question things that maybe don't need to be questioned in the next relationship. You create some stress fractures in the foundation of the next relationship and it isn't directly your fault. 

Think about your future
Oh man, she’s a cheater. You can’t marry her. Go, quickly, save yourself.
I really hope you broke up with her. Once a cheater always a cheater, it’s a sad reality. Know this has nothing to do with you, and all to do with her. Cheaters are usually some of the most insecure people out there, so it must be something that she feels she lacks in. I hope she heals quickly because no one deserves to be cheated on. You definitely don’t and you deserve better than this. You’ll feel better moving on than staying
She’s a cheater!!!! She won’t change she will eventually get bored of you and try another flavor elsewhere! Especially if she cheated in all of her relationships! And for her to brag about it she definitely did not feel bad about it. If u stay with her just be mindful maybe check her phone out the blue moon here n there lol
The alcohol showed you who she really is.
Proud of her actions with no remorse. 
She has no problem living a lie with someone she claims to love.
She showed you her pattern and how she feels about it.
God did you a favour by showing you before you were in too deep. She literally showed you her closet of red flags. If you keep her, then don't cry about it later.

Know whn to hold 'em, 
know when to fold 'em, 
Know when to walk away,
Know when to run.
Smart person, you are. You are so correct that it would dwell on your thoughts and that you don't need that kind of drama. You will find someone else.
Good job, she probably cheated on you too
She’s a whore bro. You HAVE to leave her
Ok - everyone has a past.  Some are less proud of theirs than others.   But for you to be upset she did this in the past- get over yourself.  If people shined a light on all of your past actions would you pass the test?

Now, all of that being said, if she cheated on you - then it’s a present activity and I could totally get your judgement/disappointment/anger.

But she didn’t say she did cheat on you.   So, either drop it or break up with her.  But don’t be so judgmental
Considering her explanation, age and timeframe (college) and therapy . You judged her now for who she was. Two different people but if your happy blowing up all the time you had together. Good luck to you. I hope your past is as clean
Yeah either get an open relationship or get surprised one day.
It's a pattern hence it's a serious concern - that and her apparent lack of boundaries while drunk (she should only drink with you around).  People can change but you need some indication that she is going to do this - next step is up to you.
I think I've come to realize the only time a cheater really changes is if they loose the love of their life. 

Really this is with any addiction though. You have to truly hit rock bottom whatever that bottom is for you. 

Sometimes people will hit as low as they can go and still not change. 

It's so interesting though we as a society are willing to forgive most addictions if people are seeking help, but cheating is the one addiction people write the person off as a horrible person forever.
anyone defending her is probably riddled with some form of guilt themselves.
I'd see it more as a reflection on me - you are the company you keep etcetera. 

It wouldn't sit well with me regardless though. Deep, honest conversations need to be had between you both, my dude. Then make a choice and stick by it.
I used to be a serial cheater before having met my current boyfriend. Only 1 of them know, the rest do not. This is something I chose to share with my boyfriend off-bat because I wanted to let him know that I’d just undergone a huge personal change and a part of it was no longer cheating in my relationships. 

He trusted me enough to see our relationship through and it has blossomed into something truly important and special to me. 

I see why she didn’t preface your relationship with that confession; however, the way it *did* end up coming out is just plain unfortunate. 

I wouldn’t rethink everything, at least not without hearing her out. People change. I was young, dumb, immature and incredibly selfish while doing what I did. I’m sure she was the same. Best of luck to you both.
I think you were an asshole. You're in you're 30s and are hung up that she's had SEVEN bfs? That's hilarious. She cheated on them in COLLEGE, TEN years ago. People don't grow up? I do believe that cheaters will cheat but this one seems harsh. 3 years is a long time to be with someone and dump them for mistakes they made 10 years ago. I think you get a pass for cheating in college when you're young, drunk, wild and stupid. 10 years and therapy later, you're allowed to be a more mature person. I feel sorry for her for wasting 3 years of her life with you that you could end it so quickly after 1 drunk confession.
Something  similar happened to me with my ex, and he never got over it.
so about a year and a half ago, i was 26 at the moment, we were playing we are not really strangers and he asked me if I have ever cheated on any ex, and I was drunk so it was easy to admit I did cheat on my last ex for a while but I was not proud of it, I was 21, I was having trouble with my self worth and when we broke up, I stopped having relationships until I felt ready for a real commitment. 
then I met my now ex, and I felt ready for an actual relationship, I was alone for 4 years and a half, and felt like I really did change, I would never do that again to anybody, but he never got over it, he would bring it up randomly, it changed the way he saw me as a person and it was awful. I never understood why he would ask something if maybe the answer was not going to please him. Also, this happened the first week we met, but he continued to date me for a other 5 months until he broke up with me out of the blue, and jumped into another relationship like 3 weeks after he dumped me. 

but what I want to say is that sometimes people change, but if you can't handle the truth and are feeling insecure, then leave. 

if you do want to continue with her, it might take a while, counseling and LOTS of talking 

good luck with everything
It seems like she has a harsh lesson to learn about pushing away the good one. Don’t stand in the way of that lesson. Follow your gut and break it off. You’ll be a lot better for it. Maybe she will be too.
I’m going through a divorce right now and I wish I got out earlier when I saw red flags
Nah man, that's deff an once a cheater always a cheater situation
Ur cooked 😭
She was stupid to tell you this. When things are going alright some people have to bring trouble along for drama. Well, she has got her drama and now you know you can't trust her. It is up to you whether you stay or go.
8th time’s the charm, brother!
I understand this being shocking. But I don’t agree with all of these comments. You are a different version of your self with different people some people can bring out the absolute softest sweetest and some the worst. I would just tell her why it obviously concerns you. You never know what happened behind closed doors with those relationships on the other partners end. & people change.
She’s for the streets, send her there
As a coach once told me, past performance is an indicator of future action.

You don't owe her anything. Not a sit down and discuss or let's go to couples counseling.

But, if it were me, I would ask a couple questions. Have you cheated on me, and if you haven't, what steps have you taken to change. If she cannot elaborate on what actions she took to change then I would definitely end it. And I mean concrete actions like therapy, read books, made life changes etc.

She probably won't admit it if she cheated on you, so watch her body language, tone of voice, and her eyes. Maybe record it so you can re-watch to catch something you might have missed.
Yikes dude. She’s a serial cheater that is expert level at hiding it. I would bet a paycheck she’s already cheated on you after 3 years. Sorry you shouldn’t be able to get past this it’s a major character flaw. She will cheat….
Run run run, zero guilt, no looks back. This completely sucks. I'd be nauseated if I were in your position too. But don't give her the chance to cause you more disappointment and regret. Ruuun....!
RUN!
Wait - out of the topic but your english is so good that it's like I'm reading a novel wow.

Hey, cheaters will always be cheaters. I swear to you, this is true. No matter how much she says "that's all in the past". Nope. They have been mentally exposed to cheating and have a confident inner self which they wouldn't admit when sober of course.

You said you were planning to make her wife. Hey. This is God doing the work for you. To make you leave before it's too late! Before a child will have a separated family. This is a sign from above. If you don't take this sign, you'll regret it later. Make a choice now or suffer later.
She belongs to the streets imo. She wasn’t yours, it was just your turn. There’s a reason why they say once a cheater always a cheater. The way she blew your phone up gives me clues she maybe a narcissist. Check out the narcissist abuse subreddit and it’ll open your eyes. 
Don't worry, you're the exception
What if you’re not next but already on the list? 
Why wouldn’t she cheat on you?
If she did it to them she will do it to you
She's just a girlfriend not a wife move on friendo
time for a new gf pal. you're next, if it hasn't happened already. bank on it.

also, MAJOR red flags with the alcohol. sounds like she turns into a cocky asshole and cannot control herself. on top of the cheating this is a recipe for disaster for you.

you don't wanna be with a girl like this. trust me.
I would break up with her immediately. Also, anyone who’s had that many relationships already raises a red flag (especially if they are younger than 40).

Edit: Good on you OP for breaking up with her, you deserve better.
If this gives you pause to continue the relationship, then that's ok. You have every right to discontinue for this reason, or none at all. 

For what it's worth, I'd bail. My ex was the same. She confessed at some point to cheating on all her previous boyfriends, but wanted to acknowledge it with me because she was not that person anymore. Cheated on me a month after that talk, but I didn't find out until a year later. Not saying once a cheater always one, but EVERY partner is nuts.
Honestly This should be a no brainer bro. She cheated on everyone she was with and got away with all of them. She’s too good of a cheater you’ll be next if you don’t move on.
She definitely did it for the ego boost. I'll say break up and don't marry her or else she might nor have cheated on you yet but will pull a Russian roulette with one of the future babies
The decision to leave her or to stay is yours alone, but know this. You'll be doubting her for many years to come, always wondering, worrying, looking for the proverbial red flags. She should know that if you stay together, it will be under the pretense that trust is lost and will take years and much effort to rebuild.   You'll expect complete transparency and she'll be basically under constant scrutiny. Tough call and you'll have to decide if it's worth all that.
[deleted]
I think once the NRE wears off, You'll be next if not already.
If you’re doing something wrong, back out now and don’t fall for sunk cost fallacy. It’s much less painful than having her cheat on you later (which is probably likely to happen given she’s a “for the streets” girl iykwim) after getting married or something
Yeah, it’s not worth it. She’s a serial dater. She will cheat on you. It’s not even a question.
She’s cheating on you as we speak
sad to say bro your next!
So…you’re going to be the next person she cheats on. Move on and don’t look back. When someone is that direct with you about how they cheated on all their past relationships, that’s them admitting to you that they will do it again.
She's cheated on you before. And she's cheating on you currently. Cheaters never change. They litetally convince themselves that their actions are justified and that's why she was bragging about it, because she is proud. The crying deal at breakfast was fake
If she said ALL that includes you too. RUN!
I personally wouldn’t date anyone who’s cheated in the past. Definitely move on.
Honestly if you need "closure" I'd point blank ask... " so what makes ME so special that you wouldn't cheat on me and keep me in tbe dark about it? You obviously had no problem with ALL seven of your exes"

Frankly I'd dump her and let her marinate in being the one that got dumped and also one that won't put up with BS
That’s wild.  It’s one thing to mention at the start to be honest and start a conversation about growth or whatever and giving you a chance to decide if you wanna stay early on but 3 years in and while drunk and bragging is probably a sign she’ll repeat. I feel like getting away with it is what makes it more likely to reoccur.
Sorry bro, you should leave her
Hey I don’t have advice for you but just sending good vibes. Sorry you are going through this.
Yikes. I'd be outta there
Find some guys and place hidden cameras trying to catch her cheating. The post the results to reddit for us.
She will cheat on you, sorry to say. People don't change. One time maybe there's some extenuating circumstances, 7 times? She's mental lmao
Bro shes cheating on you too im sorry this same thing happened to me and i waited to find out the hard way
“I ran, I ran so far away / I just ran, I ran all night and day”
She will 110% cheat on you also man. It’s not worth it.
Bail bail baaaaaaaiiiillllll!
The main question is: will ever be able to look at her the same way again? 
Updateme
If it was me in your shoes.... you don't owe her anything. Move on

Marriage would never work
Run for the hills she will 100% cheat on you as well . Tbh, she probably has in the last 3 years at least once.
Idk, you should have an opne relationship and tell her to be completly honest. Chances are that she has cheated on you already, but there are also chances that she wants to change for the better and on how you described it, she is probably feeling very alone in the meantime. If you take a desicion, make sure it is the right one by clearing things pf with her. Don’t let her lie to you.
What makes you think you're going to be a special outlier here?
Once a cheater always a cheater. It’s just a matter of time when a person becomes comfortable with you and he/she will return to familiar behavioural pattern.
My ex did something like this with me.  Guess what.  She cheated repeatedly with no remorse.   Drunk her is who she really is.  Sobbing her is just an act to illicit sympathy from you.   Do what I should have done.  RUN!!!
If she cheated in the past... she has 100% already cheated.... I'd bet on it.
Of course she cheated and will continue to cheat.
It’s a thrill to her to make herself feel desired by many men and to be able to fool you and her prior boyfriends. Don’t be a fool unless you are so desperate you are willing to be a knowing cuckhold.
She has a pattern, a very consistent pattern. To expect any less for you is naive. You have been warned, she warned you.
Run for the hills, and definitely don’t marry this chick 
My recommendation is to get into counseling. She told you information about her past experiences when she was under the influence of alcohol and as a result the trust in her character is compromised. People can change and if you truly want to build a life with her then you owe it to yourself to work on the relationship. She showed remorse and admitted to the truth. That is a big step. You should talk to her and find out how to move forward.
Before making a decision on how to proceed, make sure to think about whether her past actions and current behavior match the trust and commitment you want in a relationship, and take the necessary time to process your emotions.
i think you know the answer my guy, one time could be a mistake, but seven is a pattern, and it’s all up to you if you wanna run the risk of being the eighth
Nah, don’t worry, you’re special
100% agree with all comments. Most cheaters, repeat. It will happen again it’s just a matter of when.
Take the time you need to reflect on your feelings and trust your instincts about the relationship; clear communication and honesty are essential moving forward.
She was ashamed she got caught. Too risky man, especially when she drinks. Now cannot even trust her to go hangout with her friends. It will forever be on your mind and you will go insane.
This all boils down to whether you trust her enough to remain with her and also how badly this affects you in the long run knowing what you know. 
No woman is worth your mental health over and if it's rotting away inside that will only grow as you move on. 
Hit it headlong and get it out in the open with her.
Almost guaranteed she either has or will cheat on you. Better move on, and warn the next guy if you ever ran into him.
Op your girlfriend cheated on all her past boyfriends so ask yourself what makes you so special/different that she won’t or hasn’t done the same to you? The answer is your not and in time she probably will cheat.
Niiiiiiiiiiiice she love strange d

Your *ex cheated on all her previous boyfriends
You never asked her if she ever cheated on anyone? You gotta ask that early on in any relationship so you know what kind of person they are. Id be very weary. Once a cheater, always a cheater they say
She sounds like someone who shouldn't be drinking at all, nor in relationships.  I think you know in your heart what you need to do. Talk with your mom about it. I believe she's trying to break up with you, but doesn't know how to say it. 


Cheating in 7 separate relationships probably takes at least 7 months of doing it on purpose. Communication skills is a zero point 0. She could've broken up or tried to open the relationships. She didn't. And it's not likely she cheated one time with each partner. 


Bragging shows no remorse for pain she's caused or processing and development. 


Telling you is such bad judgment that it seems deliberate. And waiting to do it drunk was also deliberate. More bad communication. 


Trust is minimal. That's like 10+ red flags.
I'd bet she's cheated on you also, consider yourself lucky you've found out before it got more serious.
I'm glad she fucked up and told the truth for once. Never go back to her unless you're trying to be cheating victim #8
Are you reevaluating past situations as red flags or is this chick a Russian honey pot?
How blessed are you to find this out before marriage
Start the car!
How did you not ask her if she cheated on you?  Next time she is drunk ask in a playful way “so, how many times have you cheated on me?”.  Or “so, have you cheated on me more than once?”.  Make it sound lighthearted like you already know she has been cheating.  

It is a trick. The drunk mind will think to only answer never or none if it is truly none. Otherwise they will answer one given the fact you seem to already know it is at least one. 
Well, if you want me to be positive, maybe you're the one worth not cheating on :)
You are next if you wernt already.
It’s almost impossible to believe that she hasn’t cheated on you in the last three years. Since she has cheated on ALL SEVEN of her past partners, if she hasn’t cheated on you yet, it’s only a matter of time. Serial cheaters don’t just….. stop cheating. 

She has some serious work to do to be a safe partner for anyone and the way she revealed her past to you certainly feels like she isn’t in the right place to do that hard work of converting herself from a serial cheater to a safe partner.
7 is a lot! I personally would break up there and then. I’m a 23F and I’m just putting myself in your shoes, I might consider it if they were upfront and honest about it before we got in a relationship and showed remorse and somehow showed she had changed but saying nothing?! That’s absolutely crazy. The drunken pride is something I could not get past, sounds like she thought it was a game for stealth or something.
She’s a serial cheater. If she hasn’t cheated on you yet, she may eventually. If you don’t want to worry about that the rest of your life, then this relationship isn’t for you. If you think you two are meant to be and she’s over that phase and it won’t bother you after you have your space these next few weeks. Then that’s your decision also
I was a past cheater but not to this extent. I have so much remorse for it and regret it, but I know some people will never admit it sober.
It's a stretch, but is it possible that they all cheated on her first? Not that it would make it okay, but it's more of a grey area.
If you cheat once when you’re young, maybe that’s a bad choice born of insecurity or trauma. If you continually, serially cheat, that’s a sign of your disregard for your partners and the commitment you’ve made with them, as well as a sign of poor judgement and negligible impulse control. It’s a red flag. I cheated one time, at 17, on someone I wasn’t really even officially dating, and I felt so terrible I never did it again. It was a huge lesson to me that actions can’t be taken back.
That's hilarious that you wonder if she has cheated on you, haha.
If she did it once, she can do it again. Get away asap
She cheated on you too. Move along.
Once is already bad enough but if it’s a literal habit by now it’s time to let it go man, I’m sorry for your loss…
Just because she hadn't been in a committed relationship for while does it mean that she wasn't sleeping with a random dudes while she was drunk. She's going to cheat on you and it would be best if you just moved on
Good decision. Most people don’t change. If she did it before she’ll do it again
Up to this point you have been able to trust her… she did say something alarming and considered a reg flag but people do change. Perhaps she never took those relationships serious and with you she decided to make change and grow
I had the same situation bro, it’s gut wrenching.  I remember the awkward silence there was after she said it 😂😂 she immediately starting crying after i didn’t react the way she thought I would.  Alcohol brings out the truth always. Good for you for having the willpower to end it , I sure didn’t and could of saved myself the heart break
Once is a mistake. Doing it to 7 different people is a lifestyle.

And then she decided to wait to tell you. It would be one thing if she admitted it early on in tandem with her talking about therapy. The fact that it came out once she was drunk too tells me she planned on keeping it a secret forever. The bragging is also just gross. 

Texting other men and hiding it, or lying by omission, is in fact, cheating in my book. That is emotional cheating, not *almost* cheating. But maybe I’m just strict. The reason I say that is mostly because you don’t know what was being discussed in those messages. If it was innocent why cover it up? Idk. 

And more than likely more than that was happening. 

You made the right choice.
I cheated when I was younger. Not proud of it either. I have been with my husband for 12 years. Not even thought about cheating on him. I wouldn't. Like OPs ex I am a different person (we all change during our teens and 20s). 

Is no one talking about this girl's clear depression and drinking problem. Sitting at home drinking just you, whilst sitting next to your partner who isn't even acknowledging you. Dismissing all she's saying like he did is indicative there are some problems. This sounds like a seriously depressing situation. I think she would be better off with a guy who wants to connect with her. This sounded unhealthy to start with so it's good they split.
Unfortunately, if she changed. But it's the right decission. You should be with someone with your own morals.
nahhh that's foul if my girl told me all the details of a secret hoe phase in college she gon have to get tf up out of there 😭🤣 she did that to herself
Other times there's 7 evil exes, but this time, she's the evil ex of those 7.
I do think people can change. Especially from their early 20 year old selves… but the way you say she was bragging about it is very off putting and doesn’t bode well to her working on such a toxic trait
Leave .
My friend it sounds like you’re #8
As someone who was cheated on, you made the right call.
Don't walk... RUN
Good call. Saved yourself a lot of heartache
I mean.. as a guy.. getting cheated on is about one of the worst things that can happen to you.

I have been led to believe, that as a woman.. being physically or sexually assaulted is one of the worst things that can happen to you (yes this would also be bad for guys..).  Generally women want a man who makes them feel safe.

So imagine this situation with reversed gender rules.

Some guy assaulted his last 7 exes.. he used to have anger issues but has being seeing a therapist and working through them.. he hasn't hit anyone in 4 years.. he swears he's changed and this time it will be different.  

All of her friends would say don't touch that guy with a 10 foot pole!
RUN and dont look back
I don’t know how you deal with this. While people can change, it normally takes something drastic to make it happen.

You have 2 options. 

Option 1: Leave her now with zero proof she has cheated or wronged you not knowing if she would have ever cheated on you. You will be left with the question of what could have been . 

Option 2: stay with her and give her the benefit of the doubt because as far as you know she hasn’t cheated on you yet, but you’ll always have that little voice in the back of your head wondering if she is cheating on you now or who she’s talking too etc etc

Both options suck to be honest. If you stay and she does cheat, you can’t be too surprised. 

If you leave her preemptively for a” what if “ scenario i can almost guarantee you will be haunted by what could have been .  

Neither sounds pleasant if I’m honest. I know the second one doesn’t sound that bad at the moment, but later on in life . Oof lol. Especially if it’s been pretty solid up until this point. 

All that aside, the smartest option is probably to leave. ( but I don’t know if it’s the best option) 

As stated in the beginning, most people don’t change unless something has really shaken them to their core. We all have for lack of an ability to think better analogy a “Ruler/scale  “ which we use to judge the world around us . Some peoples rulers/scales are just not zeroed properly. They’re “off” so no matter what they judge it will always be wrong because the thing they’re using to judge things is wrong in the first place. Unless an event happens that re zeros or resets the thing they measure the world with they’re just kinda screwed .

This is partially why we all know people who mess up all the time even though they may try incredibly hard to be better.
And this is why people's past matters. I hate the "It's in the past, you shouldn't care" attitude. Past behaviors show who a person was, is, and what they are likely to repeat.
If you stay and she cheats. You’ll get no sympathy
Don't think, just leave.   Don't be number 8.
You got cheated on. Is what it is.
Well done, bro.  You made the right decision.  Not only is it likely she would have cheated on you, quite frankly, even if she never would have, she doesn't deserve a committed relationship after the betrayals she made in the past.
I have great respect for how you've handled this buddy. You deserve way better than this woman and you knew it and took action. 

Fuck her...(Not actually.. As That wouldn't end well lol) Get rid and move on! 

Good luck
I actually think that hanging out with someone you doesn’t drink and then getting so smashed alone that you confess to past secrets is enough of a red flag. 

Getting that shitfaced drunk in your 30s with friends every once in a while could probably be understandable. 

But drinking alone with someone who doesn’t drink and getting that smashed would scare the hell out of me. 

The cheating stuff is bad too, but others can comment on that. I just didn’t want the drinking to get overlooked.
That doubt will always be there. I’d leave, as painful as it might be
I'm glad you made the right decision and didn't listen to the "the past is the past people"
Are you interestet on an Open relationship? Maybe it will work with her :D
you're one strong individual. I commend you.
>she also mentioned, when her and i got together, it had been years since her previous relationship, and that she went to therapy and did a lot of self reflection

If a person has cheated in the past, and they have not put in the work to be a different person, they will cheat on you as well.

From what it sounds like she took personal responsibility and worked through her infidelity issues.

Here's what I think happened in a drunk state (armchair psychology to the max, take it with a grain of salt): I think that her past, her "secret" was placing guilt on her. She felt like she was being dishonest for the longest time. So that guilt for keeping that secret from you eventually got her to tell you in a drunken state.

If my armchair psychologist moment was correct then she's not one to be cheating on you right now. Then she's really turned a better woman.
Leave now. NOW!
good for you
It's a faith leap man, sorry for you. 
Are we sure she is gonna cheat in the future?
No, but the odds say yes.

Even if not in 2 years, but in 10 or so, when we are all tired of being with the same person over and over, she will probably seek out to something else.

And the worst part is, basically if you take the leap now and it fails in 10 years, it will be much much worse, with children a shared house and so on. 

If this truth did not bother you too much, you wouldn't be here, so my personal advice is: leave now, suck in now the broken hearth and start from scratch. 
If it happens in 5, 10 years, it will be worse.
It's a character flaw. I believe a person either is a cheater or not. She obviously is and a prolific one at that. A non-cheater would 't even comprehend doing something like this. Well done for moving on immediately. 
Same experience, was cheating on me too.
Your feeling of “I don’t know this woman anymore” is totally valid. The cruelty and disrespect one needs to embody to cheat without remorse is not something I could ignore or write-off as a minor, inconsequential personality trait. 

You made the right call, OP.
You’ve handled this amazing. Sat down, got the facts and made a swift decision. Well done, definitely for the best going forward
Sounds like you've figured out what to do, so I won't add my cent to it. Gl OP, you're sensible.
She's a hooah
It was only a matter of time before it happened again, once a cheater always a cheater. You did the right thing and got out of there to save yourself that paranoia of wondering everyday.
He’s beginning to believe.  OP I know this seems like a bad situation but guess what, you’re using your own judgment like a boss.  I know it’s scary but that inner monologue will take you so far.  Yes, you had no one to confirm what you should do, yes you were alone in this situation, you got hurt. 

but you believed in yourself, rarely is that ever realised and most people do not do this, they don’t have the balls.  You just respected yourself, loved yourself and looked out for yourself, it’s horrifying but it has to be done.  

Well done.  You overcome your own fear here, most people would be to afraid and it’s not rewarding either, but you saved yourself so much future pain and heartache.
When you said you were thinking of marrying her not too long from now... I was relieved. Thank goodness you never got married. Still. What a horrible betrayal on her part. She would never have told you. After 3 years in a relationship... jfc
"I respect myself way too much.." love that line! What a king.
Well done bro good to hear a story where someone actually respects themselves in it
hugeeee red flag, girls who are truly loyal can never stand for cheating ever
This is a tough pill to swallow. Its like any person worse nightmare
That’s crazy. For me this is one of the few things a person did in their past that would be a dealbreaker for me and I’m saying this as someone who’s in an open relationship. She lied to 7 guys before you and is probably lying to you too.
Break up with her
Could be a chance she’s cheated on you could be a chance she hasn’t, personally I wouldn’t stay
You did the right thing, OP, and I know that was far from easy because you love her, after all. I'm proud of you, and I hope you find someone who is worth your time and your energy, who is honest with you from the very beginning and values loyalty above all else.
You 100% made the right decision, the fact she was still texting guys (assuming it never went further which I hightly doubt) is a red line for me and I would have done the same.

FWIW, I'm the same age as you and left my wife last year after she cheated on me. I'll never, ever entertain a cheater. There are no second chances if you cheat or admit to cheating in the past when you wernt 100% open at the beginning.
Run. It's a trap.
Once a cheater, always a cheater. In a world of almost 8 billion people, put yourself first brother. My wife of 7 years and best friend of 20+ recently fell out of love with me and started a relationship on the side. She swears it was nothing physical, but how can I ever really know. I've begged her to reconsider the divorce for our sons sake, but even if she did, I can never trust her again and that's not a relationship that's healthy for anyone.
She’s not the one, but you will find them.
my **ex-**girlfriend drunkenly confessed to cheating on all of her past relationships

There fixed that for you.
Respect, so many people would make the wrong choice here, well done.  It must be extremely difficult but it will get better and you will thank yourself
people are parasites bro, and she is one of them. Thank you for having the sense to immediately leave this woman dude. A lot of people don’t have that shit.
The writing is on the wall.
Yeah, I get it. We tend to think once a cheater is always a cheater, and it's true in so many cases .  I used to cheat a lot. When I was married, I cheated one time. She found out, and even though it never happened again, she hated me and ended it. Can't blame her at all. I've honestly never cheated again. Though ironically, every woman I have been with since has cheated on me. I suppose my point is that not everybody is fully who they are in their 20's. The confession while drunk is rough, though.
Can't trust someone who is a serial cheater. One time? Maybe. People can actually change but she cheated on all 7 of her past boyfriends? That's above and beyond any small chance that she would never do it to you. You made the right choice.
If she hasn't cheated on you already she probably will eventually. Leave her to the streets, can't turn a ho into a house wife.
Shes going to cheat on you also bragging about that is something a fucking loser would do. She probably needs therapy.
Move on. Once a cheater always one and that’s disgusting bragging about it! It’s nothing to be pride of. Save yourself beautiful man. Don’t waste your life
That’s not a Red Flag, It’s an Air raid Siren! You’ll be lucky number 8 if you stay in this relationship. At least you won’t be surprised when it happens. Maybe cheat on her so she knows how it feels. So many options! Have fun.
Good on you dude, you did the right thing.
I can SAVE her!!!!!!
I don't know, you know her pretty good after 3 years.  People can change bro, past mistakes shouldn't always disqualify a person from being loved and cared for
The mere fact that she has had 7 boyfriends is already a red flag. A loyal person would typically have few long term relationships rather than many short ones. Although she *has* changed for the better since then, it still isn't enough. Most people cannot completely change 100%, and there will still be some traces of her past self remaining. The fact that she came very close to cheating on you at the beginning of your relationship and the fact that she kept that important secret from you for three years are some of the evidences that she has not totally changed. She isn't ready to be in a committed relationship yet and needs more time to grow up. You don't need to wait for her.
That's how you get respect.
Good for you not hanging around for that crap. She’s for the streets now.
Gahdam. Trust me OP she definitely was eyeing at someone or was going to at one point.
If she didn’t tell you (drunk or not) then she’s lying to you by omission. Ya gotta love someone for all the bs especially in your 30s. So much life has been lived and knowledge gained through the stupid choices of our youth. I too cheated in the same way she did. It’s almost a point of pride now to say to my friends, this is the only one I’ve never lied or cheated to/on and I want to continue wearing that as a badge of honor showing that I’m capable of loving someone and letting the past be the past because I had not yet dealt my own demons. I’m still very sorry for what you’re feeling though, any time I had a gf tell me about past hook ups etc etc that little green shoulder gremlin makes me feel a way and I have to accept that 0 people are perfect and I wouldn’t wanna be with perfect anyway. Just perfect for you is and will always be enough.
So people can cheat and be faithful later but I believe they need to take time and reflect and have a period if personal growth.  It honestly sounds like she hasn't done that so I would not blame you at sending moving on.  She's already bragged about her ability to lie to her partners and hide the affair so she seems to really like the rush and being smarter than everyone else
I cheated on every boyfriend I had until 2 boyfriends ago. It was 100% me,  I never felt enough and never invested. I went to therapy and decided I would invest so I got a boyfriend I liked, eventually loved. We didn't work out but i haven't cheated since. Im now in an 11 year relationship and happy as can be, I would never think of cheating on him.
I hate these comments saying that she will cheat on you. It was during her college years and she has moved on from it. I have cheated in my past relationships. I am in a 10 year marriage and I have not even sent, or said, one inappropriate word about or to another lady.

People do change, especially if they are not in a high stressed environment and have received therapy.
I dated a girl once who told me she cheated on every boyfriend she had before me ( give of them ).  I tried so hard to back out of that one without shit hitting the fan ( complicated situation as we worked together ) but nope, she made me number 6.  Get out buddy.  This is a pattern
That's a lot to unpack, and it's completely understandable to feel shaken by what she said. Trust is huge in relationships, and it’s okay to take time to figure out what you want moving forward.
Good job , she for the streets
People can change, but you aren’t required to stay.
Yes it's a bit of a shock, but people can change. The best thing is to communicate directly with her about it. Also, starting to cut back the excessive drinking, this is counterproductive. Have a talk with her, communication and trust are cornerstones of a relationship.
People can change, but they don't.  I try not to judge people by their past but even I couldn't trust someone who willingly admits to such a level of lying and deceit.  It's a major character flaw.  Plus, she was PROUD of it.

As Master Shake said, "I'm thirty or forty years old, and I don't need this."
I like women like that, but only when they're open and honest about who they're with, and if they include me in the fun from time to time.

It's awesome looking into your wife's eyes as she's blowing you and getting shagged by someone else at the same time.

But if you're not into that, I could see how you may be bothered by her behavior instead of seeing it as a fun opportunity.
So your girlfriend is a serial cheater and an alcoholic.

Bail.

Doesn’t matter how often you drink, if you can’t stop at one or two drinks, you have a problem.
I strongly believe some people aren't cut out for monogamy (but try to do it for sake of having a long term partner), or have a strong kink for cheating. It sounds like that woman belongs to 1 of those groups of people.
Idk i think you should just stop over thinking. How old is she? I am not proud of it, but I literally cheated on all of my boyfriends before I met my now husband. I've been with my husband for going on 10 years and he's the only guy I've never cheated on. I'm not proud that I cheated, but I am happy he's the one I didn't want to cheat on.
All 7 wow that’s insane… if you stay with her let me be the first to congratulate you on being number 8 👍
Red fucking flag 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
I'm glad you chose yourself. She was definitely having sex with other men at the beginning of her relationship with you. Her saying she didn't cheat was her way of sayingh she had sex but didn't consider you and her monogamous and exclusive yet. 

There is no way I could trust her to not fall back on her old patterns of behavior if she hasn't already. She already admitted she's excellent at keeping her men in the dark about her affairs.
I’ve cheated on all of my boyfriends. And will cheat on my next one I’m sure. I’m just not loyal in relationships, I can’t explain why. It’s just who I am.
I was told this well after starting a relationship. When it was too late for me to get out. She had borderline personality disorder. I knew something was wrong before she said it but couldn’t put my finger on it. She cheated and has moved in with an ex friend.

Saw that raltionship advice lady on tiktok, I forget her name, but she said listen early on in raltionships. They’ll tell you who they are. I didn’t get it til well after the relationship ended but she was right. I had the data I was just in denial.
The start of the relationship stuff isn’t abnormal in today’s world. 

The rest was when she was younger, much younger. 

You should have probably given her an opportunity to build trust with you if you love her.
Literally all?  Plus talking to other men WHILE starting a relationship with you. Despite the therapy she clearly needs male attention and validation. And don't get me started on the being proud part. Toxic. "Once a cheater" rings true... as soon as she starts getting tired of you, she will stray. Leave now before you become 8
So you broke up with her even though she has been faithful to you? Sounds like you were looking for an out.

Sounds like she had a lucky escape
Dude. You realize that you are next in the line of being cheated on. Dump this clown before she cheats on you. Make no mistake, she will/has cheated on you
Well now, if true, she can say she has NOT cheated on every boyfriend.
Good on you for being strong 💪 I’m happy you ended it despite your love. In my opinion, you did the right thing. It’s a HUGE risk to be with someone who has that kind of history. You’ll find better, I promise.
Bro.She is cheating on you...or at least has cheated on you.This boils down to her insecurities. My advice is run.Don't waste years on this person.If you do it will be worse.Like you have kids and then fund out she is still cheating.Believe me.It feels horrible to end a long relationship but listen to that little voice in your head because it's right.
First post: WTF?  Second Post:  If she's telling the truth, IMO that's not emotional cheating.  You didn't have any ladies you talked texted to when you started dating her?

  
She said she did work on herself before she met you. 

  
Why are you afraid of vulnerability?
Jesus christ man.

Imagine you go to your buddies house and he has a pet snake and you ask if you can pet it and he says "you can if you want but the last 7 people who tried to got bit and they said it hurt pretty bad" would you try to pet the snake?

Ultimately it's your life gang but me personally I would've broken up with her the second sober hee confirmed it, I would never be able to shake the feeling she had cheated
Seven dudes? I'd have never started a relationship with her in the first place.
It's soooo funny.We all have that gut feeling,voice in our head...what ever you want to call it.You should always...and I mean always listen to it.Its always right.While you are la de da ing through life it is picking up on all these little oddities and small signals.Thatd why everyone always say afterward "I knee something wasn't right".And for those who say " I had no idea" either they are lying or super dumb.
I suent even read past the title but ain’t no fuckin way

Edit plus 1 fir self respect
You made the right choice. 

I doubt you got the honest truth out of her when you confronted her to come clean. Maybe if you had asked her when she was drunk and she let that bombshell slip but I guarantee she was running damage control at that point. 

Like you said, go be with someone that doesn't make you wonder constantly. It's a great feeling.
So glad you chose yourself bro. This is why I don’t bother with people, too many bums 😂
“She also admitted to me that during the start of our relationship, she had been texting a few other guys, but did not cheat on me”

This needs clarification. Specifically, what was the nature of your relationship at the time (casual or exclusive) and in what way was she texting these other guys. The fact that she says “but did not cheat on me” makes it seem like you guys were exclusive. She doesn’t get to decide what you consider cheating. For all you know she was sexting these guys, but because it was nothing physical, she doesn’t consider it cheating. At the end of the day, it’s up to you whether you can move past this or not.
Dump her
In my experience, a cheater is always a cheater. There will be tough times during the relationship and it’s going to be damn hard to trust her when you know she has zero issues with cheating.
She has kissed you before after sucking some strange dick. 

I guarantee it.
Her talking to guys in the beginning was cheating, assuming she was talking to them in a flirtatious way.
I was in a similar situation my friend. I felt like I could be the different one. That I would treat her so good and love her to the extent that she never would want to cheat. Naturally I was wrong about that and she chose to cheat 10 years into our relationship. I think there is something to the quote about a zebra changing its stripes. People can change and I’m all for it, however most the time they aren’t ready to until they see their own bad karma come back to them. I would disconnect if I were you. Find any reason why you don’t like her or like someone else more so you can detach yourself because the longer it goes on, the more it’s gonna hurt when it happens. Hopefully you guys don’t have a child because that makes it infinitely more difficult. I wish you the best and I hope your heart remains intact.
NTA. That’s a deal breaker for a lot of us. If someone is an a bad mental state or toxic relationship and they do the wrong thing once, I could have a relationship with them, but even then it would make me uncomfortable. To cheat on every partner they’ve ever had shows you their character. To never have been caught by any of them shows you she’s an incredibly sneaky bitch and there’s no way she can be trusted to be honest. RUN!!!
You are dealing with a narcissist,which are very insecure people,in constant need of attention and new supplies,those people dont change,you will always be in an open relationship with out you knowing you are in one.
Once a cheater, always a cheater.

Early in my relationship with my ex-wife, I remember her talking about a friend of hers cheating. And she was justifying why her friend was cheating like it was a normal thing. I didn't see the red flag at the time.  I caught her cheating on me a year into our marriage.

When people reveal to you who they really are, listen to them.
RUN.
I believe in the redemptive acts of self reflection, regret, and commitment to better ones self freeing one from the shackles of past desires or escaping the folly of the blunders of youth. BUT. This boisterous boozy bimbo ain't about dat life bruh. She bragged to you about the consistency of her society crumbling degenerate behavior. 

Do not wife. Repeat, do not wife. Or girlfriend. Or befriend. Or anything.

That is all.
red flag
I don't even have to read your post.  I can read the first sentence and tell you that I hope you made the right decision, which would be cutting that off immediately.

Sidebar:  A girl with 7 ex's is already a problem in and of itself.  There are studies showing that after anything more than 2 partners, the chances of a female maintaining a relationship or marriage drop significantly.
The part where she says she kept texting other men while at the start of your relationship is honestly just standard my dude. Everybody does that. You keep a few contacts around in case the new relationship doesnt work out. Its pretty common that you dont move past 2-3 dates so you’d be dumb to burn bridges with all the other prospects. As for the rest yeah she was well you know the term, lets say sleeping around until she got more mature. Pretty common and I do think it reflect poor upbringing, good on her to have worked on it and you’re in your right to decide if thats a dealbreaker.
You did the right thing. The mental anguish of staying with somebody who cheated is horrible.

I totally understand and feel your pain ! I've been there. But give it some time, although it will be hard continue with the no contact for a week or two and be honest with yourself. If you don't feel 100%...move on
PAST BEHAVIOUR IS THE BEST PREDATOR OF FUTURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR!

This is why you always screen for high body counts, cheaters etc…their true nature is revealed and they can’t change it! Only a fool would keep a Hoe as anything other than casual fun!

Tell her you only see her as casual going forward and go try meet a girl with some morality for an LTR.
Dude. Bail. Now.
Well well well, if it isn't the consequence of their actions.
Ending the relationship was the best choice you could have made for *both* of your sakes. 

You deserve to be in a relationship with someone you trust, and if she really has changed, great personal growth on her part is great. However, you no longer trust her, and trying to force a relationship in that context is gonna end up hurting both of you in the long run, because what if she keeps her word and never cheats on you, but you still can't trust her?

Your mistrust would be entirely valid because of her past behavior in previous relationships, but so would her desire to be trusted based on her behavior with you. It would simply end with a much messier split down the road.

To sum it up, you made the kindest choice possible for both of you in the long run.
I'm not sure how old you both are, but other than the cheating, does she usually get drunk to the point she starts behaving in way she usually wouldn't? I'm getting the vibe you think this only spilled out because she was drunk, hence me referring to behaving (or speaking) in a way she usually wouldn't because she was so hammered.  Drinking occasionally can slide into full blown alcoholism a lot more easily than people realize.
😘
Oh please. She cheated on short term partners years ago? And was dating other people when you first started dating, but split with them for you? And you broke up with her because you were making things up that never happened? 

Grow up and get some therapy. You’re a child in a 30-something body.
You should get back with her and use her for sex while sneaking a spy app on her phone. Do it for atleast six months, obviously if you find cheating texts or whatever dump her but if not stay with her. If what she says is true about them all happening when she was younger and drunk then she deserves a chance. Its the only way to know. I cheated a few times when I was late teens to mid twenties it wasn't all about the sex I have always had low self-esteem and it was a way of boosting my ego. I have a totally different outlook on life now. I'm now 36 by the way.
I’m sure this time it will be different!
Just leave immediately.

She will absolutely cheat on you.

Also, NOBODY healthy in their mind drinks that much without any social event. Just in her bedroom playing videogames...

She is not a sane person and you should run away from her.
If she was gloating about it when drunk, then that’s how she really feels about it. You are the next victim if you don’t get out of this.
When people tell you who they are, believe them. She's 7/8 right now, if she hasn't already, she likely will. DO NOT MARRY HER. EVER.
My daughter’s dad has cheated on every single gf he has ever had. Promised he wouldn’t on me and never on the mother of his child (his dad cheated on his mum) but alas.. he cheated for 9 months! 7 of those while I was pregnant. 
Has since cheated on his current gf and I don’t see that he will EVER change. 

I think it’s extremely rare that cheaters change. Serial cheaters that get away with it are even less likely to change. 

Personally I wouldn’t be able to trust her again after her confession.
Good for you.
You must have done something good in your life to get this type of reveal before you put a ring on it. Somewhere out there someone is sending you blessings because you are worth so much more. I’m so glad you left her. She can finally start healing now that she has been rejected by the person she actually wants. Sometimes therapy doesn’t help in these cases but a rejection absolutely does, especially by someone she respected and wanted to be with. Props to you
It's probably difficult to hear, but people who cheat on their SO's that frequently do not tend to ever break the pattern. It is an embodiment of how they perceive and interact within romantic relationships. 7/7 is a crazy high number, and her "bragging" was true colors finally presenting themselves. Life sent you a giant red warning sign about allowing this person to still be in your life. Understand that if you remain with her, she will cheat on you if she hasn't already.

  
Source: read studies involving people who exhibited similar behavior pattern while in Uni.
Yeah fuck that lol. If it was one guy and she learned a lesson and changed after, whatever. I cheated on a girlfriend when I was 18 or 19 and never cheated in any relationships after that. Cheating on every partner just shows she doesn’t care to grow or is incapable.
OP, you have to ask yourself why she told you this. 

You also have to ask yourself what are the odds that out of 8 people, you are the only one she didn’t cheat on.

Once reality sets in, run for your life because she’s crazy and unfaithful.
I don’t know why you needed more information, you’d already decided to leave and her rational explanation did nothing for you. Hopefully she’ll be upfront with the next guy and get this out of the way. She didn’t do anything to you but the idea she might was too much for you. Better to know sooner than that later that that’s how you BOTH are.
If y'all do break up I know for sure this might be her turn around to stay away from alcohol
The fact it’s been three years and you don’t live together yet, and she’s cheated on 7 people kind of tells me everything.
If she’s single now….what’s her number? 

I got uhhhh…a friend
idk man, odds are over time she will do the same to you.  Personally I would walk.  The pain you would feel then far exceeds what you’re feeling now.  Maybe say, let’s just be friends and go from there, if that is possible.  Best of luck.
You don’t have to take our advice. Just look at what scientific studies say. They say she is more likely to cheat on you than not. If you are okay with then continue the relationship. 
I stopped reading after I left and haven’t spoken in 2 days. Bro this chicks prob banging behind your back for those last two days. Fuck her and walk away. Otherwise remain and save this post for days, weeks, years to come you’ll call yourself a cuck.
RUN. Honestly, don't give it a second thought. Run run run far away from this one.
You made the right decision. She definitely cheated on you.
Well the truth comes out . And I’m sorry but that’s not good at all
THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO BE WONDERING IS WHY SHE TOLD YOU. LIFE IS ALWAYS CHANGING AND THERES NO NEED TO BLACKLIST SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE THEY TOLD YOU A REVEALING TRUTH ABOUT THEIR DISTANT PAST (1/3RD OF THEIR LIFE AGO)
Good that you broke it off. Once a cheater, always a cheater. If you had continued and she cheats on you in future, it would have sucked. I recently found out that my girlfriend has been cheating on me with other guys, I ended stuff. It hurts a lot to be on the other side and get cheated on.
She has a pattern so you did good, I’m sorry.
Imagine being her 8th boyfriend 😂
Man, I gotta say I really admire your self respect
GOD BRO CONGRATS FUCKING LATIONS 
im 22 and im in a similar boat as u and even tho its hard to leave im trying 
fuck im proud fr
Sure, there is a possibility she's really genuinely changed, but *if* that happens again, don't be surprised. Idk if I would stay.
You did the right thing
Big ol green flag for me send her my number brother.
Yall are both in your early 30s and she's been in 8 relationships, including your 3 year one and cheated in 7 of them. Thats an insane amount of relationships as is not to mention cheating in 7 of them. Thats wild. And this is coming from a woman. Not to mention, assuming shes slept with her past boyfriends, thats seven people, plus she cheated (assuming she didnt cheat with any other boyfriends) thats at least 7 more men, making you man number 15. If i was a guy, id never date someone whos in her early 30s and has slept with so many men. Idk, maybe its because ive been with the same guy since high school and married my high school boyfriend, I just think thats a lot of different dicks shes been through (for lack of a better word I'm sorry) 1
So much easier to deal with the pain of ending the relationship, than have her get drunk and in 10 years you find out she cheated on you too. Good luck bro I hope you do ok!
Yeah, you did the correct thing there. I married a girl who told me she loved screwing married men because it was “just sex”. About 4 years in I had to be tested for an STD that she had, but I didn’t.  I looked up the incubation time that it appeared after infection and it was 90 days. 

I loved her and my daughter so I just sucked it up and started my own affairs. About 14 years later while I was working out of state she told me I wasn’t welcome back. 

I begged to try and work it out, but she refused. I lost everything and had to declare bankruptcy. 

You got lucky. Run like hell.
you made the right decision
Dude you dodged a bullet. Once a cheater always a cheater. I Just found out that my ex cheated on me with our ENTIRE friend group, my best friend, our roomate (bc we lived together) and another guy that i fucking hate to my core. I trusted these people and they lied to my face for MONTHS got off on my naivety and trust and then she just up and left me out of the blue. didn’t even tell me. I found out from a mutual friend bc he screen recorded their convo where she was brazen and unapologetic about it all. Truly insane. So glad we both got out before it turned worse.
You made the right choice imo
lol she is never drinking again 🤣
It's almost guaranteed she has cheated on you.  Probably recently too.  That's not something that just pops into your head when you're drunk.

You made the right choice.
You are next
Yo WTF… yea cheaters are the worst
Were there ant signs in your current relationship that made you feel she was attention seeking or have low self esteem?

I am so sorry this happened.  You deserve better 
Dump her, get your passport.
The past is the past. You ignoring her while she’s sitting next to you ‘babbling’ means you dont care much anyway, on top of you’re ignoring her for days for her being honest with you about her past. I’ve never cheated for the record and I have been with a cheater. It didn’t come into my relationship, it is not my concern.
BREAK UP NOW!!!!
She told you who she is 🤗
Brother just as you get told in Frozen: „let it go“
This is a hard one. I’ve been cheated on before and have told my fiancé when we started dating that I get cheated it’s over that I don’t deal with it. But in this case her opening up 2x(day of and then after the meeting) I might have stayed with her. Depends heavily on the girl but for my young 20s 3 years is a lot and I tend to hold onto relationships. If there had been any shady stuff in the past I might have agreed with OP. But based on the reaction and the story I might have stayed around.
She belongs in an open relationship obviously. Save yourself
You’re right to feel thrown off by her confession. She admitted to cheating on all her past boyfriends and even seemed proud of it at the time—that’s a major red flag. And yeah, I can see why you’re stuck in your head now, questioning if she’s gonna do the same to you. People don’t just erase their past behavior because they say they’ve changed.

Now, she says she’s been to therapy and hasn’t cheated on you. Great, but that doesn’t erase the fact that trust has been cracked. You’re already paranoid, and those thoughts aren’t going to just fade. And let’s not forget, she was close to crossing the line with you by texting other guys at the start of your relationship. So, even if she claims she stopped, that was still too damn close for comfort.

Ask yourself: Do you want to be stuck in a relationship where you’re constantly wondering, “Is she cheating on me now? What if she does it again?” Or would you rather cut your losses and avoid the emotional stress of living in that doubt?

She might be genuine about trying to change, but you’ve got every right to walk away. If trust is shot, there’s no real relationship left. Take care of your own peace of mind—don’t waste time living with that constant paranoia.
lol all she’s telling you is she’s gonna cheat on u
You did the right thing.
Tell her again that you want to talk about something else she said while drunk and tell her that she also said she cheated on you. Make sure to do it in a relaxed way and make it clear to her that you're not mad you just want an explanation and go off her reaction. If she reacts in a similar surprised or defeated manner or begins telling you more about what happened then it should give you a good idea about if she cheated on/will be cheating on you.

Or take a simpler and more acceptable approach and just tell her that her confession to cheating on others has seriously made you consider if she would do that to you again or already has. 

Take this advice lightly as I am no social analyst and could very well make things worse depending on who you're talking to.
You made the right call, 100%. Her past behavior, especially the bragging, is a huge red flag, and you shouldn’t have to spend the rest of your relationship wondering if she’s going to hurt you too. Even if she says she’s changed, that kind of history is tough to overlook, especially when she nearly crossed a line at the start of your relationship.

You’re absolutely right—at 34, you’re way too old for mind games and anxiety about trust. It’s better to deal with the heartbreak now than the constant stress of “what if” later. You deserve peace and someone who respects your relationship completely. Proud of you for choosing yourself!
I really don't agree with most of these comments. People grow and change. If she hadn't cheated on you, why would you end it? "If it doesn't grow, it rots". You ended it because of your own insecurities. I was a nightmare when I was younger, but haven't cheated on my last 3...should the next one judge me for my past? Unbelievable.
Wow, good for you! Way to choose yourself. It may be true that she never cheated on you (I don’t see talking to other people before you agreed to be exclusive as cheating) but it’s also completely reasonable that you don’t want to deal with the stress and anxiety of wondering if she has or will.
Run RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN and I’m a girl who had bf I never cheated on and respected before during and after college: RUN!!!!
Hey man I'm sorry for your heartache.  You cannot be in a relationship or marriage if you wonder what your partner is doing or who she is with.  Strong move on your part.
I guarantee you, if she cheated on 7, your number 8 or will be if you don’t dump her,you can’t be this naive bro , im tellin you in a friendly way!
You’ll start drinkin soon after that conversation
Man that is rough.  I don't think I would have approached it the way you did, I think she showed a lot of growth and that she realized what a dedicated relationship means. 

However if you don't feel the relationship any more there is nothing you can do.
Any history of infidelity turns someone into toxic waste. I'd probably never even look at my mom the same way again if I found out she cheated on an old boyfriend back in the day.

Well done.
Cheating when young can be a mistake the person can learn from.  It should be one of the early things covered when dating, and they should be able to explain how they changed and grew as a person.

Your girlfriend may not be cheating or wanting to cheat anymore, but she hasn't done all of the work where she can have an adult conversation about it with you.  That puts you, my friend, in the middle of an interesting judgement call.

🫂
I think you should leave her she has reputation of cheating what makes you different
Awesome!!
Sounds like Devine intervention. You were thinking of marrying her and the universe gave you all that you needed to know. Just be glad this happened before the ring and not after.
Staying in a relationship where you constantly question your partner's loyalty can be emotionally draining. You made the right choice!
People in their 20s are idiots. I think you may have acted too hastily. I also think, whatever, fuck it.
i’m gonna hold your hand when i tell u this, she cheated on you already
Bro, run.
People change. I know I personally changed a lot after I met my wife.
Just leave dude holy shit
bragging about not getting busted by her exes means she got off on it. Her need for that doesn't just dissappear and she might have been letting you know you were not the exception.
>my girlfriend drinks every now and then, and every time she does, she gets super wasted and it becomes rather an.. interesting night.

That right there is probably when she cheats.  So watch out for that.

>she simply admitted to cheating on all SEVEN of her boyfriends, and the cherry on top? they never knew, she was almost.. braggy about it in a way, prideful, and egotistical. i was taken aback, and shocked to my core (we’ve been dating for 3 years, she NEVER mentioned cheating on any of her ex’s, much less all SEVEN of them)

That's pretty wild.  I get that maybe she was attention seeking because you were playing games.. but 3 years together too.  Then the attitude about it... almost like she's saying "So here's what's gonna happen, because I always do it when I don't get what I want (attention) and I'm proud of that because I deserve what I want (attention)."

>after i woke up in the morning,

>part of me was hesitant to bring up her confession, but i did, and once i asked her, her expression changed, her eyes widened, and she started stuttering, she then admitted to everything being true, and began crying,

Crying is -not a defense- that's valid.  

>i told her i needed space and left, it’s been 2 days

>her cheating on her partners, and bragging about how she got away with it has me feeling violently sick, and now i’m stuck in my own paranoia

>i keep asking myself, what if she cheated on me? what if im next? what if she played me too?

So, stop avoiding it and communicate all of this.

>she keeps blowing up my phone, but i’ve been decking her.

This is immature of you.  It's fair to take a day or so, but you need to hash it out.  Her reaction and attitude during the confrontation will tell you whether to stick with her or bail.

>although it’s been 10 years since her physically cheating on all of her past relationships doesn’t mean im safe with her, clearly i wasn’t when she was SO CLOSE to emotionally cheating on me in the start of her relationship, and even though she admitted to cutting them off, in that moment, i lost almost all my respect for her.

If this last line is true, break up.  There's no reason for someone not to have a few other interests when they first started dating you.

>respectfully, i told her that i was done

There you go then.  You did the best thing FOR YOU, and I don't mean that in a negative way.  You gotta call your own shots and know how you feel-- good for you.
Good for you to leave. She should have disclosed that information years before so you could have made the decision before you got 3 years in. And the way she revealed it… omg
RUN FORREST RUN!!!!!!
Time to move on, sadly.
You’ve been with her a long time.. I understand the doubts but are you going to live you life on a “what if”
The foolish woman is loud; she is seductive, immodest, and knows nothing. She sits at the door of her house; she takes a seat high above the city, calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way, 
“Whoever is naive, let him turn in here!”
And to him who lacks sense she says,
"Stolen water is sweet, and food eaten in secret is delicious.”
But he does not realize the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of hell.
So sounds like this woman had a sex addiction.  She then got help for it.  Is it a dirty ichy past sure, but Jesus  she dodged a bullet with you.  Guess you really never trusted her to begin with.
She’s a walking and talking major red flag. I would move on and be grateful you weren’t cheated on.
You did good. If she had talked to u about that sober to start with I might of trusted her, but it slipped while she was drunk so obviously she was hiding it
god be with both of you
Whenever I see somebody that says they don’t drink that often and then gets super wasted it tells me they probably shouldn’t drink. Their exactly the kind of people that can’t handle it. They don’t know how to measure themselves. They don’t know how to be responsible with it, which is probably why most the time they don’t drink.

She probably is telling you some version of the truth and she also by the way she drinks, tells me she has a problem with it. And I know that because I’ve been sober for 33 years. I am a woman that came in to an AA program and got clean and sober when I was young.   I was totally irresponsible and got wasted like that when I drank I knew too. I knew something was wrong with me when I drink.

No, given the life I’ve had since then I wouldn’t date somebody like that. She’s told you she cheats she doesn’t drink well even if she’ll only drink sometimes I just wouldn’t trust her to get her.
Amen! You absolutely did the right thing, it’s going to be tough for a while but hang in there and you’ll be alright.
Cheaters are broken people who do not deserve forgiveness. Like the Black Death, you will only survive if you keep distance.
Once a cheater always a cheater is a saying for a reason ma boy
To me the biggest red flag isn't the fact that she cheated on her previous boyfriends, it's the fact that she told you about it. To me this reads that she has already, or knows that she will do it again and so is subtly confessing. If you're truly ashamed of your history and have moved past it you bury it forever and you don't bring your new partner into it. I'd be less convinced if you'd found out by proxy but her being so open about it...nah. It's like she's warning you. 
Ex-girlfriend*
OP , I just read your post . I believe her, people can change, when she met you , and fell in love with you , she didn’t want any other man in her life . She knew you were the one for her. she didn’t want to be a cheater anymore, and wanted to be in a monogamous,  relationship. She is happy now and wants to be the best girlfriend , best wife and eventually mother she can be. I think you guys will be happy forever.

UNTIL THE URGE HITS HER AGAIN


Dude, you are my HERO. After a confession like that , there is no going back. You have the proof you need because she got drunk with you. &  spilled all the beans , she had no idea what she said , until the next morning, and you confronted her. 
So she finishes college at 22 years of age , you meet her when she’s approximately 29 years of age, so for 7 years, she has sobered up and has not cheated? 
Maybe , but the odds are against her

no way to live the rest of your life with a girl like this , when you go on a business trip for three days , and she’s going out for dinner and drinks with her two girlfriends, or she goes out to a spa with a girlfriend or she goes to a barbecue at someone’s house and they’re drinking , but you can’t go because of work. Who wants to think about this crap the rest of our lives. she will have a hard time “pair bonding” the rest of her life.

You dodged a bullet, my friend  !
"my girl friend told me she cheated on all her ex's, why would she cheat on me, never..."

  
RUNNNN
dang
You are next.
Is her name Jen?
I respect you madly bro. It's hard to leave someone you really care for. But you did it for all the right reasons imo. I hope you all the success in the dating world.
Many congratulations.
the fokin boss.
I always finds a way to all a partner if they've cheated on the past. I usually won't be in a railroad with them if they have. My last ex that I was with for 6 years store up and down he had never cheated. He allegedly had an emotional affair yeast 4 to 5 and while drunk told me he'd actually cheated on his ex wife and all kinds of other sit he denied whence I had asked at the beginning. I stayed a year for the kids but ultimately was like go get fucked, I told you I'll never trust you again if you cheat and I meant it. Once a liar, always a liar, or at least always the doubt.
You know what you need to do. You need to walk away. This is not a matter of whether you like her or not, this is a matter of self respect.
>>her and i

*she* and i
I really really wish I was as strong as you
Talked to a girl that was an alcoholic once and this sounds EXACTLY like her. I hate to say it but that behavior as an adult is HIGHLY suspect. It took me way to long to realize I was in the danger zone and move on. Proud of you OP it is for the best
Maybe it was the binge drinking too though. I mean, you started off your post with how whenever your gf drinks she gets super wasted and it becomes an interesting night. A little interesting that it was the confession not that you don’t drink and when your gf does it’s binge drinking that ended your relationship. Just sayin’
We all make mistakes and were young once but this information is important going into a relationship and to be honest what works for me is painful honestly from the start to build that trust.


I'm sorry you had to find out that way, but you have self respect that's honorable.   You will thank yourself one day.  Take care of you and the rest will follow.
So double that number I guess.
My husband did the same. This will come as no surprise, but I didn’t fix him. He cheated on me for 8 years. We are attempting to reconcile but I wish I had listened when he told me who he was. 
You said 10 years since she cheated, but she cheated in all her relationships before you, and her last relation ship was one year before you two got together? Thats 4 years brother, not 10...
“When someone shows you who they are, believe them”
Wow wtf is wrong with you holy shit I hope you rot in hell dude
People can absolutely change.  I am not going to say you made a mistake but…
Homie is gonna get cheated on

She gonna slam some gin and tonics and then go to town
Have we reached the sex is just sex as time goes by stage of social degeneration that started in the 1950s or was it always like this ? But less public.
I have cheated on 2 boyfriends. One when i was in college and didnt care at the time what that said about me. Second was a couple years ago. I knew I was going to break up with him in a few days when we finally had a chance to talk. I feel remorse for both times to this day. And i feel worse about the recent one because I knew better, I should have been a better person. I have never looked back at those two choices with pride or ego. They were low points in my character. Anyone who is into monogamous relationships should never look back at cheating with anything other than remorse and a desire to do better for their partners and themselves.
It seems like a gift was placed in front of you
Run. Fast. You are next.
Well done bro
“We don’t do that it anymore”.. or any less..
Honestly I'm not the same person I was 10 years ago in active addiction. I did years of therapy to not be that person. People fo change but her hiding it for this long is sketchy as fuck. I was always honest about my past with partners.
Exactly.
Probably the alcohol
I don’t even think it’s worth asking that question. Doesn’t matter. Imo the risk of it happening again is far too high to spend my time with
Maybe she's Snow White and OP is the first normal-sized male she's ever been around?
I’d almost allow one, because you fuck up when you’re young and you hopefully learn from it. There’s no excuse for 7.
[removed]
If she’s bragging about cheating on all her exes, you have every reason to be paranoid about her being unfaithful to you. Trust your gut here, this is a major trust issue, and it sounds like she hasn’t changed. Take the space you need and think hard about whether you want to stay in this relationship. You deserve someone who respects you and values loyalty. Don’t get trapped just because you were considering a future with her. Move on before you get too deep in.
She has shown you who she is, if you don't heed the warning you don't deserve any sympathy. Run now!
Yea cheating on every single relationship is the biggest red flag I’ve ever seen
Same here. I am technically still married but we are separated. First he had asked for an open relationship, at that time admitting he had cheated on every gf he ever had. This was on our 1 year wedding anniversary. I found out that I was actually the other woman at the beginning of our relationship and never knew. I agreed to the open relationship because it was either that, divorce, or say no and he would likely cheat on me anyway. After a while of our open relationship he told me he had been with another girl before we married, and saw nothing wrong with it since I agreed to be open. No matter how much I said, we weren't open then so it was still cheating, he didn't understand why I was upset. He has kinky interests that I am not willing to participate in. And it got to the point where our sex was shit because he couldn't stay hard without those kinks. Long story short, I agreed to be open to save the marriage but here we are... separated anyway. I have a boyfriend now and I'm constantly asking if he loves me and I'm super insecure because of that experience.
14 nuts to be exact
I’ll be the one to say it. She 100% cheated on you OP.
This seems like an interesting approach, thanks
That’s a very interesting approach! I’ll be thinking about that one!
you are a boss. respect, sir. right move.
Once one, always one. It comes down to morals.
What a beautiful sentence.
Made me hungry and sad.
Bet she wasn't crying while getting railed by her affair partners lmao
It's even worse than that. She was willing to hurt all those people she supposedly cared about. It's already bad enough being a person who hurts others, but to repeatedly choose to hurt the people you claim to love? That takes an especially cruel and selfish person.
Most cheaters don't want an open relationship. It takes away the excitement of possibly getting caught.

You dodged a hugeeee bullet there
I highly doubt someone who’s cheated 7 different times has or is ever going to do any work on themselves. This is just who they are, a cheater, and they’re for the streets.
"Its not worth staying in a relationship if you’re just going to be stressed out and paranoid for the rest of your life"

and there is no way he won't be. the only solution here is to cut bait.
She’ll probably still find a way to surprise him in an open relationship.
Interesting perspective
For me it’s not the fact that she cheated. It’s that she initially bragged about it and only once she was confronted with it sober and realizing that it was a consequence that she started explaining that she felt bad about it. 

If she had admitted it drunk and been sad about it then that would be one thing.  But bragging that she got away with it. That’s something I don’t think I could let go of
Why would he take a risk with someone that has a past of serial cheating. Yea, she could change but odds are she wont and why take the risk when there are millions of women that have never cheated on their exes.
If you really changed, why not take accountability and admit to what you did to those who you betrayed? Sure, excuses like "They don't need to know" or "they don't need that pain" and so on are easy to use, but if you truly changed and regretted those actions, you'd tell them
“Only one of them know,the rest do not”

There’s no ‘undergone a huge personal change’
not at least in a way that matters unless you take full accountability for your past actions

My sympathies for your future ex-boyfriend.
Upvote for visibility. People say dumb shit and shit dumbly when drunk. OP owes at least a sit down conversation about the admission. It’s probably still a dealbreaker if even a kernel of truth exists bring the admission.
U skipped the part where she was texting guys in the beginning of their relationship.
You took responsibility on your shoulders and accepted your mistake instead od making it a pattern
There we go again with another cheater calling someone who won’t just tolerate and accept a cheater insecure. I was reading your comment and I was pretty on board with what you had to say, even felt bad for your situation until you got to the point where you pulled out rule #3 from the 304bag handbook.
Glad you managed to be honest, but you're not the victim here. Of course it's going to be a turnoff for him.
A cheater is not always a cheater.  I cheated on my ex-husband towards the end of our 12-year relationship - basically because we had nothing in common and I wanted it to end and he wouldn't entertain the idea. Turns out, he was gay. I was very open about my cheating while dating people the next few months. I met my current husband then and he did not like the fact that I had cheated, but I was open about it. 9 years later, I have not cheated on my current husband and I really have NO desire to. I wouldn't dream of it. 

  
Anyway, I don't like the fact that she bragged about her cheating. The truth juice set OP free.
No.   The relationship is over.  She can’t trust him with personal information about her past without him judging her and making it about himself, and he is also clearly too insecure to be with a desirable woman.    

OP, find an ugly chick to marry.  Nobody will try to fuck them behind your back. 
I used to, but I still do, too.
The Snoop Dogg response 

"I said I wasn't going to smoke anymore weed, I'm not going to smoke any less either"
She pulls the Mitch Hedberg on him

"I used to cheat. I still do, but I used to too."
Well not being upfront and honest but also the bragging part….
If someone tells me they’ve cheated more than a single time on its own I’m gone. Once can be a mistake, after that it’s a pattern and symbol of their mindset. I’m sure they have “reasons” they point to like feeling neglected, abuse, so on, but if it’s a pattern that’s just them making excuses.
When a person tells you who they are … believe them.
Jesus. This is ridiculous. The way he played you and got you to go along with what he wanted. I am truly so sorry, you never deserved that. You just got stuck with the WRONG man. I urge you to work through these feelings of insecurity, and find that child-like connection to the fertile world of the internal. Find that palpable and unconditional love again, and you’ll never feel the need to question someone’s love for you. You are more than enough and your boyfriend is lucky to be with you! ❤️
It's at least 14, actually. Unless she was cheating to her new boyfriends with her exes.
Cum on guys
28 nuts to be exact . Maybe even more nuts
Probably 30-32 nuts in this story, depending if everyone’s healthy
Someone had to tell him. Let's hope that he takes heed.
In vino veritas. She 100% cheated. Prob more than once.
I want to offer a different perspective, from someone who has in the past been very promiscuous and done a lot of cheating on several women.

This was more out of immaturity and a false view of how a relationship should work.
I am a completely different person now and not proud of my past at all.
I decided many years ago that I would not cheat and since then have not. Came close once shortly afterwards but resisted temptation.

Nowadays I try to avoid sex, especially when dating and meeting someone new.

So there are exceptions but perhaps rare.
I would hate to be judged on my past by someone I care about.
It's totally fair to have deal-breakers.


I've cheated on a few of my exes. Years ago, and I was a different person back then. Now I actually care about and respect myself, I am clean and sober, financially secure, educated, and have the self-esteem to walk away when a relationship is not working. It took a lot of time being alone/single and working on loving mysef, forgiving myself, and having a clear head. Before, I was an actual wreck.


After self-reflection, I realized I had cheated when I wanted out of a relationship, but couldn't face that it was no longer working, and didn't want to face being alone. After I told the person I was dating that I had cheated, they would naturally break up with me. I would go through terrible periods of truly hating myself.


Anywho, the partner I have now is the one I plan to spend the rest of my life with, and I could not fathom hurting them. The couple times (during this relationship) it has happened that I find myself attracted to another person, it's easy to dismiss that fleeting attraction, because I realize that there's no situation worth giving up the truly fulfilling and meaningful relationship that I have. I also would simply never put myself in a position to even be tempted to cheat again, as I've identified the poor choices I had made before (such as getting wasted while alone with someone with whom I share mutual attraction), and know not to make them again. The life we have right now is so wonderful, I could never jeopardize losing it, and would never want to cause my SO pain.


I truly believe that with intention and by putting in the work, people can change for the better.
I cheated once and it was such a heartbreaking experience for everyone involved that I promised my self I would never do it again. That was 20 years ago and I’ve been true to my word.
Especially drunk.
Not necessarily. Some or multiple might not be working with full bags.
Yes, yes she did.
I completely agree with this. I cheated on a number of boyfriends in my teens and early 20s. I met and married my husband when I was 26, and I’ve never even looked sideways at another man since. Together for 18 years, married for 17, and I’ve never cheated. 

The “once a cheater, always a cheater” isn’t always true.
I agree with you! People change everyday and the past shouldn't be an indicator of the present. Cheating is sometimes a sign of a problem in a relationship, not promiscuity at all too.... I know it's not nice to happen but people are human after all, and it's common for a reason. 

I've seen many good relationships get stronger after a cheating episode as they have sorted the problems that caused it to happen in the first place!
I've never cheated, but I've been close a few too many times in my younger years. Even now being married there are temptations, but I've stopped putting myself in the situations which might lead to them. Anyone who says they aren't tempted, even for a minute are lying through their teeth.
"I would hate to be judged on my past by someone I care about." Well thats how it works. Your actions indicate alot about the type of person you are. The fact you had to resist the urge says alot about how you are to your core
I think the math is 7 boy friends + 7 affair partners (or more) is equal to or greater than 14 nuts(fucks) not the number of balls in the coin purse.
And they probably did the same thing to her 😭
I don’t think it matters.  I cheated once.  I’ll never do it again.  It broke my partner at the time and it further broke me in ways I never fully recovered from.  

BUT

I don’t get to decide or be upset about how it impacts my life today, even if it means it closes some doors for me, based on something that I did years ago.

The problem is you cannot TRULY OWN your behavior if you don’t also accept ALL the consequences, not just the ones you saw coming, but also the ones you don’t see coming years down the road.  They are ALL still the result of your actions.

Anyone who tries to minimize cheating or the impact it has on others, or doesn’t simply accept that there may be lingering consequences, hasn’t truly owned the impact of their actions.  

At that point it doesn’t matter how much they’ve “changed”.
And your husband is OK with your past???
I don’t think you read the post properly.

I was making the point that people can change.
Sometimes it’s just about growing up.

To reply to your last point, temptation is normal. It’s a part of life. But it’s what we do about that temptation that matters.
Having the urge to cheat doesn’t make someone a bad person.
I was only counting on the stashs of the affairs and not the relationships. If you want to include the nuts of everyone she was with then yes, it would almost certainly be more than 14.

Unless for some reason she dates a lot of guys with testicular cancer, which I guess is a possibility.
I think you mean “oysters in the sandbag,” no?
I agree. I was also very upfront with my now-husband about my past very early on in our relationship. In fact, when we first met, I was in a relationship. I didn’t physically cheat on that guy with my husband, but I knew I had the other foot out the door the minute I met him. (One foot was out months before we met)

I’d completely understand if my husband had the same reaction as OP if I’d never told him about my past and then drunkenly confessed it to him.
This is reddit dude, these people hate admitting that people have the ability to change for the better. Cheating is fucked and yes, usually it goes once a cheater always a cheater, but it's some stubborn thinking to say there's no exception to that.
And that is the real issue.  Not getting this out in the open early is an indication that OP’s g/f still has work to do, and maybe isn’t as far along in her recovery as she says she is, even if she hasn’t cheated since then.
My husband is in jail
Hi. Tonight my husband and I were eating dinner and my friend got in a fight with her boyfriend. My friend’s boyfriend grabbed my friend’s hair and forced her down to the ground and kicked her. My husband pushed her boyfriend and beat his face with his phone and he got arrested. The police told me he will get released tomorrow. He was defending my friend who was on the ground so I don’t know what crime he committed. What do I do???
Get a lawyer ASAP! Do not talk to the police until you do so!
I (32F) was abused for 6 years, when I was with my Ex and it was hell on earth. I used to day dream of people coming to my rescue, but aside from words being said from the occasional friend, who would quickly become the "enemy" because of my Ex hating them for saying something - nobody came to save me aside from myself when I had finally had enough and had the perfect opportunity to get away from it. Your husband is an absolute hero. Please get him a lawyer who is heavily experienced and give him a big bear hug when he gets out of jail. I hope your friend gets out of her relationship as soon as possible, and seeks help to recover from the abuse. I now have a magnet on my fridge that says "Strong People stand up for themselves, the strongest people stand up for others", and try to live those words out in every situation where it's needed. I'm happily married to a man who would never hurt me, and couldn't be happier. Wishing you and your hubby the best!
See him tomorrow obviously, and be proud he did the right thing.
Your friend pressed charges against her boyfriend, right?
First, you get him the best lawyer you can afford. Then you hug hum and tell him HE'S A FREAKING HERO.
Get a lawyer. And marry that man again for being a hero.
Do not talk to the cops, they are not your friends and they are not there to help you.
If your friend didnt press charges against her BF for domestic violence she isnt doing herself and favors and isnt your friend either.
This happened to my cousin. He got off because there was a video. You are allowed to defend another person if you see them getting beat up.
Lawyer.

Not tomorrow, not "when you get a chance."

Now.

This is Battery.  Which is not the same thing as assault.  Do not speak with anyone, including the victim(s), associated person(s), facebook posts, snapchat, etc, without representation.  This includes judges, attorneys, police, friends of friends, text messages, facebook, carrier pigeons, morse code...  Don't talk to your dog about it.  While I'm at it, don't even talk to your husband about it unless you are both home, and alone.  And you should probably delete this post.

Full disclosure, im not a lawyer.  But you need one.

If alcohol is an issue, seek AA, and maybe anger management therapy.  Looks good in court.

He'll be fine, but you're both going to have to perform for the circus for a while.

Edit for clarification//

Assault is the intention, threat, or fear of harm.

Battery involves actual physical damage or harm.  An assault charge is usually included as a secondary charge.

An item was used in the altercation as a weapon.  It's possible this could turn into a felony charge.  Please, do not fuck around with this.
I would say he will go for assault as it wasn’t self-defence because he wasn’t the one being attacked. That’s just my guess read his charge papers and seek legal advice. I honestly don’t think he should be in trouble for it.
This is likely going to come down to the statement/testimony your friend gives of the incident. Similiar situation happened to a teammate I used to play rugby with. He got involved in a situation where a random guy was beating on his girlfriend outside of a bar. Ended up hurting the guy pretty badly. The girlfriend denied that her boyfriend had ever laid a hand on her. My friend ends up doing 6 months in jail, and wearing an ankle monitor for a year.
Self defence can also describe the defence of another, on their behalf, so to speak.
Is the phone okay?
I'm guessing the boyfriend was arrested too? Just because your husband was defending someone else, doesn't mean legally he didn't do something wrong. 

Many times in domestic situations,  there both people were physical, they will take both people now too.
Be prepared for your friend to take her boyfriend's side. It is extremely common for abused women to go back to their partner. Your husband needs a lawyer and needs to keep quiet. Don't trust your friend to do the right thing.
Get a lawyer, immediately.
Get a good lawyer, get copy’s of any video if in a public place and prepare for an expensive ride.
Write it all down in detail before you start forgetting the sequence and what was said.
Guys calm down, it was a Nokia and a perfectly logical choice as a weapon.
The devil will be in the details on this one... Did your husband do just enough to stop the assault? 

Or did he continue beating the bad guy once he was separated from your friend?  

Like others have said, do what you can to support your husband and lawyer up.
You contact a good criminal lawyer and do what they say
Support your husband.  Get your friend some help.  She needs to get away from that guy.
Tell your boyfriend "well done" and help him look for a lawyer if he needs one.
If he got charged with assault and has no previous history he will most likely just get a slap on the wrist, misdemeanor charge and a fine. He could take it to trial and fight it.
Don’t talk to police. Get him a new phone. Give him a big kiss 
First of all, if your friend didn’t respond or offer support when your husband was getting arrested, consider ending the friendship immediately.
Get an attorney. You need legal advice relevant to the state you live in. Self defense can include defending others. Especially if a felony is being committed in your home.

The woman who was assaulted needs to press charges or it will make your husband’s defense more problematic. She did not when the cops came? A lawyer can help you negotiate this if she is unwilling to provide testimony.

After you get through this, buy a couple cans of pepper spray. Great for stopping domestic scuffles.
Do you think the girlfriend is a reliable witness? Maybe you could have your lawyer talk to her to see if she will make a statement.
Get a lawyer,  he committed assault but they might decline to prosecute given the circumstances
Get a lawyer. He probably won’t be in trouble if he was defending your friend as long as your friend isn’t a fucking idiot who takes her boyfriend’s side. That’s going to be your main issue.
Are you serious … your friend’s BF seriously assaulted her in front of, at least, you & your husband? 

Clearly, that’s not the first time he’s assaulted her. But how is it that the BF felt comfortable doing that in front of you and your husband?

Were you all at a restaurant or at your friend’s house, or your house?  Who called the police?
get a lawyer asap. It doesn’t matter if he was doing the right thing, he will have to face the consequences. He assaulted someone and even though he very clearly deserved it, the guy can press charges against your husband. Please be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. I understand why he did what he did, but you can’t just beat people up these days and go about your life. I’m sorry this is happening, and I fully support what he did. It pisses me off people can’t beat up mfs like this who deserve it.
Don't make any social media post either. They will come back to haunt him.
Charges won't stick.
Geez in front of you guys I can only imagine what happens behind closed doors good on your husband I think he should be okay it’s called “defense of others” in which:

The amount of force used was reasonable

The force used was reasonable and equal to the force of the aggressor

You did not provoke or initiate the altercation 
 
Im sure your husband hits all the ticks so just be tight lipped about it until you get a lawyer involved all things considered you have 2 witnesses you your friend (hopefully she doesn’t go against the grain)
When it comes to crime, it all depends on the state. Where I live what your husband did would be considered self-defense even in the defense of other people, even if it's just defending their property. In some states it's illegal to defend yourself unless you're backed into a corner with no way out and already being stabbed. 


But seriously, MAKE SURE neither of you speak to the police without a lawyer. Doesn't matter where you live, the people who investigate you will pretend to be your friend only so they can trick you. Prosecutors and detectives only care about increasing the tally marks of people they've locked up. Don't speak without a lawyer. If they ask a question just say "Lawyer"


 Your husband did the right thing, he needs your support right now and he needs to know you have his back. 
Reminder that "self-defense" isn't limited to yourself. It also extends to protect other people that aren't able to defend themselves.
Give him head
Tell him not to lose his freedom over your friend because your friend is probably still with that man and hitting him wont make her leave him.
He did a just thing, but he also committed an act of bodily harm on another person. Regardless of motive, this is a crime (allegedly). You should just wait it out and maybe suggest he looks for non violent approaches to defuse aggressive behaviour in future?

I really hope your friend is alright. What an awful thing to happen to her - I hope you’re supporting her as well.
They may charge him with assault. If he kept beating on the guy after he no longer presented a threat. Even self defense sometimes has its limits.
Times like these I am glad I am a wuss and probably would have just called 911 or asked for help from someone else!
He stands accused of assault, likely with an upgrade (for causing damage and using a weapon). 

He can plead innocent by means of “defense of others”—similar to self-defense.
Legally speaking, he could get charged with assault or battery since a weapon was used, i think. I'm not a lawyer, but most self-defense or in defense of another cases require a force of equal nature. When he brought the phone into it, it changed things. However, he still has a chance in court, in my opinion. Did the friend press charges on the other man? That would help, too. If she didn't... he will probably just have to take the charge and know he did his moral duty as a man.
He committed assault. Some times it’s worth it to eat the charge. This is one of those times. Tell him I said good job.
Hopefully he didn’t say a word because no matter what this scum bag is going to tell the girlfriend it’s either me or them… More than likely he’ll sue, I would text her and get the truth out of her in a nice way. See what she thinks, ask her has he ever beat you like this before ? What do you think would have happened if my husband wasn’t there ? Basically get it in her words that he definitely did what you said he did. That would be what I would recommend. Ask your husband what he told them.
Lawyer and talk to your friend as well. Make sure she testifies against her abusive boyfriend.
You better keep him. That's a good dude right there.
Congratulations and tell your husband I'm having a beer just for him
It really depends on the laws in the area you're in. Sometimes with assaults in certain places the polices hands are tied. It's an immediate arrest, regardless of the circumstances so worse isn't done later in the day/ evening. Even if you're in the right. 

I spent three nights in jail for something similar. Tell your husband to keep his mouth shut and DO NOT DISCUSS anything with anyone in the jail. People talk to the guards for fun just to screw people over. Keep his mouth closed and say nothing. Anything he says can and will be used against him. Tell him to sleep as much as possible, don't interact with other folks in the jail, say nothing to anyone and ride out his time in the jail. Contact an attorney the minute he gets out. Lawyer up and shut up. 

In my case the DA pressed charges. I said nothing, refused to talk to detectives, I didn't defend my innocence or try to talk my way out of the jail. Say nothing, ever, unless it's to your attorney after you're released or in a confidential room with your attorney. Self incrimation is what gets you jail time. Say nothing unless you have counsel and only what your attorney tells you to say. If you don't self incriminate and don't give them fuel for a trial, they will usually drop the charges. Get counsel as soon as possible, say nothing, do nothing that could further a case against you. Loose lips sinks ships.
You don’t know what crime he committed????

ASSAULT
Lawyer up. And buy that man a beer.
Get. A. Lawer. Public defenders are good and your right. Also, DONT TELL THE COPS ANYTHING AND PLEAD NOT GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your husband committed assault and battery, which is a crime.
Get a lawyer. I would. In Oregon, we can call the bar and they recommend a lawyer.
Sounded a bit mad so I had a peep at previous posts. Is this the same boyfriend you posted about who had an insane jealousy issue with your friend? Is it the same friend?
If so maybe you need to make a decision
What state are you in?  I defended something similar.  Would be happy to consider representing him pro bono if it’s a state I’m licensed in.
You take him to a nice dinner tomorrow. He did the right thing.
He was doing what a real man is supposed to do.
My guess is assault.

Police will ask probing questions  like so did you assault this man while he was arguing with your friend... 

He probably said yes. 

  They asked your friend and her boyfriend if he assaulted  him and they said yes.
 Random eyewitness said they saw it.

No one called in and reported your friends assault so your husband got arrested.


Moral of the story when questioned by police NEVER share any details that imply you are at fault or committed a crime.


Police ask what happened .

I'd say he attacked her I tried to separate them he grabbed me I lost my balance and  while falling my phone broke, I was scared and through my arms up while trying to to get my balance I didn't mean to hit him or stand on his head multiple times.
Not a lawyer but retired court clerk who saw a lot of these cases go thru the system. You’re getting good advice here. 

Don’t talk to the victim of the original assault. She’s likely to turn on your husband. 

Don’t say anything about the case beyond scheduling to your husband when he’s on the jail phone. 

Get him the best attorney you can afford. A PD will just try to plead the case out. Hire your own. Mortgage the house if you have to. 

Don’t tie all your money up in bail so you can’t afford the attorney. That won’t help him at all. 

If you have already spent all your money on bail, offer that to the attorney. They can ask the Judge to assign the bail to them to pay the fees. 

Best of luck to both of you. He did a good thing and it’s going to be a rough patch for you both.
Getting arrested and tossed in jail is one thing…getting prosecuted is quite another.

You’ll find out soon enough if he going to be prosecuted, or if they just wanted to have him spend the night to cool his jets .

As with anything else having to do with being arrested….silence is king.

Make sure he exercises his right to remain silent…..and hope he didn’t say to much when he was being arrested.
Pushing him off is defence.  The continued punches are assault.   

Good on your husband tho.
I dunno but your husband did a good thing
That’s why I tell my wife not my problem of a situation comes up
Sadly police don’t care. They get paid to arrest… and the lawyers will sort it out later! DA should look at the case and say. “We will let this one slide.” Changed with battery and assault? He could claim self defense!
Is the phone okay?
Maybe they're just holding overnight, no charge
Definitely want to have a lawyer ready. But the crime is likely assault.
1st and most of all DO NOT TALK TO THE POLICE about it no matter what they say about " trying to help you out" then call a defence attorney. What they'll try to do is get him to take a plea-deal for fines and probation but don't take it without talking to that lawyer first
R/prisonwives would likely have a ton of good info, ladies who have been in your position and would gladly help you navigate this situation with compassion ❤️
r/legaladvice
The intention of self-defence law (which often includes defence of others) is to allow a person to get away from an attacker. Your husband pushed the boyfriend *and then continued hitting him with an object*, to the point where he was taken to the hospital. If the boyfriend was not relenting, it may have been justified, but just based on what you’ve told us, your husband may have crossed into assault territory. We do not have the full facts of the situation or of the law in your jurisdiction to really be certain. You will need to speak to a lawyer about the next steps.
Get a lawyer and bring your friend as the victim and witness that she is ,  she also needs to press charges against that POS .. if he does that in front of you and your hubs just imagine what he does  to her in private ..good luck
I would think he would be protected under the Good Samaritan law.
This has to go to court. If he has a good lawyer to prove that he was defending your friend, he can get the case dropped. He hasn't been convicted of anything, cases get thrown out all the time. Hope he gets out ok. Sorry about what happened.
Dope of him to protect her.
It’s the beating part that is the offence. Pushing the guy was defence of another, that is where the law draws the line on where the assault of another stops, and then the beating is when the assault of the husband begins. Two totally seperate matters. He wasn’t defending at that point, he was retaliating.
Well wait to see if they will even charge him the jails are so full anymore with homeless people they are letting alot of people that don't really have a history go the might charge him with something but may drop it down considering what happened and if her boyfriend is being a baby and want to have him charged if he gets a assault charge it probably won't be to bad it's not a DV did the other guy get hemmed up to or just your husband
Have your friend go and talk to the state attorneys office. They are who decide to continue with case or not.
All I know is I hope your friend stands up for your husband and tells the police what really happened. I hope she’s ok and that she can get away from this monster.
They are going to charge him with an assault and battery. There is a possibility the D.A. May dismiss the charges due to him defending your friend. But that means your friend absolutely has to press charges on the boyfriend. If he has never been in trouble before, the worst that will happen is a short probationary term. You may be scared about what could happen and it does depend on whether your husband has had trouble before or not. Also what State are you in? I know what will happen for sure in my State. Please give me an update after the first court appearance.
A lot of the time police just HAVE to take everyone into custody when there's a fight until they can piece together what actually happened. If there are enough people within the interaction that vouch for your husband defending someone else charges will probably be dropped. If not get a lawyer. If you can't afford one, then that's what public defenders are for. But 100% do not talk to the cops without a lawyer present at the very least just in case.
It will ultimately be up to the district attorney that chooses to pursue charges. With as overloaded the judicial system is or says it is, the DA might not want to waste resources on a case that his/her office can't win. That's what gets the DA elected. So I doubt that it will be pursued especially since no weapon was involved. The phone might be the wild card though.  But still, the DA has to know that this wouldn't get a conviction from a jury. There might be a fine, maybe some community service all depending on how good your attorney is. This is the most likely outcome given the information provided. I think.
Sometimes there’s a cost to doing the right thing. Just make him his favourite lunch and let him know how proud you are of him.
"..beat his face with his phone.." may be the reason?
Your husband is a hero. Be proud of him.  Speak to a lawyer.
Where I live goddam Australia, it’s a great country but what I hate is, if someone break into your house and you hurt them, you will get in trouble🤦‍♀️ just some laws are dumb, your husband did the right thing
It’s definitely assault. Was his life in danger? There’s a very fine line between self defense and assault. Going over board and beating his face in was a bad decision unfortunately.
You can only stop the attack. I'm assuming the police figure the initial push would have been ok but once you're on top pounding the guy with the phone... There lies the crime
There are very few things to be proud of getting arrested for, This is one of them!
If being a badass was a crime
He will be fine. Chances are the charges will be dropped.
You wait until tomorrow. In the meantime you get a lawyer. \*Shrugs\*

Never talk to police, no matter how innocent the question may seem / actually be.

"What you say can and WILL be held AGAINST you in the COURT OF LAW".... Remember remember those words.

Whatever you say, innocent or not, WILL be held AGAINST you, not for your help.
I really hope your friend takes stock and dumps that guy.
Did the other dude also get arrested?
He will get out
You shouldn’t be typing anything here if this is going to be illegal case. he did the right thing but be careful. Good luck to you both.
There’s more to it than what you’re saying and using a phone (weapon ain’t great). A good lawyer can get it dropped certainly if your Freind is actually your Freind and writes to the judge  about it.
Oof. This can be tough. Domestics can be weird. It may make sense that your friend would be on you and your husband's side. But, these things don't always make sense. People make weird illogical decisions in relationships. You should have him lawyer up just in case. Any time it's an option, you get a lawyer always.
If they take him to court I’m sure they’ll dismiss the charges. Make sure to take pictures of the injuries your friend sustained. You both are key witnesses.
Thank him properly when he comes home
Depending on where you live, should be easy to get off claiming self defense/defense of another. Now if he beat him back onto the ground and went over him for the next 3 min, that'll be harder, but it looked like he was reaching for a weapon.
Be proud of him and support him through whatever process comes. 

I wouldn't be too worried unless he seriously took it too far. Spunds like he was acting with the intent to save someone, possibly their life.
You remain silent and get an attorney!
Reading your past post, you should have a lawyer on retainer with all the violence you and hubby deal with over the years.
see him tomorrow. he’s more than likely going to get another court date and then probably be on probation and maybe some anger management classes (required when you get arrested for fighting where i’m at)
That's just kinda how things are right now. There are plenty of cases of obvious self defence/defence of others where the person is convicted and sent to jail
what you know is different to what other people know, or what they want them to know.

it's definitely different to what the police know and they have to find out.

he was in the right, just relax it will be fine.
It’s common in a domestic violence dispute to arrest all the parties involved in the fighting. They need to while they question and gather evidence.
Most likely charges will be dismissed unless he caused permanent physical damage
Just get a lawyer.
Advice that's very sound:   Advise him to be silent, obtain a lawyer and delete any incriminating statements that will most certainly be used against him in court ... 

The above description where you stated ;   "  he beat his face with his phone"..   defending someone or not is incriminating.... Leave any statements to a legal representative... 

I'm guessing they no longer teach Civics in school !!!!!
It's just the process they have to go through. When he gets out tomorrow tell him how proud you are of him for defending your friend.
For now, get a lawyer, and no one say a single word until after consulting with the lawyer.
Sometimes he has to be arrested and charged but then the judge will drop those charges based on the evidence.
Theres a high chance he'll be okay. Lawyer up & as you said if the friend presses charges that helps.
I would find a decent criminal defense lawyer, even if it's likely his charges will get dropped by the judge, and hopefully wherever you were had cameras. The jerk hopefully ex boyfriend of your friend is probably not going to drop his complaint and still press charges.
Get a lawyer.
You got this! Support your man who did the right thing.  He is a hero, and I'm glad he helped.

But encourage him to get a good lawyer because the justice system is neither fair nor blind.
Your husband is a hero
He says nothing until he has a lawyer. Even the police. He can request a public attorney. The attorney will explain the process, charges, etc...  You wait until he speaks to the attorney and gets processed through the system. They will set an initial hearing regarding bail. again, do not talk about any of this with anyone. You can't trust your friend or obviously her boyfriend in this. Any comments you make to friends or family can be used as evidence. This becomes a discussion between attorneys. They will decide if your friend is to be questioned and involved in your defense. It is a natural feeling that people want to be cooperative, especially if they feel they are in the right. The best thing to do is to do is just say you want to speak to an attorney so you can fully understand what your rights and responsibilities are. Good luck.
First contact to good attorney. Second stop saying he beat his face, that sounds really bad when you’re trying to say he was defending your friend.
3 factors are needed:
1. Which state
2. The DV laws in this state/municipality
3. How much did he drink.
Everyone who isn’t an abuser knows your husband did the right thing. He may have gone overboard, but he did it for the right reason. What you need to be prepared for now is for the abusive boyfriend to press charges against your husband, and for your friend *to side with her abusive boyfriend.* Your husband was protecting your friend, but expect her to turn on him, and you, and support her BF. Just so you’re aware.
I only wish my exs friends would have had the balls to protect me when he I was completely helpless getting my face beat in. Hug your man because you got a good one. I hope your friend finds the strength to look at your relationship and know there’s a better man out there ❤️
Do whatever he needs and if your friend goes back to that boyfriend, don't ever talk to her again
Lawyer up.  You need to find the name of the ex prosecutor, then find his law office, call them for consultation.  This is your best chance, but it will be expensive.  Not only will the ex prosecutor know the law front to back, they know everyone in the court.
The old way was to put the two "in the cooler" near each other, so they couldn't "fight" but could talk whatever out. 

Good on your husband for defending a lady. Law Enforcement deals with things like this all the time, so they try to just keep them both until they have a better idea from speaking to witnesses who is the bad guy. No man should ever strike a woman, except in self-defense, and even then it's not a nice way to treat a lady. Your friend needs to be protected. Maybe you and your husband can let her stay over for a while, and for the love of French fries and tartar sauce, your friend needs to file charges and get a restraining order. I hope the lady is okay physically, but if she isn't, get her to an Urgent Care or E.R. for a check up. And when hubby gets home, you should love the heck all over him.
Give your husband a metal when he gets out. I would also give him a kiss that would knock his socks off. Tell him thank you, your friend needs to file domestic abuse charges against her to be ex-boyfriend. If you can I would get witnesses to testify when your husband goes to court at what what was happening and why your husband acted the way he did. I would even have your friend testify too. Your husband did nothing wrong. I would also recommend that he gets an attorney. I am not going to guarantee it, but I am willing. Do you think the charges would be dismissed because your husband was acting in the defense in a domestic abuse situation? I will repeat it again. Your girlfriend needs to charge her soon to be ex-boyfriend with abuse and you married a good one
It'll be assault he's been arrested for purely because the woman beating prick pressed charges against him. 

Even if he was defending your friend, he's still committed assault. 

As rubbish as it is, unless your friend's partner withdraws the complaint he will be charged unless the police throw it out as a rubbish claim.
Protecting on one thing.  Going past that then he becomes the aggressor. Using a weapon can extend the time he serves in Otis ion a bunch.  They calm it an enhancement.  Get a lawyer for him as he may be going away for a long time.  The hazards of being a white night that they don’t warn you about.   A lessennhe will learn the hard way
lawyer up asap
Does your husband have any history with police / the legal system?

Did he hit the guy a few times and that was it?
Or did he beat him bloody (which he deserved)?
Make a nice dinner. Invite the friend over. Let her know she always has a safe space in your home. 

About your husband? Nothing? Maybe consult with a lawyer. But you’re fine.
Be super proud of him, and share this to social media.
Like others here have said, get him a lawyer as soon as possible. Don't talk to the cops without one.

And when he gets out of custody, give him a massive hug. He did good
He did the right thing. Be proud of that man and lawyer up!
W husband
Technically your husband committed battery, but he obviously had a good reason to do so.  Speak with a criminal defense attorney and do not talk with anyone about the case until you retain an attorney.
Had something happen in my family.  One of us wound up in jail.

A lot I didn't know. He was able to call while he was in processing. Of course, not so once he went to being confined. 

After that, I couldn't do anything or find out anything without his number. 

Finally after a while he called (collect,of course)  so I right away told him I need his number and he gave it. Later on, after release, he told me: he had seen men make collect calls and instead of a name they would spit out the inmate number. Now we knew why. 

It appears to me, a lot of this is deliberately made as difficult as possible. I don't know why/for what purpose, other than meanness. But anything they can make harsher it appears they do so. I'm sorry your family is experiencing this. My family member wasn't given a mattress... other prisoners had to tell him what to ask.  

If you don't hear from him by a reasonable time, go see a bondsman. That's who will get him out.  (Generally they are taken to a judge at 9am. So I would reasonably think you would hear something by noon). 

Lawyer up. This system is so difficult for the average person to navigate, 

Call a bondsman. Call a lawyer. If husband calls you, immediately get his inmate number and then tell him right away don't talk at all about what happened.  Just tell him you're getting bondsman/lawyer, as appropriate. 

Some of the jails are now giving prisoners a kind of tablet. He said you can watch "church" on it. With money on his account he can call you on it and he can pay for/watch some television.  They don't get to keep it but it is some welcomed distraction as long as they have it. (You can put money on his account but you have to know his number. Although one family friend did show us you can go there and do it in person if you don't have the number. You go to the courthouse lobby and there's a machine that will take your money). 

Jail can happen to anyone, misunderstandings happen. It ought not to be so extremely difficult to navigate. there ought to be some humanity. I understand some people need to be separated, jails and prisons serve a purpose. But your mother or son could wind up in there, anyone could have a wrong identification or misunderstanding. 

If you don't know your family's phone number, you could be even worse off. Try to memorize at least one phone number. 

We were told he'd be out.  It took 3 days. I'm sorry this is happening to you.
Be on your husband side and support him for doing the right thing!
He committed assault, possibly with a deadly weapon if the DAs wanna be dicks.

My sisters ex boyfriend did 7 years for something similar to this. Good luck. 
They're going to get him for assault. But the punishment may be light as the extenuating circumstances. Unfortunately, in the Law's eyes, two wrongs never equal a right.  I'm very sorry your boyfriend is in the situation and he 100% did the right thing. Unfortunately the justice system sucks for these types of situations.
I just want to say, be proud of him, if the police pursue charges find a good lawyer. He did the right thing!
GET A LAWYER ASAP
That's assault he may or may not have a charge. The other guy could also sue in civil court for any medical cost.
They probably had to arrest him on suspicion of assault.

What happened to the friends bf?  I can’t assume he got away unscathed?
He'll be charged with assault.  Given the situation, he'll likely have to take anger management classes and he won't end up with a felony on his record (if he's white.  If he's black, all bets are off). Get a lawyer, NOW!
99% of the time, as it is in this case, the answer is get a lawyer.
Talk to an attorney.  Sounds like he used more force than was needed and could be why he was arrested..I still think it was wrong he was arrested and I am glad he defended your friend 🧡.
ugh, law sucks
He did the right thing and any courts and judges with see that. Don't worry.
You and your gf and your husband will testify that he was defending a woman and there will be no charges
Who beats someone with a cell phone? Why would this be the weapon of choice? 

Your husband, if the story is true, should be awarded not arrested. But why hit someone with a cell phone, was his favorite commercial the one about some guys anti-theft device app on his phone?
Breath. And let the lawyers handle it. Write down your account of the events. Every little detail you can remember. Time stamp it and then you can turn that in to who ever needs it but if you are a witness then you can prove your story didn’t change.
Sounds like you need new friends.
Get a lawyer, or if you can’t afford it ask for a court appointed lawyer. He likely has a “defense of others” defense, similar to self defense. The question will be did he go beyond the level of force necessary to defend your friend. If he pummeled the bastard to a pulp, in the eyes of the law that’s too far. If he hit him a couple of times to stop the beating of your friend that’s a more defensible case. 

There’s also how this is gonna look in the eyes of the jury. If I was the prosecutor and the guy wasn’t too badly injured, I would be offering something like dismissal on completion of anger management classes or something minimal like that. No sane jury is gonna convict someone based on facts listed above. 

That said, is your friend going back with her abuser? She may be a very unreliable witness for y’all if she’s in a cycle of abuse.
I think it depends in where you live. Where I live you can’t even beat someone up who is attacking you.. they’ll still give you an assault charge, its dumb
Most likely it sounds like they booked him under domestic violence. Usually one or both get arrested as a means to legally separate they to prevent further violence. Doesn't hold up most of the time in court.
Damn check out op’s history
Get him a lawyer and tell him to shut the #$^! up untol that lawyer is present.
Just be proud of your boyfriend for doing the right thing regardless of what the outcome was he did the right thing and maybe go to the cell phone store and grab them a new cell phone
He will go in front of the judge in the morning. A public defender will stand beside him. He will instruct your husband to plead not guilty. Bail will be set. If he has cash on him he can pay and get out. If not he can use the prison phone and call a bail bond company. They will come to the jail and take a credit card from his wallet that your husband tells them to use. Once the jail is notified the process is done he will be released. If his charge is assault and battery just get a cheap attorney to guide him through the process. The attorney will see that he gets probation and that's the end of it. In my case I reached into the guys car and grabbed him and hit him. Believe it or not because I reached in the car I was also charged with Felony Burglary. Because of that I had to step up my game and hire a very good attorney. It cost me $20,000 but he got the felony charge removed and I got 2 years probation. It's a pain in the ass but it's better than 2 years in prison.
Hopefully, your friend isn't one of those assholes that takes her abusers side!  Or it could be bad for your husband.
Was the boyfriend arrested too? If the boyfriend got charged, that may help your husband's case because there is a legal precedent for committing a crime to be legal if it's to stop a greater crime. The only legal strategy I'd say to explore is Mutual Combat depending on how the fight started and what state you're in, but talk to your lawyer first.
That man did the right thing unfortunately if your friend doesn't stand up to tell the. What happen and press charged on her boyfriend your husband may face alot of legal issues. I had a friend not be on my side when my ex assaulted me in front of her. She said she was to scared to testify. He ended up getting a slap on the wrist cause it was my word against his even though I had the injuries to prove what he did
Uh, take him out for a nice meal when he gets released. Good on your husband for standing up for your sister! You picked a good one, seems like your sister could learn a thing or two about picking a good one from you. I’m willing to forgive an outburst like this when it’s in the direct defense of someone’s immediate safety.
I believe a blowjob might be in order. Hopefully he didn’t get one in prison
Get a lawyer, get your friend out of that situation, or get new friends.
They can hold him without changing for i believe 48hrs.
Give the man a blowjob
I suspect he won't have a problem if it went down the way you told it, unless your boyfriend went to far overboard.  When it gets to the District Attorney, he'll probably refuse to prosecute and thank your boyfriend for stepping up.  If not the judge probably will.  They won't want to do anything that will discourage people from saving others from being attacked.  And they definitely don't want the media to find out they sided with an attacker.
Make sure your friend gets a restraining order against her hopefully ex boyfriend. Just wait until you can get him out, you can call a lawyer if you feel like you need to.
99% no charges, or charges will get thrown out.
Is her boyfriend in jail?
I didn’t even read your shit but he probably went to jail because he BROKE DA FUKN LAW
You move in a very classy social circle! In half a century of dinner with friends I’ve never had them attack each other…
Does he need bail? I’ll bail him out. Or a new phone? Shoot I’ll go fund whatever for a man who is willing to stand up for women.
You sound like real trash op
I don't know what advice to give.. Just that I'd also be in jail.
You're husband is a good man.
Self defense doesn't just apply to yourself. Good Samaritan act extended it to other people as well. So what he did legally was self defense (or atleast that realm of law and regulations). The whole being taken to jail for a day thing is more of a formality when it comes to anything involving alcohol or domestic violence issues. Makes sure people don't make stupid decisions while theyre wound up. Yall will probably have to go to court but as long as there third party testimony or video evidence supporting your story the judge will almost certainly dismisses it out write.
Realistically this should be an open and shut case... Unless your friend is going to defend her boyfriend and he decides to press charges against your husband… Speak to a lawyer regardless.
Get a lawyer. I'm sure your husband will call from jail, or you will visit. Tell him not to say a word without a lawyer. And that goes for you too. The fact that the girlfriend pressed charges will help, but do not give the cops anything to build a case against your husband by talking to them.
Convince your friend to dump the asshole and testify on your bf's behalf. Good man
I would like to invoke my 5th and 6th amendments is all you should ever say to police.  End of list.
He will have a court date where he will be able to tell his side of the story. If you have any videos, take it to court. These happen all the time. I doubt anything will come from it. Since there was a physical sign and probably lots of witnesses is why he was arrested. If you can get ahold of the restaurant where it happened I'm sure they'd be happy to zip drive the camera footage for you as well.
Take care of yourself and maybe talk to someone about this. This is a heavy situation. It seems like your husband did what I could to help your friend, I’d support him and your friend while they process what has happened. Maybe encourage them to talk to a professional as well
Guess who's getting a blowjob on the way home from jail?
Did the other guy go to jail
Call a lawyer ASAP!!!
Why he’d pull her hair tho?
Nothing you can do. There's no visitation rights while he's in jail overnight, so it's up to you and your toys.

If it goes to trial, your friends testimony is gonna absolve him, if she dares show up to testify against the abusive boyfriend
Has he voted already?
Get a lawyer!
Potentially assault and battery.  Did he do the right thing?  Yes.  But some times good people take the fall.
Assault assault unless he's trying to assault you you think that's bad 

You can go to jail for giving someone CPR you just save their life but they have a couple bruises so now you're in handcuffs and being sued
What state? What city?  Depending on where it is he’s either gonna get the book thrown at him or seen as a hero…
Always leave the scene of a crime, find him a good lawyer don’t risk waiting.
Your husband has good instincts, but (here come the down votes) a person has the right to defend another person but the moment the offender is no longer attacking the friend if the defender continues to strike them then this is often a chargeable assault offense. A recent case of a couple being threatened by an armed man. The defender disarmed and knocked the bad guy down, set the gun aside, then continued to kick the prone bad guy. Good guy was charged and convicted of assault. Bad guy in the above case deserved to get a beat-down, but be aware there is a line.
Did the dirtbag boyfriend get arrested?
"Give me five complete sentences from an honest person and I'll get you a conviction."

Remain silent.
Reach out to lawyers and stuff but when he gets home: -Good food and good sex, that’s what he’ll need.
Never ever talk to the police without your lawyer present! Go hire one if you don’t have one. The saying “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,” is blatantly obvious to anyone that pays attention and understands constitutional rights! When police say they are your friend and are here to help is a blatant lie to get you to incriminate yourself, so they don’t have to do their job!!
Should’ve said it was mutual combat
Get a lawyer. In some states this would be called “self defense by proxy”
He might be charged with assault, but that all depends on if your friend is willing to press charges on the boyfriend. Using reasonable force for the defense of yourself or others is a legal defense, the problem is proving the force he used was reasonable to defend your friend.

He will most likely be held and released, but if they do decide to charge him he can contest that the force he used was reasonable to defend your friend who was actively being assaulted. Depends on if the friends BF wants to press charges, or if the police want to press charges. I wouldn't worry about it, the friend BF is more likely to be charged once everything is sorted out by the police, good chance the police with try and a judge will drop it after viewing the circumstances if the force used was reasonable
Beating with something in hand, that is seen as assault with a weapon.


Beating without something in hand, that is seen as making a slight adjustment of one's attitude.

Loose interpretation of laws.  Take with a grain of salt.  Force multipliers make for arresting charge multipliers as well.
Get a lawyer and a therapist if you haven’t already. Take some big deep breaths. This sounds really stressful to witness even though he did the right thing. He will probably need someone to talk to as well. 

I’m no lawyer but I will say that despite the fact that he probably did break the law, a prosecutor has to decide if it’s worth pursuing in court or not- which includes considering whether or not a jury would convict him. Hopefully that answer is no. 

Does your friend have a safe place to go?
See him tomorrow, give him the support he deserves, then contact an attorney. Depending on the state you live in, self-defense may be a legitimate defense for him, since he was presumably acting in the defense of a domestic violence victim who was being actively attacked. Beyond that? Say nothing else, do not post anything else online, and do not engage in a conversation with police, investigators, or the prosecutor's office unless you have representation with you.
Get a lawyer. Try to get one on retainer. Do not discuss the case with anyone including your friend. She could take the bf back. Do not talk to law enforcement without a lawyer tell your husband the same. Jail calls are always recorded. I can’t stress this enough do not talk to police.
Hire him a lawyer, and hope to whatever God you worship he invoked his right to remain silent and didn't answer any questions without legal representation present.
It sounds incredibly overwhelming, especially since your husband was trying to protect your friend.
Maybe not post anything on social media about it. 
Get an atty ASAP
🙃
When he’s released, try to get as much information as possible about what happened from his perspective, and then the lawyer can help you understand how to address it and hopefully minimize any consequences.
Take him out for ice cream
Buy him a steak dinner for having the balls to step up.
He committed the crime of caring and  defending your friends dignity
You did the right thing by supporting your friend, and it’s understandable that this situation is confusing and hard to process right now.
Your husband should learn about the law. You can use whatever force is necessary to defend someone, but you can't then start beating on the person. After he had removed the attacker from your friend, he was not justified in using any more force unless he re-attacked. 

Call a lawyer, ask them, don't ask strangers on the internet. And please tell me you're not responsible for raising children.
You can look him up in the jails data base, it is public record and will disclose what he was charged with. Do it all the time for my brother sadly.
Kiss him passionately that’s a good man right there
I hate to make sec sound like a reward, but you definitely need to sex that man down. I've read stories on here where the total opposite happened. A lady's fiance literally ran away while a mugger tried to rob her of her purse. If her brother had not been there with her, there's no telling if she would still be alive today. Your husband is a wonderful man for taking up for your friend. He's definitely a keeper. Meet him at the jail and reward him when he gets home with something because he deserves it. Make him feel proud. Not necessarily sex, but he needs to feel loved and that you're grateful.
Defense of another person is always a tricky scenario, based on what you are saying he will be out soon and probably with no bond.
This story doesn't add up at all!  Three witnesses vs one witness, and the police sided with the aggressor.
Not a lawyer but I'm guessing once he got the bf off your friend that was enough. Striking him repeatedly was not necessary.
Little gay to do it with the phone
Get an attorney! And make sure they expunge this off his record.
Make sure your friend is putting what you say here to paper and doesn’t side with her bf.
You use an object like that. Unfortunately, odds are good. You're going to jail. I don't know the laws where you're at, but if he hadn't done that part, I'd guess he probably wouldn't have been arrested
Your friend needs to get away from her abusive excuse for a boyfriend 

Tell her to read this. 

[https://archive.org/details/whydoeshedothati00banc\_0](https://archive.org/details/whydoeshedothati00banc_0)
He was arrested for assault. Hopefully simple assault, since he was holding a phone depending on your location it could be aggravated assault. Unfortunately his motivations won’t matter, especially if your friend didn’t press charges on the p.o.s.  she was with.  It will be on his record forever and from now on he should exercise caution if he gets pulled over by the police. He’s a violent offender now.  Tell him you’re proud of him and to keep his head up and be proud of himself.  To many people now won’t care why he acted the way he did only that he did.
maybe a brass knuckle phone case
The problem is use of reasonable force while defending your friend. Your husband went beyond this by using the phone more than once and then kicking the guy on the ground. That’s no longer seen as self defense but is considered assault.  That’s almost certainly why he was arrested and put in jail. The guy he kicked can press charges if he wants to.

He will probably use it as leverage against his hopefully x girlfriend to get her to drop her charges.
Is the boyfriend in jail also?  It’s ridiculous he was defending your friend and he gets arrested.
Did the other guy go to jail? If not sounds like your girl friend is not much of a friend. Even if the police took your husband, the other guy should be going as well. But if not then she'll be in that situation again and your husband did that for nothing. But they both went he'll most likely get out and charges dropped. What state did this happen?
Lawyer up!
Don’t have any advice to give, but please thank him for standing up for your friend against the abusive a-hole!
There’s really nothing you can do. He will sit in jail tonight. You may even have to bail him out tomorrow, depending on the charge but as it progresses through the court system over the next few months, the details of what happened will be investigated and more than likely the charges will be dropped, and if not, your friend can go in front of the judge and explain that he was just defending her and I’m sure it will get dismissed from there
[deleted]
It’s standard in a domestic abuse case (which this was) to arrest one or more parties more than likely you’ll need to hire a lawyer and depending on what the judge says tomorrow you may need bail to get your husband out. Kudos to him for standing up for your friend as any man should do, I’d never allow a woman to be hit in front of me but it still is a possibility to be charged with battery and assault
Lawyer up, say nothing to the police.  No matter how justified you or he (rightly, in my opinion) feel, do NOT talk to the police without a lawyer present.
Don't say anything to anyone that is not legally representing you...I'd presume nothing will come of it, depending on where you are, defense of another is a more than viable claim here.

If the dude that got messed up presses charges, it might take longer, but I'd still assume the same end result. Speak with an attorney in any case.
Lawyer. Lawyer. Lawyer. And make sure gf presses charges and reports her bf for beating her ass.
Hire a lawyer for the false arrest
Get a lawyer and don’t say anything. He will get pr personal releases unless he did real damage
Get a lawyer, your husband a new top of the line phone and some good sex when he gets out.  Everything will be fine he won’t get locked up for that.
I would definitely get a lawyer as soon as possible. 

I’m not sure where you live but in Canada your husband would use the part of the criminal code that is “Citizen’s Arrest and Self-defence Act”. What your husband did in this case would be defence by proxy = the defending of another person (usually if they can’t defend themselves).  

The laws would be called something different in the United States but I just used Canadian law as an example.
what happened to the boyfriend?
Just rest easy tonight knowing you’ve got one of the good ones.
DO NOT DISCUSS ANY OF THIS WITH YOUR FRIEND!! Speak to no one, not you or your husband and get a lawyer.
Depends which state you're in, and whether or not your friend is willing to testify in some way against her man. Here in California, if she didn't want to testify (believe it or not that's pretty common), there'd be a good chance that your husband would catch a felony assault charge. Because here in the sissy-la-la state, you cant cause harm to someone just because they were doing something shitty, regardless of how shitty that action was. He'd have been expected to try and stop the activity, but not by means of force, and not continue to use force once the activity stopped. Some other states, the commissioner or judge is going to give your husband a high-five and say sorry for the inconvenience.
Get a good lawyer
Your husband should have never gotten involved. Your friend can drop those charges and get back with him.
Tomorrow morning is called Arraignment. The Court will enter a plea of not guilty, set bail, usually Personal Recognizance, PR, take his word for it he'll come to his next court date. 
You don't really need to do anything tomorrow except pick him up. If you want to get things rolling, I would suggest going to court and watching. Identify the Criminal Defense lawyers and watch them. See who you like and don't. See who the court and prosecutors like, and don't. A public defender will likely take some kind of admission, with probation unless you insist on trial. Your dont want that. 
Self defense and self defense of others is an affirmative defense. The case ought to be dismissed outright. Also, if he takes a deal he may be setting himself up for civil liability. 
There's a zero percent chance that charges will be reversed, where your husband is the victim and the other guy gets booked for assaulting him so get that out of your head. 
Ive been a criminal all my life. I've been a Defense lawyer for 15 years.
Pick him up when he gets released and be there to support him until he gets the charges dropped. Not much else to do.
He assaulted the guy. Have the woman done that it would’ve been self-defense. Unfortunately just because you see somebody getting the shit beat out of them and then think that you’re helping you can get in trouble for that.
Shouldn't you be working this out with a lawyer than posting and waiting for unqualified strangers opinions?
Sounds like the crime he committed is assault, but I think it was justified.
Who beats a guy with a phone? Just use your fists. Are you sure he's not a closet homosexual
Dv and battery that will be dropped when they hear the story it's will be fine
What state are you in? Self defense varies
3% chance he gets assault with a weapon but can get it thrown out if charged should be okay tho
Call a lawyer.  No internet advice. Get legal representation for him stat!
those court fees are gonna be crazy💀 i really hope ur friend is paying half or something because the court legit might not side with ur husband dude
Mayweather when juneweather walks in
Nothing. The police didn’t see what happened so your husband was arrested. He went a little overboard smashing the person in the face with a phone instead of just stopping him from hurting the woman then calling the police
Imagine beating your gf only to get a taste of your own medicine and then having the guy who dealt it charged.
Police will take people in under these circumstances just to maintain the peace.  Doesn't mean he'll be charged with anything, especially when you and your gf give statements attesting to him defending her from grievous bodily harm..
Yeah, most likely if the witnesses well you know, say something the prosecutor won't bring a case against him.
Sadly, self-defense is a defense. They might press charges against him but if so he has a good defense. He might have to fight an uphill battle, but any Judge or jury that hears why he did what he did will understand. With that being said the first thing you should do is figure out how to pay the bail/bond.
I think they will drop charges against your bf.  He was defending someone.  😱
What kind of friends do you have that involves police during a fight? 
He's doing time, fined and/or anger management classes and community service
Lawyer up, tell him to not talk to the cops without his attorney present.
Unfortunately sometimes the abused woman will side with her bf in cases like this.
Dang he fuckin the friend ? Lmfai
Shoulda hit the guy with a fist instead of a phone, would have been cheaper.
Good for him, get a lawyer please and stay with that good man.
Yeah you can’t beat someone because they pushed someone down and were mean to them.   As your mother momma  used to say. “Two wrongs don’t make a right “.   

I’m guessing there is more to the story .  He has the right to pull the guy off the girl or separate  them using force necessary.    He can’t beat a guy
What state are you in? It matters..
Um…. Perhaps a slight over reaction but his intentions were good.
Tell your friend she needs to break off your man with s ok some hawk tuah
All actions have consequences, even good actions. Welcome to life!
Pray you have video of this interaction or your husband may be fucked
I’m confused, what did he do wrong?
If he hasn’t had any recent priors….. and isn’t a convicted felon then he may be let out with a warning. States regular rules according to population….. if he peat the guy to a severe point….. he could be facing a court hearing. If it’s close to the guy being in a coma ….. it’s going to be difficult to defend. 

Have your friend write a report against him and file it at the police station. Use it….. these things don’t happen over night. She is probably used to it. Will she go back?
Don't tell the cops anything more than you already have and get a lawyer
Get a lawyer, and watch Transformers One when you get a chance
Because he became the aggressor so off he goes
Fuck the police and do not talk to them.
He's probably going to catch an assault charge. Regardless of the situation unfortunately
As someone who recently went to jail, it all depends really. If the friend presses charges, he could be looking at an assault charge regardless of defending someone especially if he beat the friend badly, like needing a hospital visit bad. However if he decides to go down that route, it would help your husband if the girlfriend of said friend attests on his behalf but then she would have to be okay with her boyfriend going to jail for DV and facing a DNC order placed (these are automatically placed in DV cases) so all depends really. An assault charge will more than likely be charged against your husband, but get a lawyer as always
It will end up being reduced to a minor infraction and he will get probation.
Hopefully he keeps his mouth shut.
Get a lawyer
So did the boyfriend press charges on your husband? Do u know who called the police and what his actual charges are? The law gets tricky when it comes to assaults but it depends what his actual charges are
Assault with a weapon? Get a lawier
Get better friends.
The crime is you associate yourself with trailer trash.
You do nothing. Your husband gets an attorney.
If what you say is true then they will just release him and he should not be prosecuted.  He was defending a woman that was being assaulted and battered. Defense of others is a valid defense as long as he was using reasonable force and was protecting the victim and not the aggressor.
If your boyfriend used unreasonable force and continued to beat the man when it was no longer necessary then he may be in trouble.  The charge might be assault with a deadly weapon. The deadly weapon being the phone.  Not likely that a prosecutor would take it to trial but it’s possible.
Good man.  As many others have mentioned, don't say a word to the police.  Their job is to lie and manipulate people into incriminating themselves; it's what they're trained to do.  Same for you, don't say shit.
Um if he was doing anything related to defending someone, especially a woman, he will be okay...they just throw people in jail at first usually when violence is involved and they can't quite figure out the cause
Charlie Murphy on Chapel Show might say "what kind of man hits another man with a cellphone"

Seriously WTF? I don't think he will get into too much trouble for the furious cell phone attack.
breathe - it will be fine, just be there when he is released
Defence and protection ends as soon as the violent behaviour stops, so if he pulled him of her, that's where his protection ends, as soon as he attacked the guy, he committed assault. 
Not saying it wasn't an appropriate counter response
u/bot-sleuth-bot
Get a lawyer!
Of course he got arrested. The police can’t just take his word for it, they have to investigate. 

You are arrested ‘on suspicion of’ committing a crime. Once the police have statements from you and your friend I doubt very much that he will be charged. If he is charged then he can argue in court that he did what he did in order to defend your friend— I don’t know what jurisdiction you’re in because you didn’t say, but assuming your boyfriend intervened immediately and didn’t go wildly overboard in beating the guy then that argument is likely to be successful. 

Obligatory IANAL and this is not legal advice.
As glad as I am, rules are rules, and face hits and kicks will give you more time. Try stomach punches next time.
>What do I do???

Feel proud about having a top notch dude. 

Can't help much with legal matters unfortunately. But self-defense (even defense of others) is protected in most countries. And it sounds like you have the evidence and witnesses on your side. I'd bet good money it will be all good.
Lawyer up
Get a lawyer
They probably just want to keep him in their for the night to calm the situation
He will likely be charged with aggravated battery because he used his phone as a weapon. This is a felony. 
The context of this incident will only be relevant in terms of plea opportunities and sentencing. Other factors will also apply, such as previous criminal history, etc.
Be patient and see what the charges are. He will be released in a day or two, make the decision on a lawyer after that.
Are there any camera footage of the incident? I would try to get it. 

He was defending someone. A lawyer should be able to use this fact.
LegalShield is a pretty nifty app.
That's a fine man you got. Be proud he stood up for your friend.
Other than the legal advice,
Chose a keeper.
Honestly,
Good people aren’t always meek.
This man protected somebody.

Thank him for all women.
Don’t even look at a cop without your lawyer
Both you and him need to shut up and get a lawyer.
Sounds like you got a good man, need new friends though..
Things are gonna get bad now.  You thought it was bad before. Now there’s people in place who want women slapped around. It’s not gonna be pretty here. And if you thought police brutality was bad in the past. Well it’s gonna go to a whole new level. This place is sunk.
“Beat his face with this phone”

See I get wanting to hurt him but the law doesn’t allow for that.

Once your boyfriend stopped him from assaulting his girlfriend the threat was over to her and your boyfriend had to stop.

When he continued to beat on him, that’s when he broke the law.

I’m not saying I agree with the law, just explaining to you why he was arrested.

Lawyer up and don’t speak to the police at all.
What state did this happen in ?
“Beat his face with this phone”. I’m guessing this is why ?
Worst double date ever.


Anyway, lawyer up, don't say a word to the cops til you do.
I got 6 years in prison because i threw a phone at someones face. They charged me with assault with a deadly weapon. Lol. California.
9/10 times, literally nothing will happen. Unless your friend presses assault charges, to which point, even an intern at a public law office will get him off scot free.
If you are in the US he needs to retain a lawyer immediately and not discus this any further with anyone else.

If the facts are as posted this is pretty clear cut self defense especially if the friend will back your story.  If this gets into he-said/she said it can get ugly fast.
Lawyer up and sue them.
Sound's like excessive violence to me. I mean, I get it and I don't blame him but...
Sounds like he would have been better off letting that guy beat her face in. Gotta love how our system works
Happened to a friend as well. A lawyer is best to talk to
Did the boyfriend get arrested as well? Does your friend have bruises or cuts that you have photos of? Did she get medical treatment? Those records will really help your husband’s case of self-defense or defense of another. And what everyone else has said. Only talk to your lawyer, whether that’s a private one or a public defender.
Lawyer up
Two wrongs don’t make a right
Why wouldn’t have the friends boyfriend been arrested for domestic violence?  Could have explained that to the officers and they could have maybe filed the assault case on your boyfriend , depending on the injury sustained and he used a phone , he could be looking at an assault with deadly weapon charge (pc 245) for using an item to cause great bodily injury .
Follow the Goodfellas rule !
1) never rat on your friends
2) don’t talk to the cops 
3)  hire a lawyer
Relax. Your husband should plea not guilty and ask for a continuance from the arraignment. He can ask for a public defender that day. Hopefully he will be reeased if he has no priors or u will have to pay a bail…see a bail bonds company. 

Do not hire an attorney from an internet advertised law firm. They are law firms that use salespeople versed in criminal law to hype you up and get you to pay exorbitant fees and they keep 80% and pay a low level attorney 20% to just have your husband plead guilty or no contest. Go to an individual criminal lawyer with his own brick and mortar office.
Maybe delete this post after you get the answers you need.
Close your mouth and lawyer up!
I’m a retired LEO & he was defending your friend. The charge is most likely assault. Just because he was arrested doesn’t mean he is guilty of assault. The only problem he may face is because he beat him w a phone. 

Get an attorney! Don’t try to go to court w o one because the prosecution will take advantage for a conviction. But an defense attorney can make the case of defending your friend. We are allowed to defend ourselves & someone in need like your friend. 

The other guy should have been arrested for domestic violence also. If not you need to get your friend to pursue charges. 

Anyway get an attorney it’s the only way he’ll get out of this situation. UpdateMe!
For sure get a lawyer, from my understanding, there is a thing such as proxy self defense, so he was defending someone who couldn’t defend themselves. If you could get pictures or proof of your friend being hurt, it would probably go a long way. But at least your husband’s conscience is clear for doing the right thing, just sucks he went to jail.
You and he need to only know one word..LAWYER! Say it with me, LAWYER. As I tell anyone who ever deals with police, shut the F up and say only 1 word...LAWYER! Got it? LAWYER!
kiss your husband goodbye, and start a fund for a lawyer and go fund me for bills 💸
Start an only fans page
Your lawyer won't discuss anything over the phone. He will visit in person or in the court room.
Next time. Call the police and mind your own business. Your friend won’t pay for your lawyer fees and probably will be fucking that dude in a week.
Get a lawyer and hopefully your husband shut up and didnt talk his self into trouble… can and will be used against you
Hmm, I feel the self defence line was crossed after he started beating his face with an iPhone. We crossed from self defence to life lesson pretty quickly lol
STAND YOUR GROUND AND GOOD LUCK!
And make sure he does not discuss the details of his case with anyone without consulting his lawyer. Oh, and jail calls are usually recorded. The best thing you and he can do is keep silent, even if you think your statements will be helpful.
Also DO NOT TRUST YOUR FRIEND 

Most of the time people like her will side with her boyfriend that beat her over the person trying to save her. She will most likely sell your husband out. DO NOT TRUST HER you could screw your husband over big time.
Make this the top comment asap. (Not mine, the parent comment about getting a lawyer)

If you're guilty, you need a lawyer. 

If you're innocent, you REALLY need a lawyer.
Don’t talk about anything that happened if you speak on the phone when he’s in jail.
100% this
Everyday is shut the fuck up friday!
Everyone says don't talk to the police or the authority- I was innocent and not doing so delayed them figuring out I was innocent for 7 months.  With "great" attorneys.  

Everyone also says don't get a guardian ad litem.  But otherwise my daughter doesn't have a voice.  

I'm not sure this is sound advice. 

Also with attorneys - you're one of a bunch of cases they have.  It's all about billable hours. Not winning. 

Clearly I'm damaged.
And even then, still don’t talk to the police lol. Let your lawyer do all of that
Better call Saul.
Seriously. Police are there to make sure they don't have to do more paperwork. 

THEY WILL FUCK YOU AND HIM OVER FOR NO REASON IF YOU TALK TO THEM. YES, EVEN THE REALLY KIND ONES.
OP, I know you’re in solution mode right now but I just want to echo this. Your husband is an absolute hero & I really hope justice prevails in your favour.
Can you imagine how bad the abuse is at home if he did this in public 😔

OPs husband really did something good here, hoping this is her wake-up call.
I'm sorry, and I know that feeling. My ex was strangling me on a sidewalk one night in a residential area. A car came down the street and I was so hopeful they'd stop or it would at least scare him into stopping. Neither of those things happened. He actually ridiculed me for thinking anyone would help me. He could see the hope and desperation in my eyes when they drove past. He would often throw that incident in my face to remind me no one would help me. I ended up having to be the one to save myself. He's facing criminal charges in two counties now for what he's done to me.
I know you must have felt so alone when you were going through your abuse. But truthfully, it is so hard to help people before they are ready. I've been on the other side. I've taken abused women into my home only for them to sneak out to meet the abuser. One sent money to her abuser when she couldn't afford to pay me anything while staying with me. I've gotten a black eye and been threatened by men, whom these people I cared for went back to afterwards. So I've seen what happens when you try to help, but the woman won't press charges. I have an elder in my family whose grandson is threatening her. Other family members called the authorities,  but they questioned her in his presence and she wouldn't say anything 1) because she doesn't her only grandson to go to prison and 2) because he frightens her and 'what if they don't take him or let him out'. My brother paid for a friend to live in a hotel for a month. She did nothing during that time to try to find a way to make it. She just talked to her boyfriend the whole month and just moved back with him on the promise that he'd not hit her again. He did.

All that to say: in a lot of cases, more people want to help, but we can't because it can put us in danger for someone who isn't ready to leave. And we can use all our resources to help in vain.
Glad you got out.  Unfortunately I’ve read of cases where people defended victims of abuse and then almost went to jail because the victim backed up the abuser when he said they attacked her.  Be careful.
Time to buy this man a new iPhone.
And get a lawyer
He got out and was asked to come back in January but the lawyer said the lawyer can go in place and it will end there. 7k gone
[removed]
Yes
Talk to her and remind her that pressing charges is really important and if she drops them your husband is more at risk.  Many people being abused end up dropping all charges because they get coerced.
OP, This is the best answer. You have a GREAT husband. Please thank him for me. 

Get him the best attorney possible. Good luck to you.
Good news, she did so that should help the husband claim defense 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/wvQUxcL4jB
The important distinction is,  your response must be responsive and proportional -- use of force laws do not allow the 'defender' to escalate the scenario.  You can use the force necessary to stop the threat of harm to yourself or another person - but once you have stopped the threat, if you continue to beat the offender, you become the offender yourself.

This may very well be the point that has OP's husband sitting in jail.
Anger management and AA would be implying that you are aware you did something wrong. It was defense of another and you feared for her life. You don't need anger management for that.
Just a note here, based on the state, battery is not in the state law but would be considered assault.

Good Samaritan law might actually be flexed a bit here as the girl might have been in peril or a spot where death or severe injury could have happened.
But he was defending someone
you have zero clue if OPs husband will go to jail for assault. You have no idea if charges will be filed by the victim and even if he does, that doesn’t mean the he will be prosecuted.
OP this is really important - the *vast majority* of the time men who interfere in domestic violence get sold down river by the woman they were ‘saving’. 

Do not trust your friend here. Do not do things assuming she will cooperate with you or try to help your husband. The under over is that she will actively try to ruin his life for interfering.
That sucks.
This. Find witnesses, get video footage if available.
This is the right answer. Don’t talk to him about what happened at the jail or on the jail phone. If the charges aren’t dismissed at the first appearance, get a lawyer.
I hope it is.
He got arrested too but he had pretty bad damage so he went to the hospital
This!  Including dates/times/witnesses and any detail, even minor.
I like to carry early 1980s ‘brick’ ‘phones the better to batter people.
She’ll side with the dickhead bf, thinking she had it coming and the op’s bf “over reacted”
Her boyfriend was trying to reach for a knife that he had in his bag
Absolutely. Do not talk at all over those phones.
As a correctional officer- they are always recorded. ALWAYS.
About the only thing you can say is "He was beating and kicking her on the ground,  I was acting in self defense i thought he was going to kill her right there."
Was the whole thing recorded? It can get the husband out immediately.
I had a friend call me from jail one time and asked if I needed some weed when she gets out. It's hidden in her car and the cops never found it.

Boy did that car get trashed before she got it back.

RIP Kiddo you were fun while you lasted. (killed in an wreck while running from the cops for check fraud 23 years old)
It’s too late more than likely, if he was in jail he was probably already mirandized and interviewed before getting there.
correction..... jail calls are ALWAYS recorded
Yes, this can happen. Make sure to do your best to help your husband after all your friend could very well place loyalty to her abuser regardless of events. Especially if she lives with this guy and he's who makes the income - that'd be why she deals with it. She would do it thinking she's looking after herself. 

Bottom line is don't come unprepared and in turn leaving your husband unprotected. There are things you do in life and even when you do the right thing the law may act against you and determine you were wrong. So essentially be careful and mindful.
The number of people convicted based on information from jailhouse calls is staggering. 

Especially when they start confessing right after the “this call can be recorded” statement.
The problem with self defence (or defence of others) is that you want to phrase your statements very carefully.

Often people let adrenaline take over and continue hitting the other person even though they ceased to be a threat.

Then it makes all the difference in the world how you phrased your statement. You have to somehow explain how you thought they remained a threat, a lawyer can be vital for that.

Although you are correct, shitty lawyers may push for a plea bargain to save time. If they continue to insist on a plea bargain, I would recommend finding a different lawyer, as even a plea bargain that involves no jail time may thoroughly ruin your life.
Your individual case may be an outlier but it's overwhelmingly good advice.

Source: come from a family with multiple LEOs and a fair number of crooks.  Both have given me that advice.  Don't talk without a lawyer.
Yeah except she probably got her ass beat even worse she got home. Unless the woman leaves right when that happens stuff like that can make it soo much worse. Trust me, source is my life lol.
Sounds like he needs one of those Nokia brick phones... they can take and *give* a beating.
I think every dude in this chat knows what he should get when he gets home 😏
>Make it sound more like someone who is familiar with the situation.

I, too, am a human who has experienced imprisonment by those employed to uphold laws of humans. 

Nailed it ChatGPT
what in the ChatGPT 🤣
Spoiler - this entire comment was written by AI in an effort to make it look like a human was using AI and made a human error.  They are becoming sentient.
I hope this is a real flub because this is hilarious.
Awesome! That will help alot with your boyfriend. I am no lawyer but he def did the right thing.
Do not trust her, and do not talk about this with her.  she will be a witness for the boyfriend, guaranteed.
Ask her to take some photos of her bruises, it will help build a case against her abuser.
Did she accept him back?
she is going to do that,  which is why she can not talk to her about it.
But that's not how it works. Every day people can't press charges. Only prosecutors can press charges. 

Do you mean that she should put pressure on police and prosecutors to do that? If so, I totally agree. If not, let's please provide accurate info so victims know what they can actually do.
lol.  that's why lawyers are important,  there is no set value what force is necessary.  You could easily argue if he is moving,  he is a threat.
Yepppp. Exactly how this reads. If the guy is such a pussy that he beats women, then he definitely stops when a man hits him. But when the other man continues to beat him, then they’re both guilty. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Most states barely have a self-defense law, next to none, if any, have a defense of another person. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter, my husband ended up going to jail for a chunk of time for doing the same thing when he was younger.
It is called "Defense of others".

Discuss with an attorney.
Don’t get legal advice from Reddit

Hire an attorney. In the meantime make sure you don’t talk to the police or anyone about what happened.
If your friend isnt pressing charges on her BF for domestic violence they law may be like defending who?
I know, but the law works in funny ways
It was defense of others. A different justification. You get him from jail, get an attorney that specializes in defending battery.
It will be up to a judge to determine whether the assault was justified to drop the charges. The answer is probably, but if police had to get involved, this is how things play out
You guys need a lawyer not Reddit. Stop wasting your time here and call a lawyer
Some places has a "reasonable defense" law but I don't think that applies here. 

Basically you can only match someone's violence and only go as far as needed to incapacitate them.

What happened to the assaulter? Was he taken away too? Regardless you need to get a lawyer and your friend and raise hell at the police station.
Her husband is already in jail, according to the title of the post. OP said they didn't know why. The commenter  suggested looking at the charge papers to see details about charges. Seems logical.
Also if the friend drops the charges. Cut all contact with her.
I heard that Apple doesn’t cover using the device in self defence
Freaking awesome.
Wtf is wrong with your friend dating someone like that??


Not trying to victim blame here... but there's no way this happened "out of the blue" and the guy was a saint before.
The presence of a knife may provide enough justification for his actions; depending on how it works in your area, he could even be released without charges. You don’t need to rush out and get a lawyer right this second, but your husband should definitely speak to one prior to speaking to police or prior to any potential trial.
Fine to say "I'm getting you a lawyer, don't talk to anyone".
Curious, if talking to your lawyer over that phone wouldn’t that violate lawyer-client privilege?
Also a correctional officer here, maybe it’s different where OP is but if he was arrested by the police, and they say he will be released tomorrow, he probably isn’t at the jail or correctional facility he’s probably
Just in holding at the police station, will be charged and given a notice to appear and released. But heck ya still going to be recorded
Defense of others, not self defense.
>RIP Kiddo you were fun while you lasted. (killed in an wreck while running from the cops for check fraud 23 years old)

Was she mentally unstable?
I was today-years-old when I found out that the British spell it “Defence” and US spells it “defense”
He'd be in for manslaughter if he had one of those!
They got updated and released this year with 4g so it is possible. Even comes with snake lol
I think you need to ask Mike tyson to do a commercial
😂 emphasiiiiis
Dude this lady was just assaulted by her boyfriend. And the man who rescued her is married. Your a savage.
Jarvis, write me a blurb to make me seem like a compassionate human being. Add a sentence where i talk about balls
Are we reaching the point of being unable to even interact online without curating ourselves through AI?
Not the twist I expected, but I'm here for it.
This! I would distance myself until the case is over with.
If she hasn’t already.
In every use for force class I've ever been in, they've spent considerable time discussing this very topic.

When it comes to situations like these, what "you" say doesn't matter.  The legal definition is often "would a reasonable person, in a similar situation, respond in the same manner" - and if it comes to it, the prosecution may take a stop-action approach "At this precise moment in time, would a reasonable person believe a threat still exists?"

It really can turn into a frame-by-frame "is there still a threat?  How about now?  Now?" type situation - and if a pool of reasonable persons (the jury) believes at any moment the threat is gone and you continue to act......you are no longer the good guy in the scenario.
Is it covered if you accidentally drop it on someone's face?
There are specific phones that aren’t recorded that are meant for that situation. Usually though it’s a private booth you (with a piece of glass/polycarbonate separating us) and your client can talk without being recorded.
They have specific phones in a different location that are use to speak to legal representation. It is called 'Privileged Communication.'  
They have to set up/request an appointment and they will be escorted to the phone, the Officer will then step away to provide them privacy whilst still in eye-sight.  
  
\*Edited to add- Those phone lines are not recorded- though it is noted down the time they Begin/End and who the inmate was known to have spoken too.
When you speak to your lawyer by phone the guards take you a different room and use a different phone, sincerely——A felon who’s been there.
In the USA defense of others is still an assertable defense
Probably more severe.   It's hard to get manslaughter
he was hinting at recieveing it from his wife, not the friend who was being beaten.
I'm a bot and I'd still take a bj from the wife and the friend
I've been using A.I. RP for about a month and realized that I've started talking to people in real life the way I talk to bots.

I asked a lady how her day was and if she was free for the weekend, and she walked off real fast.

There was a deep urge to rewind the conversation and I literally asked again "how was your day" like what the fuck 😂 it didn't rewind.
No lol. That person is.
I’d be careful distancing.  This could actually cause the friend to rely on her abusive ex if her support pulls away.  I would definitely definitely realize she is unreliable and should not be trusted with any sensitive information.
Maybe if it falls repeatedly on said persons face
Although even then they *can* be recorded with a warrant.  Hard to get and extremely unlikely for this type of case but can happen.
At my facility we don't have anything like that, they only have face to face meetings or video chat near our control room.
Yes. 

But it's called *defense of others* and not *self defense*

He wasn't defending himself. He was defending someone else... which is a completely legal defense, but if you tell a court it was *self defense* when in fact it was *defense of others* it can cause confusion, which could lead to an incorrect conviction.
Yes, it just isn't self defense, it's defense of others
Especially when attacking someone with a clear weapon
And that is where the joke comes in.
Whoosh
Fkn dying lmfao. I can imagine her briskly walking away, checking back over her shoulder to see if you’re chasing after her. Fuck lol
Come back here and let me love you!!!!
Doesn't hurt to ask.

I hope there's no charge against OP husband. I'm sure it was an accident. I think the phone has a mind of his own.

I hope her friend doesn't go back to her abuser. Sadly, most of them do.
Ok, I misunderstood.  In some countries it's explicitly not a defense which is what I thought you meant.  

But yeah your right, a great example of why your lawyer should do the talking
Top rope, id give you gold if i fcould
Threesome..
🏃‍♀️wait sorry!!!🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️excuse me ma’am, how was your day???🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️FUCK🧍‍♀️
I’d of used my knees if I were OPs boyfriend or a chair idk phone isn’t really on my list but I found it incredible he did damage with him. Sounds like he’ll get off especially if it’s a 1st offence. People will do whiteness statements which should clear it all up also.
My boyfriend pushed me. Do I leave him?
So, a little backstory: I’ve been with my boyfriend (both 28) for almost two years. Over the last two years, my boyfriend has tended to get really upset over really small things. For example, 
1. Once I got undressed too close to a window on vacation (we were on the top floor of a hotel) and he screamed at me and accused me of wanting other people to see me naked. 
2. One time we were in a different hotel and I guess I said something too loud, and he physically covered my mouth with his hand and had the other hand behind my head which left me unable to speak. 
3. About two months into us dating, we went on a dinner date and had agreed to watch a movie at his house after. I accidentally dozed off on the couch and he got really upset about it. 

Anyway, tonight, I cooked us dinner and he was kinda helping me clean up my kitchen (we do not live together). I asked if he would take the trash out while I finished cleaning, and he said he didn’t feel like it. I ended up taking it out and when I came back inside, I began giving him a hard time, saying “are you actually a man bc I just took the trash out”. This made him really mad and he pushed me hard with both hands. I didn’t fall or anything, but I did stumble backwards. I told him I wanted him to leave my house and he responded that he wouldn’t. I said it at least 3 more times, and then he finally did leave. He texted me “sorry for pushing you” after he left, but I didn’t respond. I think this might be my breaking point. I know this isn’t normal. 

Edit: I really appreciate how supportive everyone in the comments has been. I fully understand that I shouldn’t have said what I did about him “being a man” last night, and I take full responsibility for that. However, I don’t think it was necessary for him to push me in response. I’ve been making excuses for his behavior for way too long and this is my breaking point. The last thing I want is to have children with this man and this be the relationship they grow up seeing. 
He held your mouth closed. Now he shoved you. How long, do you think, until he hits you? How long until he chokes you?
The question isn't whether or not you should leave its whether you should walk away or RUN AWAY.
I've always told my daughters. If a man lays hands on you other than to assist or to love, it's over.

It's a form of control

And no one can control or change another.

Time to call it a day, hon. There are others out there, men that would never dream of doing that.
Yes, you dump him. Men like this only get worse.
You don't have to accept or normalize violence in your life. It will get worse. You need to leave.
Someone putting their hands on you should always be a dealbreaker. 

You can see in your own words how his behavior has escalated. Abusive people tend to get worse. 

When you take them back, you’re showing them that ultimately it’s okay, you haven’t hit your limit yet. 

You can’t have fuzzy boundaries when someone puts their hands in you. 

When I was 18, I got into an argument with my boyfriend, and seeing how angry he was scared me, so I left to walk home. He followed me, grabbed me, and threw me to the ground. I got up and went home. The next morning, the only way I could get out of bed was to roll out, and was in severe pain. I went to the ER, and found out I had whiplash in my neck, and had pulled every muscle in my back. The police were called, but I wouldn’t press charges. 

I took him back after he groveled and cried real tears. A month later, he raised his fist to slug me. I told him that if he hit me I’d press charges for it , and the previous incident, so he put that fist through a wall while I ran. 

I got lucky. He was much bigger than me, and he could have hurt me far worse than before. I never forgot that lesson. 

You deserve better.
No it’s not normal. Your boyfriend’s behavior is a red flag and he is an abuser. Usually men who physically abuse a woman, they start slow, like a push her or a slap there and then over time it gets worse and worse to the point where he is beating the heck out of you. Usually abusers are triggered very easily and almost everything upsets them, even small things. They usually jump to ridiculous conclusions, like where you mentioned your boyfriend accused you of getting undressed because you wanted to be watched by other people while you were naked. He then covered your mouth to prevent you from speaking. These are all signs of a man who is going to be a hardcore abuser. Leave him now. Thank goodness you are not married to him. I’m not sure if you live with him or not but if you do live with him, now is the time to start packing your bags and moving back to your parents home or live with a relative or a friend temporarily. Do you have a job and can support yourself? If not, start looking for a job. Leave this guy because I guarantee you things are going to get worse and he will become more abusive and he could end up killing you as there have been thousands of women who have been killed during a domestic violence dispute. I hope you don’t have children with him because he will abuse them as well. Do you leave him? Yes, absolutely. As soon as possible. Like pack right now and go.
Block him on everything. He is volatile and abusive and this will only escalate. It's already escalating. He is testing your limits to see what you are willing to put up with and if he can push further. I'm speaking from experience. Don't allow it to continue. Leave. Also file a police report for the pushing. They won't do anything, but it will start a paper trail if anything worse happens. Be sure to tell trusted friends and family as well so they know the situation and can check up on you if need be.
The question should not be whether you leave him or not, but *how* you tell him instead.

I recommend sending a very formal text or email similar to as follows:
> We are done. You shoved me, then refused to leave. I refuse to be abused, especially in my own home. Don't ever contact me again. Any attempt will be considered harassment.

Then you refuse to message him ever again. If you have stuff at his house, arrange to get them by another person or when he's not home. Another option is to have the local PD do a domestic escort (it varies by municipality). Or write them off as gone. If he messages you or if he calls you, you ignore it. If he escalates from there, you involve law enforcement. ***DO NOT SEE HIM AGAIN***
My ex started with a shove...and then he fractured my left orbital.  Please leave him, honey.  I'm worried for u.
No, stay with him and continue being pushed? Is that what u want us to say? Gurl you know what you should do so do it instead of asking what u already know 🤦‍♀️
I’m old enough to be your dad. If I was and you told me that story, well, I don’t know exactly what, but I don’t think he’d enjoy what happened next.
When you were a young girl imagining the type of man you’d like to be with when you were older…. 

Is this the guy you imagined ?
Girl no! Any one of those three things are relationship ending. But let me show you something... he is testing the waters with how much abuse you will allow. First 1) shaming you for nothing to see if you would allow being degraded. Then 2) starting to get physical and SO controlling. Literally not allowing you to speak?   
And while it wasn't what most people think of as violent, holding your head and covering your mouth.. that is getting physical. Now 3) pushing you. That is straight up assault. Were you rude to him? Yeah kind of. But that NEVER makes assaulting someone OK. Then a "sorry for pushing you"? Oh I forgot the refusing to leave part. If you allow him back, you have told him you might not allow violence yet, ( because you did make him leave) but it is not a deal breaker for you so he can do it, lame ass 'sorry', and carry on. I know Reddit is famous for saying "divorce" and "break up". But get away from him while you still can.
Good love is given with kind words and gentle nudges to greatness. If he does more than that, it's always leave. The person you will be in 6 months or a year will thank you for having the courage to set your boundaries and CHOOSE YOU. No man, woman or family has the right to make you feel like you aren't safe or cared for. Especially in your own home.
I don’t even want to read the rest of the explanation. Pushed you = leave him before it gets worse.
>he physically covered my mouth with his hand and had the other hand behind my head which left me unable to speak.

This is the one that I don't like. The others I don't like either because he's escalating his physicality with you. I don't know how to explain to you that none of these are good signs.
He’s showing you his true colors, believe him now that he’s abusive. My ex strangled me and choked me. Took me a few times before I realized I had to stop making excuses for him.
"You can be the biggest bitch in the world and that doesn't give him the right to lay his hands on you" - the officer who handled my domestic violence case.
Yes, you break up immediately and safely. It is good that you don't live together. Involve the police. Install a camera. See if a friend can stay with you for awhile for safety reasons.
It will get worse. I promise you. This shit never gets better. Please take care of yourself. You know what you have to do. And you don’t have to try to get him to understand. That’s a trap. He knows. Ghost him. Seriously. Been there.
It's not going to stop with a push!!!
All 3 points are massive red flags, and this is coming from a fairly leveled headed male whose never laid a finger on a women.
Did you know that you can have a normal and healthy relationship? Because I don’t think this is about him. It’s about how much respect you have for yourself. 

By contrast, my boyfriend would playfully find it hot that I was undressing by a window. He’s told me that he thinks that it’s cute that I talk really loud when I’m passionate. He offers to take out the trash and often does it without me having to ask. 

Don’t settle.
No, this is not good.  It will get worse if you live together.  Even the most mild, easy going couple can get on each other's nerves.  It is how you deal with it that matters.
That’s three strikes. Adios!
Stick around longer and the trauma bonding just sinks deeper.
Leave before it gets worse. He should never lay hands on you when angry under ANY circumstances.
God, please girl, RUN! That is so not okay, it's abusive. I would have left after the second incident, the first one might have been a slip of temperament. Everybody gets a second chance. But covering your mouth because you are talking too loud? Nope.
Get away from this guy. I delt with anger during my life. There was a lot of anger from my household growing up and no communication. 

This is something I have been working on and am alot better now but never have I ever pushed my wife, put my hand over her mouth, never anything remotely close to that, never put a finger on her......ever. 

Get away from this guy. Leave......right now. Huge red flags that MUST not be ignored. Thankfully he is your BF and you didn't mention kids so this is VERY easy to walk away from. Be thankful for that.
If he is like that when you are not living together, I am scared to think what he is like if you did. Dump his ass, might be hard at first but there are some red flags on this hill.
It's starts with pushing ,it ends in tragedy.

As a couple you can argue, scream, cry, whatever ... The moment the man starts to push it's over ... Next time it's a push + slap, then a push + slap + slap ...

Stop this tragedy before it begins ...
\>My boyfriend pushed me. Do I leave him?

Fucking yes. Jesus what the fuck is wrong with people.
That is absolutely not normal. 
I amend you for keeping tabs on all the instances but luckily you see the pattern here. 

Did you talk to him about respecting your boundaries the previous times?
Do NOT stay with him. imagine being married to him, would you be happy? I know you couldn’t be ever fully relaxed in your own home if you has a history of acting like this
You know the answer, I hope you follow through.
Leave him.
Run away, far and fast.
Why are you even doubting leaving when a man puts his hands on you, then refuses to leave! He has a serious problem and you want to stick around to see if it gets worse or not? Yes leave!
Jesus lady, the verbal abuse was bad enough, leave now while it's easy or you'll be walking on eggshells around him the rest of your life, once he moves in.
Yeah, I’d say break up with him. His reactions to things are extreme. (While not being on the more extreme end of things, it’s still in that wheelhouse.
Yes honey, you leave him. He is abusing you and it will undoubtedly escalate. You have described both physical and emotional abuse. 

Please **call an abuse hotline ASAP**. Get advice and resources from them. Where are you? I can give you a hotline number.

I would also advise putting together a **Safety Plan.**

A Safety Plan is a personalised, practical plan that can help you avoid hurtful situations and know the best way to react when things are going badly between you.

This plan includes vital information tailored to your unique situation and will help you prepare for and respond to different scenarios, including telling friends and family about your situation and events as they happen, coping with emotions, and various resources suited to your individual circumstances. 

In your Safety Plan, include information for when you leave him. For instance, include a plan to gather up all important items prior to the split including identification, important documents, all medication, medical records, car permits, and personal items that are important to you and store them somewhere safe. This will help you navigate things when you are emotional and under duress. 

Here are some resources to help you: 

https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/create-your-personal-safety-plan/

https://www.1800respect.org.au/help-and-support/safety-planning/checklist

And those hotlines I gave you can help you create one too.

**What you need to know is that what he did is not normal, it is not okay, and it is not excusable. You are right to feel hurt, scared and betrayed. Trust your gut. Your body’s warning systems are telling you something.**

**“Genuine love means respecting the humanity of the other person, wanting what is best for him or her, and supporting the other person’s self-esteem and independence. This kind of love is incompatible with abuse and coercion.”** - [Lundy Bancroft](https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf)

I’m going to pop some signs of emotional abuse below; because I suspect there’s a lot more abuse going on than you realise. 

**Signs of Emotional Abuse:**

1) **They are Hyper-Critical or Judgmental Towards You**

2) **They Ignore Boundaries or Invade Your Privacy**

3) **They are Possessive and/or Controlling**

4) **They are Manipulative**

5) **They Often Dismiss You and Your Feelings**

Another list:

**Humiliation, negation and criticism - tactics that undermine self-esteem.**

Examples include: 
+ hyper-critical / judgmental towards you
+ insults like calling you stupid, derogatory nicknames / terms of endearment that highlight your weaknesses / things you’re sensitive about, won’t stop when asked; 
+ character assassination (eg: ‘you’re always xyz’) to you or you others about you; 
+ screaming, yelling and swearing to intimidate you; 
+ patronising and belittling you (eg: ‘I know this is beyond your ability to comprehend’); 
+ public embarrassment - picking fights, spilling your secrets or making fun of your shortcomings in public; 
+ insulting your appearance; 
+ belittling your accomplishments; 
+ putting down your interests (because they don’t want you to participate in activities without them); 
+ pushing your buttons - continuing to do the things that annoy/upset you even if you beg them to stop.

**Control and Shame - tactics that manipulate you into doing what they want you to do, often by making you feel ashamed of your inadequacies. controlling everything you do.**

Examples include, trying to control you by:
+ ignoring your boundaries;
+ invading your privacy;
+ behaving in a possessive manner;
+ manipulative behaviour;
+ making threats;
+ monitoring your whereabouts;
+ spying on you (physically, digitally, via others);
+ gaslighting you (which can leave you questioning your own memory, not to mention your mental health and well-being);
+ making all of the decisions;
+ controlling your access to finances;
+ emotional blackmailing (including frequently ‘testing’ you);
+ lecturing you constantly (cataloguing every minor perceived error, monologues of all the ways you’ve fallen short, making it clear that you are beneath them);
+ having frequent outbursts;
+ feigning helplessness;
+ unpredictability (creating a walking on eggshells effect);
+ walking out (eg: of events, unexpectedly);
+ stonewalling you during disagreements or conflicts.

**Accusing, blaming, denial - creating a hierarchy with them on top and you on the bottom.**

Examples include: 
+ jealousy (eg: accusing you of cheating or flirting);
+ guilt-tripping;
+ unrealistic expectations (they expect you to do what they want, when they want you to do it;
+ they think you should always prioritise their needs, do things according to their standards — and you absolutely shouldn’t hang out with your friends or family if there’s any chance they might need you);
+ goading and blaming (goading you into being upset and then blaming you for your reaction), 
+ denying the abuse (and often flipping it into you);
+ dismissive of your feelings / trivialising (eg: if you express your feelings about something they did, they accuse you of overreacting or misunderstanding the situation);
+ blaming you for their problems;
+ destroying and denying (they might destroy or damage important possessions, etc and then deny it or claim it was an accident). 

**Emotional neglect and isolation - they will try to get you to prioritise their needs and neglect your own and they’ll also make an effort to isolate you from your support network, leaving you more dependent on them and less able to contextualise their behaviour.**

Examples include: 
+ dehumanising you (eg: intentionally look away when you’re talking or stare at something else when speaking to you in an effort to make you feel unimportant); 
+ keeping you from socialising; 
+ invalidating you (suggesting or stating that your your needs, boundaries, and desires don’t matter to them); 
+ trying to come between you and your family; 
+ using the silent treatment; 
+ withholding affection (refusing intimate contact if you offend them or refuse to do what they want you to do); 
+ shutting down communication; 
+ actively working to turn others against you (eg: undermining you and your mental health to others, making you seem unstable, turning you into the ‘bad guy’, etc); 
+ interrupting (your talk, your activities, etc. - forcing your attention on them); 
+ disputing your feelings (insisting you shouldn’t feel that way). 

Please note that your partner might not do all of these things; but if he is doing some of them, that is emotional abuse.

Please be safe. You need to get out ASAP. It can be hard. It might take time and multiple tries; but you can do it. **You are not alone.** Chin up.
Leave him. His behaviour is slowly escalating and he is not a safe person to be around.
only read the first point and that was more than enough
Uh, Sis, this dude has been laying hands on you. Get out. It will only get worse
Dude sounds violent. You better get out now.
YO LEAVE THIS MAN HE IS AN ABUSER THIS WILL ONLY GET WORSE. WAKE UP HOME GIRL.
🚩🚩🚩🚩🏃🏼‍♀️‍➡️🏃🏼‍♀️‍➡️🏃🏼‍♀️‍➡️🏃🏼‍♀️‍➡️🏃🏼‍♀️‍➡️
It is normal for couples to occasionally argue. Your boyfriends behaviour is not normal. 

You are in an abusive relationship. 

You probably shouldn't have said he wasn't a man because he was too lazy to take out the trash, but that is  a normal thing couples argue about and your comment has probably been said millions of times by millions of partners. Being shoved or hit for that is not an appropriate response. 

Please leave the relationship. Do not engage with him when he says he wants to talk or check you are OK as he will worm his way back in. 

Go full no contact and if required get a restraining order or whatever your local equivalent is. 

Tell your friends or parents what has been going on and seek support from them. 

If he has belongings at your house, ask a friend to go with you to drop them at his parents or friends. Even better, have them shipped. Do not see him again or put yourself in a situation where you may run into him alone. 

He is going to try and be super apologetic and the best boyfriend in the world for the next 2 to 4 weeks, then it will start again. It will always start again.
He’s treated you badly since you started dating and now it’s escalating. He will hit you next. This is not normal behaviour and you shouldn’t put up with it. There is no point trying to talk to him or try to get him to understand your feelings because he thinks this is acceptable behaviour. It’s not.
He's abusive and it will only get worse. You should leave.
You listed multiple reasons, I think you know the answer. But if you don’t it’s definitely leave him cuz this is abuse
Wow I'm a man and I can get angry when I shouldn't and I'm working on it but putting his hand over your mouth was a major red flag. Now he's pushing you too? Please don't go on any longer. It's only two years and you'll find someone else. Life is too short to waste the rest of it with him.
Yeah, girl. Leave him. It doesn't start big.
Run for the hills and never look back
It only gets worse. Run.
I didn't even have to read this in its entirety. RUN.
As someone who has been there in that same situation with the same jealous type of a man I’m going to say it started with a shove . Then throwing things at me . Then dragging me and finally grabbing me by the neck and choking me . Last thing he did was punch me in the face for saying he loved his ex he had just cheated on me with and later denied it saying it was just a “slap” . My entire face was bruised and swollen . My kids seen it happen . That’s where I drew the line . Don’t let it get to that please . I’m telling you it only gets worse .
Yes, the answer is yes.   
Why would you stay with someone who physically assaults you?
Yes.  Today.  Don’t wait for more!
Saying "Are you actually a man" isn't that bad at all, nowhere near getting physical with you. He must have a fragile ego to get that upset for that cause, yes, he should have been helping you clean up and not treating you like a maid, making you do everything for him. Only children make their gf/wife do everything for them. Run girl
I don’t have to read past the headline. Yes. Leave him and never look back.
Dump him!
Don't settle. You want someone who won't do these things, so find them
I'm not sorry for what I'm about to say.

Please look at this little string of red flags, and call it what it is... A bunting of red flags. 

As others have said, what else are you willing to overlook to keep the peace and how long can the peace be kept for by an emotionally immature ass hat?! His actions will only ever get worse. Because that IS how it starts.

This man should think about therapy to deal with his emotions and his issues. He needs to do that himself and it is not your job to fix him. 

Please set yourself free of this. Leave him. And please be safe whilst doing so. You don't necessarily know how breaking up with him will cause him to behave. But you do need to break up with him because this behaviour isn't healthy. So please make sure you're not sharing your location with him and that you have places of safety for yourself.
So then leave. This isn’t rocket science. The only logical progression is that his behavior will escalate physically.
If you stay with him, it's telling him you are willing to put up with abuse. I was in a very abusive relationship for years. It slowly escalated, he was pretending to be a good person until I got pregnant. Then he would yell at me, use his forearm to pin me up against walls. He choked me and I got out because I knew Id probably be dead after that. I didn't stay that long for him, his mom was sick and we had grown close. It was a bad situation, and looking back I had options  I was just stuck in a state of fear. What I'm saying is, you deserve more. Find someone who does the same amount of work as you, that won't take advantage of your kindness. Good luck, and please get a camera for your place if you don't have one.
Please split up with him safely - perhaps with someone else in the house or in a public place. And if he has keys to your house change the locks before you tell him in case he refuses to give them up. Good luck and well done for making a brave call.
Why do you need to even ask this. Break it off immediately. It's only going to get worse.
Time to leave. The red flags are definitely there. It’s only going to escalate. Get out before you have to get carried out
From angry to screaming, and then go to pushing, if you keep going, it gonna be punching, last thing you know it. Better run girl
His behaviour seems to be escalating - and all of those actions are bright red flags. The increased physical aspects will eventually lead to full on physical assault.

Get out, you deserve to feel safe in your relationships
It doesn't matter what you did (backstories), asked (trah out) or said (being a man), his actions bring two things to mind, the first being he is a very controlling individual, it is his way or the highway, the second being if these are his responses to minor issues, what is going to happen when you have a serious disagreement? My advice? Change the locks, unfriend him and block his number.
>I fully understand that I shouldn’t have said what I did about him “being a man” last night, and I take full responsibility for that. **However, I don’t think it was necessary for him to push me in response.** 

Correct... perhaps maybe you shouldn't have said what you said, but DO NOT AT ALL let others try to convince you that you "asked for it" or that his reaction or behavior is somehow your fault because of what you said. IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. This is exactly how people get stuck in cycles of abuse. Get out. Tell a trusted friend or family member what's happened. Look for support. You can do this.
Leave.
Yes leave him. And ensure you are safe. Seems like he's the type to come back and take "revenge" for breaking things off. He can get violent and finish his anger on you. 

If he has keys, take it back or change locks, if he continues to call/text you.. change numbers. Avoid going anywhere alone. Ensure your friends know about this situation.
What comes next? A slap or punch.  Maybe a kick?  Get rid of him!  It only gets worse.
RUNNN
You are not good for each other.

Trying to emasculate a person because they didn't do what you wanted? That is cruel and toxic.

Pushing you was also disrespectful and crossed the physical boundaries.

Neither of you seems to value each other. A relationship should be about loving someone and wanting to become your best self for them.
Please inform your family and friends of all this and safeguard your welfare by breaking up with him. Inform the authorities if he threatens or attempts to harm you further.


---

I think women need to look in the mirror and ask themselves 'why do I attract but more importantly choose to date and tolerate abusers?'

Although seen as nerds etc. Nice guys do exist, choose one of them.
Well obviously he is controlling, jealous, and has no issues putting his hands on you. Your taunts don’t help but that would come from a place of frustration.

Two years in and it’s like this? What about 5 years? 10?

Please leave before you end up with a black eye or worse.
Babe, the more you put up with, the more it escalates. Right now it was a shove, tomorrow it would be a punch. Just don’t. Always leave at the first sign of abuse.
RUN!!!!   Run, run, run.   This is only the beginning.   RUN!!!
I can't tell you how to do it but run like you're life depends on it. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times. He will stalk you.
I don’t think your joke was even that bad. His behavior however is disrespectful and disgusting. You don’t deserve to be bullied by a man that never matured past 3rd grade. Please stay safe.
Very immature.  Honestly, breaking up with him might be a beneficial trigger helping him grow.  Not that you owe him anything.  I'm thinking, it seems like the best thing for you and might be the best outcome for him.
I didn’t even have to read this, based on the title alone. Yes, leave. Don’t even tell him, just ghost the dude. 
RUN!! DON'T WALK 🚩🚩🚩


That guy will kill you one day. Get away from that asap!
NTA 

I would file a report with police about how he refused to leave when you asked him to so they have it on file because a man like this isn't going to "let" you leave him...and with that report, you already have proof that he is a problem which will help you if you need to get a restraining order from him.
Those are all major red flags. You deserve better.
Him pushing you is not the first time he put his hands on you. The first time he covered your mouth and then he pushed you, which is progression. Unfortunately I feel like if you stay, it’s only going to continue to progress. No one has a right to put their hands on you in anyway. Show yourself the respect that he doesn’t and that relationship. You don’t want to look back and say you should’ve left before things got worse. I’m really sorry this happened.
You’re in a toxic relationship do yourself a favor and get out.  The more we tolerate the worse it gets especially when they have a temper. Wishing you the best❤️
If you ask the question it's already a sign that it's time to leave. Take care of yourself and please go away
Hi. Dude here. 
Go. Go fast and don’t take him back.
Yeah, none of this sounds good. I'd abandon ship as soon as possible.
He’s definitely an abusive asshole, but sounds like a fitting pair for someone who is going to insult someone’s masculinity when they don’t do what you want. Leave him and work on yourself.
This is a slippery slope that looks like it's only going to get worse. The writing is on the wall sis, you already know what to do.
I see your edit,  and I can appreciate how wrong what you said was,  but there should be nothing you say to illicit that response.  No physical response is appropriate. Also,  so many red flags outside of that issue.
Bruh, LEAVE

I just turned 28 last week. I'm a guy, and would never do that to my woman. 

Find someone who treats you with respect. This relationship sounds toxic AF.
I’m curious, did you try the mental exercise of reading this back and pretending this was your best friend posting this? Because you should have left him at #1. 

I’d also encourage you to realize you have likely fallen into toxic behaviors due to how bad the relationship is, and work on them with a therapist before your next relationship. Saying “are you a man” because he didn’t take the trash out one time is pretty verbally abusive. He’s 10x worse by physically abusing you, but it might be wise to really try to understand if you’ve learned negative behaviors from the relationship.
Yes. It will not get better. Your understanding and forgiveness will cost you your self respect and self esteem. Leave now while you still have it.
Yes.

But frankly, if he was posting "My girlfriend said I'm not a man because I didn't take the trash out" I'd be counseling him to leave you too. You both sound awful.
Why did you keep dating this loser after the first incident?

Have some self-respect, FFS.
Lol, you're a jerk for questioning his manhood over taking out the trash. But, he's an abusive asshole for laying hands on you. His mask is beginning to slip and I think you're aware. This isn't a joke, he's escalating and you should get out while you still can. He apologized this time, but next time it will be your fault for making him hurt you.
You should leave.

However I want to be clear. You questioning his manhood because he wouldn't do what you wanted is abusive and you shouldn't do shit like that going forward.
Guy's a dick but "are you actually a man" is an unnecessarily sexist comment, so close to male mental health month.
Obviously. What the hell do you think is gonna happen when your his wife
It’s time to go. It doesn’t get better. 

Show him who’s boss.
Get out while it’s this mild.
Yes, end things with him. Make a clean and firm break.
leave him. its only going to escalate from here
You should absolutely leave him.
Leave.
Yes
You have two options: check out Amanda Nunes on YouTube,  if you can train to be like her, stay with this insecure narcissistic jerk,  else run as this will end very violently and some big medical bills
Too many red flags. Girl RUN!!!

Honestly you should've done it a long ago. You still have time tho. So leave that guy asap
Honestly , talk to him and make it clear that if he doesn't deal with his anger issues then ur gonna breakup . It's not worth it to be this compromised
No this is definitely a lot of red flags. If this is how he acts now it won't get any better. For the sake of your safety get away from this dude.
I’ve been with my wife 12 years. I’ve only really yelled at her once, and I’ve never put a hand on her. That is not normal at all. Run.
Run for your life sis! He's no good. 

When a man's hand is faster than his words when in anger, it's a matter of time before having a black eye or even worse.
No, that is abuse. He is controlling and abusive and it's only going to get worse.
Why are you with someone that seems that kind of mentally ill?
YES. Immediately.
Not normal; this is abuse

I’m glad you left him, plz cut all contact and change your number.

This only escalates from here. you have no kids and no ties to him…
You’re in a dangerous situation. His behavior isn’t just controlling; it’s abusive. You can’t ignore the fact that he pushed you. If I were you, I’d cut ties with him immediately. This isn’t about love or fixing things; it’s about your safety and well-being. Reach out to friends or family for support, and consider talking to a professional about what’s been happening. Don’t let him back in. You deserve better than this.
Leave and FADT!!!
girl. How could anyone advise you to stay? He sounds horrible.
It isn’t going to get better only worse. End it and never ever look back. Next time (hopefully there isn’t) when someone act like that leave them after point 1.
Leave that man. Any man who puts his hands on you won’t hesitate to do it again, and with more force.

When I ask my boyfriend to take out the trash, he does, and the right man will for you. I’m sorry.
Leave
From your examples, he is showing an escalation of violence, and these are just the ones you've shared. Started verbal, moved on to actually touching you when he covered your mouth, and now he is forcefully pushing you. You don't want to be there for the next escalation. There are over 8 billion people on this planet, there's someone out there for you that will respect you and never even think about laying a finger on you.
Run. Don’t look back.
The fact she has to ask strangers if they should break up is scary. Should she stay we know where this will end up. Pregnant and isolated or……the other alternative
I would have dumped after the hotel incident!
Today he pushed you, tomorrow you're in the hospital getting your jaw wired up and eating from a tube because of how bad he beat you. I am not exaggerating, situations like this escalate quickly and violently. The fact that he is showing his true colors so early in your relationship speaks volumes. Run away don't walk this man will only hurt you in every way possible. You see the red flags so act on them put this man in your rearview mirror and never think about him again.
Get the fuck away from this guy. OP, have some self respect and leave this dumb motherfucker.
Leave him. 👻
GTFO. Now.
It’s not worth investing another minute in this relationship he is abusive. He will probably try to apologize or make you the villain (you aren’t). He is and always will be abusive.
Why are you posting and not filing a no contact order
Nope nope nope. Not worth it. You're too important to put up with this. My ex husband got really close to this and I kicked his ass out while holding a shovel.
Those red flags should be enough to leave him. These tend to worsen over time. It begins with little signs of control like him getting angry at you for undressing close to a window, and then turns from pushing into beating. Don’t let him back in. These people tend to be very manipulative and convincing after they’ve fucked up.
Once he put his hands on you your relationship ended he's not a man he's an immature little boy you need to keep yourself safe
WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING AFTER 2 YEARS INSTEAD OF AFTER 2 MONTHS??? LEAVE AND RUN AWAY
Don’t walk RUN
just run. leave as fast as you can. men like this only get worse. he’s an abuser and pushing his limits. don’t let it be one day he pushes too hard and you get seriously injured. stay safe and know that it’ll be better down the line <3 you DESERVE better
Yes, do NOT put up with this kind of treatment.

You deserve better and I'd bet a million it will escalate as he gets older.

  
Don't cheat or try to change him....just walk away gracefully and lose his number permanently.
Wow. It will only get worse
Rule #1 that I was taught at a VERY young age (4 years old) after I was in preschool and bit a girl on the arm. NEVER EVER lay a hand on a girl and NEVER EVER disrespect a woman. Plain and simple. It's one of the golden rules of being a real man. The further I read, the more my mind was blown. Yes, leave him. Make it very clear to him you will never accept anyone who disrespects you like that, and that you hope he can fix that before he hurts another woman the same way as you. Be very clear it's over. Not only his physical abuse towards you, but his verbal abuse seems to be something that is just as big of an issue. Based on your last sentence, I think you know it's the right thing to do. Trust your instincts. You know your worth.
Yes
You may be worried about what may happen if you break up with him. However, please think about what most people are saying on here if you decide to stay. It’s not over exaggerating to say your life may depend on it. 

I would recommend speaking with a therapist or contacting a local woman’s hotline to talk with someone who has experience in these matters. 

Sometimes we are attracted to people who we want to fix and low self-esteem or past trauma may have us believe we don’t deserve better and should settle. 

You deserve better. Don’t settle. You leaving sends a strong message that is behaviour is not okay. It may even plant a seed for this person to make some changes in the future.
This is a no brainer question. YES.
It’s only going to get worse.  Take care of yourself.  He’s a grown man & is responsible for his actions.  However it sounds like you’re becoming his scapegoat.  Don’t let him make into his punching bag
I'm sorry, why are you still there?
Dump him. You deserve better sis
Yes. You know this. Girl, run.
Please google the -cycle of abuse- and see if it looks familiar. If it is, please save yourself time and heartbreak and end it. It may be hard to leave, he may sabotage or love bomb you. Breaking up can be a dangerous time, make sure you’re safe and protected. Please talk to people that can support you emotionally. Wish you well.
These are textbook RED FLAGS. Stop wondering and run away. It’s only going to get worse.
I hope you read enough here in this thread to walk away from this relationship 🙏🏽
You've had all the information you need to let this fish go. 


Yes. Abuse gets worse not better. 


You have been conditioned to accept this behavior.  Spend some time getting counciling befor dating again, or you may end up repeating this pattern 
I don’t think you should be asking people opinion about this situation. I know very well you know the right thing to do. Don’t ignore red flags. I don’t wanna see a documentary about you on REAL CRIME.
Definitely leave him.
Leave before he actually belts you one
You need to go no communication. This sounds toxic AF. Starts with pushing ends with years of soul crushing and body crushing abuse. He will escalate.
I don’t know you. I will never meet you. But I am pretty sure about two things:

1. You know you deserve something better than this guy
2. You know you should be leaving him because he put his hands on you for literally no reason at all

You already know what to do. No opinion on Reddit is going to change that. Good luck.
You need to run away and never look back. Block him on everything. No contact.
Be safe, OP. Stay with some friends a while if you need. Even in moments of extreme stress, violence is NEVER acceptable and is a huge indicator of deep, dangerous issues.
The first point is already enough to leave him. Do you want to be with someone who gets so angry like that? Do you think this will be the last time he'll use physical force? Do you think next time he won't be harsher? 

I'm shocked you haven't already run to some country at least 9 oceans away
Yes, leave him immediately. There’s men out there that won’t put their hands on you and can communicate their emotions like adults through conversation. 

But also questioning his manhood over taking out the trash was corny. Let’s not make that a habit going forward.
Yeah you need to get out of there!
Leave him, please. Before it gets worse, because it will. 
I like the idea of demanding he go to counseling and make sure it’s clear that will never happen again or you are gone. However, you need navigate if you can do that safely. If you don’t think you can, that tells you all you need to know.
My dear... don't walk, RUN from this man.  He is violent and unstable.  Violence is something that is a progressive pattern of behavior.  It starts as verbal and ends with physical violence. Many times people get even hurt or killed. Cut all ties with him.   If by chance you can't rid of him, get evidence and put a restraining order. You need to build up your self esteem. You deserve better!  Good luck 👍 
Yes. I bearly started reading number 3 and came to that conclusion
No back story needed. The answer is never stay with a man who uses his strength to control you. Then I read the backstory. It makes it even worse. Get away from this man. He is going to hurt you.
I would be interested to hear the boyfriends( /or ex's, hopefully at this point) version of things. Not because I don't believe you, or think that you haven't told us the whole truth or anything, just purely out of curiocity of how he explains the situations in his head to himself. And is he aware (other than in this latest situation) of how not ok his behaviour is. 

Especially I would love to know why tf would he get upset if you dozed off when watching a movie?? Sounds so weird. And not worth finding out I bet, so you already know what to do. Unless there is more to the story but I'm gonna take your question and explanations of those situations at face value.
Things might be a bit different if you for example were completely in his face about the trash thing or something, but in that case he should've taken a step back himself or removed himself some other way from the situation, not push you to get space. 

Anyway, please come let us know how things turned out, and that you got out safely. And bc I'm a curious motherf*cker please come spill the beans on what he said and how he reacted and tried to explain things when you dumbed him 😄
Leave. It's always shocking to me how people accept violence in relationships so often.
Change the locks and block him.
You're dating a child in a man's body. Children throw tantrums and hit things/people when they don't get their way. 

You're an adult and can make your own decisions, but IMHO, this relationship is going to end one way or another. You already know what you should do.
Get away now. It is a pattern and its getting worse.
Yes, leave him.
Dump him.
He crossed the line with covering mouth, yelling (also a form of violence), and pushing? No! Best to end things before things escalate further.
It’s not a question of if you should leave him the question is why are you still there and why have you been there for this long?

If you decide to break up with him in person, make sure you have a witness or do it in a public place.
Leave him now. If he did those things to you it’s only going to get worse. I would never do anything like that to my wife. If I were you I would call the cops and have it reported. Please be safe 
Fuck yeah you leave him
I see nothing but red flags.  End it now
Honestly...I'd have the conversation from afar. Like over text or a call and simply leave. Let him know you don't love the person he has become. Make sure he understands that his actions and the things he is doing is what is pushing you away. You can not stay with him and allow him to continue down the path of becoming a very abusive and horrible person.

I wish you luck and please take your time to make the best choice for YOUR sake. No one else's
Have him charged with domestic violence. A few days in the cooler might help him.
that your ex did WHAT?

ok, seriously, that's how abusive relationships start, you should get inmediatly (or asap) out of there.
Leave him
It starts with a push, then it continues. Goodluck op do what feels best.
Here’s what a normal/healthy relationship would look like for your scenarios (or at least what I would say to my gf)
1. “Oooh, you need to close the blinds. Are you like an exhibitionist now or something haha?”
2. I wouldn’t cover your mouth but I would say something along the line depending on my current mood “Holy you’re so loud”/“Quietttt *whisper*” but both in respectful and teasing way
3. I would simply take the trash out and ask if you needed anything else

Do what you will with that
Absolutely leave him.
I would leave him after #1. You are a saint for staying for 2 years. What kind of monster are you trying to create?
I think you know the answer. Please be safe ❤️
You should leave him but if you don’t he should leave you. He didn’t do what you asked and you started to demean him. You both sound pretty awful.
It's over.  Next time he's gonna bash your skull in.
This is just the start and all the red flags are THERE!!!! It will only get worse!
BIG YES.

Violent behavior tends to escalate, he's already exhibited signs of being irrationally controlling and now he's escalating physically. Leave him and stay at a friends place until things cool down. I can guarantee he will not take it well and you'll see his true colors.
girl stand up
Uhh the first point was a no from me. The more I read, the more red I saw. Girl, he is behaving like a child, and is NOT husband material. Imagine you get married and he makes you do every little thing, and is being controlling like that until you die? That’s a long time. Better to end it now. Usually I’m hesitant to throw around the term “controlling,” because a lot of people just say that flippantly, but he is physically controlling your body and silencing you.
LEAVE HIM PLEASE!! I PROMISE PROMISE FUCKING PROMISE IT GETS WORSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That behavior is inexcusable and will only get worse from here. The writing is on the wall (as well as this thread.) You know what you have to do. 

If your sister, best friend or daughter (one day) came to you and told you this same exact story, what advice would you give them?
Leave him, this behavior is not okay and staying positively reinforces it.
Do you see how in each of your examples it escalates and gets worse? Please don’t come back with an update about him upgrading from here and hitting you with a closed hand the next time. Leave. Unless you don’t mind how he treats you…




And when I say leave, I don’t mean by tomorrow. Start making your exit plan now, since wondering if you should stay is the first step in the exit plan.
Everything you've described are key behaviours of domestic abuse...

Please get out of this relationship
Please do not break up with him if it’s just you and him alone.
Yeah, leave. Quick.
Yep
Please please please leave him! I promise you it will only get worse! I speak from experience!
Yeah. This is done. Walk away.
red flag after red flag, and they are only escalating. This is a bad sign, and only a matter of time before that "push" turns into a full on hit. Get the hell out of there.
Dump his like he was about to detonate!  If you don’t, he probably will in time, and take you out with him.  There is no excuse whatsoever for being abusive.
You know this isn’t normal, said so yourself. L e a v e. As someone who’s been in abusive relationships, and as someone who’s SEEN escalation first hand happen to my mother when I was a child and my little sister when I was an adult, it’s time to leave when you’re seeing the signs and knees in the pit of your stomach that it’s wrong. He got that upset over things that many (myself included) would describe as small, almost insignificant. So what happens when you and him have a big argument as couples inevitably do? What happens when he feels so very “emasculated” over something else and decides worse than shoving you? It was pretty bad the first time he laid hands on you by literally covering your mouth instead of being a normal fuckin human being and asking if you could please mind your volume. Don’t do what I did when I felt icky and had that voice going off in the back of my head when my ex patted my face in a very rude way. Despite me explaining why I didn’t like it, why I’d prefer he didn’t, he kept doing it to prove a “point”. That pat turned into a slap one day. And I beat myself up because I was uncomfortable with how it started and I let him talk me into why what I was feeling wasn’t true or couldn’t be right. Listen to yourself. Get out of there, that man gets angry at the smallest things and chooses to use physicality instead of his words. That’s never someone to be happy or proud to be with.
Yea you should leave this guy before it gets worse
Boyfriends shouldn't shove their girlfriends around, he would probably turn into a husband that beats his wife.
Girl just casually dropped 3 creepy toxic things about toxic dudes
Why is this a question? You already know the answer. End this.
So just the fact that you needed to post this on this forum means you already know the answer. This guy is an abuser, and it will only escalate the longer you’re together. He will also try to continue to make you feel like you’re worthless so he can escalate the abuse over time without you objecting or leaving. 

So simple, tell him over text (he’s not worth the phone call), that you’re breaking up now and to never contact you again. Take out a protection order with your local PD (this ensures that if he even comes to your place, there’s no bullshit or explaining why you’re scared, he’s just arrested immediately). When you drop this piece of trash, have your largest male friend come hang out for the evening (if dude shows up before the police, this will help, and it’s well known that the abusive type male cannot actually stand up to an actual man, or anyone more powerful than them). 

Lastly, just for an attempt at levity: this guy did an angry 2 handed push, and you didn’t fall over; do you really want to be with a man that’s actually that weak?
Yes. Get away.
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
You are worth so much more than this bullshit.

I know what I'm talking about.  I left an abusive marriage after 3 decades and now have a great life.  Don't waste another second.  This isn't love because love doesn't hurt.
It sounds like you have a girlfriend, not a boyfriend. Don’t waste your time with him and go find better while you are young and can.
Based on these anecdotes, he sounds like a fucking jackass.
Yes, absolutely 100% leave him, but take safety precautions. For example:

* If he has a key to your apartment, change the lock. 
* If you live in a building with an entry code, and he knows the code, ask for the code to be changed.
* If you track each other's locations on your phones, turn that feature off.
Umm, leave him. He's clearly abusive, even before the pushing. How he acts is not normal.
He sounds abusive and people like that don’t change. Abusive people often mistreat you, then apologize and try to “make it up to you” simply to keep you around. Don’t fall for it… it’s not normal to treat someone this way and it’s not good for you. And it only gets worse overtime. So you should leave him I think. You deserve better.
I know his type all too well, he’s a weak minded insecure little man, inside his underdeveloped mind be thinks you won’t realize what he is if he treats you badly and knocks you around, and/or has a drug addiction as well. Drop his ass and find a man that knows how to properly treat a woman and isn’t insecure with himself. He’s not going to stop and it’s only going to get worse. Men like him don’t change.
Yes. First it starts with a push and ends in your murder. Run, your life depends on it.
Time to leave this piece of shit. It is never acceptable to assault you like that……… let’s face it he assaulted you. At first it’s a push, sorry I’ll never do it again and then it’s a hard shove and then a punch. Fuck him make a clean break!
Get away from him. And read Lundy Bancroft’s “Why Does He Do That?”
So many red flags with this, He quite obviously has a temper control issue and wants you to fit into a certain mold, when you don't, his temper flares.
You've not fought back either so now psychologically he holds an advantage and this will make him push boundaries when physical violence is concerned. 
Get away from this person asap, before you're either wheeled out on a cart or worse.
It's not unlikely that you'll die sooner if you don't leave him, but you need to co-ordinate with some people you trust.
DO NOT blindside him 1on1 or without telling multiple people about your plans.
I think it’s time to pull the plug 🔌
You’ve absolutely answered your own question. You’re best to cut things off before your life potentially gets cut off first. If he’s giving you clear signs on things now? Imagine marriage? Imaging living together? You’ve got the easiest time right now leaving.. you’d be wise to take the signs.
Run
Red flags for sure
If a guy can't even throw out trash for his girlfriend of 2 years when shes asking him for it, I doubt he's going to be a good partner long term.
Yes! Run like hell!
I have a little frustration temper that leads me to throw things. Not once have I ever thrown anything at or even close enough to hit my wife that I have been with for almost 20 years. Never once shoved her or anything else. People can have tempers and outbursts and not be an abusive partner. 

Mine is more frustration when things are not working,  I recently tossed a pool skimmer pole (accidentally) through our mesh pool fence because the brush fell off in the deep end and I got mad and tossed it. 

if my wife undresses near the window I’m watching and not caring if others see the goods.
Yep leave him. Don’t think any measure to get out of that relationship is too extreme. If you feel like it’s necessary then do any of the following: 

Make sure the people close to you know (trusted neighbors are awesome too)
Change the locks
Stay with a friend
Have a friend stay
Get a doorbell cam
Get a firearm
Change your number
File a restraining order
Etc etc

Not saying he’ll escalate things that far but your physical safety is important and so is your mental wellbeing.

Also, in a self defense situation, if you decide to act then you go 100%. Just bc he’s dazed by one frying pan to the head doesn’t mean you’re in the clear.
This is pretty awful - I can see this escalating - it would be a good idea to work on yourself and find someone else now
You gonna show him that his genes are not going to reproduce
He’s a coward leave him. It’s not going to get better!!
Leave him, please. Don't ever let any person cover your mouth to shut u up or intimidate you! No.  Not okay. Thank God you don't live with him.  He sounds unhinged. Block him and don't look back.
Yes
GIRL LEAVE THAT'S A RED FLAG
Leave him. It will get messy with time.
Wow get the fuck away from that guy! Red flag after red flag, ignore them at your own peril!
You’ve been in an abusive relationship this whole time. Get out now before he really hurts you.
speaking from someone who wishes they left the first time, please get the hell out while you still can. do not get pregnant either because that's when the abuse really kicks up. sending you love i know it's hard but you can do it.🤍 there is a man out there who is going to love you the way you deserve and you'll look back questioning why you ever accepted any less. hugs.
Get out now, it will only get worse. You don't want to spend the rest of your life walking on eggshells or worse.
Ummm…item #1 is a HUGE red flag all on its own, without anything else or any other context. Hell yes you leave him. Like, yesterday.
Leave now before you’re removed in a body bag. 

I’m sorry ❤️
There's a pattern and it's accelerating. Time to get away.
As everyone has clearly said, run. You know it, everyone knows it, this relationship is not trending upward.
Yes absolutely.  This is not "I can fix him" behavior.  This is deeply part of him and will only get worse.
A girl insulted his masculinity in a joking manner, he showed you how much of a man he is, do him a courtesy and take him at his word. Red flag. Manhood is up to personal interpretation. His interpretation seems to be doted on by his woman and physical dominance. You're in a Honey moon phase and showing you his best behavior, his best behavior is lazy, letting you do 100% of chores even when you are treating him, then physical outlast at the smallest of teasing. So, what will his behavior be once he's fully comfortable? Kinda sounds like he's real close to back handing you across the face for saying something he doesn't like. 

Get yourself a man who will insist on cleaning if you cook for him would be ideal, but one like this is utterly unacceptable.
If he has a key or knows where you hide your spare, change your locks!
Girl RUN!
Just to echo what everyone else is saying, leave him. I had a similar experience and it only got worse.
Send him a text saying you do not want to see or hear from him again. That you are stopping all contact. Screen shot and save those messages. Block his number. If he comes by,  do not let him in and ask him to leave. If he refuses immediately, call the police. If he calls or texts from another number, inform him you are going to the police and will file a restraining order if he texts or calls again. Don't hesitate to do it immediately. 

To many people don't realize how quickly things shift. If you value your life, then listen to everyone telling you it's not normal or okay. If you value your life, listen to your gut. The fact is you are on here asking for an opinion from strangers, means something already didn't sit well with you.
Danger ! Danger! Following this path leads to more danger! Danger!
You are too good for him.  This guy is going to hurt you!  Please leave him.
RUN GIRL RUN
Save that text
Why do you ask this question? 
What exactly do you think will happen in the future?
That he won't beat you? That he won't rape you? That he won't strangle you?
I am an attorney who specializes in domestic violence and abuse. I hope you will believe me when I say that your boyfriend has been abusing you. Not just in the more nebulous, therapy-speak emotional sense that people talk about these days, but actual, legally recognizable abuse (in my own state, at least. I can't speak definitively about the laws of other states; but it's hard to believe they'd be this different). 

Leaving abusive relationships is often hard. I've had a number of clients who tried to get away from abusive partners but then decided to go back to them. Sometimes it seems to be about financial dependency, but not always: I've seen this behavior a number of times from financially independent, even wealthy women (and it is often women, though abuse can be committed by people of any gender against people of any gender). There's some social pressure that makes you feel like you can't leave - even though, I hope you would agree, this behavior is totally unacceptable. Think how you would feel if a friend of yours told you that her boyfriend did these things to her. 

Domestic violence like this tends to escalate, as people like your boyfriend discover what they can get away with. It operates in cycles, of mounting abuse followed by emotional breakdown, maybe apology and reconciliation, but it's unlikely to change unless your boyfriend does some real intense work on himself - and for that to happen, he needs to experience some consequences. For your own safety, I beg you to stop seeing him. You have the advantage that you don't live together, which should make this somewhat easier. You don't have to be cruel - end it as kindly as you like, but please, end it. If he refuses to accept your decision, and continues to harass you, please talk to a lawyer in your area.
the fact that he couldn't fully apologize is insane
This will just get worse.  He has issues.  You can’t fix them.  Run.
If you stay with this creep it's only going to get worse. He shoved you because you jokingly said something about him? Fuck why would you wanna walk on egg shells around an abuser.
I come from a home of abuse and this is just the beginning. It will get worse. He knows he can get away with it so he will press on. You need to really think about this. Good luck.
It’s time to leave. Make sure you do so safely. Get advice from a DV hotline. 

It has now escalated to the point that there’s no predicting just how far he will go the next time, or how you will end up. You can expect the usual dog and pony show of fake remorse, so just be aware it’s all part of the cycle of abuse. Better still, have no way for him to contact you again. You owe him nothing.
Time to be done.  There are guys that would never do any of those things.  He legit pushed you over a comment.  

I think you already want to leave him by your comment after he didn’t take out the garbage.  Doesn’t really seem like you like him as much as you are trying to convince yourself that you do.  I’m sure you did at one point, but things have clearly changed.  

There is literally no excuse for any of his actions that you described…. Which have all escalated to now pushing you.
He's got his own demons to fight, whatever it is, you shouldn't be caught up in it.

Go find someone else who will appreciate and treat you as you're deserved
Leave now. If he ever had your key, change your locks. This will only get worse
Get out. Asap
Why is this a question? What makes you think you should stay and deserve to tolerate violence and abuse?

Google your free local domestic violence service or crisis line. They can safety plan to help you leave and might be able to provide counselling. Or if you can’t find one, contact your local women’s shelter and ask them for support. 
Leaving can be a dangerous time for abuse to accelerate.
Girl, leave him as soon as it’s safe to do so. Tell him why and do not give him a chance to apologise and lie and say he won’t do it again.
Lmao so what did you see in him fr before u started this very very short-lasted relationship so far? Was it his... clearly not personality ...
This guy is a psycho.
Unacceptable behavior, ever. Full stop. Huge red flags. Run now. Run and be confident because you are 💯 making the right call by leaving.
Run away.
The way I see it, you should leave. If you stay and do nothing then you set the precedent that this behaviour is okay. If you leave then you are teaching him a lesson that some lines shouldn't be crossed. So either leave... or cut one of his hands off, that'll teach him.
Run away, before they take your body away
You were right to question his manhood. Men don't strike women, overgrown boys do. Dump his abusive, insecure, and controlling ass and find a real man who can respect you. Also, nobody "feels like" taking out the trash, it's a task that needs doing, what a childish excuse. Lol
Yes yEs yeS YES
Omg RUN. Like fuck that guy
Run
Nope, wait until he beats you senseless and leaves you in a hospital with a broken nose and a few teeth missing. Jesus H Christ...
Speaking from experience (just escaped an abusive relationship last year) he is only going to get more aggressive. Run.
yes
Screaming at you in the beginning was a red flag. Holding his hand over your mouth was a red flag. Pushing you is a red flag. He does need to address the level of anger he is carrying. His anger is very disproportionate to the stimuli. Call Orange Door if you are in Australia. Let them know the information you have shared with us and what you are thinking. Listen to them and follow their advice. Individuals who are controlling like this can be unsafe when you end it. Learn. Join r/narcissists and see what others experience.
This shit only escalates. Get away. There are better guys in your future, by far.
There are billions of men in the world. Why have you settled so low? 

It’s not compulsory to be in a relationship. It’s far far far better to be single, than spend all your time wishing you were. 

Please end this relationship and treat yourself better.
Yes. Yes you leave him. Don't even look over your shoulder or wave goodbye.
Leave. Now. Don't look back and do your best to disappear from his awareness.

I don't want to be alarmist, but this behavior is HIGHLY concerning and after losing a friend of mine last year when her seemingly lovely (but super controlling in private) husband murdered her, I don't take these red flags lightly anymore.
Oh shit, yeah no.

Get the fuck outta there.

Why are ya still with him?
Why are you even posting this? You know he is an abusive scumbag. Leave
From what you say it seems like he has a short fuse and like he's controlling and if he pushed you and grabbed your mouth/head so you couldn't talk and if he didn't want to leave your house when you asked him to leave than it's only gonna get worse as time goes by. So just tell him that its not going to work out.(Oh and I think that this belongs on r/Abusiverelationships)
You’re right none of this is normal. It’ll only get worse
So you've been with him for two years and in ALL that time he has progressed regarding being mentally AND physically abusive, which you can remember in detail......so you KNOW it's wrong.why are you still with him??? Don't let him back into your home, change the locks if he has a key. Block him everywhere and REPORT HIM.
Why are you still with him if he’s treating you like this? Are planning to stay in an unhealthy situation to see how bad it’ll actually get before leaving? Know your worth. Leave.
as someone who's just had a big block of domestic violence in uni given by DV shelter personnel, I can only support what the other's have said: get out of there. this dynamic would sadly only get more complex, more violent and you'd convince yourself of more reasons why you must stay with him. there's resources across the globe for support, contact them if you want it.

take care and keep us posted. 💖
it's alarming behavior so early into the relationship. if this is how he deals with things, it's not a good sign
LEAVE most of my life was wasted being a victim LEAVE NOW
Definitely leave. It will only get worse. I’m glad you don’t live with him.
If there are red flags of abusive behavior best to not let it get any further.. things always get worse when you move in together..abusers hurt the person closest to them
Please follow your instincts as a woman. These behaviors will likely morph into mental abuse, including gaslighting. There are many good men are out there who would never do these things to you, I promise.
I am deaf in one ear partially blind in one eye have complex ptsd all
From DV every day I suffer from
Injuries he caused me . Get him out ur life now
Have you heard of the frog and pot of hot water metaphor? Because you're the frog, OP.

Get out while you can. Don't let him make you a statistic
Run
Run
Leave while you can walk before you leave in a stretcher. This is only the beginning. Domestic violence always starts off with seemingly small violations that people brush off. It never starts with the punching and beatings and choking, it escalates to that. Leave him. And file police reports.
Leave.
please leave. as quickly as possible. 

i wasn‘t pushed but made to fall. as a joke. it was early into the relationship. i stayed. two years later i lived with him. in a fit of rage he hit the door of our closet. i told him i was scared but managed to threaten him i would immediately leave if he‘d ever hit me. he never did. 

instead i got demeaned, ignored, raped, abused in all kinds of ways for years. i would keep going because i still thoght he’d change back to being nice. then he threatened to kill me a few times.  he stood in front of me with a knife. he‘d drive recklessly while high and drunk shouting he hated me and more.

it took me years to get bck to normal and be myself. yet still it takes a shit ton to trust a guy. 

every second you spend with him is a second too much. be careful leaving him. but do it as fast as you can.
This is way past the line! Dump this one like a hot potato and do it quickly.
>and he screamed at me and accused me of wanting other people to see me naked.

  
Nope.
Absolutely yes you should leave him. My wife can be fcking annoying at times, as can anyone, but I have never shoved her or covered her month like that. I believe men like that end up with women who tolerate this. I've seen it happen. they become more withdrawn from the world as the abuse gets worse. Sometimes it ends in tragedy.
It's been a slippery slope since his first act of aggression. If you don't stand up, it may be too late.
Well technically, he’s already hit her by pushing her. Now, it’s only going to escalate from there with actually catching hands to the face from him. Should have left months ago.
How long until he kills you?

Let’s not wait to find out… 

We don’t need to add to the statistic…
Yep. You’re so right. They don’t come out of the gate with fists flying. For me, it started with squeezing my hand too hard, then went to throwing things near me (one of which “accidentally” hit me), then pushing me, then “getting carried away” during sex and choking me almost unconscious. He talked about wanting to punch me all the time, even publicly on social media (his friends thought it was funny). I didn’t stick around to see him follow through.
It is likey when you break up with him and leave he will promise you the world about changing and also likely stock you and harass you.
It amazes me that she's still with this guy, anybody sushes me with both hands I'm swinging.
my father would shove me, then he would slap me, then he choked me, he told me next time he would kill me, i've been no contact for 16 years
Suffocating/choking is a real bad sign even in physical abuse. Hitting is one category but any time someone is preventing you from breathing is a whole other level. That’s a sign to leave NOW!
Exactly!  That is not normal behavior and it's slowly escalating. I've been married 20+ years and never pushed or covered the mouth of my wife or any girl that I dated.
Exactly. My bd called me a bitch a couple months into dating. Not even a month later I found myself being pushed up against a wall, choked, and beaten. I was a dumbass though and stayed with him :( now I just want to help other people not make the mistakes I did because having a baby with your abuser is, imo, more stressful than the abuse itself.
^ THIS. Leave now!!!
Yep. OP needs to gtfo before they end up dead. ☹️
THIS!!!!! Do not put yourself in situations that you are not comfortable with. Signs like this only show us what is coming out way. I hope you take care of yourself xx
Or worse, kills them…
Or worse ends your life who knows
Been there, done that.
I got to #3 and didn’t even need to read the rest. These stories are far too common. I hope OP learns she’s worth more than this and leaves.
The hitting starts AFTER the wedding. Get out now.
I really really really don't understand how these people lock down partners.

There are a LOT of good, single men out there.
This!! It's only a matter of time
I don't think these are remotely the same thing.

I've had them done to me by people who have literally never been violent ever.


But what it actually is indicative of; Is serious emotional immaturity. 

Women have done this to me

It is an element found in emotionally manipulative people, physically abusive or mentally abusive people.

It's not that everything has a linear progression.

But OP should get out nonetheless. Dude is possessive and controlling.
Before she has to crawl away...
Sometimes the real choice is between making a graceful exit or bolting out the door. When the red flags are flying, running might be the safest bet!
OP knows the answer to her question. The abuse has predictably escalated with time. She should have left at the very first instance of abuse. RUN OP , don’t be a statistic.
Eventually a push becomes a punch. Time to leave
[deleted]
He also tried to dominate her by not leaving her apartment when she told him to. This is highly dangerous.
Exactly! Love this
I can testify that’s a true statement
I should add that apparently the most dangerous part of a relationship for a woman are the 10 days after breaking up.

I can imagine someone like him putting up a physical fight for her.
And just a reminder that when you leave, he’s gonna try gaslight the fuck out of you. Don’t fall for that. You frankly don’t even need to explain why it’s over, but it certainly isn’t important for him to understand or agree.
Wow, that is so scary to read.. really puts in perspective that it isn't just a closed fist that can really hurt someone.  Seeing someone thrown to the ground is pretty extreme, but I think most would assume a right cross to be worse.. but whiplash and pulled back muscles are still serious damage.  Glad you got out before any worse damage was done.
Girl I would’ve lied in that moment and pressed charges anyways. Now that fucker can hurt someone else.
>When you take them back, you’re showing them that ultimately it’s okay

I agree to the fullest.
I'm so glad he hit the wall instead of you and I'm doubly glad that you are safe now
Yes definitely it might be hard for her to move and she need a paper trial so she can get a restraining order when he tried to come back and stalk her at her current place (assuming she lives alone). Also telling other people who live nearby or setting up cameras for when he comes by looking for her.
Agree, but contact the local sheriff department instead. Cops are notoriously bad at handling DV cases, and sheriffs are more trained to deal with keeping the peace. They do things like execute evictions and remove DV victims and their possessions from the abuser's property.
Yeah, she needs to shut this shit down, make it airtight, otherwise abusive people will always find a way to worm back in
💯. I could not have said it any better.
Gaslighting is so real and can make people feel like they're crazy and overreacting when they're not. Also, sometimes people have loved ones who would tell them they're overreacting because they're broken themselves. That's why they need the confirmation. People put so much emphasis on "you'll be ending the relationship for nothing" and a lot of advice is shaped from the frame of not losing a partner rather than protecting yourself.
fr swear they know what to do but for some reason need the extra confirmation. What if we say stay will she?
Exactly 
Of course we're all protective of our daughters, but she frankly should just break up with him.  That is the most sane answer.  
  
Sure, the idea of going to beat up the bad BF sounds good on TV, but in reality there are consequences for assaulting someone despite what most Redditors want to believe.
Yes, CHOOSE YOU!
Yeah, this is worse than the pushing in my view. Literally a physical manifestation of his urge to control OP
This is why he didn’t want to leave after pushing you, he needed to try to get you to calm down so you could begin to forget it happened.
With me, people generally get one strike. That's it. Stay away from me.
They’ve literally been brainwashed to put men’s needs first and to be loyal. It’s real and she truly needs emotional support.
 Aww, come on. Take it easy on her, she's been through enough. She's smart, she knows, but it's scary. She needs positive words of encouragement now more than ever. There is nothing wrong with her, just that abusive weight she's been carrying for 2 years.
I don't think you being angry about this situation paints you in a great light either tbh. She is clearly upset and doesn't know what to do. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with her.
This is such a rude thing to say. Sure, you’re telling her to leave, which is the right thing to do, but you don’t need to add in a demeaning comment afterwards.
How would that work out?
Thank you. I wish I had this list 15 years ago. My ex fits so many of these traits.
This is a really great reply. OP please read this one!
Should be top comment!
I’m glad you got out of that situation. Thank you for sharing.
Absolutely. Ghost him. It’s really the safest thing. Please.
His girlfriend of two years cooked him dinner and then asked him to take out the trash and he said no. He’s not a man.  He’s just a little insecure boy. 

When my partner comes to my house and notices my trash is full, he starts gathering that shit up to take out for me. I have never asked. I just couldn’t imagine asking him for a helping hand and him just refusing to help me. If he couldn’t do what I asked, he’d offer up other things he could do instead. 

If she’s taking her own trash out, she should start with him.
It doesn’t matter what she said to him she still doesn’t deserve to be beat on. He needs to learn how to control his anger and not lash out like that.
Yeah because insulting someone is comparable to physical violence, so they're both equally terrible /s lame attempt at victim blaming bro
At least OP included what she said to him when she very easily could have omitted that part. She knows the comment was rude. But, I hope she finds a man one day who will take the trash out for her after she cooks dinner.
>his first act of aggression.

Which we might not know about....
It's already too late. He's got an anger problem, and she's a good place to vent it, she's shown him this. 

What she can expect now is that he's going to be really sorry, and apologetic. Then there's going to be some stable time, then he's going to be violent again. In every iteration, the violence will increase. The iterations will become closer together until they meet. 

There are only a couple of ways this ends. The best outcome is that he goes through counseling and learns productive ways to channel his anger. The second best is that she ends the relationship. The worst way is that he kills her. It's her choice how it ends. Here's hoping she chooses wisely.
THIS! I was in an abusive relationship. It only gets worse.
Yes.  And not to make it sound like there is an acceptable trigger for domestic violence, because there is literally a zero amount of acceptable abuse in a relationship, but it stands out in this case just how fragile he appears to be.  OP made a throwaway comment because the guy who just got food cooked for him wouldn’t take out garbage and his response is physical violence.  OP was by his opinion changing in a way that *may* have allowed someone to see so he chose to be verbally abusive.  Same for OP falling asleep watching a movie.  
  
But the “was too loud” one is just a Soviet parade of red flags.  It wasn’t just him being upset and lashing out, it was literally denying OP a right to speak, and using physical force to ensure OP’s compliance.  For me it’s like one step below choking for a sign of how violent he is at his core.
Seems like he's testing her reaction to see if she'll take it or call the police his actions are getting more violent.  She needs to leave before he starts beating her or worse
I will never forget this. I was a nurse working on a children's unit and I became very close to a child who, due to many medical conditions, spent most of their time in the hospital.

After a weekend at home, she was different—very quiet and withdrawn. Eventually, she opened up to me and said that she had seen her daddy hit her mummy. A doctor overheard the description of what had happened and tried to clarify what the girl was saying. He asked if she meant that her dad had pushed her mum, and this sweet little girl said, "Yes, that's what happened, but isn't pushing like that just slow hitting?"

I've never forgotten it.
When he screamed at her for standing too near the window in her first example.  That was the exit alarm for the relationship.
Exactly. It’s a pattern of worsening behavior. If any one of these things happened in a vacuum it could be brushed off as a bad day that could be talked about and help to work through, but all of them occurring in this escalation, it’s a recipe for worsening abuse.
Or even no hands !
I’m sorry that happened. No person should have to go through abuse 
If you are choked / strangled / suffocated you are 500 times more likely to be murdered.
It’s one of the biggest predictors of domestic homicide around half if not more of domestic homicide victims experienced strangulation prior/during
Manipulation, 100%.

Cycle of abuse is such a powerful thing. They charm and lovebomb you so you fall in love with that version, push boundaries, tear you down, abuse you, and then quickly go back to the loving version. Gets you addicted to the cycle. Cognitive dissonance kicks in where you knows it's abuse but you don't want to beleive it. You hate yourself and feel ashamed. You desperately want to beleive the person you fell on love with, that you only get glimpses of, is going to finally come back.

It's awful and even once you are out they try to trick you into coming back. 

But once you are out you dont trust that there are any good men out there. Because when you first met the monster, you thought he was a good one.
Until someone has to carry her away…
Please be safe in your exit, OP. The man you are with could be dangerous please come up with a safe exit plan with friends. 
It's her place,she should just bolt the door after he has left.
Thankfully they don’t live together, which makes things a bit easier.
Graceful exits where you actually talked to them in person can get you killed so speedy is best.
THAT PART!! It was all red flags but this was the BIGGEST RED FLAG EVER!! OP, you’re in danger girl. If he wouldn’t leave your apartment when asked, do you think he’ll “allow” you to break up with him??? SERIOUSLY HOPE YOU SEE TIS COMMENT BECAUSE YOU ARE IN DANGER!
I second that. Abusive people go through the cycle of mistreating you, pretending to change to keep you around, then mistreating you again. Overtime it just gets worse as you lose more control. So I hope OP leaves them
A girlfriend of mine's husband once pushed her and she broke her back. She took him back...
For any reason for her to reach out, she did. She might wonder if she's being too sensitive, she's not. People in her life may not be supportive, so, let's be that for her. She asked for advice,  let's tell her! Yes, OP, get him out your apartment,, your mind and your life. Now, while you still can.
Look at your beautiful self in the mirror and realize your worth. Peace.
Because abusers gaslight their partners. This is peak victim blaming. Don’t be gross.
Because she’s probably been slowly ‘trained’ into accepting his behaviour before it came to the push! Abusers trickle the insults, push the boundaries etc to see what they can get away with. Think of the boiling frog example.
It's scary, because the fact that she's coming on here and not automatically leaving makes me think she's going to stay with him. This is about as obvious as it gets.
And then it just goes round and round. Yelling at you is also abuse.
THIS^ All OP needs is support to feel safe and strong enough to make the right decision and leave this unhealthy relationship. Belittling comments that only aim to make her feel bad do nothing but harm.
 No need for a note or any more communication. Communication only opens the door for him to reel you back in.
She better find that man, because if she doesn’t it’ll be his fault on how she reacts.
and she is gonna keep counting IF she stays with him
>What she can expect now is that he's going to be really sorry, and apologetic. Then there's going to be some stable time, then he's going to be violent again. In every iteration, the violence will increase. The iterations will become closer together until they meet. 

Wow...one of my family members was in an abusive relationship. I always found that pattern perplexing. One day he "accidentally" headbutt her in the face. She was bleeding. He said sorry and that it was an accident. She brushed it off. Then he immediately proposed to her...........................
This is the same with verbal and psychological abuse as well.
The thing is, the apology will sound believable because he will quite likely be genuinely sorry.
But just like an addict might be sorry that they stole a sentimental item from a family member to sell for drugs, that won’t stop them from behaving the same way in future.  This sort of person has a lot of damage and issues which require more work than a simple act of remorse.
👆 This exactly. Please pay heed. Violence always escalates but in between there are periods of contrition, pleading for forgiveness, promises to change for the better, etc. Don't fall for it because it always gets worse in increments
I spent 46 years with an emotional, financial and verbal abuser. It started slowly and increased once I had two children. They are so careful to never do it in front of others that everyone admires and befriends them and you begin to believe they are a great guy, it MUST be you! It’s insidious.  Listen to your gut, RUN!
This is def the cycle. I stayed in it for way too long and can see this is where she’s heading— 0/10 would not recommend.
They always cycle.  Like you said do something then they are remorseful and say they won’t do it again and that goes in for a while then they do something again and the cycle continues.  End the relationship.No one deserves to be a abused in any way.
As this pattern takes hold, he's going to start claiming that she's provoking him intentionally. (If he hasn't already.) To him, this feels true. Eventually it might even feel true to her... because when tension ratchets up enough she might crave the reset that much. Or even just want to establish that he's crossing this sort of line.

Of course, even if she reaches the point of trying to provoke him, her shitty behavior doesn't make his violence justified.

She can't choose to have him go to counseling and get his shit together. Trying to make that happen will be interpreted as trying to control him, and make it less likely to happen. Also, it's important to avoid couples therapy with abusers. They're good at manipulating the therapist and they fundamentally need help with their issues before you can work on the relationship together.

She only has two choices: She can choose to stay. She can choose to go. On average she'll attempt to leave something like seven times before it sticks, because abusers are really good at creating dependency and isolation.

If she does leave, she should plan it carefully and treat it as a life-threatening situation. (As in: Get yourself and everything you care about out of the house before he knows you are thinking about leaving.)
I’m so glad you got out.
I wish more people would just break up after the first act of agression. Let it be the first and last time if you can.
Same. I’m glad you’re a survivor as well! It’s hard af
I have been choked into submission because I wouldn’t say “i love you “.  End of relationship.
Wish I’d been seen by you. I saw things like my mother having her head bashed into the washing machine by her boyfriend and even when I told teachers, the counselor, my youth pastor, even strangers on the internet no one helped. I wrote a statement on paper for the police and had it torn up in front of me. Even at times I wasn’t being hit this sort of thing will mess a kid up. You don’t hurt people you say you love.
Out of the mouths of babes as the saying goes.

I'll remember that too. Pushing is slow hitting. It is amazing the kind of behaviour you normalise when in an abusive relationship 😞
Wow. Yeah I wouldn’t forget this either.
Sometimes children say things that sting so bad because they don’t understand just how heartbreaking and jarring their words just were and how badly they’re victimized. :(
Absolutely. Life is way too short to put up with bullshit from anyone or anything. That used to be me until I woke up. You only get one shot at life. People need to do what makes them happy as the next second of life is not guaranteed.
yeah I'm not sure how someone with no arms would push me but they'd be wishing they had some arms to block with
 750 times more apparently

“A person who has suffered a non-fatal strangulation incident with their intimate partner is 750% more likely to be killed by the same offender.” 
https://www.ottawapolice.ca/en/news/strangulation-is-a-significant-indicator-that-domestic-abuse-will-turn-deadly-experts-say.aspx
YES! This!
Add to that the people who stay for this cycle often have no healthy concept of love to begin with. Too many were brought up by parents who did exactly the same to them, under the guise of "parenting". So when you learned that love is constantly being punished for mistakes so you can "better" yourself, how would you suddenly realize that all of this is abuse and you deserve better?

People who **know** their worth and **know** they deserve better leave such relationships as fast as they can. People who only know abuse disguised as "love" stay - and constantly try to "be better".
This is oddly poetic… OP listen to these comments
Or 6 someone’s
The number of people not getting this is too damn high.
In a body bag   Let’s hope she leaves now
In a box.
This is legitimately what happened to Gabby Petito.
I wouldn’t be surprised if he made himself a key. I’d change the door code/lock to be on the safe side.
Dump him by text, then block him everywhere on your socials.

You can’t negotiate with a guy who does these kinds of things to a woman.

I speak from experience. 🫣
Agree, I would not mess with any meeting in person to break up
Which is definitely why they question themself. They start to feel at fault or question things. Like maybe they think they are overreacting somehow. And maybe because their partner turns it around on them to feel at fault by saying they are the ones overreacting, that is was no big deal, apologizing.. Love bombing. Etc. 
Exactly. Somehow we all have that strong urge to get the abuser to understand what they are doing and how it is making you feel. They know. Again, ghosting is the only safe way. Wishing you the very best. You deserve it.
What's sad is I'm just quoting statistics. This is the pattern of a normal abusive relationship. The only thing that changes is the acceleration time.
Did she accept?  That’s scary!
Can confirm. 

The worst part is, sometimes the aggressor (My dad) is *entirely clueless* to the fact that they are not being a good person. Not that they can't be; they're not paying attention enough to be.
I worked with a woman whose husband beat her, but he was clever about it. It was always where it couldn’t be seen. She finally left him and found someone who wasn’t successful wasn’t maybe the most charming man, but he treated her so beautifully and her family hated him and they loved her ex-husband and could not understand why she broke up with him. Abusers are so clever.
Hugs to you hun. I came from a very similar background, and I never told anyone until we had an english writing essay at school, where i wrote it all down. I got an A+ for it, but no one saw it as my truth. My teacher never even asked if everything was ok at home. 

Sending love ❤️
Please tell me that you are now away from this situation?
I’m so sorry you and your mom went through that.
I don't know how long ago this was, but today, all those people would be breaking the law. They are all mandated reporters, and if they fail to report, they are criminals. Doesn't help now, but if you ever see or hear about a child being abused and professionals refusing to intervene, go ahead and threaten them with prosecution.
i hope your mom and you are safe And people like that in your lives would only do thing if someone dies and they would said if only they told me. Please know not everyone is like that and again i hope you and your mom are safe
Kids have an amazing ability to see a situation with such clarity.
No not push you but shush you.As in shush you to be quiet verbally.
That is very true. 

The relationship feels normal because it's all the person knows. I once heard that if you grew up like that, avoid any partner that makes you feel at home... instead it's the good partners that will feel boring/uninterested/unsettling.
The backhand is coming
100%
I am one of those statistics. 
(For the record, men can be abused, too. This isn't about bashing men. My situation happened to be where men are the abusers)

So, from experience, allow me to say that counseling only works if he really is going to counseling because he believes he has growing to do. Otherwise, they put on a show for counseling, then comes home and start in with the abusive behavior and then they will sit next to you in the ER looking concerned for your wellbeing to ensure you leave out the how you fell on the river rock path covered in rain water and hit your head so hard you were unconsciousfor a few minutes (when he punched you as you were walking around the vehicle to walk into the house because you didn't agree with him).

Six years and many black eyes later, I managed to escape. 

I say escape because until I moved over 6 hours away, he stalked me, and no, the court order of protection didn't stop him from trying to contact/find me. 

Once I sufficiently managed to get outside his physical reach he would contact my mother claiming I was locking him out of his accounts and she'd fall for it when all he had to do was hit i forgot my password link and go to the email account he'd emailed her from many times on his phone. 

And yes, despite the fact that my mother knew he beat me, and she herself was a beaten woman by my own father whom she escaped from, she has established a post (he/me) breakup ongoing connection/communication with him aka they stay in touch. Needles to say she and I do not speak any longer.

Today, I'm multiple states away...from both of them. (To be clear, these are different instances stitched together for context.)
I lived those statistics, she needs to RUN NOW
Same. Both parents. My father recently told me that I'm the problem because I never "change my mind" (loosen my boundaries). After saying that I was ungrateful and using the example of me not thanking them for coming to be with me after my husband died and I lost my house, that was the end of that relationship. They escalate enough that it's eventually going to be unbearable, just like with physical abuse. The only way out is for the aggressor to notice that they're fucked up and decide to change. I know we make more excuses for verbal abuse because it's not going to kill us, but it is going to change who we are as people. I'm sorry about your dad. I hope you have people in your life who can replace him in that role.
I will never forget this woman I worked with back when I was 19. We worked at a popular Western clothing store and Western supply store.  Cheri was beautiful, petite, and sweet. Her husband would take her her to and from work. I met him a few times, and he gave me the chills. He had cold, dead eyes, and he was a massive man. 

Over the next 6 months, I got to know my co- worker as we worked in the same department. We had another co-worker who was a good-looking guy who played college football.  He worked with us  to make extra money in the off-season. 

Cheri started to open up to me and the rest of us about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband. She came into work one day, and she was having a hard time moving. Come to find out, he had beat the shit out of her. He'd hit her where it wouldn't show. He would place a bar of soap in a sock and hit her in her back, stomach, and legs, but never where the beating was visible. The football  player started to fall for sweet Cheri. Her asshole husband would never let Cheri keep her checks.  She had to turn all the money over to him. He wouldn't let her have friends, and he listened in on her phone conversations. Mark(the football player,  not his real name) found out about Cheri's abuse. When we saw her back and stomach filled with bruises,  I cried. Mark wanted to beat the shit out of her husband. 

We begged her to call the police, but she said it wouldn't do any good. He would get out of jail and beat her worse because it had happened before. This was back in the early 80s. So, I approached my female professor, who was also on the board for a domestic abuse center, and asked her for help. 

All of us employees pooled our money together, including the owner of the store, and we helped Cheri escape. The owner gave her new clothes, and we girls gave her toiletries, etc. My professor had a place reserved for her at the domestic shelter. Cheri's husband dropped her off at work. He had beat her the day prior. We waited for the husband to drive off, and we sprung into action. 

We gave her 7k in cash, the clothes, etc., and my professor picked her up from the alley behind the store. We loaded Cheri into the car. Five hours later, her pos husband came  to pick her up from work, and when he found out Cheri was gone, he went into a rage. He demanded we tell him where she went. We stayed quiet. He then threw a swing at the football player, and it was on. All of us dog piled on her asshole husband, including the store owner, and this time, her pos husband was the one that was beaten. 

Cheri ended up divorcing her husband. We showed up with her when she had court dates so her husband couldn't attack her in the parking lot. Cheri moved back to her hometown in Texas and went back to school, got a degree, and married a wonderful man.

Somerimes,.there are happy endings. 
.
Yes.  I had an ex BiL who SAed the girls.  I knew he was verbally abusive, but missed the signs of the other.
Abusers are very good at acting super normal around other people, then turning into Captain Bligh in private.  It goes with the rest of the syndrome.
I’m so sorry no one was there for you.
I had a similar experience. Literally wrote down what he said to me throughout the week and my teacher "didn't think parents would actually react that way"
Still, some of them fail at that. I worked at a school. A child who had behavioral issues told me some disturbing things about her dad. I reported it to my supervisor. Who dismissed it because she had behavioral issues and was known to lie. I said, “That doesn’t mean she’s lying about *this.*” So the teacher reported it to the principal. Who instructed the teacher to talk to the mom. Who said it was bullshit. And they left it there. I was like, “I don’t think that’s what being a mandated reporter means. You call the police or CPS and let them determine if it’s credible.” So mandated reporter or not, I don’t believe for a minute they report *everything.*
I think so as well
Thank you and your coworkers and the owner for helping her!
I’m so glad this had a happy ending
What a story. Terrific post.
You guys are all angels. I really felt something reading this and I pray that I have people in my life that will help me similarly to how you helped her. 🥲
Wow, you guys are genuine heros. Thank you!  It's amazing to hear how everyone helped her. I hope she is living a much better life now.
What a beautiful story! I'm sure it will give her some hope. Thank you!
You folks are awesome and that is the power of solidarity and community.

Sometimes it takes a village to deal with a bully.

And let's make no mistake, domestic abuse is just bullying within a long term relationship.  The dynamic is the same.  Bullies push limits, they escalate, and if not brought up short they become monsters.
You and your coworkers are some seriously amazing and wonderful people. You all literally saved her life. 💗💗💗Thank you for that.
Gosh. That gave me chills. You are the type of people who are amazing people. You helped her feel safe and literally all risked bodily harm to jump the dude. Ty for being nice.
I was fearful of the ending the whole way through. Thank goodness it ended so well. Whew.
Now THATS the happy ending cheri deserves! U and ur coworkers r amazing ppl!! Sends hills down my spine to imagine where'd she'd be had u guys not been able to help her escape. U r angels.
Literally in tears reading this. You, Mark, your co-workers, professor and store owner are heroes.
The girls?
We were all horrified to find out she was being beaten. Cheri was the sweetest, kindest person. I'm the type of person people naturally trust and open up to. Cheri trusted me enough to tell me what was taking place.  I asked her permission to let me tell our coworkers and  the owner of the store what was going on. I explained to Cheri I needed help in order to help her. She agreed. 

I'm glad I asked for help. I couldn't help her on my own.
For real I was biting my nails reading this.
Thank you. Sometimes, it takes a village, but i have always been the type to stand up for people or animals who are being abused.
She is. She found me  on FB around 10 years ago. We have stayed in touch. She credits us with saving her life.
My sisters daughters.  One he adopted the other was his.
You are a true hero
I would have to agree with her
Oh god. So sorry to hear that.
It’s been over 30 years and I still freaking hate that man
My mother wants me to be her Surrogate Womb
Hello, I'm writing here because I was so surprised by the suggestion that I was left speechless and I don't know what to do. 


Context: As context: I am a 21-year-old girl studying at university. About a year ago, my mother had to have her uterus removed due to medical problems. This made my mother and my stepfather start having problems in their relationship because my stepfather wants to have children and, obviously, my mother can't "give them to him."


In the end, a month ago my stepfather left the house over this same issue, so my mother started obsessing over finding ways to have children. He even wanted to adopt, but my stepfather said that since it wasn't his, he wouldn't come to love it. Until he got to the topic of surrogacy.


She started researching the topic and saw that it was extremely expensive (in dollars, it would be around 30,000), so who was her cheap option? Yo.


On the same day (10/22/24), he asked me to be his surrogate. Because supposedly I am their only support network and because I wouldn't charge them anything. But when he told me, I felt an overwhelming urge to vomit and cry. She started saying that she wouldn't force me, but a moment later she talked about how beautiful pregnancy was and that she would talk to my university to get their support. 


I clearly don't want to have children at this age. Yes, I'm no longer a teenager, but I'm still young and I don't want to ruin my life explaining why I'm pregnant. In addition to this, I take psychiatric medications and an unwanted pregnancy would, in short, make me commit suicide. 


So my only options (considering my mother's personality) are: accept and live in depression or get kicked out of the house and not be able to study anymore.


What should I do? I'm really very desperate.
Your mom doesn’t want children, she just didn’t want her husband to leave her, in desperation she offered her own daughter like an offering to her husband.

You need to start planning, to distance yourself from them if possible because it is clear who your mom prioritize now.
Fuck no. You’re not an incubator.
Unless you are going to get pregnant via a turkey baster or the "traditional" way no clinic would consider you because of your age and not already having had a child. Tell your mother she needs therapy to deal with her loss and her feelings but you are not a womb for rent. It's sick of them to even suggest it.
They are both nuts as I am assuming he plans on impregnating you the old fashioned way.  No medical person will participate in this ridiculous scheme because you have never had a child.
run for your fucking life.
Your health comes first, and no one should force you into something like this. If possible, seek assistance from someone outside of your home, friends, university counselors, or even a trustworthy family member, to help you locate support and alternative living arrangements. You should put your mental health and future above this absurd request.
Please leave and go low contact ,I am genuinely worried about your safety because what your mother is saying is crazy and unhinged. I don't want anything to happen to you and as much as you think someone is family that doesn't mean they can't hurt you. Please stay safe and stay away from your mother and stepfather.
A man that says he can only love something related to him probably isn’t very loving to anything.
There are so many reasons to say no here.  The child would biologically be yours.  Your body will undergo a massive overhaul.  It will cost to inseminate you and psychologically, can you handle having your step dad sperm in you.  You may have a developmentally challenged child.  If the step leaves, mom can and probably will, give back your sister daughter.  You will have a sister daughter.  Your grades and social life will suffer.  Your mental challenges will be at DefCon.  Post partum is a thing.  Oh, and yeah, it could kill you.

Say no.  Mean no.  

Start looking for other living arrangements. Don’t let the idea of being kicked out force you into this incredibly awful decision.
This is is incredibly creepy. I would honestly reach out to the uni to see if they can help you find a way to move out - maybe they have hardship funds etc. Do NOT give in.
They generally won’t allow someone to be a surrogate who hasn’t had children before, especially someone who doesn’t want to. Even if you agreed, you would most likely be turned down.
Ok. Breathe. Take a step back and take 5 deep breaths. You are allowed to be panicked, but clear thoughts is definitely needed in this situation.

1. I am so sorry you are going through this. The fact that you have been asked is not ok.

2. The answer is no. No is a complete sentence. I do understand that likely won’t fly. Not sure where you are- but I know where I am (ONT, Canada) you need to have previously had a successful birth before you can become a surrogate- even for someone you know. It’s an expensive process no matter what, they want to ensure that everyone knows what they are getting into. 

3. Giving up a baby- even one that is not biologically yours, once it has lived in your body for 9 months is not an easy thing to do. If even a cell in your body is leaning towards yes- then please keep this in mind. You have never given birth (neither have I), but in everything I have read, it can be quite an arduous process.

3. Where on earth does your mother think she is getting the egg? I hope she doesn’t think that’s coming from you. And that is expensive in itself. 

4. Look into free therapy provided by your school. I don’t know what the US and other countries look like, but many of the Canadian universities have a lot of support when it comes to students. You need a trusted person on this one, clearly outride of your family, to rely on as this situation unfolds.

5. This is very clearly an unhealthy relationship your mother is in. It makes me worried for other aspects. Have a go bag ready for your own safety. If you can, ensure you get a good lock for your door. I don’t want to see anything happen out of desperation on your mother or her partner’s end. 

6. Look into shelters for victims of domestic violence. They help people get on their feet. Explain the situation. You are not feeling safe in your body as you are feeling pressured to use it to provide a baby for your mother. Work with them to develop a plan. If you get kicked out at 11 at night or god forbid they try to force something, you need to know where to go and have your bag packed to get there. Ensure you have some cash, your passport, SIN, birth certificate, bank info, everything you absolutely need. Also ensure that your banking info is not connected to your mother so if you need to go for your safety, she can’t track you

7. You are not alone. This won’t be easy, but I know you can do this. It’s ok to have the tidal wave of emotions before this is over. Fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, etc…. Are all ok. Be kind to yourself. If you are struggling during this time to keep up with school work, your profs are human. Let them in on as much as you feel comfortable with. Or just tell them your family situation is changing and your are requesting more time. Try and do this before an assignment is due, not after. Our brains don’t work at 100% when we are under threat. Ask for help when you need it.

Good luck OP. I am sending my best thoughts and strength your way.
All else aside, if you have this man's baby, he will do everything in his power to control you for the rest of his life, because you had his baby. He feels entitled to your body and your life already, imagine if you were the mother of his child
If you're 21yo, she was too old to have another kid anyway so she can't blame her uterine problems.  Sheesh. Say no, and mean it. Not "I'll think about it". Just say no.  If she kicks you out, then she won't have any kids left.
Someone mentioned in another family-pressure-to-surrogate that you cannot be a surrogate if you have not already had a successful pregnancy.
No. Just… no. OP, everyone has give excellent advice, I’m going to add:

- actual surrogacy agencies often *require* that you’ve already had a healthy pregnancy and children of your own before you’re even allowed to volunteer for such an intense service to struggling couples. There’s a *reason* for this - and it’s because, while pregnancy is “beautiful”, it’s also genuinely and 100% physically intense, medically intense, and can genuinely result in permanent physical damage to your body, to the baby, to both of you - up to, and including - death. You can’t properly agree to a risk like this without having first been through it. 

- surrogacy requires signed legal documents, healthcare payments, and all kinds of insurance for a reason. They don’t want to pay the $30k? Then that’s tough. Who would be covering your insurance and the birth payments? Who would be covering your necessities when it’s time to take maternity leave/leave of absence? Who is going to cover any surgery costs associated with the birth, if it comes to that? Who will be covering the expenses and losses to *you* when you put your entire life on hold to recover from birth - serious and dangerous medical process?

- What happens if stepdad *still* doesn’t bond to this baby? What happens then? 

- What happens if you agree to this, and suddenly stepdad (and mom, via emotional abuse and coercion) attempt to impregnate you via a… non-consensual way? (Stepdad asking is also so creepy - it makes me see red flags and concerns me over any warped ideas he may have for impregnating you). 

- what happens if you agree… but then, later, back out? What would they do? What would the reaction be? 

- There are so many countless ways this could go wrong, and you, OP, will be left without compensation or help because they are trying to emotionally manipulate you and guilt you into being a “free” surrogate.

- consider as well: if you agree to this: your mom’s age, your stepdad’s age - and, goodness forbid - what would happen to the baby/child if something were to happen to either of them? If you’re their “primary support”, you may end up with a kid. Even if you don’t agree to surrogacy (and you shouldn’t), you need to ensure that legally, they have other back up plans. 

You don’t owe them anything. 

I’d honestly push for your mom to get therapy for her issues and the abuse she’s dealing with from your stepdad. 

I’d also encourage you *and* her to read, “Why Does He Do That?” By Lundy - even if all you do is peruse the pertinent parts. It’s important. It’s also [free to read here.](https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/85477.pdf)


Be safe, OP. Be careful. Take note of any other red flags and plan accordingly for your own safety. Your stepdad sounds like a proper creep from what you’ve written here, and the fact that your mom is going along with this is beyond upsetting. I’m sorry you’re going through this, OP. Just be sure to call the police if needed, ensure all devices have voice commands on and working, and that you have a go-bag and a place to crash if needed.
Your family is asking awfully A LOT from a 21 year old. 

If you were crazy enough to fall for their shit, I would charge them more than what a successful surrogate would. Only because they think you can do it for “free” since you are family. 

It is completely your choice to have kids or not. You need to get the fuck out of there. They shouldn’t be putting their marital issues onto you. 

Stepfather is a complete dick as well. There’s something about men and adopted children. My parents adopted me and my dad always treated me less and different. He still does to this day and that’s a huge reason why I decided to go no contact.
Do not do this. Pregnancy is an extremely extremely peessure and stress on the body, lifelong side effects can be had and you will be depleting your body of every accummulated nutrient you have. Pregnancy is beautiful but it can also kill you  if handled wrong.

That’s all besides the point even, your mom is a fucking huge creep, politely handle this and say that you want to experience your first pregnancy with someone you love and she needs ti understand that. If the step dad wants that they should pay, she should get a side job or qhatever


This is so fucked up, do not do it, for any reason at all
Take this as a grain of sand since I dont know how illegal this is, but you could speak with your psychiatrist and have them put on paper that 1) the medication you are currently on is harmful for any fetus, 2) the medically-recommended withdrawal period is VERY long (i know some medications can take even 2 years to withdraw off properly and 3) any amount of this medication in your system can and will be harmful for a fetus.


In addition, I dont know how unhinged your mother and her husband are, but it might not be a good idea to have on your medical record that IVF or fertility treatments are not recommended: depend of how crazy they are, they might just not care about that and push for a "natural insemination" which is sadly not an uncommon thing with abusers.


My advice on the first paragraph isn't a permanent thing, but it could buy you time. Since your mother's husband (and your mother) seem like (pardon my words) pieces of shit, you could use a lingo to make them think that the fetus has a very high change of developing a cognitive and/or physical disability.



Please put *yourself* first and don't accept under no circumstance. You do *not* want this no matter how they try to twist it to make you feel obligated to. *You are obligated to nothing of this.* Depending of your country, the type of resources may vary but since you speak spanish, I assume you are latin american. You can search for feminist groups/"tías" groups (the ladies who help women get abortions) since they are usually more knowledgeable on the available resources of their countries.


Best of luck OP.
I suspect the stepfather only married OP’s mom because he wanted to stalk OP. That’s some serious disturbing sexual harassment right there. You hire a surrogate. You don’t go lurking after your stepdaughter like he does. is wonder what other red flags 🚩 he’s done around OP or other women.
If your father-in-law behaves like this, it would be better for them to separate, because his attitude does not bode well for the future of your mother or the potential child. Holding back a man with a child often ends badly. Honestly, don't be the surrogate mother, this seems dangerous given your health problems. In addition, the aftermath may be complicated to manage. Do you have other family members who could help or support you? And maybe make your mother understand that she is wrong in all of this? No matter your choice, she wants to destroy your future for another child? If you say no she cuts you off and if you say yes you risk suicide, it's getting rid of a child to have another... I'm sad for you, I hope your mother realizes this. all this before you get lost. Courage to you!
If your answer is no, the answer is no. For her to even pressure you and think you will be part of this is wild. Delusional even. Talk to your university and local aids, maybe there is support and aid you can sign up for and receive to start living on your own and still be able to study.
No. Keep saying No. Your stepdad will already be auditioning younger women to be his baby momma.
This is the most selfish thing I have ever heard. Stepfather is a total creep. Your body, your life. They should be supporting you to build YOUR beautiful life, not asking for something so outrageous. Don’t do it, please don’t.
By not doing this, you are saving a future child from terrible parents.
1: find a place to move into, friends, family, dorm, ANYTHING. 

2: do not tell them where you are going.

3: do not let them know you are going, in the hours they are sleeping, or not move move your shit out.

4: fucking run.
Nope..and time low to no contact. This is gross on many levels. Also..you would not even be approved to be a surrogate medically by a legit medical practice.

Talk to your university to get help and legal aid/info
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Your stepfather wants you to have his babies? And how exactly is he planning to insert them? And if you refuse you’ll get kicked out of the house? No matter what they’re telling you, THIS IS NOT NORMAL. This is absolutely not acceptable. Your stepfather is a creep and has your mother’s head turned completely around. I know it’s scary, but you really need to get out of that house for your own safety. Does the university offer access to counselling? You really need this, and they would NOT be on your mother’s side.
You literally will not be allowed to be a surrogate by any company as you have never given birth. There are a multitude of reasons for this from concern for your health to your developing possible attachment to the fetus. 

Call this what it is. Your step-father wants to rape you. Tell them that what they’re proposing would be rape, he would be charged, and you would medically abort the zygote.
The fuck is wrong with your step-dad? He's going to leave your mom because his ass missed his chance to have kids? He won't adopt because he wouldn't love the kid?

This guy has got some serious issues. I wouldn't even blink if you told me his heroes are elon musk and alex jones.
These people are insane
Jesus Christ on a cracker, what is your mother drinking to have this idea?

First of all, you are too young to go through with this, especially if it's not something you want.

Secondly, I really don't think you can actually go through with it. If I'm not mistaken, to be a surrogate you HAVE to have given birth before. I'm pretty sure it's non-negotiable to be even considered for surrogacy.
Talk to your doctor but pretty sure you can’t be a surrogate until after you yourself have gone through a pregnancy & birth.
Ah yes pregnancy is so beautiful. My partner was over the moon about feeling morion sickness almost all of the time for the full 9 and a half months. Not being able to stomach anything other than water and lightly buttered crackers for 3 months? Delightful! 

And the fact there are only a handful of positions that are not uncomfortable to sit/lay down, it’s magical.

Hard pass. It shouldn’t have even been a fleeting thought to ask their daughter to give birth to their sibling.
Your stepfather should marry a different woman.

Men if you want kids, marry women under age 40 who also want to, and can have, children. Don't marry an older woman who already has older kids.
Apart from, just, fucking NO. Please talk to uour University and warn them that she might well contact them with her bat shit crazy ideas, but make it crystal clear to them that she isn't speaking for you and you want nothing to do with it. You might also get some guidance/support from your university.
She can’t force you

If she calls the university, I doubt they would get involved on personal matters. Even if the school supported, it’s not their choice 

Try to find a new place to live and don’t listen to your crazy mom. You don’t owe her anything 

The fact that she wants you to do this for free is disgusting
Sorry to hear this. Overall right now you need to think about your safety first and school second. Even if you have to take a semester off from school . Talk to your school about your unique situation and see if they can provide you with housing or special scholarships. If not then see who’s willing to take you in and get a job and attend school part time/full time.
First of all, unless it’s done naturally (barf) you can’t legally be a surrogate until you’ve had children of your own. So tell them this tell them that the medical field will not allow someone to be a surrogate without bearing children of their own first. 

Honestly, I would not be alone with these people. I know it’s your mom, but it sounds to me like she’s losing her mind a little bit. And they are not safe people to be alone with.

You need to leave the house. Do you have friends or other family you can stay with? Honey please don’t do this for your mom. They are not mentally stable to parent. You are not mentally stable to be essentially graped by your stepfather to impregnate you. 

You need to tell your therapist / psychiatrist what is happening. You absolutely do not need to get off your medication. 

Tell your mother. She would be trading in one for the other because if he tries to impregnate you that you will unalive yourself. You were also not gonna be shy and telling everybody else if they kick you out of the house why you had to leave.
FUCK NO ! and how old is your mom?
Fuck that. They sound like toxic people that they’d even consider that. Your mom is obviously desperate to stay with your step dad but seems delusional on the actual impact that would have ?

I would talk to any sort of crisis people at your university that you need emergency housing asap.
This is so weird. What mother asks this from her own daughter? Don't do it.
Don’t worry, you’re not even eligible to be a surrogate legally until you’ve already carried a pregnancy to term- at least that’s what I understand. 

You also need to go through mental fitness tests, physicals etc. Oh, and you have to want to. No fertility doctor is going to go along with this. Not like you’re going to agree to do it “the old fashioned way” or use a turkey baster.
Tell her fuck no. Or ask her to pay you 100K usd before anything because you are risking your future having a child. Can you stay with some friends so your step dad doesn’t end up forcibly inseminating you?
They normally won’t approve a woman who’s never had kids to be a surrogate. So blame it on doctors
NO. And you’re NTA for saying no. Yikes. Your mom should leave that man if it’s something he just can’t deal with.
This is not a realistic proposal at all. I am so sorry you have to deal with that. 
You wouldn't be a viable choice if they legally arranged this. One the medication would be An issue. But two if i AM not mistaken, they don't allow women to be a surrogate if they've never had a child before.
That is besides the fact that this is just bizarre to ask of your 21 year old daughter of course.
You can't be one if you've never been pregnant before. 

Unless they're literally planning to have you either fuck your stepdad, or they're going to pump his semen into you with a turkey baster- ie, disgusting and legally questionable & definitely morally wrong methods that they may actually consider forcing you you- you cannot legally be a surrogate.

You need to find somewhere else to go. Easier said than done, I'm well aware, but you don't really have a choice. 

This is batshit and disgusting, and I doubt you are safe.
You can't be her surrogate if you haven't carried a pregnancy to term.  Case closed. And end the conversation with your mom every time she brings it up.
Do you know how much my hospital bill for having a baby was AFTER my insurance in the US?  $18,000.  OP, do your parents have 18k lying around?
Go to your financial services department at your university and tell them you are in danger of being kicked out and you need an avenue to grants and subsidized loans. My dad threw me out at 18 and this is what i had to do.
This crosses all the lines and is gross.

Also, why would they feel entitled to use your body for free?
This looks a lot like the plot of a horror movie girl.

Your mother is emotionally manipulating you and your stepfather seems to be a horrible person, don't give in to their pressure and if possible try to get a dorm at the university, they seem like very problematic people
Depending on where you live, there are rules/laws around surrogacy,  one of which is that you have to have carried a child to term before you can be considered.

Investigate the rules/laws where you live.  There might be an out.

Also, you can have your doctor state officially that, at this time, it would be detrimental to your health to come off your current medications. Thus ruling you ineligible for surrogacy.
I didn’t even make it past the second paragraph. Why? Because I just found out there’s a real possibility I can’t have biological children either. When I told my husband this, didn’t even skip a beat. No narcissistic need to create little cloned copies of himself. There’s over 50K kids in foster care needing a family. Your step dad doesn’t care about your mom if that’s a deal breaker.
Girl hell nah. This wouldn’t end well for anyone.
That’s super weird
No, no, no!! Ewww!!!

This grosses me out a ton, but that’s because it’s forcing me to remember how my mother-in-law told my husband and I that my sister-in-law could be our surrogate since I can’t have children thanks to chemo and radiation. 

Your mom is obsessed with the idea of having kids without any regard to how you feel, and honestly, it’s pretty telling in how she views you. I lost a lot of respect for my mother-in-law and actually had to tell her outright that I found her suggestion really gross and inappropriate because she wouldn’t shut up about it. Maybe you should do the same.

Also, logically and depending on your mom’s age, if she kept her uterus she probably would’ve had a lot of trouble conceiving anyway. When you reach a certain age (as young as 36 actually) you’re considered a “geriatric pregnancy” and there is a LOT more risk to having kids. Once you hit 40, the risk exponentially increases.
You can’t be a surrogate if you have not already had a child of your own.
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Absolutely not. Your mother is insane. She is willing to sacrifice a body of one child to have another? Nevermind the mindfuckery that will come with your progeny/sibling. Yikes and gross.
Well, to start: an ethical fertility doctor would reject you as a surrogate because you have never had children previously 

No one is entitled to your organs (even your uterus) and if you tell an ethical doctor that you’re being forced into surrogacy they will immediately reject you as a candidate.

Just because you’re family doesn’t mean you’re not entitled to financial compensation for carrying someone else’s baby. 

If your stepfather REALLY wanted children he should have married younger in life and unfortunately waited too long.
No way. Your mom needs therapy. And probably a divorce lawyer. Not a baby. 

Whose eggs would this baby be created with? Did she want you to do IVF or a more “natural” method? Because no reputable medical professional is going to allow a surrogate who has never given birth before. The way around this is a more “old-fashioned” approach, meaning your stepfather puts a baby in you!
Just tell them you need to be paid a normal surrogacy fee plus medical plus tuition and housing and whatever else you need. Make sure it adds up to a lot. If they want you to be a surrogate, you deserve to be compensated. Every time they ask you, tell them sure you’ll do it for $100k and eventually they’ll look elsewhere.
Just say no and keep repeating no.

You can’t be a surrogate if you haven’t been pregnant before.
Your stepdad doesn’t even sound like someone she should be having kids with anyway. You’ll be doing her a favor by saying no.
100 percent NO! They are insane suggesting this.
I am praying this post isn’t real. Wow. OP run. Get loans. Find a new support system. Soon, they might kick you out after baby so they can “bond” or you won’t even be able to study because you will become a live in nanny. Put yourself first.
That is just not right-how old is your mom and stepdad?
This is an outrageous request. You need to focus on building a support network outside of your family and creating oceans of distance. This shouldn’t have even been a thought, let alone something asked of you. It’s not normal or healthy.
HELL NO!!! THAT IS GROSS  HELL NO
First of all, DO NOT ACCEPT! Pregnancy AND childbirth is no joke (first time mom here) and usually to be a surrogate you have to have at least one child. 

It is extremely entitled by your mom and stepdad to just assume to do it for free, again pregnancy is no joke. Would they compensate you for your “lost time” at university? Probably not..

Getting a kid to save the relationship is the worst decision someone could make. He already walked out on her once, he’ll probably do it again. 

Lastly, imagine you’d be on different meds for other reason than mental health and stop taking it would result you in dying, would they still try to persuade you?

I’m sorry OP but this feels like they don’t care about you and your mental health at all.
Let them kick you out. You're not going to be studying successfully whilst pregnant under those circumstances. Way too much psychological trauma. 


Getting pregnant is going to affect your life a lot more than not studying right now. Actually it may be a good thing for you to work and gain some independence before you return to university.


Get far, far away from your mother and step father. This is not a normal thing to ask. 
If you need to stay in the house, just lie and tell them you'll do it after you graduate.
Listen I hate to go all true crime but this really makes me feel like step father actually wants to impregnate you specifically....
I honestly think this is an excuse for your stepfather to have sex with you, while also manipulating your mother into allowing it. That is what I think this sicko's ulterior motives are. This is beyond fucked up.
Hell no!

You are very young still to have a baby.  It would be alright if you felt you were ready and had a loving partner but thats not the case.

Many women don’t talk about this but they can have ongoing issues for years or even the rest of their lives after childbirth.  Usually they don’t mind too much as they get their own child but in your case you wouldn’t even have that as it would be for someone else.  Now you may not have any problems but enough women do that it should worry you.  

The other thing is that your first baby should be a big deal and special to you.  They would be taking that away from you.
You literally cannot be a surrogate unless you've had kids before. Any doctor would say this, even if you agreed with them. Their research should have told them this.

Be sure you talk to someone at your school about what is happening, like a teacher you trust or an advisor.
Don’t ruin your life!!

If you wanted to do surrogacy - then you could have charged for that. Tell them you can do that for a double rate of 60k and not doing it for free. Make them shocked as they did to you.


And while they are processing that - start thinking of how you can move out of their mad house. It’s not a safe place to be.

I am sorry this is happening to you.
This is a hard no. 

She has a child - you. If that's not enough for her, she needs to work on that herself. 

I suggest you avoid as much as possibly until you get a job and can support yourself. If you need to lie and say you'll do it after university finishes, do it. Your life is much more important than their insane request for you to be a freebie incubator for their new spawn.

Edit : I forgot to say that if you feel like you can't say no or lie to them, go to the doctor and tell them what's happened and you're being pressured into this. They can write you a letter stating that you are infertile. Pretend to be devastated and not want to talk bout it too. Overall, it'll get your mum to stop instantly.
Pregnancy is beautiful is when it’s your child from a man you love and at the right time in your life. Not if you give the baby away, also in the middle of your uni.

Plus, I wonder if they are planning to use your eggs? By IVF? Also, not a procedure you want to go through for free if it’s not to get your own child.

And if they plan to use your eggs - just be aware that you can sell them for a good price too. Not that I recommend that, just pitting that into perspective.
You can’t. You have never had a successful pregnancy resulting in a full term child so no doctor would allow you to be a surrogate anyway. It’s a moot point 

Don’t allow yourself to be alone with him. He may try to get you pregnant the old fashioned way by force
This is AI generated. Why does the gender keep switching when the other grammer is correct? Also surrogacy is 80k not 30.
And to save money you should expect to allow him to impregnate you the natural way.

Your lovely mom will watch so she can be part of this beautiful event.
I could not even for a millisecond imagine asking my daughter to do this for me.
No, on so many levels, no....
what in the handmaids tale 
Do not accept.
I would NEVER ask my child to do this for me! Never!!! Pregnancy is no joke and will completely change your body. Hell to the no!!!
Everything about this is dysfunctional
Where is your biological father? Bio grandparents? Family? To say this is a No!

Edit: IT is not far off for you step dad to ask if he can inpergnate you himself cause that don't cost anything.  And for your mom to tell you that he is a great lover and and the baby should be made with love! 

Seriously, advocate for yourself!
Well your step dad has said that your not his daughter any kid that’s not blood is not his. 

HE wanted to use your womb first? That’s some gross step-incest  BS ! Supper scary that HE wants to you be pregnant with his son. After he has started that he doesn’t believe you are his “daughter” 

He also wants to leave your mom. She’s HOW OLD and thinks now is good time to have babies? Did they plan this for how long before she had the surgery? 

If he will only stay with her for a baby - that’s not a strong marriage. If he forces either of you to do this - that’s not a good guy or a strong marriage. 

Normally - you’re not suppose to be a surrogate unless you’ve had children.

NOT paying you the normal fee is also a massive mistake and ethically wrong - they SHOULD cover all your medical and pregnancy expenses along the way- they sounds like they won’t do that .

Please tell the counselor at the school and get some support in your corner!
Americans are wild man “A mother wants her own daughter to become surrogate for her child”
YUCK!!!!
Nope out of there, this is super abusive. Might be time to move out, get a job & a roommate, hopefully you can find a good friend who wants to start out with you as you grow into your future.
Not only no but hell no.  Move out, rent a room, maybe look for a job that will help pay for schooling.  Apply for a nanny job where your housing is payed for.  Go work on a cruise ship.  Do anything possible to get out of there.
Something fucking tells me the stepfather will want to put the baby in "the old fashioned way."

What a creep. Fuck NO.
Tell her to be a mother to the child she already has. Also, no one should be their surrogate because they clearly are not going to last. No child should be born just to be their victim. Super gross, bc you know he thinks they will save even more money if he just has sex with you. I think that was the plan the whole time, some way for him to have sex with you and your mother is all for it
Don’t do it. This is abusive. And trust me, a man who would walk out on a woman because she had to have a hysterectomy is going to be a terrible husband and father. A mottler who wants to force her child to be a surrogate to keep her man  is being a terrible mother.  

Focus on getting out. Stay with a friend for now? Get a job while you are in college and save some money. Then asap rent a room in a house with roommates.  Do it!!!
Let me guess ... Your step father wants to inseminate "naturally" too.

🤮

OP, there's support out there to continue your studies. Leave this dumpster fire of a home and do not be their surrogate.
Don't do it.  Apart from all of your extremely valid personal reasons for not wanting to do it...   ....having a kid is not a valid way to save a relationship that isn't working.
I truly hope someone at your university finds a safe haven for you. This is something no parent should ask their child.
JFC run.
Please do not agree to this. They are exploiting you. Pregnancy is not usually beautiful…it is very, very painful and tough on your body in so many ways. It’s not uncommon to lose teeth and be left with lifelong back problems. There is a reason surrogacy is so expensive. Surrogates earn and deserve it.
She wants you to have a baby to save her marriage to a man who left her….

NTA
Go to your college financial aid office and explain what's happening. Maybe they can help you. Get a part-time job and rent a room. Post on campus for a roommate. 


I hope you find a way out! Don't give in to this insanity. If they try to kick you out, know that legally they have to follow eviction laws so you have time to find other housing.
Ask mom if she's signing you up to have sex with her husband. And of course it will take multiple times for it to take. That's the only way it's not going to cost a small fortune. I'm willing to bet he wants to have sex with you since it was his idea. Tell Mom you are not willing to sleep with her husband. And you aren't qualified to be a surrogate because you've never had a child and the prescription drugs you take.
That is the most disturbing thing I’ve ever heard in my life. Your mother needs to get some fucking therapy and realize that your stepdad needs to be removed from the house not you.
Your mom sucks. I would never ask my daughter to do this. I would do this for my daughter in a heartbeat but I’ve had my youth, I’ve had babies and pregnancies. I know exactly what happens to your body and the cost of a pregnancy. I know how your body reacts afterwards and how it’s life changing. She is a straight up asshole for even asking.
Pregnancy can ruin you. My body is completely fucked after having a kid. 

Don’t risk ruining your body carrying your first child not even for yourself.
You can’t be a surrogate, am pretty sure that you have to have had a baby before a reputable doctor will suport you to be a surrogate, the risk is too high otherwise, so it’s just a no
Your stepfather probably will want to do it "the old fashioned way" so you better get ready for that part of the talk too. You need to  get out of that house, OP.
I'm really sorry she's your mother, if I'm honest.
your mother needs to leave him, this relationship is toxic and adding a child to the mix is abusive.
No. Hell, no. Just no.  Take your chances with getting kicked out.  If you give in, mom and hubby will decide they want a second or third child.  You, of course, will be expected to provide this service.  Next thing you know, you are single, and 30 years old, probably, too tired to think about having children of your own. It's not wrong to reject this request.
A little while ago I was conversing with a woman who was very damaged by the delivery of her child, and now she is in constant severe pain.  The pelvic floor isn't an area to be lightly put at risk.  Damage there can be permanently and totally disabling, very easily.  Especially since medicine knows almost nothing about its nerves and its operations, compared to any other type of medicine.  Ask any standard doctor that a person might encounter about the nerves and muscles down there, and they will shrug, have no idea, and casually refer one to a gynecologist or gynecological specialist.  Meanwhile, EVEN THOSE MDs don't know everything about the zone.  It's very likely that one could end up trying to find two separate specialists to deal with two separate muscles or nerves inches apart, and have no freaking avenue to integrating their treatment plans, each of them disavowing any responsibility and saying it's the other one's job not theirs.

This may be an acceptable risk to run for one's own husband, one's own family.  But to be forced into it in order to receive the extremely minor benefits of having a place to live while in college is essentially slavery, and it has the potential of stopping your life's progress before you've even gotten started.

Tell your stepdad to go dangle it somewhere else, and tell your mom that 30K a pop is cheap for the risk that the process entails, and you would demand a high multiple of it.  How much is your future worth to you, anyway?  Because a life insurance payout seems about right.  The actuaries have done the math and know how much a life is worth.
Jesus Christ, this is sick and abusive. No. No, do not even think about saying yes to these horrible people. 

Listen, I don't think she will really kick you out, but even if she does, you will be better off than you would be having a baby with your own stepfather 🤢🤢🤮🤮. You are not a baby making machine. 

(And I can't believe the cheap bastard doesn't even think you should get paid. Does he think children are raised for free?? Does he think pregnancy and labor are not a sacrifice? What the actual fuck.)

Lots of people graduate college a bit later. Maybe you will have to go part time or put it off for a few years while you work. That's only a few years. Better than having a baby you don't want (that maybe these selfish crazy people won't even take care of). Better than having lifelong trauma because of this horrible situation. 

If they bring it up again, please SCREAM bloody murder at the thought that they would even think about using you like that. Seriously, scream at them. Go ahead and vomit and cry, right in front of them. Tell her she is not a mother. Tell him he is an abusive pervert. 

I am so sorry you are being treated like this. Stay strong.
This is so disgusting and disturbing. Your mother clearly never should have had children in the first place and certainly is NOT well enough to have another.

For all that is holy, Run away from her toxic, vile, ass and never look back. She’s a POS of a person.

Signed-Mom of a girl.
Please call 211 and tell them you need help living elsewhere (and talk to your university) - they may be able to get you into alternative housing. Listen to your gut on this one.💕
You cant even be a surrogate, mental health wise your excluded but also physically, a surrogate has to have had one live birth before.....so youre not actually an option
A baby won't fix their relationship
Your mother is crazy. And she is asking you to sacrifice your health and body to keep her ass of a husband.
Just get a job and move on with your life. Find a roommate to live with. Your mother is crazy for asking this  of you.
Your mother’s marriage is doomed. Even if you have a baby for her, it will not last. Your mother will be jealous of you. Her husband is a sicko. You might need to start looking for other accommodations of where to live. I’m sorry. Under no circumstances, should you be there surrogate
This is wrong on so many levels. Your mom basically is asking you to give birth to your sister... that's some tv drama Jerry springer stuff. Imagine the redneck people will think you are if you have to explain your giving birth to your sister. No was the obvious answer
If you have a relative, sister, cousin, friend who empathizes with you pack your stuff and get the fff out before you are “forced” into this. You will not be losing anything if you go no contact these are not nice people.
GIRL. RUN.

All this story shows a highly toxic relation between your mother and her partner. Your stepfather seems to be a narcissist human being, who wants to have a child only because he's obsessed about replicating himself (remember what he said about adoption). I think he doesn't care about your mother. He reduces herself to her reproductive system. There's no difference between her uterus and any other. He feels trapped, because he's desperate be a father at any cost.

Your mother seems to be terrified to be left alone, and will endure anything to keep her partner. As someone said here, she's ready to sacrifice you, your physical and mental health, and your future, to keep her relationship afloat. And the worst thing is that I don't think their couple is fit to have a child together. A child isn't supposed to be the Band-Aid that holds a relationship together.

I understand that you feel overwhelmed and miserable. She's delusional, as she shown when she started talking about making an arrangement with your university. It is extremely inappropriate to ask you to be her surrogate womb. As you stated, you don't want to have children, you're actually busy studying and you're taking medication that prevents you to take your own life. And knowing all that, she asks you to put all your life on hold, crippling your mental health, and without hope of any kind of remuneration. I don't think that she realizes it, but she seems to rely on her authority as your mother to impose you to obey, as the obedient girl you are.

At 21 years old, you're legally an adult. Stand for yourself. Your mother will definitely not be delighted by your decision, and it may make things difficult for both of you, but she can't force you.

Your body, your choice.
First of all eww, and no way. Having a child is not going to fix their marriage, and will in fact probably make it worse. I believe that the surrogacy screening process is quite thorough when done through a legitimate agency. I highly doubt they would let you be a surrogate, so if they wouldn’t, you shouldn’t do it on your own.
I didn't know where you live, but in the US you won't be permitted to be a surrogate if you have not had a child already.
There is a reason why you want to vomit. 


Dont ignore it, or reason it away
Do not do this. Say no. I’m amazed they’d even ask this of you. Stay away from that guy, and I pray that your mother leaves him.
You need to get far, far away from them.
I’m guessing this would be done through a clinic.  I know that usually they won’t let you be a surrogate unless you have already had a pregnancy and birth - and it has to usually be a textbook pregnancy and delivery since they wouldn’t want to have someone who had had a near death experience with a pregnancy be a surrogate.
My understanding is you can’t be a surrogate until you’ve had at least one of your own. There’s your out.
How old is your mother if you’re 21. I respect that he left. If you want children and your partner can’t give them to you for xyz then find someone who can. But I want your mother to find happiness within and not crawl after him. 


If your mother is willing to put a man, who isn’t even your real father, before her child then she needs therapy. Go to financial office and get on financial aid after she kicks you out if you are in the us. Your studies don’t have to suffer because of those two. Or you could just keep telling them you have to think about it, suck them as dry as possible and then go from there.
Dudes next suggestion is to try to get pregnant “the old fashioned way”. Mom’s crazy or they’re planning to fuck you.
Absolutely say no. There's so many kids they can adopt if they want one that bad. It's your body and will affect your life and it's an experience that should be for YOU and only when YOU want that, not someone else.
Move out! See if you can live in residence or find a room to rent with roommates. You don’t want to be anywhere near this train wreck. Your mom is hoping a baby will keep your step dad from leaving. You want to be as far away from this shit show as possible. Do not have an unwanted pregnancy. It’s your body. This is incredibly horrible for your mom to even suggest this. See if you have counselling services at your university. It would be good to talk with someone.
I wish you best of Luck.
Best if you sound the alarm about your crazy mom and step-father and get to a safe house.
Look at options for support from your university - in the UK if you are estranged from your parents there are many grants and bursaries that can be awarded for those who do not have relationships with parents who can support them financially.
I'm sure if you speak to your university funding office or student support services they can help you work out the finances.
Enjoy the rest of your life!
Also let the school know what’s going on, so they know the situation if she calls them 
Just no. No child will ever fix a breaking marriage. Just no. Your stepfather can't bring himself to love an adopted child but could love a child he has never seen, what a load. Just no. Pregnancy is really hard on a body, a mind and your relationship going forward with the child, your mother and your stepfather. Just no. Your mom  is having a midlife crisis that is bubbling over onto her family, she needs to talk to a qualified therapist. Just no. What if the child isn't healthy, are your mon and stepfather ready to face retirement with a kid that might require all of their resources. Just no.
This is wrong on so many levels, I don't even know where to start.
No doctor would allow this. They don’t allow women that have never been pregnant to be a surrogate. Even if where you live does as soon as you said who the couple was the doctors would never allow it
Please do not be their surrogate. Pregnancy is difficult and it comes with risks: Physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. It will change your body. There is a price to pay and you will paying it alone. Don't allow yourself to be used. Go to a homeless shelter if she kicks you out, but please do not get strong armed into doing something you don't want to do. You are better off alone than being used.
Just say no.
She's desperate to make him stay with her by giving him a baby but a child won't solve their problem. Poor baby...

If you don't want to do it, don't. You're not a "tool" and you're under medication. I would be clear about it: you don't even have to explain yourself!
You have two main reasons:

You do not want to be a surrogate parent.

Your mother, disregarding your emotional and psychological well-being for her own selfish motives, should not be raising another child.

She’s trying to have a baby to salvage a failing relationship, even at the expense of your health and safety, and she's engaging in emotional manipulation to make it happen completely disregarding your well-being. She shouldn’t be bringing another child into the situation.

This is emotional manipulation and can be considered a form of abuse, especially given your past struggles. 


It’s crucial to set firm boundaries. Make it clear that this will not happen, and if she brings it up again, you will cut off contact. This is a serious matter, particularly with your history of suicidal thoughts and the potential risks of postpartum depression. If you give in even a little, she will continue to push until she convinces you.
Why TF does step dad think you wouldn't charge them? Hell, I'd charge a premium. I mean, I wouldn't do it. It's super weird. But I'd be mad AF that they think I'd do it for less than the going rate.
You can't legally be a surrogate in a lot of places unless you've already had a child. 

Look at the laws / regulations surrounding surrogacy in your country.
Being the surrogate is clearly not an option. 

Are you sure you will be kicked out? If so, can you contact your university and tell them you might be made homeless? I don’t know what it’s like where you are, but in the UK the uni can offer help in difficult circumstances. Even if they can’t offer direct help, they might have services that could offer practical advice
OP, please leave this situation. This is so unhinged that I’m worried about your safety.
You can’t be a surrogate unless you’ve already had a child, at least in the US.
If you're going to make that decision, don't forget to take care of your mental health, and of course your physical health too (it affects both a lot)
Tell them you're charging market rates or GTFO. (half-kidding. don't do it. but if you do, get them coins)
Look to your university for help, do they have a counsellor you could talk to about this issue? Could they advise you about housing options? You need to move out because it is not safe to stay when you are being pressured like this. I am worried he will use it as an excuse to assault you. I don’t think he is intending on going the official route through a clinic as they would not use someone as a surrogate who hadn’t had their own children. Are there other family members or friends who could help you get somewhere safe?
I don’t think you can be a surrogate if you haven’t given a live birth before.
You can not legally be a surrogate for someone else no matter who it is until you’ve had a baby of your own. You also have to pass a mental evaluation. Which it sounds like you won’t in the head space you’re in. If they suggest doing it the old fashioned way to get around all of it will be disgusting. It’s basically rape because they will try to force you if you say no.
I don't think your mother realizes how complex this is legally and medically. The whole reason surrogacy is expensive is because it needs to be done properly to protect the surrogate, ensure their physical and mental health, to do IVF and to ensure that a legal framework is in place. 

A potential surrogate needs to have had a successful pregnancy and be physically and mentally able to have a successful pregnancy. It takes two years to recover from childbirth. Pregnancy is a serious medical condition. You have to say no for the medical reasons you've mentioned plus your unwillingness to become pregnant.
Don’t do it.  Their marriage is already in trouble.  A kid is not going to fix that
they need a welfare check
I don't think you can be a surrogate until you've already had at least one child.
Jesus Christ! Please don't do this. Just because your mom is too afraid to be alone doesn't mean you have to be. If they kick you out for this then fuck them.
You won't be approved to be a surrogate unless you have carried a pregnancy through a live, healthy birth.

Tell your delulu mother that. And do NOT allow yourself to be coerced.

My fear is that crazy, demanding stepdad may force himself on you to give him the children he thinks he deserves.  Do not be alibe with either of them!
It’s not your job to be a baby supplier to your mother and stepfather can rent out your womb to them. They have other issues that are bigger than what they’re asking you in the only difference between adopting and what they’re asking of you is that he’s the sperm donor of the baby do not let them bully you or blackmail you into this. It is your body, your choice, and just even asking you is beyond a normal situation it’s not your job to be your mother‘s baby factory. You were 21 and you have your life ahead of you next time you talk to them if they ask you again do not say no but say hell no and if they continue this discussion that you will go either know or low contact with him this is got your problem good luck and what they ask of you is a subject for the Jerry Springer show or Dr. Phil
Hey OP I am pretty sure to be a surrogate you would have had to have one successful pregnancy anyways. 

How old is your mom ? 

This gives me the major Ick. You’re only 21 , don’t do this. If they really want to they can ask a friend or go through an agency. 

There’s a lot that can go right in pregnancy and there is a lot that can go wrong. If anything goes wrong at all I get the impression they would blame you for things that are so out of your control.
If you can’t tell your mother no on this the majority of your adult life is going to suck. You may need to take more student loans to cover living expenses but it will be worth it.
FYI, you need to have already carried a pregnancy to term with no complications before you're considered a candidate for surrogacy.
idk where you live, but if its near and you need a place to crash for a while let me know. this behaviour is toxic. Get out if there ASAP.
No is a complete sentence, you cannot be forced into it if you don't want to
Updatebot, updateme
Absolutely not. Yuck.
Legally you can’t do it while not having a viable pregnancy before. 

Secondly don’t let this bitch gaslight you into believing it’s beautiful. Sure it is when it is YOUR KID. But she’s expecting you to suffer through all this for her failing relationship. This is so disgusting and out of line I’d start avoiding them. 


It only gets worse from here. Tell her no. If she tries to force you or kick you out tell the whole family.
Your mom is better off with this guy leaving her tbh. Pregnancy can be beautiful but it can also be DANGEROUS! It can quickly turn into a life or death situation at any moment and it can permanently change your body. Plus, postpartum depression/anxiety/psychosis can still happen if you don’t take care of the baby. Why should you have to put your life on hold for a year or longer? If he can’t love something because it’s not his your mom should have immediately said- okay so you can’t love me or my daughter? Bye. Reach out to your university and tell them you need support leaving an abusive home environment, they actually might be able to help you. Threatening to kick you out for not being a surrogate is a disgusting form of blackmail. Please reach out to other family members, friends, anyone
Angela (90F) is that you?
You mother is a fucking despicable human being. As a mother myself, I cannot begin to imagine a world where I would ever ask my child to take on surrogacy in order to keep a man. And the fact the stepfather is on board w it gives me weird kink vibes too.
That’s disgusting DO NOT do this. Women who do this have support systems and make 80K+ (idk where she got 30K but that is very low). Do not let her or that creepy man abuse your body like that.
OP, you know that reaction of feeling nauseated and horrified that you had? That was your answer right there. Absolutely not!

Your mother’s husband sounds like a real gem - won’t love a child he adopts? Leaves his wife because she cannot bear a child? What a nasty, cold person. If your Mom causes you problems in your life as a pressure tactic over this, then she will deserve it when she finds herself alone, without you or her one-foot-out-the-door husband.

You should talk with someone in financial aid at your university. Tell them plainly what is going on and your concerns that it may interrupt your course of study. Ask about grants, scholarships, loans, campus jobs, and housing options.
Don't do it.  Tell family that going off mental health medication would be detrimental to your health.  A doctor may validate that. 

Step father left house because mother couldn't provide him with a child.  Not a good scenario to raise a child in- he will leave.
Why does the surrogate need to be you? You haven't been pregnant before so doctors wouldn't want you to carry a pregnancy for surrogacy. You're 21 and they're just now wanting to have kids and are struggling in their relationship because your mom can't have them? This seems all too convenient of you being an adult and tbh that's a bit creepy of your stepfather to even think of you as an option. Your shouldn't do it for many reasons, you don't want to, it would be bad if not devastating to your mental health, and there are other people who are surrogates that they can go with. It's very very weird that they thought of you. They need to actually do research about this if this is what they want because I'm also almost certain you can't be a candidate either because I think you have to be at least 25 as well as having birthed at least 1 child, correct me if I'm wrong.
Welp. Get kicked out and start figuring it out. Anything else is mindblowingly ridiculous. You will have to pause your studies, get a job, and return to your studies later. Unfortunately some women will sacrifice their kids for some dick. I’d consider going no contact.
Start planning your move from their house. Look for part time jobs, hostels and shared places to stay. Get your documents and bank accounts in order. Check for scholarship and financial aid options from college.
You do not owe them anything. It would also be very, very hard to find an ethical doctor to implant embryos for a surrogacy into you because you’ve never given birth before. Typically surrogates who haven’t given birth in the past are not considered ethical or reliable carriers. You can say no. They do have other options.
Pregnancy forever changes your body.  It’s not a simple “have baby, go back to normal.”  Your periods change, your feet get bigger, your hair changes texture forever, your breasts are forever changed (bye bye perky), and more.  You could actually die in childbirth.
There are so many red flags:
- stepfather saying he's unable to  love a child who is not genetically related to
- leaving your mother about this
- your mother trying uncomfortable solutions just to get him to stay
- wanting to save money using you
- ignoring your needs and health

Also... Did they really say they'll kick you out if you don't do this?!

I think you should ask a legal opinion... Protect yourself
No. Just no.
Do not trade being a surrogate for your mother for her allowing you to continue living as you currently are. 

You're going to school still. Is there a dorm you could move into? Friends who could give you a hand while you get sorted out? Family members in the area? 

It's also possible that your mother is bluffing and you should call her on the bluff.
You CAN find ways to continue studying again. That is always a possibility for you. Start looking into your schools resources. Talk to a Domestic Abuse Specialist and tell him that your mom and stepdad are trying to blackmail you into being their surrogate. And you know this doesn’t exactly fall under the normal guidelines for domestic abuse. But you need advice on resources that can help you navigate leaving your home and also being able to continue your studies. 

Any family or friends who can give you temporary housing while you get yourself together. Take all your important documents with you.  You can do this. You do not have to live with your mom to pursue your goals and this will be a crash course in gaining your independence. 

You CAN do this. You DO have options. Good luck. Be brave.
Fuck no, also pregnancy and giving birth  is very taxing on the body, only when you are ready should you become pregnant
So wait a minute, does he not love you as his stepdaughter since you’re not blood related to him?? “I don’t consider you my daughter, but I’m perfectly willing to use you as an incubator.” 

This is bizarre and gross. Your mother’s behavior and request is deeply disturbing and unhinged. I assume they’re not doing this the legal way because you wouldn’t be approved by a clinic. Are they expecting you to actually have sex with him, or is this a turkey baster type situation? NTA and start looking into alternative options for paying for your education. Or, be willing to have some life plans disrupted while you put distance between you and them. Your mother doesn’t want more kids, she just doesn’t want to be without a man. You are not their personal incubator, wtf.
This feels like an unsafe situation for you.  Do you have access to birth control? Ideally, long lasting birth control that they don't have access to, or are aware of, such as the implant, shot, or an IUD? I have a bad feeling about this situation and about your stepdad. Stay safe and contact your university and see if they can help you.
Do not do this. If you think they may prevent you from staying in school talk to your counselor. There may be programs in place to help displaced students. Neither of these people needs to be trusted with another child they're willing to harm you to get. Please reach out to your support network and get out of this situation.
She wants you to give up a good bit of your college education so she can keep a man. Tell her no
Ewwww, your mom needs to throw that man in the trash
Ok, I've already commented but now i want to try giving you more practical advices.

First of all, what you are living could be considered abuse so get in contact with your therapist (I think you have one if you are taking medication?) and/or associations that help abused women or people who risk homelessness.

Ask also help from your university, maybe they offer some help to students who go through hardships?

Ask legal advice... Maybe a lawyer know some things we are not thinking of that can be of help.

Is your father in your life? Have you other family members or good friends who can help you?

And finally I suggest to lie to protect yourself if necessary: 
Maybe you can tell them you'll do it after college, or next year. If you are in a really dire situation lie. And then don't keep your word!
Get kicked out.
I just want to say I’m sorry your mother isn’t protecting you. As a 21 year old, you’re young you’re a child. Would she be okay with you getting pregnant otherwise??? It’s super young and she’s not thinking about you at all. Also I’m assuming your step father is around his 40s or 50s. Why is this something he’s so adamant about now?? The fact that he’s doing this later in life shouldn’t mean that it’s your problem 

She’s choosing him over you and you need to start caring for yourself, especially with the mental struggles that you’ve shared. Wishing you all the best and I hope you have other people to rely on ❤️ this is very inappropriate
If you are in the US, you are not allowed to be a surrogate without having given birth to child before.  You need to find another place to go. What about your father?  Grandparents? But don't let them guilt you into this.
They really ought to have done their homework before trying to force you to be a surrogate, because you’re not eligible. You can’t be a surrogate if you haven’t had a child before!
Ewww ! I can’t decide who is more disgusting, your Mum or StepDad so I will say both. 
Not your problem and the only thing you need to focus on is how to get out of that house and far away from your desperate mother who is prioritised her man over her daughter.
I’m pretty sure you can’t be a surrogate unless you’ve actually had at least one baby of your own. Maybe the rules are different in your country but I would at least see if that’s the case where you are. 

I think you really need to distance yourself from your mum and her husband. 

Please please please do not agree to this.
Don’t worry. No doctor is going to let a woman who hasn’t given birth before be a surrogate. It’s against the protocol for this procedure.
*No*. My mother wanted the same thing but now we have no contact, she hasn’t even met my son that’s almost 2 now, eventually I figured out she was just using me and her new husband turned out to be a convicted pedo not much of an upgrade from my father haha,anyway my point is you don’t really know who this guy is, you’re not obligated to do that, also pregnancy is not an easy thing to go through and your mother shouldn’t ever even ask something like that from you, you have to put YOU first. I hope things work out for you, believe me /anything/ would be easier to get out of including finding somewhere else to live than to have to go through 9 months of an unwanted pregnancy, maybe even end up getting an attachment to the child and not be able to take care of them yourself, or not have any bond and feel like you wasted 9 months of your life and let someone use your body as a tool to get a means to an end. And of course don’t forget it’s not just pregnancy, but then months of postpartum that could possibly put you in an even worse state mentally, and with some medications you might not even be able to take during pregnancy, in my opinion you should say NO and if you have to leave, then leave. I got kicked out too for a different reason and I know it isn’t easy but having been in a similar position, my biggest advice is to say absolutely not.
Nooooo
Noooooo
That is a very selfish thing to ask your YOUNG ADULT daughter. That’s also cringe as fuck for you for knowing you have your little bro in there. 

But how do you feel? 
Sounds like soon they might start manipulating you.. do you have someone to talk to?
You may want to start talking to your university about tuition and housing assistance. However, you honestly may not qualify to be a surrogate. Doctors usually require surrogates to have a history of a healthy pregnancy. So, if you don't have a child, most doctors won't agree to the arrangement. They also do an extensive psychological screening.
I would tell your mom that her time for trial and error is long over and she needs to accept the hand she’s given herself.  Please contact both your local and university’s authorities and request to document this threat.  I would treat them as walking Rapists in waiting.  Do not go near those people.
I’m baffled reading this, absolutely not.
You should go to the dean's office (counseling dean, student support, etc.) at your university, tell them the whole story, and ask for help moving into a dormitory ASAP.

Most universities are pretty used to parents being shitty - undergraduate is when parents start acting badly due to their control over their children slipping. Depending on the caliber of the university (public vs. private) there's often discretionary funds available to get students out of abusive situations.

If you have to withdraw and get a job to keep yourself safe, you will want some help doing that in a way that cuts your losses most cleanly and allows for readmission when you're ready. University administrators have seen all of these things happen before. If you want to transfer to somewhere further from home, or go on an exchange program, or get an internship in another city (depending on your field and skills) those things might well be possible.

In telling the story use words like, "I'm creeped out by the idea of getting pregnant in any way, especially by the idea of carrying my stepfather's child." All parties can know that you would feel safer and attend to your studies better in a dorm.
Pregnancy is still, in 2024, the MOST dangerous thing a ciswoman can do to herself. 
If you're in 'Merica, 1) multiply that risk 10-fold. 2) who pays for medical complications for baby or you? 3) Do you live in a state where abortion is restricted, in in process of restrictions, at all? If so, HELL NO 4) Even before all this antichoice nonsense, 'Merica has the highest rate of neonatal and maternal complications and DEATH 
Within or outside of USA: 4) Who pays for your lawyer for the incredibly intense contract you'll need to draft? 5) Who pays for your cost of living expenses when you can no longer work or study, due to pregnancy/complications 6) What if complications arise that alter your fertility. 

It's a thought borne of desperation. Don't do it. You are not your mother's incubator.
It is YOUR body. You have ZERO obligation to oblige your screwed up parents’ requests. Please decline, go low or no contact if necessary, and enjoy being 21! 

I would never in a million years ask my daughters to sacrifice their bodies in such a way for my own selfish desires.
What the actual F? Did she even consider her ovaries could still be making or holding some eggs? Ovaries don’t stop working because the uterus is removed. She could try to get them harvested and go for surrogacy.
Mom here. Sweetie it’s your body. Absolutely tell them no. That is so selfish of them to ask you that. And don’t let them make you feel guilty for saying no. It’s not your problem.
If you haven’t had a successful pregnancy, you can’t be a surrogate and there’s no other way around that
She is one of those women who is desperate for a relationship. If he doesn't leave her over this, he will leave her over something else, and then what? She will be a single mom. He needs to accept the situation for what it is or he is not the man for her. 

She of all people should know what pregnancy does to a woman. Our bodies are never the same (though you might do better since you are so young). It is not a fair ask of them. It is huge. 

And think about this, you are not emotionally strong. Pregnancy can do a real number on our mental state. 

Plus, what if they don't raise the child like you would like? What if they divorce? What does your kid call you?

Don't do it. You think you're depressed now. How will you be when everything is a mess?
I have a daughter your age. The idea of asking her to carry a pregnancy for me is repulsive. If your mother has the audacity to ask you, she has a very dysfunctional view of you.
If your of a mind to do it then do it, if not... don't.
He's leaving her over this, what's to say he won't leave her over something else and then leave OP with the task of raising her sibling-child?
Ask a relative or friend if you can move in with them.
OP, I'm sorry but your folks are fucked and you need to learn boundaries now and reclaim your young life before they claim it. I was your exact age when my old folks got ahold of me, I took care of them for years and I'm 29 with nothing now. Run away.
Youre 21 years old and have never been pregnant or carried a child to term. You would legally not be allowed to be a surrogate anyway. Assuming they mean to do it through the proper avenues, and not direct insemination 😬
If you’re in the us, I think a person is only allowed to be a surrogate if that person already had a healthy pregalnancy
Tell that comemierda that if he wants to have children he can get una sucia pregnant and then take the kid. Guaranteed to be his.  Sounds like the kind of asshole that would have no problem doing that. You are under no obligation to fix their marriage. What’s left unsaid is that your mother should be fine raising someone else’s kid since that’s what it looks like she is ok with. 

Man that is crazy.
get out gurl
Fuck no, leave and never look back. You will hear them cursing you from behind, but there are millions of millions of people who would NEVER ask you to to ruin your body and I bet 100% you are worried she is going to hang her failed relationship over you like a dead fish. 

She will. And it made me sick too. Fuck them.
Men who

>said that since it wasn't his, he wouldn't come to love it.

Don't deserve children. 

Can you imagine saying that to a single father or mother you were dating?
This is an EASY answer!!! You legally can NOT. To be a legal surrogate you would have to have successfully carried at least one child before. No doctor will risk their license implanting an embryo into a surrogate who doesn’t fit the legal criteria. The only way to get around it would be to umm…yeah no that’s not happening. So you’re in the clear.
Your mother is a disgusting human. 

Sorry, that’s probably not fair. Using this single story as basis to judge, your mother is a disgusting human. Her husband doesn’t love her, because if he did she would be enough even if she can’t be his incubator. Your mom doesn’t want another kid, she wants to keep her husband and trash your body in the process. She needs to speak to a psychiatrist and tell the husband to kick rocks. 

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Have you been completely honest with her about your incredibly valid concerns? If you have and she still pushes you, the disgusting human judgement stands
Say no, this will do a lot more harm than good in all of your relationships with each other. I can't believe your mother would ask you such a thing! What an incredible weight to put on someone. I'm sorry. I understand it will be a struggle with it being your mom, but your gut reaction is exactly what you should be telling them. I hope the best for you
So.  This is awful.  But if you may have options.  If you are in the US and they try to use a reputable clinic, you might safely play along for a bit because you will be dismissed as an unacceptable candidate almost immediately.  A prospective surrogate must have had a previous uncomplicated, healthy delivery.  There are also multiple psych evaluations where you could safely tell the staff that you are being coerced and they would simply quietly disqualify you.  


But I'm afraid that would just buy you time, because your mother sounds unhinged.  


I'm so sorry.   I hope you can get free of them.
Hell no! I would never ask that of any of my daughters! Especially at your age. While I loved being pregnant, it does change you. It changes you physically of course but also emotionally. And it's not always temporary. 

The first time your pregnant should NOT be to carry your sibling! And that's if you even ever want children. No one should try to make you feel like you HAVE to give up YOUR body for their personal use. 

Your mother and stepfather have some big issues they need to work out that do not include bringing a child into this world. Your stepfather sounds like a douche BTW. 

Do not give in to their pressure. There are many ways you can continue to go to school. It may take longer, but it's better than being forced into a pregnancy. I know how going off psychiatric meds can really mess you up, and combine that with the hormones of pregnancy.... That's not healthy for you or this child they want you to carry.
That suxks for your mom.
Don’t do it
This is vile.

Please start looking fow a way away from them.  Check with your university, maybe they can help.

Do not do this.
To me, they do both sound like they are completely out of their minds! Get away from their presence as soon as possible - family or not, this will not be going to end well, believe me!
nah  fking NOO
I feel unsafe FOR you. Please run away this is some horror movie plot.
>because I wouldn't charge them anything.

Who says you'd do it for free?

I'm not saying you should do it at all but for them to assume you'd do it for free is crazy on top of their crazy request. Give them a number and they'll back off when they realize you'd want to be compensated just like all the other surrogates. Start at $70,000 and the more they piss you off, the higher the price.
OP please speak to someone at your college. They will help you navigate various programmes that can help you get funding. This is abusive and I wouldn't put it past them to force you. And I don't see them paying for insermination. He is not past forcing himself on you. You need to take this seriously. Go to the school and ask to speak to someone. 
The fact that your mother says "she wouldn't force you" means that there is a world where she considered TO force you. 

You need to get out of that house.  Your focus should now be on finding a way to get independent, even if it means going part-time with school and increasing your work hours. Make sure you have your important paperwork - birth certificate, social security card, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if this comes to a head suddenly and unexpectedly and you need to be prepared.
Absolutely not. Having a baby is a big deal, giving birth is hard on your body. Tell her no once and wish her the best, genuinely in finding a surrogate, and that you don’t want to be asked again. You don’t owe anyone that. And she would never ask if she loved and respected you more than the idea of a child. She’s just desperate to keep her husband. Disgusting
Oh dear lord. Surrogates are expensive for a reason. Pregnancy takes a toll on your health. Every pregnancy you have increases the risk of complications for a future pregnancy (specifically thinking of one issue which is new blood vessels form over your uterus with each pregnancy increasing your risk of excessive bleeding during a c section which happened to me on my last child and my only c section). 

Your mom is in an emotionally abusive relationship and trying to use you to save it. If he wants a surrogate, he can pay for one.
Getting impregnated by your stepfather against your will is sexual assault. He wants to out his semen in your vagina, so you two can have a child together, and your mother is pressuring you to do it. You would become a parent, with your stepfather, and that would be YOUR child, not your mother. 

It is also possible that your stepfather wants to have sex with you, and will claim it’s to save money over in vivo fertilization. 

Even if you went with in vivo fertilization, it’s inserting his sperm into your vagina in a clinical setting. 

This is abuse. Leave. Now. This has an entire aura of threat about it. The worst it could get is rape, so freaking LEAVE. If your mother would kick you out unless you allowed her husband to impregnate you, then she’s trafficking you. Escape. 

I knew someone who was a surrogate twice. The ONLY ethical way to use a surrogate is to go through an established, reputable surrogacy agency in your own country, such as the U.S., where I live. The agency made sure the woman I knew had already had kids, was completely done having kids, had easy pregnancies, straightforward births, and passed rigorous psychological testing to ensure she’d have no emotional trauma giving up the child. It was also not permitted for the surrogate to donate her eggs. Otherwise, she’d have the legal right to keep the baby. The woman felt like it was an incredible gift to help a childless couple, and she absolutely loved being pregnant. She felt so moved, seeing the two couples she’d helped hold their miracle babies, and she never thought of them as her babies. 

No one should pressure family to be a surrogate.
Most care providers won’t allow you to be a surrogate you haven’t yet achieved a healthy pregnancy resulting in live birth. Your doctor may be able to say no for you. But you need to be prepared to say it for yourself as well. 
And start making moves towards more independence from your mom if your honest interpretation is that she’s going to kick you out over this. Maybe cut back school hours to make time for more income. Not ideal but will allow you finding for a place to live while you finish school.
No. Being a surrogate is a deeply personal decision. Even with family.
Dude wtf? Your mom is HORRIBLE. I even feel guilty asking my kid at college if I can borrow 20 dollars if we are out and about and only cash is accepted and I don’t have cash on me. Which I’ll pay back within an hour. Like what the actual fuck! 

No. You don’t owe her this. Pregnancy nd childbirth can be dangerous. Do NOT do this. I’m appalled.
Say no and stand your ground.  You don’t want a pregnancy.  Your mom only wants it because she’s afraid this man will leave her.  

This man will leave her no matter what.  Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.
Ewww no please. Try to get some loans from your school and find a room you can rent because what your caregivers are asking you is weird af!! Maybe get a part time job to help with paying rent, it’ll be hard but you’ll have your own freedom.
With the way your stepdad talks about wanting only “his own” children and asking you to carry his child, and the fact you live at home, this is *even more dangerous for you.* 

You are young and single- you can find housing somewhere. Ask your university about housing or assistance finding housing resources, move in with a friend(s) temporarily, do anything except stay with your parents and especially don’t give in and become a handmaid.
you deserve to make choices that are right for you, you dont have to deal with this alone, try talking to some of your friend to seek for an advice,, take care
No. Just no.  Tell your mother and creepy step father to find someone else. wtf?
This doesn’t even sound legit.  Sounds made-up. And the answer is no, absolutely not.
They don't let women who haven't had kids be surrogates.  You have the perfect excuse.
When I was 19 my mom had her uterus removed. She already had four kids and her husband, not my dad, had three. Shortly after her hysterectomy my asked me to have a baby for her. She said that we could just use my egg and I could have the baby, but then give to her and it would look just her and her husbands baby since I look so much like her. 

It was one of the most screwed up things she’s ever said to me and she’s said A LOT. I understand your pain over this. I’m not sure what the rest of your relationship with your mother is like, but if this is any indication I recommend counseling sooner rather than later because my issues make my life harder sometimes. Therapy sooner would have helped. 

Lastly, I want to say, please stand firm and don’t give into your mom. If her husband wants to leave her because she can’t have a baby with him, he’s going to leave her sooner or later and now there’s another baby suffering with your mother as a parent.
No, don’t do this. Pregnancy is complicated and dangerous and it’s going to affect t your studies. 

Go see a counselor at your university ASAP. You need support navigating this, and you need to document their craziness, just in case they get more crazy.
OP, I don’t know how long you have to go before you graduate, but until then I would find a friend or family member to move in with. I’d also talk to your advisor or counselor at school to give them some idea of what you’re dealing with. They may be able to guide to help with finances and/or mental health. Your mother has put you in a horrible position. It is not your responsibility to save her marriage. (It sounds like she’d be better off without him!) This all sounds so manipulative that I suspect your step-father has a bigger plan ( like personally inseminating you). Tell them no, no, NO in no uncertain terms.
You're not a "rent-a-womb". You're your own person with their own free will. Use it. 
Girl no!!! They’re not even paying you!! They want to use your body because you would do it for free (in their head). Don’t be a doormat, don’t be desperate to please them say there is no way in hell you’re doing that.
what they are pressuring you to do is illegal, immoral, physically and psychologically dangerous for you. NO, NEVER is the only answer. get away from them, and tell every adult in your life what they are pressuring you to do. build your support team; no sane person would ever want to risk their child’s life in this way. if someone doesn’t believe you, tell someone else. your mother and stepdad are monsters.
Abso-fucking-lutely no. I'm sorry your mother is going through this, but your stepfather is a monster, and the last thing you want to do is get wrapped up in any of this. Let him leave her. She will be better off. And tell your mother that this request was extremely gross and inappropriate and that you will be setting severe boundaries with her if she brings this up ever again.
This sounds like something you would see on hulu or Netflix. Your mom wants you to carry the seed of your step dad in order to have your little brother who would actually be your child? This is top 10 craziest shit I’ve ever read on Reddit. I’d much rather believe you’re trolling than to think there’s people as sick as your parents. As far as school talk to an advisor and let them know you’re going to be transferring to community college, get you a job, find an apartment and go from their. If being dependent on your parents comes with what you mentioned it’s time you start doing your own thing
I very nearly got coerced into being a surrogate by my ‘best friend’ a few years after having my son, she couldn’t afford to do it properly and said we’d ’turkey baste it’ 🙄 
Baring in mind she was considerably older (late 40s early 50s), both her and her partner (an affair partner, she used me to get away with that but that’s another story) both had considerable health conditions which could have been passed down. I eventually said no due to x y and z reasons. She didn’t speak to me after that but I wasn’t going to bring a child into the world in good conscience because it wouldn’t have been a good life for anyone involved. 

Stand your ground if you don’t want to do this.
This is abuse. Do you have a job? Whether you do or don’t, I would recommend getting into serving/waiting tables because you make a great deal of money that allows you to pay your own bills while you’re still in school. I would start looking for a roommate ASAP and get out of there. That is such an uncomfortable situation to be in and that would make anyone feel dirty. Try to find a restaurant that is busy where you will make consistent good money and save up about $4k before you get an apartment. That’s what I did. I’m 23 and in school. I had to take a year off from college to stabilize things in my life financially but I’m so happy that I did because although my family’s drama wasn’t as bad as yours, it was still bad and I had to get out. Good luck!
Do not let them force you into surrogacy. Pregnancy is not easy emotionally nor physically. Unless you genuinely want to, I would not even allow it to be a question. Hard no, and be done with the conversation. That’s also messed up that they want you because he sees it as a “cheaper” way. Absolutely not. 
Hell no
FUCK.THAT.NOISE.
A baby is not going to fix the relationship between your mother and step father. Honestly he sounds like an abusive AH punishing his wife for a medical situation beyond her control. 

You also need to make clear that the medication you are taking is not conducive to pregnancy. Some psychiatric meds can cause birth defects. 

Tell them no. You will be far better off moving out and being away from this because it doesn’t sound like they will stop obsessive.
So they want you to carry your step Dad's child?! This is some weird incest dynamic and gross. I know he's not biologically related but still. This is some Jerry Springer nightmare.
NO is a complete sentence. 

I’m real horrified your mom asked this. And your stepdad wounds like he’s looking for a reason to leave anyway. 

Which means you’d probably be on the hook for helping your mom raise your stepdad’s baby. 

Just… NO 

(and I agree with the previous poster that this is probably your step dad’s way of trying to justify having sex with you. It might be the reason he’s with your mom in the first place; creeps are known to weasel their way into older women’s lives for this purpose) 

this is such a grave offense I’d really consider going no contact with *both* of them. 

Idk where you live, but your university might be able to help you find resources so you can finish your studies and get the hell out of there. 

At 21 I’d assume you’re getting toward the end of your program, so it’d be a shame not to finish, but this is bonkers and you can’t stay with these people. This is a “run away in the night” situation
No no no no no.

Not only does it sound manipulative in their part but I would absolutely not have a FIRST pregnancy as a surrogacy.

I didn't even like pregnancy when I wanted my own children. I cannot imagine my family trying to convince me to carry a baby for them.

Pregnancy is a very difficult and scary time (and joyous and beautiful) but it can put your health at risk.

Please don't do it
No is a full sentence.
Do they want a child right now? 
If possible, try to lie to them and tell them you'll have the kid when you can be on your own feet and escape that hell.
Good luck, and I wish you the best!
No ethical doctor will allow a 21 year old who has never been pregnant be a surrogate. They would have to do it the old fashion way 🤮
UPDATEME
Depending on where you live, most women can not be a surrogate without having a successful, uncomplicated pregnancy...plus with your medical condition, a doctor wouldn't recommend it.

I say go get a one hour psych evaluation, and have the doctor put in writing that pregnancy at this time is not recommended due to the unknown status on if you can safely carry with no previous history of pregnancy and your medication(s).
If you are in the USA, you cannot be a surrogate without having at least one child of your own.

If you are not in the USA, look up surrogacy rules in your country.
Your feelings are valid, and it’s important to prioritize your own well-being.

First, remember that you have the right to say no. Carrying a child is a huge decision, especially at your age and given your circumstances. It’s important to communicate your feelings to your mother clearly. Consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor who can provide support and help you navigate this conversation. Focus on your studies and your own future, and seek the support you need to stay strong. You’re not alone in this
Updateme
Contact the domestic abuse hotline. You are being abused. 800-799-7233 if you’re in the US. 

Your mother and stepfather are threatening your housing as a way to coerce you in to being a brood mare for them.

If they can’t afford a real surrogate, how do you think you’re going to get pregnant. I’ll tell you, that man wants to have sex with you and this baby nonsense is how he enrolled your mother in to helping him rape you. 

The domestic abuse folks can help you tap into resources in your own community. Even a women’s shelter would be better than your mother’s house at this point. 

I don’t think you’re safe in that house anymore.
No
What if you get pregnant and then mid pregnancy they split up or decide they don’t want a baby anymore? Congrats now you’re a mom of an unwanted pregnancy
Wow your mother and stepfather are completely self absorbed. They know about your mental health challenges and still expect you to come off your medication so they can have a baby. 
Having a baby isn't going to fix whatever's wrong with their marriage, and something more is going on to make your stepfather leave like that and your mother knows it. She's just hoping this baby would be a magical fix for everything. 
Do not become their surrogate and find a way to remain in school even if it's without their help.
If you decide to do it: tell them you will do it for $15K and you want to live rent free until you are cleared by the doctor and healed from the pregnancy (could be a year or two until you feel like you), you are able to find your own place and until you have completed your studies and found a stable income. 

$15K is to help you have an emergency fuck off fund in case things ever go bad so you can GTFO quickly from their household, a bad job or abusive SO in the future. Be smart, protect yourself.
I would contemplate even going as far as contacting the police for advice, I'd suggest a specific support place but God knows who deals with that. You are being coerced if your housing ends up being threatened.
I take psychiatric drugs as well.

When I found out I was pregnant, my doctor told me to stop them immediately. They can cause birth defects and unwanted complications. It was very tough for me, but I was monitored the entire time.

Tell your mom you’d love to help, but the baby may have lifelong disabilities. Going off your meds is out of the question. You’d need to go off well before any pregnancy because your system is saturated. So, you’d be in jeopardy for a long time. 

BTW, stepdad sounds like a creep. He’d leave your mom if she can’t produce a baby? He wouldn’t love an adopted child? Mom is going to call your university to get them on board with what they want but you do not?

Their only solution is imposing on, and bullying mom’s own daughter with this nonsense. If stepdad wants kids that badly, let him pony up the dough.

He doesn’t want any inconvenience or expense, so he’s pushing you? Your mom may be better off without him. Besides, he’d be a crappy dad if the way he’s treating you is any indication.

I’d just go the it’s not medically viable route. Maybe even get a letter from your doctor that stopping your meds would be a danger to you and the baby. And taking them would be even worse.

Tell her what’s going on, and enlist her aid. She is probably a mandated reporter. Maybe a threat by her to call CPS because mother and baby are in a threatening situation. Or because mom has gone off her meds and is a threat to herself and the baby. And you’re living with people who are forcing you to do this against medical advice. They are using extremely poor judgement, and not fit to be parents. If mom and stepdad won’t listen to you, they will listen to a healthcare professional who has the ability to have the child removed. 

I can’t even imagine what you’re going through.
Holy balls RUN! Do not become a free incubator for your step dad ... What kind of lunatic would suggest such a thing?! 

This is all kinds of messed up, how could your own mother ask that of you?! What if you give birth to their child but they don't take good care of it? What if you fall in love with the baby and don't want to hand it over to them to raise?? Run.
I think the bigger problem is that you don't have a way to support yourself yet.   
Find help, please look for any source of \*legit\* help in your real life. Does your university offer any kind of support if you get kicked out of your house? Is there an advisor you could turn to? Talk to your teachers, classmates, relatives, and friends. If you have any grandparents, uncles, aunts, or cousins, decide if they're trustworthy and ask for help.  
If nobody could help you at this point, then get a student loan, work part-time if possible. And definitely work hard, because you're on your own now. Surrogation is not an option.

Your reaction and feelings are totally valid. Your stepfather is disgusting to even suggest that.
Girl, move out. I know it’s not as easy at it sounds, but nothing is more difficult than carrying someone else’s child. You can put your studies on hold while you find a job and a place to stay. Just listen to EVERYONE here
Move out. Get a job. Go no contact. See if you can get a scholarship or loans. If not, take classes outside your working hours and get through school more slowly. Anything is better than being used as an object. I mean, they want you to bear your stepfather's child to preserve their shaky marriage and because they're too cheap or too poor to hire a surrogate? How long before Creeper Stepdad points out it would be cheaper to conceive the child in the regular way? Yuck. Just a thousand times yuck. Run.
OP this is abuse. Please seek help from your university, your health insurance provider, do not keep this secret - tell everyone in the family their request and that you are being both manipulated and subtly forced! It is a shame your Mom had a medical condition resulting in a hysterectomy but that has nothing to do with you.
I thought the medical community generally wants surrogates to have children already before being a surrogate
Omg hell no
Jesus fucking Christ
Your only option is not to do it.  Do you really think you can have a baby and stay home and go to school?  

Who do you think is going to wake up in the middle of the night to feed it?

You will carry it, nurse it, and care for it.   And then you will have guilt for the rest of your life when you realize how fucked up it's parents are. 


Make an appt with a therapist and ask your mom to go with you to the doctor.   Let the therapist help you both set boundaries.  

You're considering  a permanent life altering solution to a temporary problem.

Both your step father and your housing are temporary problems.  A baby is forever.
This is all wrong. You wouldn't be a candidate anyway because of mental health. If they are going about it the right legal way. You have to go through a whole health screening. Second, that man is going to bail on you and your mom. If this is a deal breaker for him! And if they are trying to save money by asking and threatening you with school and home, they can't afford it. And how will you feel carrying a baby for 10 months, giving it to them, and seeing that child every day. With your mental health??
You're not an incubator but he's also not the kind of dude who deserves kids. He wouldn't be able to bring himself to love an adopted child? Red flag. That's the kind of mentality in the same people that can't love their kid if it turns out queer or disabled or anything other than expected.
Bro tell ur mom to stop cooking
She can't force you to be a surrogate. She cannot pressure you with threats of being thrown out of the house. This only works if you're willing to be a surrogate. But this also means you now have a child with your step dad which I'm sure you're well aware is fucked up.

Firmly say no that it's your life and your body and you choose with whom you want to have a child with. Pregnancy is beautiful when done right.
If the stepfather is leaving because of this issue, a baby isn't going to fix it for mom.
There's the fact that at least in the UK and maybe USA that surrogates need to have had a successful birth already. Unless you've carried a child before you wouldn't be eligible.
And he’s going to leave her anyway.
The Bible has a story like that... it worked out great for Abraham and Sarah.  The drama with her handmaid was so overrated. S/
It is possible the mother is grieving the loss of the ability to carry more children.  After my hysterectomy at 24 years old, the grief hit hard about the loss of potential.  Although I never asked anyone to be a surrogate for me....but it did break my heart every time my toddler asked for a baby brother or sister. It took me years of therapy to come to terms with just the loss of the potential of another child down the line.  I'm absolutely appalled by the mother btw, I would never ask anyone, especially not my child to be a surrogate for free (I wouldn't ask my child period) 


I'm definitely not saying the mother is right, she clearly needs a lot of help. OP should reach out to their university to find out if there are any resources for housing they could assist with so she can get away from this messed up situation. 
[deleted]
Exactly this. She doesn’t want to be alone. She’s realizing that OP is leaving the nest and doesn’t want stepdad to leave as well. Let’s say OP did go through with this batshit crazy idea (which please absolutely DO NOT DO THAT OP!!!) what happens when mom and stepdad want a second kid? Would they expect you to keep being their cheap incubator? Babies don’t save marriages. If they want to learn that the hard way then they can shell out the small fortune to gain that knowledge. There’s no reason to drag OP into their bad decision making process.
Also it probably will make a weird relationship where the stepfather might trump boundaries cause she is carrying his kid ect ect. Gross
Yes, OP needs to RUN. This is extraordinarily creepy and has vibes of entrapment and potentially rape. 

Ugh I get second hand heebie jeebies for OP.
You nailed it. This is what is happening here. Yikes.
They don’t view her as an adult either-  she is only 21 and dependent on them. 

They are not asking op to agree, they want her to cave ‘willingly’. But will do what they want either way.

They are telling OP what they plan on doing with her body and they have threatened to retaliate (kick her out/loss of school).

OP’s mom is desperate and OPs stepfather has eyes for her. The mom is turning a blind eye to step fathers true intentions.

This is going to end very badly if she doesn’t get out of that house! They are not going to take no from her for very long. And if they think she will leave the stepdad may just go for it before he feels he has lost the chance. 
Plus she is willing to put YOUR life on the line. Bringing a child earth side comes with so many risks that you haven’t even thought of. Don’t even think about doing it. If your brain didn’t say YES! I’d love to do this for you from jump then it’s a hard NO.
This.  Sadly your mom is entirely caught up in the wrong things. Maybe she’s entirely dependent on your step father.
This is vile, my sister (young and healthy) very nearly died in labour. How could any mother want to put their kid through such a potentially dangerous situation when it wouldn’t even be for your own kid. There’s a reason surrogacy costs so much. I’m really sorry you were asked this.
Also, is their plan just to do this naturally to save on cost? Because, if you are doing this artificially, it’s still going to cost a fair amount. Otherwise, is he expecting you to have sex with him?  If that’s the case, they would forever be out of my life. This is horrible.
Tell step-creep-father he can go find and pay for a surrogate, who is willing, himself, if he's that obsessed with a baby... which I'm guessing he'll just dump on your mum and leave her anyways? 

Tell your mum, OP, just straight up no. 

Ugh. How freaking gross that they want to play mommy's and daddy's; all at the cost of your literal life! But oh, pregnancy is BEAUTIFUL though (that was sarcasm). Gross humans.
and a free incubator, to save a marriage that isn't going to last.  Having a baby NEVER fixes marital problems. 

Even if you wanted to do this, there are SO MANY legal issues that could happen.  This will be so hard on your body, in ways that don't reverse.  You really don't want to be pregnant during school.

  
SAY NO
Very much this! OP do not do this! They will try to guilt you but stand strong, this is your life! If they kick you out of the house for refusing to carry their baby that’s disgusting.

I hate when parents choose their partners over their children… get your priorities straight and prioritize your current child instead of trying to keep this toxic man around.

It also annoys me how everyone says pregnancy is so beautiful too lol… it’s different for everyone, for some it’s completely miserable, others not. Yes it’s totally amazing to grow a human but not everyone has a magical experience.
Please consider contacting your schools title IX office. Some are not great but others really do go the extra mile to help people in situations like this. They can help connect you with resources to distance yourself from these people who clearly do not care about you.
Second that.
Most of the time, you are not allowed to be a surragate if you do not have your own xhildren first. They ( drs and hospitals) wont do it. Tell your mother that.
Even cheaper if they go with natural conception. Don’t let yourself be guilted, or pressured into this awful idea.
If she lives in the US, she might be if Trump/Vance gets elected.
 Commenting on this so hopefully OP will see this. Look into your country’s social services if possible. They may have free university and resources for you since you have a disability. Please look into any help you can get through social services and university OP!
Fucking repulsive
I understand it’s normal terminology to say “the traditional way” but please God and Sunny Jesus let there be no culture where shagging your stepfather is “tradition”. 🤮
This is the way to preserve your living situation. Tell her that her batshit request is totally normal, but you looked into it and clinics won't accept you for the above reasons. Then start figuring out your exit strategy. Even if she drops this issue, these people see you as cattle. It will not get better.
>not a womb for rent

It didn't sound like they were offering to pay...
Not even for rent. They want her to do it for free!
The fact that step-daddy suggested the daughter as surrogate makes me think he intended to go the traditional route? He just wants to fuck his step-daughter.
If your mom wants to use her egg and your stepdad's sperm and insert the fertilized egg into someone's uterus... That involves a medical operation by a doctor.

And where they insert the fertilized egg into... Involves a selection stage. One of the criteria is for the surrogate have already successfully given birth before (because they have lower risk of complications).

You are clearly not a candidate, and tell your mom to start asking her mother friends instead, because the doctors will reject you even if you are willing.
And tell your mother to ditch the dude who doesn't actually  want to be with her, he only wants to squeeze some biological children out of her somehow, and will probably make her do most of the parenting.  🤮
This right here. I don't know where OP lives, but in the US, you cannot be a surrogate if you've never given birth, regardless of age. If mother and stepfather want a biological child so badly, they need to pay for a legit surrogate and keep their nasty suggestions out of your life.
I’m waiting for OP to say they want to save money and do it “naturally” OP you need to be the one to reach out to your college for help getting away from them and their abuse!
Exactly, i'm literally just hace 21 years
I would go further and say that no contact is absolutely warranted
This must mean he doesn’t love his step-daughter as a daughter 💀
Yeah. I hope OP has family or friends to go stay with in the mean time. Otherwise, yes utilize the school resources. Especially since OP is an adult, the school can’t give out information to these people without permission. A lot of university’s have a lot of resources. OP needs to get out ASAP
They're probably not going to go through any official channels
OP PLEASE print this out and read it every hour. Such great advice and way of breaking it all down! 

OP - think about it: where are they getting the egg? Step dad wants yours! 🤮
This is amazing and should be at the top. I want to add that: You CAN figure out another way to make college work without relying on family. This is not a decision between baby=maybe college and no baby=no college. There are plenty of options for no baby = college. I think changing this mindset will make it easier to hold your ground and say no.
It’s possible the mom had a hysterectomy without an oophorectomy, meaning that she still has her own eggs (but I’m not sure if they can still retrieve eggs from her in this situation). 

So at least there’s a (slight) possibility that the mom isn’t expecting her daughter to use her own eggs 😅
This! If your stepfather is over 50 and anything changes in his income or health status, will he see you as the de facto backup parent? 

Your mother is putting her husband’s personal goals above your own and her own well being, health, and life goals. WTAF. 

What if your stepfather doesn’t want to be with your mom anymore, but this is all just his ploy for him to get you to have his baby. Or to control you in general as maybe in his creepy eyes you are a younger version of your mom, especially if he sees women as incubators and inferior humans. 

You need to secure alternate housing ASAP. Be prepared for them to pressure you into this unwanted pregnancy and if that doesn’t work and you’re physically under the same roof it may escalate. Protect yourself. 

I’m sorry you are going through this.
I mean *technically* she could be as young as her late thirties. Classed as an “elderly” person for the sake of obstetrics and somewhat higher risk for complications and medical issues for the baby, but not that uncommon.

All that said - I’m 37 with two small kids and the thought of being pregnant again is right up there with root canal and watching Fox News.
I mean, I think this situation is disgusting but the age comment made me laugh. My brothers are 19 and 17 years older than me, we are full siblings, and as I’m sure you can guess I was an oops.
Right, but if they go the legit way that is still more than likely 10k+ so I’m going to assume they are doing this the not legitimate way. Aka either sex or turkey baster. 🤮
The problem is that OP has mentioned the mom and step dad have researched about this and knew it is expensive due likely to the aforementioned reason. 

This is disgusting as this means the stepdad likely knows he has to impregnate his step daughter old school. The excuses he gave also outlined that it is either this way, or the highway. This dude is sick and OP should run away from them asap.
I love this because it's got everything in it that I wanted to say. Bold of her mother to not only ask (demand) she do this, but also assume that OP wouldn't charge them anything. So she expects it and she expects it for free? That is ridiculous and disgusting.
It’s pretty clear step dad wants to rape OP. She needs to run, not chat with a doctor.
Step-father is giving controlling and creepy vibes. If he won’t take “no” for an answer and since he feels so entitled to use OP for her womb then I fear  that he might force a pregnancy on OP anyways
I think it’s a “bootleg” surrogacy in that she’d just get pregnant (by her step-father- yuck) and carry the baby to term. It sounds like this isn’t going thru an agency or anything.
EXACTLY!!!! 
He will leave her one day and take the child with him. 
[removed]
"For free" implies to me that step dad is expecting to create said baby "naturally" 
Otherwise there would, at a minimum be insemination fees, and if mom wanted to be the bio mom, egg retrieval fees, too. 

The idea that this would be "free" makes my skin crawl. 
Get away! Your mom will see the light, eventually. As everyone says, this is about "keeping" the man, not about having a baby.
I think this is a very different situation.  OPs mom is at least in their mid 30s (that’s assuming a teenage pregnancy). It’s more likely she is in her 40s with a 21yo.  She’s already had a child.  That’s not a 24yo finding out they will never have children. 

OPs mom just wants to keep partner in the picture, this isn’t about not being able to have kids or wanting to be a mom again.  It’s about keeping the partner.
Probably fair to assume that if mom is such a cheapskate as to think her daughter would/should do surrogacy for free, she might expect that step-dad sleep with daughter to effect the conception, rather than IVF
Or after mom’s husband will have left mom will also leave the new kid for OP to raise. The kid’s only purpose is to keep the husband and if that fails, nobody wants the kid.
💯🥇🏆🥇!!!!
I woman can die in labor whether she’s having her own baby or a surrogate for someone else. That’s why I hate when parents push their kids to have kids because they want grand babies. Just let people be and if they can and want to have kids, they will. Stay out of people’s personal business. You know?
Welp, we are talking about abuse and toxicity here. OP is forced to have that child. Neither outcome would be a good one for OP and her life is ruined by this ‘brilliant’ idea. This is vile, I agree.
Part of that reason is because you actually do need to meet health standards and the needs OP is on would probably disqualify her anyway on top of the fact that you need to be a mother already. But yeah, the moon doesn't want more kids, she wants to keep her weirdo husband
I too almost died because of childbirth I don’t recommend surrogacy to someone whos NEVER been pregnant. You dont know how your body will respond
Absolutely 100% this. Carrying a child is a choice to be made ONLY by the person doing the carrying because it’s one of the single most dangerous things that person will ever do. Labor and childbirth are rigorous and extremely hard on the body. Anything can happen at any moment that leaves mother, child, or both, dead.
Truth. IVF is expensive and forcing you to have sex with the stepdad is rape.
This is my suspicion. He wants to have sex with her.   
OP can try to tell them that she spoke with her doctors and they strongly advised her against any pregnancy as it would be detrimental to her mental and physical health.   
Pretty sure they won't care which should really tell OP how much they don't care about her as a human being.... Don't put a baby in that situation anyway.
Exactly.  

Also why was mom's uterus removed?

If it was cancer, then the eggs might have viability issues that is, if the ovaries were not also removed.  

That would mean it was biologically your kid and if step-dad and mom breakup, are you going to suddenly be expected to raise a child?
You have to have had a baby first before you are eligible. Also, why assume it would be free? I'd charge friends and family rates which would be double.
And they'd probably want more than one child.
If they can afford IVF then they can afford $15K at least to help you cover any expenses like a Fuck off emergency fund to help you get someplace away from them and their little  family. You will want some distance if you decide to go through with this.
Not to mention that they may end up getting divorced anyway. Having a baby is no way to try and save a marriage.
Oh good god. OP get on birth control NOW if you aren’t already and keep it in a safe place they can’t get to. Or better yet, get the shot or arm implant. I would not put it past this guy to rape you to get what he wants. Fucking gross. 🤮 

Having to temporarily stop your studies to get into a safe living situation would not be the worst thing in the world. Your uni may have resources to help. This whole thing with your mom and step dad is going to turn into an even bigger shit show than it already is if they somehow manage to bring a child into it without you. You’re not going to want to be a part of it. Don’t walk, RUN!
Saying he can't love an adopted his is the same as subbing op too and leads me to believe he had sinister intent.
Third that.
And think of the poor baby! God knows what a life they'll be forced to live.

Kids being used as tools. Pure shit.
It's okay, she doesn't qualify based on her post. Doctors wouldn't let her. The only way it could happen is if her step father tries to sleep with her
The whole concept makes my skin crawl
I'm not sure if you should bring your god into this.  I'm amazed this didn't happen in the Bible.  

There's that one dude who forced his daughters to be gang raped instead of some male stranger that the gang wanted to rape.

That queen who told her husband to rape their servant.  This one seems pretty on point, but there's probably something even closer to this.
Even better is to say she isn't applicable because she has fibroids or endometriosis or something that would make it difficult to get pregnant
I feel like that's HIS intention period. He doesn't care about having a kid
You cannot be a surrogate unless you've had your own to term pregnancy. As in you have your own child. So you dont even have to worry about this atrocious behaviour as you CANNOT do it. Not that you would anyway. I'd get away from them both though, sick
Please do what you can to secure alternative housing ASAP, to get yourself to a safe distance from these horrible people. Speak to someone from your college to see if they can help you with that.
Yes, pregnancy is beautiful but pregnancy can cause changes to your body and you are ONLY 21!!! 

Do not go through with this, you don't want to. Its **your body** and NO ONE can force you to do something, especially as extreme as this. Your mother just doesn't want to loose her husband and is desperately reaching here.
FYI- unless you've already had your own successful pregnancy, no reputable fertility doctor will consider you as a candidate for surrogacy.  They will flat out refuse.  

https://surrogate.com/surrogates/surrogate-requirements/surrogate-qualifications/

You would not be a candidate for a few reasons.  You've not carried a pregnancy to term is the obvious one.  You would also fail the psychological screening.  For a daughter to carry a baby for her mother is quite unusual, especially since presumably you'd also be the egg donor.  If the screening detected the slightest hint that you were being coerced or pressured into this, they'd reject you instantly.  

Your mom might then suggest doing it the old fashioned way- you have sex with your stepdad.  
While that's disgusting on a great many levels (especially given the situation) it might also be illegal in your state.  And I'm sure that would be harmful for you psychologically.  

> saw that it was extremely expensive (in dollars, it would be around 30,000)

There's a good reason it's so expensive.  The toll on the woman's body is extreme, and prenatal care is expensive.  If you charged them nothing, you'd end up far in the red, both in terms of medical care and consequences on your body.  

**Getting kicked out is a FAR preferable answer.  In fact I think you should leave on your own.**  

A mom who'd treat you as a human incubator to save her relationship is not worth living with.  You're better off with predatory student loans.
OP, are you on any form of birth control? I highly recommend going to your OB and getting placed on some kind of implanted form of contraception that can't be tampered with. You need to protect yourself in as many ways as you can.
Lock your bedroom door open.and find a way out. Steodad is sick but your mom is a sick pos!
Don't do it. Save yourself.
I'd argue it's necessary as soon as possible, this is just fucking evil. And I don't have any belief they have a limit.
Which is why he feels like it’s ok to ask this of her. It’s so disgusting.
Exactly
A woman’s shelter may also help her in the short term
Exactly this is the time to reach out to every person they know for help, even distant relatives she never talks to. Call in some favors, ask for favors, couch surf for a while, look for a job. Anything to get out!
Yikes. So the old turkey baster, if we’re lucky
But implanting is expensive & they want free 🥴
Some people may not know, but even after 40 women can have children. Considering all the risks, of course.
Your comment is cracking me up. Especially the Fox News part..
Or ditch her with the child to raise alone, and the mom will expect OP to help her raise it.
[deleted]
As a Taoist, I have no idea what’s going on. Pls someone enlighten me.

Edit: the comment I replied to has now been deleted. Istg I know how to read, so there’s no need to explain what’s going on in OP’s post. Thank you.
Muslims do not have an anti Jewish agenda. I’m sure some do, but racism is not restricted by race, religion, etc, unfortunately. Don’t just blanket statement a whole religion. It’s bad form.
Muslims do not want to wipe you off the earth. Muslims have been constantly scrutinised by the media for every little thing.
They would not be able to do the mom’s egg because in a legal surrogacy the carrier has to have already carried a child to term.
Edited:  missed the word NOT. Ooops.
He just wants to have sex with the daughter and has the perfect plan for it.
That's EXACTLY going to be the next step.
No FUC*ING WAY! JUST NO. I'm sick for the daughter. No. don't do this. It's messed up beyond words.

But I do appreciate the history lessons in this.
Usually doctors won't let you surrogate unless you've already had kids. My pg and labor were easy and there's no way I'd do that. If you're not married with kids of your own it's not something that should even be mentioned. If they want a kid that bad they can foster or adopt but it's not going to fix their relationship.
Imagine OP died and gave birth to her own half-sibling and that half-sib finding out later on that her surrogate mother/ half-sis died so her bio mom could have her.  It's so ridiculous
Yes yes. Especially, the fact that they don't realize their evilness, makes me want to vomit like a waterfall. So fucking eww.
Exactly this. She technically is trying to sell her daughter’s body for this creepy man. Absolutely disgusting and selfish. Women like her are dangerous to society and their own families
Many psych meds are dangerous for developing fetus, so OP could only be on low doses of certain medications. Which can increase mental health symptoms and make PPD even worse. Her saying she would be at risk of suicide is very true, as in addition to this she would have been emotionally and financially coerced into having this baby. Financial coercion due to threat of having to move out.
Most places won't accept a surrogate that hasn't had at least one child of their own.
Or sex trafficking your daughter to the other room. (instead of all the way to Morocco.)
my mom married a creep too - that makes me absolutely sick
They would make her an appointment with their own doctor and push her to go with them in the room so they could get the results with her. There are no boundaries or concern for the daughter in this situation.
They don't always remove the ovaries actually. My cousin got to keep hers for a bit after her first surgery - they did get removed but it was a year or more later
You think he wouldn't rape her to get what he wants?

Men rape girls.
Yeah, that’s been pretty looked down upon traditionally. 😂
They’ll just force her to try “naturally”… OP needs to leave.  They already asked, the idea is in their heads, living there is no longer safe.
Oh god 🤢
BINGO!
Pretty sure if they expect her to do it for free, they aren’t going through appropriate legal channels. 

OP, flat out refuse, and tell your mom if her husband actually loved her, he would love her with or without children of his own. Also, tell her she’s a damn fool if she thinks you’re going to f*ck her husband. 

Find a relative or friend you can stay with.
True, but plenty of people go down the turkey baster route. 🤮
It’s even deeper in that - You can’t be a surrogate until your own family planning is complete for mental health reasons. So the surrogate doesn’t feel attachment.
I don’t think the turkey baster is part of stepdad’s fantasy.
My Grandmother was 44 when she gave birth to my mother. 

Fun fact: Erramatti Mangamma, who gave birth at the age of 73 through in-vitro fertilisation via caesarean section in the city of Hyderabad, India, currently holds the record for being the oldest living mother.
Same, and I 100% agree. I have four kids and I'm 39, and I'm just so incredibly done having more babies.
"well it IS your kid, after all"
"You don't want the child you carried?"
i know, i’m like, what’s the tea here
Following this thread because I’m also confused
I don’t think OPs mom gives a damn about anyone but herself. And I don’t think she means to go about it the legal ethical ways. It seems implied to me she either wants husband and OP to be intimate or use a turkey baster, as any mother who would ask her very young daughter to carry a child for her, to keep her husband from divorcing her, isn’t thinking rationally.
This comment sounds useful. Look into the rules for your state for surrogacy and then you could say “unfortunately I can’t do it now but in 5 years I might qualify for this” - then in 4 years you can move out.
Yes, but they could do this privately, which is what the mom wants.  If she sees her dr when she suspects she's pregnant, the dr wouldn't know about ths surrogacy unless she told him/her.
I had amazing pregnancies and at one time I may have thought about being a surrogate but then I ended up on meds that I would have had to stop and that wasn’t an option. So many women have horrible pregnancies that if I hadn’t had it so easy I wouldn’t even think about it. And it would have been a c-section delivery so way more expensive for potential parents.
I was thinking no reputable fertility clinic would facilitate this
The whole thing is twisted.
and you'd need a whole seperate, very expensive process to legally make the mom and stepdad responsible for this baby, otherwise legally it's OP's baby and they could charge her for child support
Is there a safe guarding or support team at your university? There should hopefully be, so I recommend having a chat with someone there and telling them everything. Especially that you are worried the situation will mean you can’t continue your studies. 

There may be grants or bursaries or something that could help with accommodation at uni. 

Even if the worst case scenario is that you have to leave uni, they might be able to put your studies on hold so you can come back to them once you’re set up with an income and a place to live. 

Do not give in to their vile request. I honestly think you should get the hell out of there sharpish. Definitely talk to your uni and see what help is available from them.
Really? Why is that?
In the US (which is where I think OP is based on the date format), she is not allowed to be a surrogate. If OPs mom researched all of this, she knows that requirement exists. 

So either she wants to be able to blame someone else (OP) for not being able to be a surrogate OR she plans on having OP make a baby the old fashioned way.  

I wonder how long step dad has been in the picture.  If OP is 21, there is a high likelihood OPs mom is over 40 already. Mid 30s assuming a young teenage pregnancy. There is a likelihood that OPs mom is already in her 50s (though it seems unlikely bc step dad should know a woman getting pregnant in her 50s is not common).
Even then, I think a lot of doctors would avoid this on ethical grounds.

Options are:

1) a very unethical doctor/clinic
2) DIY turkey baster 
3) OP having sex with step-dad

All of these options are disgusting and creepy.
Imagine marrying someone who treats you and your daughter like this and turns around and says he couldn't love a child that wasn't his when he had a step child he's trying to force birth on
That is why I said if.  I had a friend that had cancer of the uterus and it affected one of the ovaries.  She also had to have some pretty heavy chemotherapy and while the ovary made the right hormones, the eggs within were basicly fried.
Especially creepy step-dads with young step-daughters... 🤮
It's pretty much looked down on reddit as well.
Sick. Imagine having to put your own step father’s sperm in your body. Hope Op can make a swift exit.
He’s not going to want to use a turkey baster.
Basically Abraham was told by God that he was going to have a son but Sarah couldn't have kids so she offered their maid, Hagar to have a kid for them. Hagar got with Abraham and got pregnant and then Sarah also became pregnant and was a salty b word about it.
This is turning into an emotionally incestuous 3 way
It's not like that in the US- there is very little government regulation of the fertility industry. Most clinics have rules they institute, but most of those can be waived if it's a personal arrangement rather than a strictly professional one. Like you can't be a paid surrogate for a random couple if you don't meet the clinic's requirements, but if you want to be a surrogate for a close friend or relative and everybody signs waivers acknowledging that not everything is medically ideal, you may still be allowed to proceed. 

Mothers have been surrogates for their adult daughters, for instance- no clinic would let a woman in their fifties be a surrogate to just whoever, but if the prospective parents are willing to take the risk and the surrogate is too, then it can still happen.

Anyway most clinics also will not do "traditional" surrogacy anymore (where the surrogate is inseminated directly and it's her own eggs fertilized), because it involves more legal complication (because the surrogate is also the biological mother in that case). Surrogacy now almost always involves IVF- so the surrogate is carrying embryos made from someone else's eggs. This means it's still wildly expensive even if the surrogate is a volunteer. 

(I suspect this op is ragebait, but it's good for people in general to understand this stuff better because the industry really does need better regulation, and most people don't know that it isn't well regulated at all.)

Edit to add: and most other countries fall to one side or the other of this- they either ban surrogacy outright or regulate it very little or not at all. This unfortunately isn't a scenario that most governments that permit surrogacy would safeguard the OP well in. She would need to advocate for herself, unfortunately.
Think not in states.
And since you never know, I can't imagine anyone with a horrible pregnancy or delivery being willing. It's certainly not someone you do for someone else without already fully knowing what you're getting yourself into.
And yikes. What if the baby ends up less than “perfect”? With a disability that needs lifelong care after mom and stepdad are gone? 

Would your stepdad accept a non-“perfect” baby as even being his child?

OP, consider this outcome as well.
Great idea. Talk to counselors and/or medical office at school. They can point you to housing resources possibly, so you can leave this situation. It sounds very hard. You may not be ready to leave, but talking to a counselor may help you sort out your feelings. This is probably not the only crappy confusing thing happening at home. Hang in there, we’re rooting for you.
They want to make sure the surrogate can actually carry a pregnancy to term without a bunch of problems. Plus the emotional side of it. Someone who's never given birth doesn't know exactly what they're signing up for and could cause issues later.
He’s manipulating the mother i reckon. Granted the mother is equally as sick in the head but this man is trying to put on this “fatherly” act that he won’t love the adopted kids as his own but he knows what his intentions are🤮
I imagine that he wants to put it there himself.
That made me throw up a little bit thinking about.
Well technically her mom and stepfather could create embryos and transfer them to OPs uterus. She said her mom doesn’t have a uterus, but she may still have ovaries. Although if OP is already 21 the mom is probably 40+ I’m assuming and egg quality declines at that age. Anyone who has done IVF knows that whole process is very expensive in itself. 

Aside from the science of it all the whole situation sounds toxic and shady as hell. Find a way to move out OP and don’t look back!
Ok thank you for the explanation on that. Why would that make Muslims hate Jews though?
Hager started rubbing it in Sarah's face for years and wouldn't stop, until Abraham exiled her and her son. This is the point that the two religions diverged, since Muslims and Jews go back to Abraham.
If the Bible was explained like this i would certainly read it more often 🙏🏼 (on a side note, I just realized this emoji was high-fiving instead of praying)
Also not sure about this, but Abraham had sex with Hagar while she was lying between Sarah's legs, thus giving the idea that he was actually having sex with Sarah.

If you apply this to ops situation it gets a bit icky.  Maybe if there's a turkey baster involved, but the idea of having a baby by stepfather is a bit uncomfortable
Lmaooo the Bible is hilarious
A lot of the bs bible stories sound like reddit from before the internet.
That’s because Hagar was a servant, not a wife. And she was treating Sarah as the servant and being disrespectful. That wasn’t done in those days.
That’s a great explanation, lol. Is there a sub Reddit for spilling the biblical tea like this?
>This is turning into an ~~emotionally~~ incestuous 3 way
If he's not prepared to love a child who's adopted I seriously doubt he could love a disabled child .
Nothing to consider. Just no, don't do this! From no angle does this look acceptable. 

Horrifying.
Makes sense thank you! I never really thought about that I guess…
Honestly I feel like OP needs to run away. Her mom is clearly unstable, stepdad is a fucking creep. Depending on just HOW bad they want this, I don’t feel like she’s safe with them..
If they’re going they’re going through all the effort of creating embryos why not hire a real surrogate instead of going down this semi incestuous route? Just feels like an inappropriate thing to ask your step child to do, especially if he was her stepdad a few years ago when she was underaged. Ne would have been her father figure. Not to mention they want her to birth her own biological sibling. The whole thing is making me queasy.
I don't know too much in terms of how to explain with great details.Think of Isaac(Sarah's son) as the father of Christianity/Judaism and Ishmael(Hagar's son) as the father of Islam. Two boys from two different mothers.
That's not why they hate each other. They hate each other because humans are pack animals and need common ground to get along. Being of a different religion makes them of different packs which puts them at odds when it comes to expansionist wars, especially when they fight for the same territory.
Abraham is the same guy in both religions
Hagar was marched out into the desert to die with her son to spare Sarah’s feelings. They survived anyway and supposedly are sort of the genesis of the Muslim branch of the Abrahamic religions, with the line of Sarah representing Judaism and eventually Christianity.
Muslims are descended from the Son of the handmaiden, while Jews are descendants of the son is Sarai.
Thanks, I was trying to remember the reason for the bad blood but couldn't lol
💯
On paper, my SiL should have had a perfect pregnancy - no family history of anything, Mom/Aunts/first cousins all had easy pregnancies, in amazing shape, great medical care. 

And yet. 

It was not a good pregnancy - in the end, they both came through fine, but there was a seven week hospital stay for her, and 10 weeks in the NICU for my nibling...

Pregnancy is unpredictable.
I agree, so creepy and unsettling! If they went through the trouble of making embryos they’d still have to pay for the cost of the surrogate on top of IVF. So maybe that’s where they’re trying to save money. My mind went straight to IVF because I couldn’t even imagine him trying to impregnate her naturally? So sick and twisted if that is the route they were thinking of going ugh 🤮
Oh. So that’s how it is. It’s kinda crazy that these people’s affairs are still affecting us thousands of years later, if you think about it.
Ohhh ok that makes sense. Thank you :)
Reminds me of that Sunday school song: "father Abraham, had many sons. Many sons had father Abraham. I am one of the, and so are you, so let's all (clap our hands, stomp our feet, turn around, sit down!)
Also, while Jews and Christians believe it was Jacob who Abraham offered as a sacrifice required by God, was “saved” by the lamb in the thicket; and was given the birthright to carry on being the “father of nations,” Muslims believe it was Ishmael who was nearly sacrificed.
Judaism has been around 3000 years, Christianity for 2000 years and Islam for 1500 years.
Yup so basically after Sarah and Abraham get their biological son, Sarah starts to HATE Hagar and her son especially because the son makes fun of her for having a baby when she is so old. So she gets weak as hell Abraham to abandon Hagar and her son in the desert with only a little bit of food and water because of the mocking and because she wants all the inheritance for her own son.
The majority to Monotheistic scripture is about family drama, and instructions on what to do if you wanted to be remembered for thousands of years for being a prick.


Also something about spontaneous combustion affecting some types of oil rich flora in arid conditions but honestly that is me reading between the lines and adding logic where there is none.
It is crazy for sure considering in those religions, the same God is technically being worshipped. But it's two different tribes who disagree on how to worship and rules and such. It just spiralled downward from there.
FYI, that’s why Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all called “Abrahamic religions” - they all trace their lineage back to Abraham through his 2 sons.
No problem :) this is just a crude explanation though. There is much more to it but it's the best my sleep deprived brain has right now lol
Thank you for that! I hadn’t thought about that since I was maybe 5 or 6, and I never knew what it meant. For some silly reason I always thought it was referring to Abraham Lincoln. As a kid you don’t necessarily question your thoughts… or songs you sing at school (not public).
got a south korean girl pregnant during a hookup its mine
So, in November of 2023, I posted on here that I traveled to South Korea with my friends and stayed there for a month. I met a Korean girl, hooked up with her, and two days before we left, she told me she was pregnant. Most of the comments told me I should go back and get a DNA test. I built up the courage, and on September 3, I booked a flight with my friend. We got there and texted her through Instagram, where she was keeping me updated with the baby, even though I was suspicious. Surprisingly, she wasn't upset with me; she was happy I was there. Anyways, I immediately asked for a DNA test, and it took three days to get the results. I was scared, nervous, and felt sick. Finally, the results came back - it's me, I'm the father. Not gonna lie, my heart dropped, I was sweating, shaking, and on the verge of tears. I came back home after being there for one week. I told her I needed to go home and think for a while. She said, and I quote, "Ok, but please do what's right for our daughter." It's been about two weeks since I've been back, and I genuinely don't know what to do. I still like her, but I live in America; it's not like I can just move there. I'm still so naive to so many things. Please give me some advice; I'm stressing.


Update : So, I've been getting a few DMs saying I fetishize Asians. Let me tell you how I even thought about going to South Korea. Around October of 2022, I decided to walk to a Korean restaurant that's four minutes away from my apartment and get some food. I enjoyed the food so much that I would go once or twice a week. Eventually, I grew close to the son, who was 20 at the time, and his mom. They're both Korean American. After being friends with him for a while, he asked if I wanted to take a trip to South Korea. For a while, I thought about it and eventually said yes. And that's how everything went down. I don't fetishize Asians. Korea was the first Asian country I've been to. I had only been to the UK and Mexico before. I'm talking with her, and we're figuring something out. I will let you guys know what will happen.

Update: I want to thank everyone who genuinely gave me advice. After talking with her, we both decided it's best if I go to Korea for a bit and be there for my daughter and build a relationship with her. She’s willing to get me Korean lessons and everything I need to make sure I am the best for my daughter. My family agrees I need to be there for her. I still need to figure out some things with my work, but that will come in time. Also, thank you to everyone who private messaged me. It really woke me up. Wish me luck, and check my page—I posted a picture of me and her. I want y'all to see us. Thank y'all so, so much.😊

Register your child's birth at the US embassy in Korea. Giving your child their right to American citizenship will let her have choices in her adult life that she is entitled to.
time to own up and accept that you have a daughter now. It may be really hard but it’s what’s necessary for you and her. Better start learning Korean, you’ll need it most likely
Damn.. people are just raw dogging strangers in different countries... THATS CRAZY
At least pay child support. Seriously. It takes two to tango - and two people to make a baby. So take responsibility for that child. You don't need to marry that woman, but you should at least support her and the Baby in any way possible.
Do right by your kid and step up
You really need to have a conversation with the mother about your options. I am fairly familiar with Korean culture and it's not a very woman, biracial (if you aren't asian) or mother friendly culture. Would she be able to move to YOU? It sounds like she speaks English (unless you are korean American and/or speak korean?) which honestly gives her a leg up over you on options. There aren't a lot of jobs for people who don't speak korean in Korea unless you are an English teacher and without a job you really aren't going to be much help to them anyway unless you become a stay at home dad and frankly i wouldnt wish moving to a foreign country to be dependent on someone else you barely know on anyone- you or her. 

I don't know your circumstances in terms of education, career, qualifications, location, support systems, opportunities etc, but those are all things that would have to factor into your decision making.

Worst case, I think make sure your daughter has American citizenship (this will be great for her down the road if she ever wants options), and try your best to visit, call, try to get her for periods so she learns English and stays connected with you these are all great for her whether she wants to stay in korea or live in America.
A few things I haven’t seen mentioned here:

1. Make a plan to ensure your daughter speaks English so that you can communicate with her. Start learning Korean.  Maybe she can spend the summers with you? You work from home anyway, she can come to you and you can also come to her for large parts of the year.  

2. Ensure that she gets her American citizenship. 

3. Is the mother interested in immigrating to the US? A lot of Koreans are trying to get out, maybe she’d be interested.  

Good luck!
Do the right thing, might be the best relationship you ever have. Doesn’t mean you have to be with her mother but you have obligations as a father to provide financial and emotional support. 

If you’re gonna rawdog it you gotta know this is a possibility.
you are responsible for that baby. do everything in your power to make her life better. That’s what I would do.
I feel like you should go talk to lawyer as soon as you’re able to. One that deals with family law. They will be able to help you with what steps you need to take for things like child support and parental rights etc. I think you’ll feel a little better and less lost having someone like that to metaphorically hold your hand through figuring out those things. They will also likely be able to help you or at least point you in the right direction for finding other resources that you might need to aid you emotionally, mentally, and logistically.
Everyone has a test of character in life, this is yours. Own up to it, accept it, and then embrace it. You have created a life. I see you are 20 so it’s normal for you to think that your “life is over” or that you can’t do it. You can if you try. You can either, leave, and run away but you will never forget about it ever for as long as you live. Or you can be the man that a daughter and this new mother needs. Make yourself proud of yourself, and don’t deny a girl a father. Best of luck to you man you absolutely can do it.
As a child of teen parents, my parents were just my parents. They didn't seem any younger than anyone else. They both loved me and provided for me. Thank God my dad didn't have his head up his ass and say, I'm only 18.  He went to work and took care of me. 

You don't have to be with the woman to provide for the child. Do what's right and start saving so you can be with her as often as you can, and support her financially.
So what are you gonna do? The truth is the matter. It’s your baby you didn’t use protection and now you brought a human life into the world and you are responsible for it. The right thing to do is pay for it and try to engage with her as much as you can. You’re grown up enough to have sex. You’re grown enough to bear the responsibility of the outcome.
I'm 40, a mother of 2 and a 2- time immigrant myself and have had to learn a second language. It is hard and it is expensive but it's a positive life experience. There are options! My first thought is you could do a TSOL course and go over and work teaching english. Many native English speakers do this. Or apply for visa for her and the baby to come to you. Give yourselves a chance to get to know each other.
Hey bro, I’ll actually try give some feasible advice. I think you should take your time with this maybe try build a better relationship with the mother and see whether there are feelings there. I think staying in America is the best choice as of right now. Just try to visit as much as you physically can. It may drain your wallet but at the end of the day this is your child and you need to be there as much as you can for her. This is a difficult situation for sure, I’m your age so I can only imagine how scary this must be. Take it step by step but get ready for a big change. Best of luck hope things work out for you! Feel free to reach out too.
People are being really harsh in the comments, and I saw your response about only being 20, my parents were only 18 when they had me and it was a lot for them. I can imagine being 20 doesn’t change very much as it’s only a two year difference.

I think whatever choices you make depend on what path you’re on right now in life. If you are working or if you are attending school.

If you are solely working, then you’ll need to figure out a way to financially advance yourself to such a degree that you can atleast send some kind of assistance to your daughter and be there for her physically on occasion abroad.

Your other option is, if you’re in school, finish your schooling as quickly as possible and do your best to find a program in Korean that allows you to work and provide for your child. This may look like teaching English predominantly, but perhaps if you strive for getting a graduate degree over there and learn the language over time this could change.

If you make these decisions NOW and start planning NOW you can be there for your child during their childhood. Maybe not a ton at first because these things take time, but you need to legally establish rights, ties, and provide evidence that this child is also yours.

Your other option other than going to SK, is after she gets through her pregnancy and recovers, you can start the discussion with her now of coming to the US if she is interested in that idea.

You can get married to her, and figure out a way to get her citizenship. There’s a way you can get a green card going I believe pretty early, but you might want to look into speaking to an immigration lawyer first and see what they say about everything.

Lastly, I would like to say to you that YES this is a lot, and YES you are young, but this isn’t the end of your life unless you make it that way. You have to decide for yourself whether you want to live with the guilt of not being there for your child and the mother of your child FOREVER, or as others have mentioned “figure it out!” 

It’s a lot to figure out though, and I’m sorry that things will be a bit confusing for quite awhile. If you like this girl, and find her attractive, kind, and that she already cares for this child, then maybe you should make the effort to try and develop a loving relationship with her. This may not be possible at first totally due to whatever stress you feel, but I think if you put in some effort, you’ll find that it’s not that hard to learn to love someone that is good and kind. 

Even if all of this doesn’t work out, and in the end you do spend some time away from your child and visits happen on occasion, remember that you have a baby and she is waiting for you and will be looking for you for the rest of her life if you aren’t there.

Fate really works in mysterious ways, and sometimes your swimmers work better than you ever imagined! But this is why it is important to use protection. I am pregnant presently and it was COMPLETELY unplanned and I am not that much older than you, it happens to the best of us.

You CAN DO THIS! 

You CAN figure this out.

And I think if you do work hard and do put your best foot forward and think of this woman and child truly as your own to support and protect you will make the right decisions as they come.

Wishing you the best! Be kind to yourself and be soft, don’t go crazy, and DO find someone to talk to in RL about your problems, preferably someone with a degree mental health or someone reliable and wiser.😅
Everyone is saying ‘man up, support your child, you’ll be a great dad’ etc. All of that stuff may be true, but they’re not addressing the elephant in the room.

Your child and her mother are on the other side of the Pacific Ocean in a foreign land. A land where you presumably don’t speak the language and have no real understanding of the cultural landscape, unless of course you’re Korean yourself. This is a pretty unique situation for many reasons, beyond that of the typical accidental young father. This isn’t the same type of situation you’d be in if you accidentally got the girl down the street pregnant.

You’re going to have to work something out. Visits are necessary. Keep in mind, you may not ultimately be compatible with this woman as a life partner. After all, she’s raised in an entirely different culture. It wouldn’t be a tremendous shock if it did work out, but there is a lot stacked against you.

For one, are you even employable in Korea? Are you more use to your daughter if you stay in the United States where you can get a job and provide for her from afar? These are real questions you’re going to have to find the answers to.

You’ll have to really familiarize yourself with Korean culture— you have true ties to this country now. You’re probably going to have to learn Korean if you don’t know it already, as that’s the language your daughter will be speaking in a few years. You say you ‘can’t just move there’. I guess that’s fair. But the reality is if you want to have a relationship with your daughter you will probably have to. Or arrange for your daughter and her mother to move to the USA, which seems like a more difficult and less likely prospect. With that said, if she and the child move to you you’ll have the benefit of being in a culture that is more open to and set up to accommodate immigrants.

Try and do right by the kid. She is yours. 

Best of luck, friend.
you *ARE* the father

\~Maury
Man up. If not, at least pay child support.
You don't have to move. But send her money and ask for pictures. Be there for big events in her life. Come visit and open your house for them to vacation. That's the minimum you could do. 

You could also move there, be with your daughter, not necessarily be with the girl but be cordial with her, and watch her grow up and raise her. But that's up to you.
Try to be in the child’s life , you don’t have to have a romantic relationship  with the mom , but atleast have a relationship with your daughter , get to know the mom more and go from there
I am 25 and my german mother met my venezuelan father on a trip there and came back to Germany with me and my twin brother in her belly. My father was 21 at the time and honestly I cried a lot because of my absent father as a child and my mom had it really hard raising me and my brother herself. BUT today and more specifically when I turned 21 I forgave him. It doesn't erase the pain and hours of therapy but the dude was in my eyes just a child who wasn't able to give up his live because of a dumb mistake. Yes he should have know better and yes he at least could have paid child support but with what money haha.
I am just commenting 'cause I feel that I can give another perspective on this matter and I wanna highlight that it still was shit for 20+ years as a child but then it gets better and I for myself was able to forgive.
SK had crazy laws and I believe you cant just ghost this lady. She can come after your for child support half way across the world. You wont be able to escape this.

This is the price ya’ll both pay for being dumb
1) It’s okay to be scared. No matter how old you are or how much money you have I think all new parents are scared, you don’t know what to expect. I can say having a baby will change your life for the better. It’s challenging but so rewarding and you will want to do anything you can to make sure she has a good life. 

2) I don’t know what your life of financial situation is, but you should consider talking to a recruiter for the Air Force. You will learn discipline, honor, integrity and so much more. You will get free healthcare for you and your child (you will need to do paperwork so that she becomes your dependent, unless you get married to her mom). You will get the money to financially support the child if that’s how you choose to do things (I don’t think you should only do this, I think you should be involved), you will get education benefits, a housing allowance, a GI Bill, entitlement to a VA loan for a house. It’s something you should think about, I don’t recommend this to everyone because it’s tough but it seems like it could be good for you.

3) Be involved, being there for your baby is so important and you did this together, it’s not a one way thing, so you need to step up and take responsibility for the life you’ve helped create. It will be okay, you can do this! Congratulations!!
You need to have a very honest discussion with the mother of your child immediately.  I don't know much about Korean culture specifically, but if it's like many other Asian cultures there is potentially a very strong expectation that if you get a girl pregnant, you marry her.  I'm not saying you have to do that, but you need to learn about any expectations she might hold or any cultural stigma surrounding single motherhood in Korea before you can make a fully informed decision. Paying child support and not being so personally involved might be an option in America, but I don't know how it works in South Korea and I don't think you do either. Nobody can force you to do anything, but this might have very different implications than it would if you got a girl in the US pregnant. Or it might not. But you need to find out immediately.
Hi Dad! You will need to be involved in your daughter’s life. Have you discussed potential ways to do that with your parents and siblings yet? This is a place to start.
I will just hug you cause this is hard. 

You will figure it out...time will tell and a child might bring you more happiness than you think even in this situation? 


Good luck.
Accept the fact that unprotected sex has consequences, it might be scary to think but you’re having a daughter. You may not have much feelings for the mother, but perhaps do the right thing and be in the life of the little one? I hope that the necessary courage and life experience brings you to do the right decision and wish you and the baby along with the mother well. It won’t be easy, but it just might be worth it in the end.
That's ur child, u got to man up do the right thing and be by it. Get urself a visa or her, get a tutor to learn Korean, u could even be an English teacher there for a bit if u are stressing about getting a job, well depending on how well ur Korean is. Step up, man up and do the right thing brother.
I live in South Korea and there is actually great benefits for couples here. People here are saying "take the baby to the USA" but a bit ignorant about the benefits here too but it depends on your financial situation back home to compare.

Korea is widely known as having the worst birth rate in the world (0.68 children per couple) and the government is actively trying to reverse this by offering a pretty good monthly child benefit monetary allowance and apartment advantages. If you do end up coming here (and marrying) you will get the F6 visa which is like a golden visa for foreigners here in terms of finding work.

I recommend you join the FB group Expat Dads in Korea and Expat Parents in Korea to find out more info.
Good luck. Take care of your baby. As others have said, register your child so that she can claim US citizenship is she wishes.
If I were in your shoes, I'd move over there and see how well I get along with the mother. You never know, it could be a loving relationship. I don't know why these comments are telling you to step up without wondering about the other half of the equation.
that child is your responsibility as much as it’s hers. you both need to talk and come up with a plan to be present in the child’s life and give them the best possible life. it’s okay to be scared, hell even married couples trying for a child get scared when it happens. but you need to take responsibility and give that child a good life.
This is an epic romantic movie plot.

Would she be interested in moving to America? Honestly that is such a crazy situation to be in. I have no idea what I would do if I was in your shoes, but I think making an effort to be in your daughters life is very important. She didn't ask to be born, but she exists so it's up to you if you want her to grow up with a father or not. Having a kid can be a tough change for your life, but her not having a father can be traumatic for her life. I would recommend taking some time away from all kinds of internet access and think by yourself. What you decide will determine what kind of man you are.
Get a lawyer. Learn your rights and legal responsibilities. You don’t want this woman to take advantage of you in any way so having a lawyer can protect you from being scammed or extorted. Make informed decisions. 

For the people saying you should marry this girl, that is terrible advice. For people saying you need to move to Korea or she needs to move to the US, stupid just plain stupid. You have no idea if living together is good for you, her, or your daughter. 
You aren’t doing anyone any favors by creating an unhappy home.

She knew the consequences of having a bi-racial child in South Korea and did it anyway. Unfortunately the country is incredibly xenophobic. 

If you decide you want to be a part of this child’s life then you have to decide to what capacity. 

If you’re fully invested then become friends with this woman. Get to know her outside the realm of anything romantic. She is the mother of your child not your girlfriend, fiancée, or wife. You are free to date anyone you wish. If you are fully invested look into getting your daughter dual-citizenship. 

If marrying this woman is on the table then foster the relationship like you would any other. If anyone moves discuss it together fully and until both of you are satisfied with the decisions being made. Honestly these things take months and years to fully develop. Don’t make any spur of the moment decisions. Think them through and discover what it is that you actually want. Communicate your needs. 

If you want nothing to do with either of them then still get that lawyer. Get off social media completely and become a ghost. No contact, no sensitive information on any public format. The mother also decided to have unprotected sex with a stranger, this is one of the consequences of having an unplanned pregnancy. If she wanted that domestic dream then she shouldn’t have had a baby out of wedlock. 

If you want something between fully invested and wanting nothing to do with them then a legal agreement needs to be reached. Plenty of people grow up with one parent and it isn’t as if her finding someone else who wants to be a father is outside the realm of possibility. 

What is best for you? What do you want? Advocate for yourself.
1. Figure out how the mother would like to proceed, would you like to continue on romantically? Or would you just like to be a supportive father in their lives. See what works for you two and go from there.
2. [This is a great introductory book to Korean](https://www.amazon.com/Korean-Beginners-Mastering-Conversational-Included/dp/0804841004), it'll teach you pronunciation, basics, and the ability to read Korean. Korean isn't that difficult to learn IMO. It's got an Alphabet with vowels and consonants so it's sorta easy to learn from English.  
3. If you don't want to move/she doesn't and you don't want to help with the child at all, at the absolute minimum, pay her monthly child support. She's probably in a mountain of shit with her family for getting pregnant, and also now having an absent father.

  

Lastly:  

**RELAX**  

This isn't some crazy conundrum bro, just take a deep breath, and collect yourself. You'll be fine with whatever you decide, I implore you to help the girl you fucked tho.
Do the right thing, OP. Fatherhood ain't for everyone but man, it's such a blessing. Get your kid's citizenship in order at least in case they ever wanna move to the States.

Whatever you do, best of luck to y'all
If you are stressing just imagine what the young soon to be mother of your child is going through.
Well, we found Dave Grohl's reddit account.
Congrats! Must be scary, but the fact that you flew all the way back out there speaks volumes for your character. Of course she was happy to see you!

You got some things to figure out now. Namely, where to live.

* Does she intend to raise the child, or give her up for adoption? 

I don't know what your baby mom will want for her daughter, but I will say it's quite uncommon to meet single mothers. Or at least if you do meet them they don't declare it. Many children of unwed parents end up being put up for adoption. Talk with your baby mom about her intentions here; make sure that you're both on the same page.

* Do you want to raise your daughter directly, or just financially? Or not at all? 

One thing that's fairly common is a "goose dad" (기러기 아빠) where the mother and child live abroad (usually to learn English naturally) while the father lives at the home country supporting them financially. Your situation potentially sounds kind of like reverse of that, where you'd be living abroad (i.e., the US) and mother and child would be living in Korea. Or maybe you'd rather take you daughter in and her mom would stay in Korea and work? Unlikely, but possible, I guess!

* Where does she want to live?  Are you open to her living with you in the US?  Are you open to living in SK? 

If your daughter does grow up in Korea, and you are not ethnically Korean (or East Asian), she may have some social struggles. She's gonna look different from others. This could be a small thing, or a big thing for her. It might make her stronger, or it might hurt, or both. Sometimes kids who speak English too well get teased and bullied, but maybe that's changing over the past decade and the next decade. Just another factor to consider. 

Oh, yeah, and you probably wanna learn some Korean. Better start with nursery rhymes. Search for 동요 today!

It must be scary for you but you can make it work. If nothing else, you have the opportunity to move to Korea and work as an English teacher with a very comfortable F-visa on the table. Great food, great healthcare, great people. You'll get a lot of respect. You could live a pretty good life out there. Honestly, for an American, the QoL in Korea is miles above the QoL in the USA. The main thing is that you would be far from family and friends - but all homes are temporary. Even if you don't love this woman, you have the chance to make some really meaningful life choices here.
Instant family! Just add money! Marry her. Move her to the US. Live happily every after! If you so choose, you have a clear path in front of you, which is a rare gift in life.
Wife her up if you like her, and talk to her about potentially getting her to live with you in the US, it might be scary now but trust me there’s nothing more beautiful than being a father so… congrats
guess its start of a happy family:)
Congratulations. I know you’re scared, but imagine the number of times your daughter will be scared in the future and will need her father to be there for her. 

Do the right thing. The strict minimum would be child support, and ideally either you move there or you help her and the mom move where you are.
You could apply for a K-1 visa and bring her here.
Move to Korea bro fuck it start a new life. Not like you gotta drop your friends and family but bro learn some Korean and get out there… not sure what else you can do bro. If I had a daughter I’d wanna raise them unless I absolutely couldn’t stand the mom.
Step up. You're an adult so you have to deal with the consequences of your actions. Be a father, and be a good one.
I'm assuming you are a US citizen. You are young but don't worry. You can do the right thing. 

Even if your daughter is born in South Korea she will be able to become an American citizen but you will have to submit some paperwork with the government.

I don't know what your plan is with the mother of your daughter. Are you planning to marry her. Will she move to the USA. Etc. 

Take deep breaths. Handle one thing at a time. This whole thing is overwhelming and it's totally understandable.

You may also need to check how mixed Korean kids are treated in Korean society. I think mixed Korean kids have a tough time there. Also the daughter of a single mother. 

It'd be best for your daughter to be raised in the states. IMO.
I don’t see your other post, but before jumping to decisions regarding things like child support and being there or not being there for the child, I would suggest really spending some time talking to the mother and getting to know her.

Do you know if she’d be open to living in America?  Is she a kind person? How old are y’all?  Jobs? Income? Family? 

I think any advice is not going to be good because we don’t know the exact situation, but I’d at least talk to her a good amount if you’re choosing between being there and not being there for the kid.

If you’re like me and would step up no matter what, just know korea is a great place!
I think the best advice is for you to contemplate and hopefully realize that this is not either one way or another. There are infinite ways you and your new Korean baby momma could handle this. Think. Debate. Make Lists. Pros. Cons. You have a child out there. You gotta at least take the chance to be in their life in some way. Build towards something. It doesn’t have to be overnight. Sorry but not sorry, you fucked and got a kid. If you walked completely away you’d be a monster in some eyes.
There's a tiny human coming that's going to solely be depending on the both of you.

Please do the right thing.
"'DO WHAT IS RIGHT BY OUR DAUGHTER."  🌻

Congratulations! Dad . . .
If you are old enough to play you are old enough to pay, you weren’t naive about hooking up with a random stranger or not using protection. 

Some reason because of the distance I feel you will just abandon the child and “out of sight out of mind” and just in living your life. 

I hope that is not the case. You brought a child into this world and to walk away because it’s an inconvenience is terrible.  The child growing up fatherless and the mother finding for her self trying to make it work is selfish. Do the right thing
Your decisions have consequences. You really jumped in the life lesson deep end. First buy some damn condoms. Then do the right thing for your daughter, even if it’s just monetarily. Also, familiarize yourself with the words entrapment and fiance K1 visa.
At minimum child support and register your child for dual citizenship. At most start a family with this womam
Apply for 90 day fiancé.
When my grandfather was 20 he had a child with a woman he had quickly married. The marriage didn’t work out, and the woman quickly found another husband who wanted to adopt this child and no longer have my grandfather around. 

40 years later my grandfather was on his deathbed from cancer after living an absolutely amazing, full, love filled life after finding the love of his life and having 2 more kids, 6 grandkids, and 1 great grandchild. Want to know who he could not stop talking/ thinking/ wishing about? The son he never got to see again. 

Do with that what you will, but save yourself a massive amount of regret later by doing what you can live forever with now.
I came back to see the update, congrats!  

You made a very grown decision and who knows where it can lead. I hope you grow to love Korea as I have. If you ever get homesick, look for towns near US military bases. They are heavily catered towards Americans.
Be a man and Take responsibility
Just to clarify—this was a paternity test in which you were in control of the samples? There was no intermediary between you and the testing facility?

I’m also assuming you must have hooked up near the beginning of your trip?
fuck that lmfaooo that’s rough my guy
Unpopular opinion here but I was a daughter of a hookup and the best thing my biological parents could have done was put me up for adoption. My parents were way too young and dysfunctional and I had the best life with my adopted parents. Wish you could have a frank discussion about this. They adopted me when I was 3ish after my parents realized they couldn’t do it. Best decision ever. This is a crazy idea too but would your parents want to help you raise your daughter? You’re way too young and I don’t agree with people saying to “man up.” 

I have a totally different experience and my advice to you would be to find other options like adoption (ideally with more financially secure individuals in yours or her family who can give her the best education and life like I had).
You’ve brought someone into the world. You now have to care for them.
Congratulations, pal!
Being an expat in Korea I understand how much of an adjustment this will be if you move here. But I feel like some of the advices could be better suited if we knew your age range. And if you have a college degree. This can make a lot of difference in finding the right path for you through all this hardship you will go through.
figure out how to maximize your income asap
Muslim from Pakistan here, after reading your incident, I feel sad and sympthy for you. Here is my advice, I think you should discuss the matter with your parents, especially the one that you are close to. It will be bad in start but no parents abondon their kids. After talking to the parents will solve your worry, try to calm yourself down. Release your burden, one barden at a time. Make a note of all the things that worry you. After that own the problem, make the korean girl your wife as soon as possible. Go to the korea and also face the parents of the girl. All this will also make you good in the eyes of that korean girl, it will make you strong too. Please own the child, don't abandon her. Don't even think of doing that.
She sounds great dude whats the hold up
Responsibility and life, this is it. The people here are helping you see what the right thing is, try to see it.
I saw someone else say this, and I was thinking the same thing! A TOL course will allow you to move over there to teach and earn money for the child.
You have a child in an international situation. you need to consult a lawyer yesterday. you've established paternity now get onto being an adult.
Bring her to America and man up! Use this as an opportunity to get your shit together
Well it's your kid. Don't be a dead beat dad and not have any contact. You need to either uproot your life and move over there to be with your child and the mom or you need to have the mom and child move over to the US. She's going to need a lot of support and the baby is going to need it's dad, especially in the baby-toddler stage as that's the best time to bond, but most stressful too.
Time to think? The time for thinking was prior to having unprotected sex. Now, this girl is pregnant, and a baby that has been proven to be yours is counting on you.

You need to step up to the plate, act like a like a man and accept your responsibilities. You should probably marry this girl and You need to either move there or make arrangements for her to move here. Have her here when the baby is born so the baby will be 100% an American citizen and have your wife, If she wants, apply to become a citizen.

Be a good dad. Be a good husband.
This is why people should not be sleeping around recklessly.
You need to grow up. You flew to Korea from the US and didn’t use a condom and now you have a baby. Congrats. You took a DNA test and It’s your kid. Congrats again. Now think about it from the kids and mother’s perspective.  You made a kid now you need to do what’s right for your kid. Can they move to the US? Are you at least sending money to her to help with the baby? Do you like the mom? Would you want to get married? You need to step up.
Gonna give some odd advice here, South Korea actually is currently giving AMAZING benefits to young couples having kids. They want to increase the population by like any means necessary. You can marriage migrate, cost of living is cheap af. If you have a bachelors, you have job opportunities in the country.
Yall did that to yourselves, be there for your daughter. Think whats better for your kid, not for u.
Biggest piece of advice I can give you is to learn from this to use protection with every partner if you’re not ready to have another child. Also, look into getting a vasectomy if you’re sure you don’t want more littles for a while.

You may also want to consider what it may cost to relocate there and costs for her to relocate here to the US.
Well congrats 
You created a human being. The absolute least thing that you could do would be to start paying child support.
Don't know what to do? You be responsible.
Tell your parents.


SK is rad af. Go live there and be a daddy to that kid. Enjoy the amazing food and incredible hiking and things to do there. Beaches, mountains. What’s not to like?

States are wack af anyway now is the perfect time to go be a role model for that kid💪
Man the fuck up. Tell younger men your story, and show people the reality of what goes down when you wanna play in them streets. 
Accept the consequences and do the right thing for your kid. If not you will live the rest of your life thinking about this kid
So a lot of people are jumping on the bring them to America train. South Korea is not a bad place to raise a child. Unless she wants to move, she’s perfectly justified in staying there. 

I do think learning some Korean makes sense. 

If you’re not interested in moving to SK, You could also find a career that allows you the flexibility to travel. Digital nomad type of thing, work in hospitality, start your own business. Something that ideally offered you the option to work there some and here some, or at least offered flexibility in terms of PTO and airline miles. Flying back and forth infrequently is expensive. But if you’re in a career where you can travel or if you work for an airline or something, you can really build up those frequent flyer miles, travel points, etc. I have friends and family who haven’t paid for a flight in years. 

You’re still young enough to plan for your career. If you’re in college, consider doing a year or semester abroad in SK. At age 20, there are ways to build the flexibility career wise to be there for your daughter even if you don’t move.
You have a child and should be supporting the child with child support.  I don't know if there are international laws about that and if USA courts would support a claim for child support from South Korea or not, but it's a moral obligation even if it's not a legal one.

Beyond that, it's up to you as far as how involved you want to be in your child's, and baby Momma's, lives.
Register her at the embassy as was mentioned before, and start sending little gifts. Your daughter is going to want to know who you are, so start communicating with her mom. See what she thinks about coming to the US, if you want to be together.
What would you do if this happened to someone you had sex with in the US?
Do whats right

Also, its kinda cool ngl, I wonder if it would be possible to gain SK citizenship through your babymama. Maybe you could move there, might take the edge off becoming an unwilling dad and make this whole thing an exciting chapter

Regardless, do as you must for your daughter. You have an interesting relationship now
Just, no matter what, make sure your daughter feels loved. The wisdom needed for a toddler is much less than the wisdom needed for a teenager. You will mature together. The only thing you will truly regret is neglecting to make her feel as loved as possible as young as possible.
Also esp since there’s a big exchange rate between the Korean won and USD, you can send money that would be extremely helpful to a single mother
Invest in zoom. Write a child support agreement. Start saving for travel.
[removed]
A condom could have prevented this problem
Please don't be a deadbeat and abandon her with the child. Everyone knows what sex leads to. Especially with no contraception in place. You can choose to be a family with her, or you can be an active father. Being active father means making sure your child is well taken care of financially and being present in her life. Did you tell your parents? How do they feel or would feel? You can travel back and forth and don't necessarily have to move there. It would be hard, but it's a beautiful journey and the right thing to do. I hope you 3 the best. YOU CAN DO IT?
Eh. Why not give it a try? Could be the best thing that ever happened to you.
I was born in South Korea and found on the side of the road in a cardboard box as a newborn. I never knew who left me there and I never met any of my biological family members. For all I know, I was born from a single mother who was impregnated by a foreigner during a ONS, having to abandon me due to dire circumstances and an absent father. In other words; don’t be a pussy and support your daughter. You don’t want her to have a life like mine. Be there; you helped make her.
Remember to show the mom plenty of love still and make her smile and laugh like you dod from the start. Dont just break character now
Just an fyi incase you didn’t know type thing if you are thinking of staying in Korea and don’t have a transferable job. As long as you have a bachelor’s from America (any major), no felonies, no HIV (Korea still has stigma against it) you can work as an English teacher/Tutor in Korea. People I personally know have used it as a stepping stone into the country or have made it as a long term career. The money isn’t the best but it’s enough as most places provide housing or a housing stipend.
Whaaaa,congratulations man,you are father!
My advice is this:

Your life has now changed, forever. This isn't a negative thing, it's just changed the course of your future. I recommend looking up work you can do in South Korea, or becoming an English teacher there (you can make decent money). Your priority is your new child and the child's mother. You can develop a very loving relationship with the Woman and have a great family, and wonderful life.

If it were me, I'd be moving to South Korea in a heartbeat. What a great Country to live in, and now you have a very good reason to make that happen. Hangul is also very easy to learn and its a really beautiful language
Congratulations and good luck. I sincerely hope this is the best "mistake" of your life and it leads down a road of fulfillment, personal enrichment and lasting happiness to you, and all.
First of all, to all the people saying he will be a bad person for abandoning his daughter, women have the right to abortions which men don't have. If a woman doesn't feel ready for parenthood, she can abort the baby. If OP feels he doesn't want this, then he should be able to give up his parental rights and move on with his life without any judgment. 

Secondly, if he did decide to be part of that childs life, how??? He is halfway across the world. Via video calls?  Once a year visit, if that? People must just be realistic.

OP, think long and hard, make a wise decision. But also, you don't need to be afraid. I'm sure everything will work out. Just know that a child is a wonderful gift, and if you decide to be part of her life, I know it will bring joy and an awesome sense of pride (talking from experience). I know you're only 20, but it's definitely not the end of the world. Good luck, my friend.
Tuis is literally a textbook case of Fuck Around and Found Out… that you’re having a daughter
No one seems to be addressing this, but it might be important. Was she involved in the DNA testing process in any way? Did you verify that the test was legitimate and couldn’t have been tampered with? It may not be the case, but it's something worth considering.

Also, if you were only there for one month, and she claimed to have found out about the pregnancy toward the end of your trip (which would be roughly 3 to 4 weeks after the first intercourse), it seems a bit suspicious that she would have confirmed her pregnancy so quickly. Generally, it takes around 4 to 6 weeks after conception for pregnancy to be confirmed reliably with a test.

I'm not an expert, but it raises some questions. Additionally, you might want to think about the potential benefits someone could gain from claiming that the father is from abroad, especially considering the complexities with parental rights, immigration, or financial support.

Good luck with everything !

Edit: Also it looks oddly convinient that the DNA results came back in only 3 days, which is really quick. Especially as you were there only for a short time. I have no knowledge on how things work in South Korea's DNA tests. But be careful going foward. Things seems off.
Do the right thing.
Man up.
Take care of your daughter and the mother of your daughter

Don’t be a piece of shit
I mean at the very least you need to financially support your child. Stop having sex without protection especially in foreign fucking countries. Because when you have  sex, a child can come from that and then you're stuck. There's no going back once you have a kid. Time to step up and be a man.
Congrats, it is a girl! 

Seriously... You are a grown ass man and made a choice to have sex which can always lead to the possibility of babies. Step up for your daughter.
Y’all have got to stop raw dogging strangers  that’s why it’s so many stds man 😂😂
Don't listen to all those people telling you to move to Korea and be together with a woman you don't know and don't love... No one can force you to do that. We don't know your education, your aspirations etc. Yeah drop your college an become an English teacher in Korea, what a joke. The baby may be better off with another, Korean father and you deserve a loving relationship and a normal life, too. The baby is important, but not more important than you. The mother MADE THE DECISION TO NOT ABORT, I'm sorry but if "my body my choice" applies then it is also true that a man can choose whether to be a father or not and his life can not be decided by a decision of a woman he barely knows. I can already see the downvotes coming but it's true.
Sucks to be you I guess, time for you to step up and do what’s right for your daughter
Just tell her you going to the store to get milk and will be right back
You're cooked
either give up ur parental rights or start looking for ways to get them to america or u going to korea
You *could* just move there though.

Edit: just saw you remote work. Why on Earth are you still in the US? Get a new tourist visa and start getting info on longer term visas.
I genuinely believe that over time, you will grow a love for that child that you never knew was possible.

Personally, I never wanted children. I never imagined settling down and getting married. I NEVER wanted the white picket fence lifestyle. Ever. The thought of having children gave me cold sweats and repulsed me (there was a lot of trauma that I didn’t realize influenced a lot of this for me from my childhood).

Now, I absolutely love being a mother. My children are the best things that have ever happened to me. I would do almost anything for those kids.

All I can say is trust the process. You may not always understand but everything works out in the end.
Abortion
I may be down voted and I'm okay with that.
How reputable was the agency you used for the DNA test? Regardless, I'd get a second opinion. As I would with any medical test or medical opinion. 

That being said: doing what's right by them isn't going to harm you. You got this. Positive vibes your way OP.
Something about the timing feels weird. 

What method did you use for the DNA test? What clinic, what was the process, et cetera. 

Get a second test.
I think I would be scared if I were in your situation but you cannot undo it now. Think clearly, take time to talk with your loved ones if you can, maybe you won't regret stepping up for your daughter and it could be the best decision for you.
[deleted]
You have to deal with the consequences of your actions broski, and I promise you you will be better for it. It may suck in the short term but in the long term the fulfillment you get out of it will be  infinite and I'm willing to bet will open up opportunities and experiences you werent even entertaining before or felt out of reach.
Sometimes it just works out
Facts are this is your son and a result of voluntary sex
 
Anyone will tell you their opinion

Simply answer these questions and you will get the answer

What does your offspring deserve? 
And what is right for him? 

Whose responsibility is a baby? If this responsibility wasn't claimed by the right person what could happen? 

Did you grow up with a father? if you did imagine if you didn't, if not do you think if u had a father present wouldn't that have made life different in a good way for you?
Is there anything preventing you from moving there? I know that many people aren't experienced with moving often, but if you love her and want to support the baby, (as you should) you might want to entertain the possibility of moving there to help out.
Man to man, you need to step up. You made a decision and now you should do the right thing. You've got a daughter. Yes you're young but you're still a man. You should act like one. 

You don't have to be romantically involved with the mother but you need to support your daughter. Do the right thing.
Life goes in weird directions. This is one of those times. Make the most of it.
Firstly, congrats. 

Secondly, what a mess, but you can make it work. This comes with tons of questions. Ideally, you two move together in whichever country seems to work best - support networks and wealth matters ton, maybe go for double income careers after year or two years, raise up the kid well, and who knows you two go along wonderfully and there will more and happy ever afters. 


Realistically, something less, but minimum is to figure out some stable income and sort out from there. How wealthy/poor she is, how are her support networks etc - can she handle the kid? How about you - do you have parents that could and would want to you two moving there together for a while when you figure out way to make it work? Does the mother of your kid even want to move from Korea, do you live in region that is equally good or better for raising up a kid? ...tho, that seems bit unlikely, maybe, but ... can there evenne work in Korea for you? ...military maybe, sounds rough tho.


Third, importantly, find a way to be present in the life of your kid, it'll be worth it. Of course you could go the abandon-no-contact-asshole-route, but you know to strive to be better than that. Not like kids come easy and often these days, make best of this shot of raising a worthy heir.

Tough spot, make best of it, it'll work out somehow, but make a heavy attempt to be the kind of man you want to be and see how it goes then. It is a human life, your kid, that you're responsible of. Act like it.
Hookups have consequences. Yours just came sooner rather than later, so you have to deal with it in a mature manner. You absolutely have to do right by the kid - discuss with the mother and together come to an agreement as to what's best for you to do, so that everybody gets the best out of the situation. Maybe try to get to actually know the girl, after all if she was good enough to hook up with, maybe you're also going to like her as a person and she can become your life partner. Or, if that's not in the cards, you will most certainly need to provide for the baby.

You won't get anywhere by just thinking about it on your own. Communicate with her and together you can figure it out.
"'DO WHAT IS RIGHT BY OUR DAUGHTER."  🌻

Congratulations! Dad . . .
You fucked up, bro. You lived by your consequences, now you have to be the man to die by them.

Get learning Korean. Ask her for help if you need. And if you’re serious about her, tell her that. Because this is your new life and you chose it whether it was careless or not. 

Be the dad that stepped up, or be a failure forever. I wouldn’t let my honour go to shit.
It’s your baby and your kid and the outcome of your decisions. The baby is your responsibility and now you need to ensure the baby you helped make has a good life. The least you can do is pay child support and frequently visit
You did the deed and now you have a kid on the way. You don’t have to have a relationship with the mother if you don’t want to, but pay child support and do the right thing by having a relationship with your future kid.

And maybe take this as a sign to not make stupid decisions like this.
That's tough OP but i know and you know what's the right thing to do for your daughter. I'm not here to judge you or blame you for your naiveness but what happened happens and the sooner you accept the fact that you have a daughter now is the better. Be responsible and start planning things 2 steps ahead you have a much greater responsibility now..
Wife her up and bring to usa
If you are stressing just imagine what the young soon to be mother of your child is going through.
I mean, SK is a country where abortion is often a non-option, unfortunately. In countries where abortion is a reasonable alternative and a woman chooses not to take it, I generally think that we shouldn't treat men like monsters for leaving when they get women pregnant. Not to say that it isn't *better* when they do stay, but these things are complicated, especially for a young guy, and I find it hard to blame someone for not wanting to get trapped with a girl, especially one he barely knows, when she had the option to terminate the pregnancy and didn't. However, South Korea has a very weird situation with abortion, and I have no idea what this girl's options were. 

The unfortunate answer is that there is no easy answer. The *best* thing you can do is probably to try to make things right. Ideally, maybe you can move to SK or vice versa and settle down with this girl, and help raise your daughter. Who knows, moving over there could be an exciting adventure! Barring that, you could at least offer financial support and try to visit when you can. All of that said, it's understandable that you're unsure of making a big commitment like this. However, it sounds like you didn't even indicate to her from the off that you didn't want a kid, which would make me far less sympathetic if you left her now. 

These are just some things to mull over. Again, there is no super easy answer, as some people here would have you believe. But I think if you think hard about it, you'll probably agree that the morally right thing to do is to at least try to help in what ways you reasonably can.
Life happens and i believe it happens for a reason.You can decide what you want move the mom to be here if she is willing and you can be in the baby’s life or do the long distance thing which won’t be much of a life for you .
Personally, I'd ask here what she wanted you to do. Moving there isn't financially possible for for you and I imagine her moving ymto the us isn't an option ether. And with the price of plane tickets it's not likely you be able to visit often unless you have a great job. So ask her for her input.
There's no choice to be made, go take care of your kid.
Own up man. Marry her. 

You get the awesome wife.
Best advice I can give you is get her a Isa bring her to the US and take care of your manly responsibility
Time to man up. Make a game plan to be in your daughter's life. She will need your help and protection.
I mean I would be happy to have kids but not with a random ass women I met 1 time. This is extremely sad OP, best you can do is try to form a connection with the kid and the mom.
Hell yeah dude congrats you won
Sometimes life just redirected you suddenly
May I ask your age?
Doesn’t let me say that I didn’t see your first post but I’m seeing this one. 
I know finding out you having a child it is scary. It’s so unknown. But believe me once you see your daughter things may change, all the fears and scares will go away for a while until they start growing up. Then nervous will set in but sometimes little ones changes our life for the best. Don’t think so negative about this. 
If you two don’t want to be in a relationship that’s fine, but you share a child. At least do your best to co-parent. 

I think a talk about what to do now is at play. You two should talk what would be best for which of you move. Think of all the pros and cons. 

I would do what others have suggested to register your daughter in the US embassy in Korea. 

I think you guys need to talk about if she wants to give birth there and wait a couple of months and then move, or vise versa. Or have the baby in the US but it all depends how far long she is. 

Take one step at a time. Don’t do anything rushed. But one thing is for sure, you need to come to terms you having a little one on the way.

I don’t know if anything I’ve said has helped, but I hope it did some help.
At least you were man enough to see if it was yours. everything will work out for you. life is crazy like that
I understand you’re freaking out and this is very crazy and all happening at once but the reality is you had unprotected sex with a stranger in another country. It really doesn’t matter how you feel about this situation you did what you did. You need to own up and take responsibility for that. I’m not saying you have to uproot your life and live there permanently and marry this woman. But you certainly need to be in this child’s life one way or another. I had a similar situation happen with my now fiancé. She was here on a Visa when we met and I got her pregnant just before she had to go back to Korea. It wasn’t even a question for me, I went back and forth between the two countries frequently until she was finally comfortable with the idea of moving here to be with me and raise our child. Just do the right thing here and don’t try to run away.
Move to Korea
Oh man.. sounds like you’re going through an incredibly emotional and challenging time, and it’s great that you’re seeking advice. First of all, it’s important to acknowledge that you’ve taken responsibility by going back for the DNA test, which shows you’re trying to handle this situation maturely.

That being said, it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed right now. You have a huge decision ahead of you, not just for yourself but also for your daughter and her mother. Moving forward, I think the most important thing is to approach this practically and consider all options.

First, think about what kind of relationship you want with your daughter and how much you want to be involved in her life. If you’re not able to move to Korea, could you work out a co-parenting arrangement where you visit regularly or have her visit you as she grows older? Also, try to have an open conversation with her mother about your concerns and how you can both cooperate to provide the best environment for your daughter. She will be a parent too, together with you. 

It’s also okay to take time to process your emotions, but keep the lines of communication open with the mother. Your actions now will have a lasting impact on your daughter’s life, so it’s good to make thoughtful and informed decisions.

Some comments suggested seeking legal advice, in this case, you may want to consult a lawyer who specializes in international family law to understand your responsibilities and rights.

Don’t forget to lean on trusted friends or family for support, and if you’re feeling really overwhelmed, consider speaking with a counselor who can help you navigate this emotionally. You’re not alone in this, and taking things one step at a time is the best way to move forward.

Wishing you strength as you figure this out 🙏🏻💖
I’d look at options on moving her and the baby out to America. I believe that would be the best option since it’s better to raise a baby in the us then is SK
You need to get some advice from people who have experience with what you are going through. 

But I will tell you one thing. I have never regretted anything that I did with the best interests of my children in mind. Whatever you decide to do, the best advice you have gotten is from the child's mother and that is to do what is best for your child. 

Also, being a father is awesome. And they grow up so fast; you can't even believe how fast it goes. So figure this out quick.
You provide for that child. Make sure you register as a dual citizen, send child support, be in her life every way you can.
Start putting some money into a long term Investment, so your daughter can have some choices when gets bigger/adult. It's tough. Do you want her to know you?. Spending time will have to happen. Good luck
Going against the grain here and not commenting on what ya’ll should have done. What’s done is done now. I’d bring her and the kid here. I don’t care about up or downvotes. I’d wanna see and raise my kid.

She sounds sweet. Do the right thing and get married and bring her home and have five more. Embrace life.
I’d say remove ownership
Try to convince her to abort it
I really think it’s gonna be hard for her to enforce child support from all the way across the world
Just wondering. Do you have to pay her child support or because you are in a different country there’s no way to enforce it?
*Appaaaaaa* sounds to me like although it happened unexpectedly you chose a decent mother of your child with a good head on her shoulders and very laid back. Life works in many ways don’t beat yourself up too much, your daughter will be the biggest blessing in your life. You can either stay in America or go live in Korea to be close to her pregnancy is not easy for everyone so I ask just to keep that part in mind too on how she carries / what she is going through in this journey as well , years from now you’ll look back and appreciate this
How old are you and your pregnant girlfriend?
Congratulations!!! 🎉
Shaking and sweating huh... maybe you shouldn't have made a Korean creampie. Obviously that's on her too. Are you sure this outcome wasn't her intent to begin with?
She's pregnant. So, what did you think was going to happen?
What's your job/education situation?
OP I’ve been in your shoes. Went to Japan in my early 20s. Now have a wonderful 30 year old son. 

Support and love your child. It won’t be easy. But just do it. 

Take your time with the mother of your child. No rush to marry or anything like that. Best wishes
I'm sorry but how immature can you be to hook up with someone and impregnate her???? None of you thought about using a condom? And what did you do to prevent that? Came outside? This is ridiculous. I really hope your daughter won't be affected by your actions.
Do you want to do the right thing, or do you want to do the thing that feels good right this second? 

There are things that happen to us all that, at the time, feel like the end of the world. Most of the time those are blessings in disguise. They change our life. They cause us to go in a different direction. 

In your heart, you know what the right thing to do is, but in case you don't, I'll tell you my theory: If you don't do the right thing, this little girl is young to grow up without a father. In Korean society, that's a punishment no one would want. She'll live her whole life punished for the fun you had. 

On the other hand, if you do the right thing, you'll get to be a dad. GET. It's the greatest thing a man can ever do. Nothing is more fun, more rewarding, more life changing. There's nothing like waking up in the middle of the night to your child's crying, going into their room, cuddling them and rocking them to sleep again. Nothing like it. I would give anything to do it all over again. Watching my kids grow up and become teenagers has been the most enjoyable time entire life, and I've had an interesting and fun life. 

Secondly, you must have liked this girl to a degree. Is she marryable? Is she nice, kind, pretty? What does her family think of you? 

I don't know how old you are, but it may be time to hang up the old life and step into the adventure of a new life. You might even learn to love it. 

I hope for you, and the young lady, and your daughter, you'll do the right thing. It won't be easy, but you'll be better for it. 

I hope you read this. Good luck, kiddo.
Find out what her definition of the right thing is.  And what her family will do if she has a child out of wedlock.  She may not have a choice but to leave her family’s help.   She may want marriage or may want child support.  Communicate to get an idea of expectations and what you realistically can provide.
You go. Get married and bring them hole to mom and dad with you. Welcome to adult hood.
Your obligations as a father are not just financial, supportive and emotional, you HAVE to BE WITH HER, what's the freaking point of supporting her and the mother financially if you are not going to be with your child, she needs you, she needs to be with you, she needs a father to be with her, she needs a father to protect her, I can only think of 2 options, either move with her or she moves with you, a child is nothing that solves itself just giving them money.
I hope you make the right desicion, no child should grow without their parents.
I think you have to work out something to take care of the child. The child is innocent. 
I would get a lawyer who can set up something to ensure the child is taken care of. 
The reality of going back and forth won’t happen. 
Or bring them here. It doesn’t mean you have to marry the women but you can then be the father.
Many people are telling you to leave and be selfish, but have you even tried a relationship? Have you tried being a dad? How do you know it won't work? Don't let fear ruin your life.
What about assist with  child support?  Is the mom  financially capable to meet child's needs? I think that's the real question. Was it even discussed?  I cannot see a marriage of this type working no matter where the couple live.
What you felt is exactly how a first time father should feel and it's how I felt as well. Just know that there are many milestones you felt you weren't ready for throughout your entire life including walking on your own. It's okay to be afraid & it sounds like the mother really cares about the babies future , take it into consideration. I guarantee being in that child's life will be the best thing you've ever done in your life and you won't regret it. There's no instruction manual for being a parent , just be the very best you can be. CONGRATULATIONS!!! ❤️
And this is why you don’t hook up dumb asses
Hey man, don't listen to what others said about fetishist Asians. You went to a foreign country, you slept with a woman. No difference with going to Europe and hooking up with an Italian or Spanish woman. You gotta do what's right.
This almost happen to me..but I lucked out.. very difficult to pull out.. there so tight
take responsibility for your actions. you might not want to move but you had shmex unprotected and it’s not anyone’s place to judge you but as a man you need to step up. you’re gonna have to make some sacrifices and that might mean moving to SK to be with her and your child. i suggest committing to getting to know her and her family even if you gotta download duolingo
You stuck it in unsheathed, then you better be prepared to take care of the result. If only financially.
I don’t think you have to move there. but making sure she at least has child support money. She also has a choice and whether to keep it or not. But i also don’t know the laws or culture and South Korea so I’m not sure about that either. But both of you  uprooting your life to move to another country is also not needed but it’s up to you all in the end of what you think is best for your child and yourselves
Honestly- get off Reddit and see a Family law Atty for advice .
Don't decide to marry just for the child.
Well you have sex with a woman, pregnancy can happen. 

Congrats you are now a father. Register the child’s birth with the US once born so she has the right to come here when she becomes an adult. SK only allows dual citizenship until the turn 22, then they have to pick. 

Start figuring out how to be a father. This is your child.
I don't envy your position, idk if I could do it if I was in your position.
Best of luck with you. Even if you don't move to Korea, you can still do lots of things. Fly there for big events, call and text them often, send money, fly them over to visit your family.

Just staying in the child's life is a huge part. So don't feel overwhelming pressure to move to Korea permanently or to get married. You definitely can it those things feel right to you. But just staying together for the baby when you barely know the girl probably won't work out great in the long term.
Hey first of all congratulations!

Many people become parents when they're not ready, but make the most of life as it is. I'd urge you to test living together with a plan to see what works, if it doesn't, that's ok.

Stay in each other's lives for the sake of the new generation, as much as that requires.

If you can't try coparenting, do what you can to provide for your child. It's a big responsibility, but this is life.

I should know, I became a Dad at 24, and my wife was crying when she told me, we weren't married, but we made it work for 11yrs. We're still legally married but not romantic partners anymore, but coparent and still have as much of our kids lives shared as we like.

We're so much richer for the brilliant hilarious gift of these little people who talk back to us. My son is now a teenager and he's great.

Make the most of it, your life will be so much richer.

If money is an issue I understand, but think of every possible way to try parenting before thinking it can't be done. Now's your chance, you are a Dad already!
honestly having a conversation with the mother would probably be the best, how much of a role does she want you to play? does she want a reasonable amount per month for basic stuff? whats the minimum in s.korea? what are their laws for single moms? i'd look into everything and then decide, obviously moving out there is unlikely, and the money you make in america is probably better
You must hate seeing condom ads
You can get a fiance visa and move here her to the states. 
You’re doing the most mature thing you can do, happy for you! Everything will turn out okay!!
If you really like her, then maybe you should get married and spawn more ...



...overlords
Rice cooker
Glad to hear you’re going to spend some time with them, that’s the best option
What a sitch
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. You look like someone who would ditch their kid anyway.
It’s kind of (very) effed up to just accidentally anyone of that fetish just based on this.  Aggravating.  It ticks me off because accusations like that dilute REAL bigotry.  Ungh.
It will be hard but you need to take responsibility for  your kid
Damn bruh! You fucked up. But it is what it is I guess.
Man just make sure she’s an American citizen and if you want her biological mother to be apart of her life file a visa for her and marry her so she can stay permanently when she comes.

The truth is Korean and other Asian women look at American white men like yummy fools chumps of meat 🍖 to devour and consume. For US citizenship. 
Bro u are a sloppy mfer
Man, it's a good thing you like Korean food because you're going to be eating a *lot* of it, king.
I went through all of those feelings when my daughter was born. DNA test, the works. I was 19 and scared shitless. She's 15 now and the best thing that ever happened to me. Nothing more important or fulfilling than being a father, in whatever way works for your situation. God bless
Wow. This is an amazing story. How powerful it is that you stood by your child and this woman even though it was a hook up. I hope you receive a lifetime of blessings through this decision and I believe your daughter is truly favored for having a father like you. 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
How are people this irresponsible? Who thinks it's a good idea to not use protection when hooking up with someone you barely know. Better man the fuck up and be there for your daughter and her mother. Next time let the big head do the thinking.
My advice is to get your kid to the U.S. and don't allow the mother to dictate everything with your child.  You could be placed in a position where SK affirms her parental rights and disregards yours.
Way to step up kid!
So you just raw dogged it in Korea ?
Jesus Christ, dude. So here's the thing, you were foolish enough not to wear protection, you were definitely not thinking straight, man and now, this has costed you.


The thing is, the women is choosing to keep the baby and this is her choice alone. She is taking full responsibility for that choice even knowing that you may not choose to get involved.


I am not going to tell you to move to Korea and do "what's right". Only you know what is right in this situation.


I definitely believe the women is delusion for keeping the pregnancy in this horrific situation and her, having any expectations of you is ridiculous. Yes, you didn't use protection but she didn't either. So, fault is shared. 


So dude, is entirely up to you. I am not pushing down your throat any high morale bullshit. At the end of the day, this is a mistake you and the girl made. She chooses to keep the pregnancy and take responsibility. You can still choose not to get involved at all. But that's going to be hard, knowing that somewhere in Korea you made a baby. Good luck to you mate 
Tell her to get an abortion so you can move on
I know I'm late to this, but mate. Please read this. It makes sense in the end. Ask anyone who fits the following => If you were ever unfortunate enough to have something happen to you where you spend some real time alone in hospital with a realistic chance that you're going to die; everyone who has been in that situation will tell you. A remarkable thing happens. You find yourself/the meaning of life. I'm telling you everything that I thought was important suddenly meant nothing. It's weird. What suddenly mattered was family, connection. All that silly cliché crap that you always just rolled your eyes at. The only thing on your mind is the people you care for. Go be with your child. Because imagine the alternative. Imagine every single big moment in her life. Times when things happen where you'd love to have a dad there to be proud of you, comfort you, or just enjoy the moment with you. She will always just have nothing. Emptiness. Imagine some other guy walking your daughter down the aisle one day. Mate. You don't have to marry the chick, but be in her and your child's lives. If they can't relocate to your country, then you relocate there. Just do it. Make it work. Otherwise, one day, you're going to be in for some of the most painful regret in your final moments. Sorry for being so somber; I've just seen this too many times. And I've been blessed to have that moment of realization and clarity early enough in my life to avoid mistakes and really hoping to pass it on to you. Having a child is weirdly one of the best things that can happen to you. Nobody understands that until it's you in that position. Embrace it. Enjoy it.
I mean if that kid wasn't planned 
She could have choosen abortion 
Isn't that obvious.....
Be the best father you can be by providing financial support and a home she’s always welcome in. Be there for the mother as much as you can and in future, don’t grope(without a rubber) people that you don’t want pregnant.
Go for it. Be a dad, it’s going to be awesome. Move to South Korea, learn the language, raise your daughter, buy a house, come back to the states for holidays, visit Japan, China, Philippines. That girl seems cool and understanding (she wasn’t mad or anything). Do something almost no one else would do, live an amazing life. It will all be worth it.
Anyone saying hes a bad person for not knowing what to do as a young parent also insults every victim of sa and child born through unwanted circumstances.

You're all disgusting and if you genuinely think hes a bad dad then you also need to sort yourself out before you start parenting. "Yikes" if you already are.
Bring them to America
Make a big decision on whether you have a moral framework that you are prepared to live by. 

You dont have to have one- they are totally optional.

Full disclosure- I am an absolute convinced atheist- so no God shit from me.  
Take abortion, as an example- I'm a guy, and Im totally against abortion- unless its someone elses womb, then I have no say. So Im completely agnostic on the subject, because it will never be me.

Take the death of children in War, say , Syria, Palestine, the Yemen, Ukraine.... do you really give a fuck? 

My children never suffered under war, because we live in safety- so Im sad about others... but, like what the fuck? They arent my kids who are being slaughtered, and life goes on. Just like the little 9 yr olds in Africa spending 12 hrs a day in knee deep mud looking for precious metals for Elon, while the bastards who rape them at night whip them during the day.

Or the kids in India who sniff glue all day to stay warm while they gather tin cans and plastic to recycle to survive.

Am I a horrid person? Probably... but I do actually care... I just realise that no-one can do fuck all about it, so why stress? I really cant stand people who express horror but do nothing... like - stop being upset with the reality of human horror- its always been this way. Chill out.

  
So - how will you feel 20 years from now knowing your child is being raised ( probably quite well- it seems their Mum is thoughtful), and whether or not this plays on your mind.

Tell the truth- but realise this- YOU did it, and they will want to know you, at some point- so do your best for your kid and dont be a cunt... OR ... cut of all comms and be a cunt like the rest of humanity.

Good luck with your decision.
If you can't move there and she can't move to the USA, at least be present in both her and the childs life. Like financial support, video calling, attempt to learn korean, visiting Korea or her visiting USA with the child.
"texted her through Instagram"

Is this the new way to contact someone?
Get married and bring her to the states
Either you green card her up, or you move there, unless you want to be the absent father that sends child support.
Firstly, congratulations. You might not feel like it's a good thing right now, but I'm sure once your daughter is born and you see her, hold her and start to spend time with her, you will be grateful for her.

Keep building your relationship with the mother, you don't have to be a couple, but coparenring is much easier when both parties are civil and friendly. You're in the US, so work out a schedule with her of how and when you can be involved. Things like when you can go over throughout the year, when they can come to you, how often you can call/video chat your kid and what she needs from you. 

You might be regretting what happened, but that doesn't matter now. You've made a life with this girl and you're both responsible for making sure the babies life is as good as you can make it. Please don't be a deadbeat dad. Stay around for her and keep in touch.

Please keep us updated!
Ask her what she wants to do, most of koreans dream of moving to america maybe thats why she wasnt upset because she got an american baby daddy now, if shes willing to move then you can start a new life with her or let her stay in Korea and pay child support
Weren't were aware about what could happen having unprotected sex? Be a fucking man and be there for the human being you brought into this world. What sort of questions are these such as what are you supposed to do? What are you expecting people to say? Don't be a deadbeat dad.
If you are stressing just imagine what the young soon to be mother of your child is going through.
Never come back
RemindMe! Six weeks.
Pretty easy actually. You will either live the rest of your life as a deadbeat dad and not care about it at all or regret it all your life. Depends what kind of person you are(you know yourself best). 2nd option, take responsibility and take care of your daughter. Your life dreams and goals will end for at least the foreseeable future as the family's welfare will take precedents. You will either be bitter about them ruining your life or you will come to love them. The easy road is option 1, the hard road is option 2.
should’ve pulled out 🤷🏼‍♂️ or condom. i really don’t understand not pulling out / nutting in someone the whole ‘i might have a kid if i do cum in her’ thought kind of ruins it for me n is a turn off. i mean to each their own but, thinking of consequences >>> short term pleasure.  every.  single. time.

as for what to do now ? you gotta decide. but the least you can do is send her money , saw someone else say the exchange rate between korean & USD is quite a bit so i’m sure sending USD would be a huge help to her , the least you could do if you don’t go back there or she doesn’t come here w the kid
Hey OP, a small inquiry. You can do right by your kid while you’re afar, but imho the way the woman responded and how calm she is all throughout the ordain. I’d say wife her up. Rare to find non-crazies these days. Plus, she been through enough being pregnant and alone for 9 months is crazy. Imagine all the doctors appointment she had to go through alone. Maybe dip your toes wet and see what it’s like to be with her and now your family like and then make a decision? 

Might get downvoted for this but it’s the most rational thing i have in my mind if you wanna get grounded and start the real adult life whether you like it or not
Start learning Korean bro, for real 😁 Move in with her in USA and support her however you can?
One day you will look at your daughter and thank G-d for how lucky you are to have her. Parenthood is the most rewarding activity on earth. You will get past this oh crap phase and embrace her and the mother. Congratulations! Consider yourself a very blessed and lucky man!
Abortion???
Come back when you get a NORTH Korean girl pregnant.
Just confirming that you went with her while the DNA testing was being done, were present during the procedure at a medical facility and they provided you directly with a copy of the paternity test? I’m not saying she’s not being truthful but there is a lot on the line here and I would want to trust but verify. 

It’s the timing for me. You had sex the first or second week you were there. She either missed her period before you left and then tested. Or she was suspecting it and was testing until she received a positive. 

My intent is not to be disrespectful to either of you, especially the young woman though if I were your mom, I would want you to be 100% sure.
Don’t ever go back, fuck that kid lol
This almost happened to me but reverse. I became pregnant in Korea but I miscarried thank GOD
Tbh, I feel like this story is sus as fuck. What responsible guy (OP sounds “responsible”, at least he’s not trying to run away) doesn’t wear a condom? Why would he not ask her to abort it at all? Why would this girl keep a baby from a guy she’s met like once/twice? It sounds like a ploy to get American citizenship/hitched with a rich foreign guy. Really odd story all round.
guys she kept the baby because shes a christian and so i am well i guess a lukewarm christian
I'm gonna keep it way more real than everybody in here. I(21m at the time) was a soldier in Korea and was in the same situation. I got a women pregnant just before I left.

I was adamant about not having a kid and she was certain she wanted it. I left her in that country and didn't look back. 8 Years and I have no regrets. Is it shitty? Yeah. But i know my life would have been so much worse if I tried to make it work with a woman I didn't really know from a foreign country as a kid. Make your decision in life.
No need to take responsibility she could have had abortion you have no obligation just do what you want
*Running GIF*
Would you consider her moving to you so you two can try for a better situation for the kid? It could be one of lifes serendipities to find your family like this
Does this mean you get dual citizenship?
Wow you didn’t use a condom?
Well your opinions are
1 get her abortion if u don't wanna marry her because I think it's hard to be a single mother in Korea.
 2 you can marry her since u said u like her and try getting her us citizenship 
3 pay child support and just stay in us

But if it was me I feel too much guilt leaving a single mother like that.

Talk with her and ask what she wants you to do.
South korea is a shit country with so many problems. 

I guess abortion is already out of the choices?

Tell her to pack up, start learning english and make anything you can to get her and baby to the USA and try to have a relationship.

Also if you don't want the child and she wants it you still can only pay child support and that's it.
How old are you then? Having a child at a young age without a stable job and family planning is very stressful.
The child will have to choose SK or USA citizenship.  SK does not allow dual citizenship anymore.
This is the right call. Also means that the kid will pay american income tax no matter where she lived in the world, but it is a small price to pay for all the benefits.
I'm currently in the process of learning Korean for the sake of my in laws on duolingo. It's brutal but not too terrible at first. I'm still learning syllables just glad it's free. I'm hoping to be able to add it as a skill on my resume as well once I get fluent enough. May also start learning Spanish. I hope op has the best of luck though 🙏
you're in an incredibly stressful situation. reflect on your relationship with the mother and how involved you want to be in your child's life. Take your time, but don't delay addressing your responsibilities.
OP, does she want to at least visit america? You could do this whole being a dad thing in english in america.
[removed]
😅😅😅
This was my take away… who the fck does that???  If you fuck without a condom (and sometimes even with) there is always a chance you can impregnate someone.  How is this mind blowing to a 20 year old???
Fr someone said it! Ppl r wild and don't think of the consequences.
I think safe sex rhetoric really dropped off at some point. Maybe as the aids crisis felt further and further away, it became less of a priority from a public health education standpoint?

I also blame the rise of abstinence only education in the US- some kids just never grew up with access to any knowledge about this stuff, which is a shame. People are gonna fuck and suck anyway, with or without the facts.
Insanity. I would never
lol - oh no! It’s the consequences of my own actions!
Take as old as time
It's called sex tourism. Very sad. And it's both women and men doing this.
The way I cackled at this
It's a very Christian thing to do
Lol yeah, you'd be surprised by how many people do. Not sure how old OP is but when you're young, randy, and perhaps a wee bit intoxicated you'll do stuff like that.
Hey your friend may be one of them! Just saying..from experience 😭
This, to do what is right to your daughter means to be involved in her life, not to marry her mom.

Start with the child support and build up from there. 

Good luck!
I wonder if support could even be enforced from another country.  How does that work? I'm not referring to the ethical ramifications, but the realistic way in which many men move in the world.
Why on earth is he fu€king ANY woman he doesn't know without protection?  

He's lucky a baby is the only consequence that he came home with.
Best answer yet I think
I don’t think people are being too harsh at all. When it comes to bringing another person into the world, and as heavy of a responsibility as creating life it’s absolutely infuriating to see people acting surprised and not willing to own up to their own actions. 

Like genuinely what would to expect having sex without protection in another country??

It’s not just like an accidents happen type thing. This situation was 100000% preventable. If you have enough money to fly across the world you have enough money to buy condoms.

It’s not like OP is a teen and maybe lacks sex ed or whatever. OP is a full grown adult who knows where babies come from

Oh and for the record, it takes two to tango. The mother is just as equal to blame. Taking chances with a guy multiple seas away is extremely irresponsible
The leg up pun is nice
Might want to talk to an immigration lawyer too. See if you can get her and the baby to come to you?
This. This. This. This.

I was also a young dad. I stepped up. Now I'm making enough money to put my kid through college. It is hard but your life is not over. I'm a gigging musician on the side and my wife is my best friend.

You got this.
This wording is really good. Life is hard, and it’s certainly not fair. Every one of us has to go through situations we don’t want to and deal with the consequences of actions we aren’t proud of. This won’t be OP’s last time having to go through a stressful situation where their world feels like it’s crumbling - that’s life. And it’s okay to get upset about it and scared and freak out. Or need time alone think or someone to talk to about it. At the end of the day, though, the daughter and the mom will still be there. And OP is the adult (a dad) in the situation. So: shoulders back, chest proud, eyes forward. You can do this OP. There is so much joy and happiness in childhood, and it can be really fulfilling and meaningful to care for someone you love. 

There’s some really good advice in these comments. I would add: if it’s available to you, seek out some who you can talk to about all this with. Someone who you trust and with whom you can have private conversations about how you are doing/how you are processing/what you need.  Could be a counsellor, therapist, spiritual leader, whatever. Maybe a grandma? No matter what OP ends up doing or not doing, there will be a lot of feelings to feel.
Very reasonable comment. He seems to already understand the gravity of the situation or he wouldn’t be freaking out, which is good. What’s done is done, hopefully this has a happy ending. It sounds like the mother is handling herself very well. Not pushing for anything yet not trying to alienate him.
Great comment! I agree that giving people too much shit after the fact is pretty ineffective.

An ex married an Australian, got him moved to the states as a permanent alien.  It took a couple years and was a PITA.  They had normal people money.  It was primarily jumping through hoops.  

Not sure if there is a race factor here but I think fluent English speaker carries a lot of weight in that situation.  As does OP's kid.
look up SC (lack of) child support. Ain't no "at least" here. He won't be jailed for not like in the US, so maybe if we want him to be in this child's life we should be encouraging him instead of talking down to him with shaming language like mAn Up.

Reading his comments, he's already doing "the right thing". If you paid attention to the dates in what he wrote, he's a father now. And despite what the majority of y'all are saying, he's _allowed_ to be scared. He's a human being, and his feelings are valid.
Cringe ass comment. Dude made a mistake, and it's not as simple as just catching a plane and flying to South Korea to live there.
thank you this honestly helps fortunately i have a work from home job i work in insurance
And then what? Honestly what does any of that have to do with anything?
Unfortunately, those are her problems. She also made the choice to hookup with a random stranger from another country. He can’t just fix their culture because she has a baby. He can’t move there and fix it. He can’t do much of anything in the way of their culture. So I’m not exactly sure what you’re wanting him to do about it.
Excellent advice if OP is willing to step out of his comfort zone!
It isn’t as easy as simply “moving over there” though, visas and work permits are required.
Honestly they’d be much better off in Korea. The government is currently very invested in making more Korean babies, mixed or not. Massive support for new parents.
Oh my god i didn’t even think about how her family would react, especially being from south korea which is a rather conservative country. As dumb as it was to have unprotected sex with a foreign hookup, I feel heavily for her 💔
Well, dude didn't wear protection but neither did she. Also, she choose to keep the pregnancy and bring a baby into the world in this situation which is quiet fucked up
thank you
A nightmare 🥲
He's 20 and works from home
I wish and hope you will find the solution and pray that the path is smooth. Every human makes a mistake. Don't be sad. Don't lose your heart.
My thoughts too XD wife in Korea works for me, just learn the language
couldn't think, blood had rushed out of his head haha
Yep.  I'm guessing they're going to be well-supported if they live in SK.
I know, right? Americans who have never left their home state are commenting on "baby trapping"... like what? He's the lucky one here. Gets to move to a great country and start a happy and healthy family. Main obstacle will be affording an education, thankfully it only costs a few months salary there instead of decades of your life like in the US...
 I second this recommendation - or really any similar system. Pimsleur was the start of my journey to fluency. (It was a long road, but Pimsleur was a good start). Their approach is essentially "Listen, repeat, take break, revisit". They have you repeating phrases over a set short time interval so it sticks in your mind quite well. Easier to memorize something if you remind yourself of it 5 minutes after learning it.

>>If OP feels he doesn't want this, then he should be able to give up his parental rights and move on with his life without any judgment.


Before giving that kind of advice to OP you would need to look into international law on whether OP is able to sign away parental rights. 
im definitely the father theres no way she could have tampered with it also looking at the baby you can tell shes mixed im ethnically mexican and could see that in her i guess mexican and korean mix well
The quickest you can officially get a positive test result is 10 days post ovulation. If you head over the trying to conceive sub, there’s plenty of people who test this easily and get positives. It’s a very faint line. Some people have got them as early as 9 days. Then add some days as intercourse can be a few days before or after and still catch the egg. 

But these people are usually tracking their ovulation and trying to conceive. 

However you can have sex and have a positive 2 weeks later (I’ve done it). It’s not common for people who aren’t trying to conceive (because people don’t test until a missed period) but it definitely does happen.
Maybe move her to America with you
Op made a decision with his body not to wear a condom. He now has to deal with the ramifications of his choice. If he didn't want to face the potential of fatherhood, he should have made a more responsible choice.
I completely agree with this guy, don’t do anything rash. Moving to Korea would be a terrible decision… do you even speak Korean? Could you get a good job in Korea? It’s very raw at the moment, I think you need to take a lot of time to think what to do next
>>a man can choose whether to be a father  


Before giving that kind of advice to OP you would need to look into international law on whether OP is able to sign away parental rights. 


Your comment on "my body, my choice" for men is a moot point -- it may have made a little more sense if OP did his part by wearing a condom or using another male contraceptive method, and is thus unwilling to assume legal and other parental responsibilities. OP chose not to use protection, and his daughter is already here.
Fully 100% agree with you, she made the decision to not abort, you have a right to your own life. Just cut contact and she'll never find you again, pretend it never happened.
OP should note that one cannot apply for a Korean visa while in Korea. When he's ready to apply, he'd have to fly to a nearby country (usually Japan or Taiwan) and apply at the Korean embassy. Makes a nice weekend trip.
Ps I'm not religious so people don't come at me, my wife and I simply decided to go for it once it was happening anyway.
how so?
bro she had the baby already
i think abortion is looked down on in korea
I got no clue how to meet anyone these days, I try to meet in person and they just get freaked out, but I didn't have social media...
shes already born
>>most of koreans dream of moving to america


I'm afraid you're misinformed, if you meant permanently moving to US, not living in the US temporarily (expat). A lot of Koreans may have wanted to move to the US some time ago, and I don't doubt many would still be willing/planning to move, but nowadays "most Koreans" certainly don't dream of  settling down in the US for various reasons that are perhaps ill-suited for discussion in this subreddit. There are other countries that are just as, if not more, preferred by prospective Korean migrants/expats.

she already has it
yes i went with her i was actually observing everything i possible coupd to see if she pulled anything but no everything was legit and im the father
im not lying she kept the baby because she’s religious in the christian faith so am i and why i wouldn’t ask her to get a abortion that didn’t even cross my mind at the time
Well, you know what the good book says to do, and even if you don't really believe in it just understand that it is still the morally right thing to do and that it's never as bad as you think it is.
y’all are both not real christian’s so please stop calling urself that 😂😂😂 y’all are and disgusting and dumb literally what christian’s have one night stands and get pregnant irresponsible and dumb asf should be ashamed of ur selves equally stupid i’d be disappointed if my child did some dumb shit like that but they’d never they all know better
Peak human selfishness. Doing the deed and forgoing the consequences. 8 years. Imagine your child's face at 8 years old. That's just pathetic. Who cares about your life when you brought one into the world with your actions? It didn't ask for that, but you did through your mistakes. Even if you don't have any regrets now, when your child goes to find you someday and you finally see their face, I hope then the weight of all the years of regret and self-centredness comes back at you.
Well this is generally the outcome
The USA is a shit country compared to South Korea.
yes but she can keep her dual citizenship until shes 18 so she can choose then
Since when? This is news to me.
Not true of those born with dual citizenship. I have a dual citizen Korean American child too.
This seems to change all the time. Who knows what the policy will be in 18 years. Especially with Korea needing more Koreans
Things will change in the next 18years
You only have to pay taxes as an expat if you earn over a certain amount. Source: I'm an expat and I definitely don't earn enough to have to pay taxes in the US
What benefits? You guys get benefits?
There’s an income tax agreement between the two, so should only need to pay tax to one as long as it’s under a certain amount.
The US passport is actually weaker than South Korea’s, and I’d expect that to get worse.

The perks are quite limited unless ld ends up wanting to work there.
Not necessarily; there are tons if agreements between countries and you typically pay only one or the other
Benefits?!? We pay taxes for military and corporate subsidies. No health insurance no vacation no education. The benefit of being a citizen is the right to work in a country where you can achieve entrepreneurial freedom if you want to put in the time.
Holy shit, that's real? Your right I would totally pay just to have dual citizenship but didn't know you always had the taxes for America.
What benefits? The great health care? The active shooter lessons in primary school? The country run by degenerate old folk? Kids much better off in Korea.
What benefits?
What benefits?
Better learn the Lingo or you will turn single.- Duo Owl
Duolingo is great for some languages but awful for others. Korean is one of the awful ones unfortunately. It is only ok for vocabulary but is useless for grammar which is the really challenging part for native english speakers.
Check out LingoDeer! It's alot better than Duolingo for Asian languages like Korean, Japanese and Chinese.
Not really. It's incredibly unlikely a one night stand is going to be willing to leave their entire support system to move to another country. If you mean just visiting, that's also not happening until the child is much older and I wouldn't call having your kid visit for a couple weeks the "while being a dad thing". Paying child support and virtual visits with his kid is a start though.
Brutal? What would be the right thing to do then?

Brutal is getting a girl pregnant oversees and abandoning them.
[removed]
There's no point in berating him now , whether it was a good idea doesn't matter anymore
If you do it with one there's still a chance it won't work

Just saying, condoms and most BC isn't 100% effective 100% of the time. Best to double up and have multiple methods like condoms plus BC pills, or any other method that doesn't interfere with the condom.
It’s *because* they’re 20.  The prefrontal cortex doesn’t finish developing until age 25.
Yeah we really need to bring back "No Glove No Love" I notice people are being riskier and riskier. The US has really taken a nosedive in sex education. Syphilis and the Clap are literally at record highs in the US.
REALLY? You blame abstinence rhetoric? Abstinence is the safest birth control, ever. Any form of birth control is not 100% safe unless one or both parties had their tubes cut or are infertile. And no, ABORTION IS NOT a form of birth control. Stop blaming the most basic and the cleanest way of living while single. Every time you fucckk, there is a possiblity you get pregnant or get your partner pregnant. ABSTINENCE is still the best advice you can give to your teen or single children. Nothing wrong with remaining a virgin. That’s what hands are for..!
Pretty sure everyone knows that unprotected sex = baby. Especially as an adult. Whether they care or not is a different story.
Sex tourism involves visiting for the purpose of sleeping with people in another country/area, and tends to involve taking advantage of more relaxed laws around prostitution, age of consent, etc. I could see it also applying to taking advantage of poor sex ed.

Idk that that applies to hooking up with someone in another country without protection (if that's the case) because you like them as a person? Is there a different definition that leads you to call what OP did sex tourism, or other context I missed?
How is just paying for child support not enough? No need to get involved in a kids life if you don’t want to. Kids can tell whether you’re be sincere or not.
By the sounds of it, he’d rather have had something else he couldn’t cure 😅
Exactly 💀 men who act like this are so full of it. You mean to tell me you’re shocked by all of this yet didn’t put on ANY sort of protection?!
Why are women fucking men they don’t know without protection?
These are good points
It doesn’t matter what Korean law says on this though. He could pay child support without being mandated to.
I'm not sure what comment you are calling "cringe ass", but OP's legal and other parental responsibilities may not necessarily entail "catching a plane and flying to South Korea to live there". Since the daughter is his, it's certainly not as simple as stating "dude made a mistake" and phrasing it like that is not only inappropriate, but actually does no favors to OP.
Do you need to be in the US? Remote work from Korea for a bit. Also don't forget to pay for child support. You know Korea is a really conservative society. The world is not going to be kind to your daughter and her mother over there. It'd be even worse if you're not around.
Bro whatever you do don’t join the military this person is wild. Wasted 4 years of my life on that and had ask permission to travel anywhere outside my bases state.
Don’t join the military just because you had a baby. That’s fucking crazy.
move to south korea then
Maybe take responsibility for his biological child? He ALSO made the choice to hookup, so why shouldn't he do his duty as a father?
No, he can't fix it. But he needs to understand what impact the choices he makes are going to have on this girl and the child for the rest of their lives. Not to mention he absolutely has to know about what constitutes child support in Korea, especially what the expected amount is. Since they're citizens of different countries I don't believe there's any way to legally force him to pay it, but he certainly should pay some support regardless at the bare minimum, because it's his kid. This is what happens sometimes when you hook up. They chose to do it, they have to live with the consequences. But he needs all of the information he can get in order to understand what exactly those consequences are for both of them before he makes any big decisions.
Do you know how babies are made? They aren't gremlins; it involves ejaculate from a male human. He ejaculated irresponsibly and now has to care for the child he made.
Oh yeah he has a lot of potential in Korea actually
Living in SK was one of my favorite experiences in my life. The fun, the challenges, being in a place that you’re uncomfortable and can grow. 

Accept the consequences of your decision and make it a new adventure. 

Childcare, healthcare, schools that actually care about your child, low cost of living for an insanely advanced society.
Thanks for your response and for clarifying. I wish you all the best moving forward.
somehow tho she came out pregnant
Couldn't you say the same thing about her?
Abortion was fully decriminalised in SK in 2021
Well it's not illegal there
They can get rid of it anytime of there pregnancy 
23 weeks if I'm not wrong
Oh I'm sorry! I did read the post, I just clearly wasn't paying enough attention!

Nevertheless, work out a schedule and just do your best. All any parents do is try their best to do right by their kid. As long as you don't abandon her, and you make an effort to be a part of her life and respect her mother, you will be okay! 

How did your family take the news?
Oh right sorry I didn't realize.
Then you’re a pretty shit christian 😂 I never understood the cherry-picking, if you’re going to have premarital sex, then you either become pro-choice or wear a fking condom 😂

Either way. How old are you? I know everyone is telling you to be a man and pay child support yadda yadda, I guess you can marry her if you like her. I don’t think moving to South Korea is going to be easy or fun when you don’t even speak the language. I guess theres a 0.01% chance that you will marry her and you will have your happily ever after. 

If I were you, and I was like early 20s, I’d offer to start paying child support once I got a stable job. I’m not sure if she can sue you for not paying it since she’s abroad. Unless moving to South Korea was already the plan, I don’t think you should fuck your whole life up because you two were stupid enough to fuck without a condom while being devout christians
You are both incredibly young to have children, even more to have premarital sex without taking care to protect yourselves against an unplanned pregnancy from the sounds of it.
Blah blah blah blame I share whatever blame with their mother. Is what it is.
Yes duh but …. Makes you think next time not to be young and dumb like that.
I don't even like USA but I still find it a heaven compared to SK, at least the kid won't be discriminated all his life and live in a failing country, with the lovest birth rate on Earth...
Seconding this. I went to college with people who decided which citizenship to get rid of at 18.
I don’t know about the case for South Korea, but I am past the age of 20 and still have my dual citizenship with the U.S. and Japan. From what I understand, Japan doesn’t strictly enforce the choosing policy as it cannot revoke a birthright nationality.  It could possibly be the same for SK.
She can decide whether she wants to continue to be a dual citizen before turning 22, not 18.
It was 75,000 several years ago, has possibly been raised since I last knew it. Also it's called the Foreign Earned Income Tax Credit
She'll be able to attend an American univ without being considered an international student, which is HUGE. She won't have to pay the entire tuition upfront, she'll be entitled to apply for some scholarships, and she won't have leave the country after graduation if she can't find a job to sponsor her visa (which she won't need as a citizen). Also, despite the fuckery that goes on here, the American passport still holds a lot of weight when traveling throughout the world. Oh and I forgot, if she finds herself somewhere where shit pops off, she can be evacuated out as an American citizen via the embassy.
Off to Tajikistan with you
With the SK one there's forced military "service"
Iv been seeing alot of the duo owl on tiktok and it's savagery 😭😭
>It's incredibly unlikely a one night stand is going to be willing to leave their entire support system to move to another country.

How is that any different for him? 

He needs to take time and let this all sink in before traveling back to have a serious conversation with the mother. 

Are they going to be in a relationship or are they going to co-parent. What are their careers and where will they be able to provide the best life for the kid. If the answer is Korea then they stay there, if the answer is the US then she needs to move here. 

They both are responsible for making the child now they both need to be responsible for raising it, not doing what is most convenient for one of them.
No I’m saying it as in I like your cold honest truth 😢
As far as Im aware abortions are legal in South Korea. Having your life ruined over a hookup is devastating. One can also wonder if it's fair towards the child to have a father who hates his life, they are smarter and more perceptive than people think.

True but a lot of people actually need to get reminded
Theres always a chance it won't work but my main concern is STDs at the very least a condom should be worn.
This is a myth. The brain doesn’t magically mature at 25. It’s a continued process. Also it depends on people. Some finish developing at 20. Some continue until 30. 25 is an arbitrary cutoff point.
Abortions are not birth control, I agree.

No one in the pro choice camp is using abortion as birth control. You demean yourself to fall into such insane rhetoric.

Apologies as I think I misspoke in my original comment. Abstinence *only* education is the problem. You are correct, abstinence is the only, 100% effective form of birth control and disease prevention. 

We are absolutely in agreement here, so please direct your ire to more worthwhile sources.

I'm just saying, in tandem to that, people are gonna do what they want to do. They should be made aware that condoms and birth control pills exist. 

I had an education in a blue state, where we received both education about abstinence as well as condoms — I still didn't lose my virginity until my twenties. 

Access to education isn't gonna make teenagers out there spread their legs automatically. *But* a certain population will begin experimenting anyway, and *since you and I already agree abortions are not a form of birth control*, the knowledge that a couple bucks on a pack of condoms can save a lot of lives from being ruined is pretty valuable.
I don't know man. Where are they supposed to learn at if they didn't grow up in an environment that fostered it? 

People grow up in weird religious enclaves where they aren't exposed to this knowledge and at a certain point you create a population of young people who don't even know what they should be googling. 

I really think you overestimate what counts as common sense for you and me might differ for somebody with a different life experience. 

An example I'll give you is, when I was growing up you had computer lab in school. And I learned that they eventually eliminated computer lab from schools because, hey every kid knows how to use electronic devices now. Although it turns out now the kids are less prepared for very basic skills like basic HTML because everyone took for granted that computer knowledge is "basic". 

Basic knowledge to us is basic because somebody taught it to us once.

If we stop teaching the generations after us about that basic knowledge it no longer becomes basic. It becomes specialized and you have to have a specialized set of experience to know it.
Pregnancy the incurable STD.
Maybe he did and it failed?
Because both parties involved are young and stupid
Yeah, sadly, SK is still very conservative about the whole single woman with a child thing, so the best OP can do is try to be present in their life or at least his daughter's.
This is important!!
I think you’ve misunderstood my comment.

I’m saying it is very possible that the dates for finding out about the pregnancy are legit.

I know the baby is born and you don’t doubt paternity, I was just explaining to the poster above that you don’t need 4-6 weeks for a pregnancy test (if you know when you ovulated, or just got lucky with guessing the symptoms)

I’m not suggesting the conception was anything other than an accident. But I’m saying the dates don’t suggest anything underhanded.
Just fyi, fuck the people down voting you here.

You have a right to be worried and you're being responsible by asking questions. International situations like this can be very complex and raise a lot of suspicion. They can be rot with alter motives including parental extortion and anchor immigration.

Two days before you left? She's keeping a child with a foreign national? Agreed to DNA testing? Emails/texts (paper trail)?

This happened with an uncle of mine too with a girl from Cuba. He *"maned up"*, but she only let him see his baby once and spent years demanding more and more money. He eventually cut off contact only to find out that she did the same thing with another tourist after him.

Maybe her intentions age good, but if you want to feel better about what's going on, get some control of the situation. This is a very complex LEGAL issue, its not about *"owing up"* Look in to your countries diplomatic stance with parental claims and don't contact her again or send any money until you know exactly what your legal responsibilities are.
“somehow she came out pregnant” man u are so fucking dumb wow
And she made a choice to keep the child. Now that they've both made a decision to have and keep a child, they now have a responsibility to raise her.
im 20 shes 19
Yes. You share the blame so you equally share the consequences. Unfortunate how selfish and disgusting people can be, has your life turned out exactly how you want it regardless? If not, then that's a huge waste of a life isn't it.
I guess the age thing is a Korean thing. I got a dual citizenship past 18 with one being US too
no you can’t have a dual citizenship in SK past the age of 18 because of the war going on between the south and the north
From what i know it's 22 years for US/Japan dual citizenship. I know cause Noami Osaka had to drop her U.S. citizenship at 22 to represent Japan in the Olympics. So you might wanna do some research if you wanna keep your Japanese citizenship instead(:
Bit confusing here. Google says you have to before turning 22 (which is the equivalent of 20) but the embassy told me you have to choose before you turn 18 which is before you turn 20 in korea. However korea recently changed their age system so it’s even more confusing
And, a lot of countries have an agreement with the US that if you’ve already paid an equivalent or higher amount in taxes to country b, you don’t have to pay double taxes to the US. If you paid less in taxes to country B than you would have to the US, you only have to pay the difference to the US. For most in European countries (and others that have national healthcare like Australia) this means you effectively don’t have to pay US taxes as the European rates are typically higher than US rates.
I think you'd have to live in the state for a certain amount of time before a non resident citizen can get benefits,  happened to my cousin, couldnt go to Uni for a whole year due to finances
lol well may be not that far
The woman is the custodial parent. She has been taking responsibility.
She’s the one that has to carry a pregnancy and give birth, and let’s be honest probably do 80-90% of the child care. That’s why she needs support more than he does

Her family will probably help; his family, we don’t know
Massive double standards 💀💀
Legal yes but come with a massive social stigma. They were effectively illegal until 2021 and even now a woman who aborts is a pariah
That’s a cop-out. 

That baby didn’t ask to be born, and this is on both of the parents. Want to help make a better world? Start by giving a shit about the emotional wellbeing of your own kids. 

OP, your life is about to change, but not necessarily for the worst. Man up and father your child ; she needs you.
Pro choice means pro CHOICE. abortion is traumatic and not everyone wants to go through that. This comment is nasty.

This post was already a reminder
honestly like not to defend raw dogging, but if you’re tested regularly and there’s no visible signs of an infection.. you’re probably gonna be good.
I think the people who grow up in weird religious enclaves is a pretty small portion of the population. We are living in the Information Age where knowledge can be accessed at any moment. Not knowing how basic reproduction works (as an adult) is stupidity, not ignorance.

To clarify, I support standardized sex education in schools - I just don’t think the absence of it should be an excuse for these people.
It's curable but some don't want it to be 
[removed]
One party clearly has more choice and agency in this.

She has the final choice, he does not. He has the choice with what he does with himself.
I’m 22, from Asia too. I guess you can also take the advice of older people too. But my advice for you would be, if it hasn’t been 24 weeks yet, urge her to abort the fetus. You two should have done it earlier, personally I feel that the closer the fetus is to the due date, the worse I would feel about aborting it. 

Do you actually know this girl? I genuinely do not think you can have a happy and good future with this girl that you barely know

It will be ruining three lives to have this baby. You think a kid born out of wedlock in a christian asian family will have a good life? That kid will be ostracised and bullied, and looked down on by friends, family, everyone. 

I think most people here think you’re older. You’re 20, you can barely afford to buy Mcdonalds.
I mean, yeah I'm having a way better life than I would otherwise. I'm happier than most. No regrets on my end.
Yes, it's definitely a Korean thing. For some reason I got plenty of tiktoks a while back of people going to settle their chosen citizenship. Makes me feel kinda weird watching them. I have dual (US and Mexico) and it'd feel kinda shitty to have to decide which privileges to give up.
>>no you can’t have a dual citizenship in SK past the age of 18  


This is only correct in some cases. Dual nationality by birth is technically allowed (e.g. one of your parents is South Korean and the other is not, and you were born in a country with birthright citizenship) but dual citizens who would like to retain both nationalities are usually required to, before turning 22, declare their intent to not use their other passport in South Korea. 


What you may be thinking is the regulation for male dual nationals who forfeit their South Korean nationality. They are required to do so by March 31 of the year they turn 18.
> If you paid less in taxes to country B than you would have to the US, you only have to pay the difference to the US. 

Which, as a practical matter, I'm certain never happens unless you're a c-suite world exec with a super complicated compensation
That’s nothing. A lot of us did that to get in-state tuition when we came from out of state. I also think there are states where the kids can get in-state tuition if the parent is paying taxes and child support out of state. Basically it’s acknowledging that the child of parents who live in different states can get in-state benefits in both. May have changed but I think FL was like this.
IDK I hear it's getting nice with all the like minded deportees

They both took the risk of pregnancy, and should both be equally responsible
She doesn't have to do any of that. She gets to choose to do it.

He need to choose to do the right thing for himself in this situation. She is making choices, he needs to make choices that are best for him first.

*(looked up abortion laws in Korea out of curiousity. It is decriminalized now but it's a grey area. Might be difficult to find an abortion there so maybe she does "have" to.)
But he's known her less than a month why would you risk that. Its crazyyy
For sure I don't doubt you support it, too!

I just have a little bit less faith that people are taking efforts to do any research or googling of information that was not provided to them. Even in this information age! 

But I honestly hope that you are correct and that I'm selling folks short!
True. I recently learned you can even cure up to 6 weeks after delivery or something (according to Trump ) but didn’t want to bring that energy.
i’m a girl ur a dumb bitch u both are
Your saying that because she didn't get an abortion she's solely responsible for the child despite him being an adult who had unprotected sex knowing that pregnancy can happen? If you want to have unprotected sex with someone you don't really know, don't be surprised if they decide to keep the baby, all you had to do was wrap up. He has a choice but one choice is being a responsible human being and the other is being an asshole
bro shes born already
I’m with you on this one. I’ve had abortion - zero regrets. It would have ruined my life and his life if I didn’t, and if I had chosen to have the baby, it would have been my responsibility because it was my choice. It’s never made any sense to me that one person in the situation can choose to opt out and the other one can’t. No kid should have to have a parent who didn’t want them, it’s 2024, there are far better options.
Do you not feel any shame or spare any thought for your child? You've given them abandonment issues for life, lack of support from a vital figure in growing up, and the opportunity to have a worse life than they could have.
it’s because of the war sadly
South Koreans who legally had more than one nationality when they were born may be allowed to retain both nationalities in certain cases, depending on their parents' nationalities and their country of birth -- only those who are legally dual nationals by birth are able to retain both, but need to declare their intent not to use their non-Korean passport in South Korea. For men this gets a little more complicated due to military conscription and the resulting difference in the age by which the declaration is required.
what you said makes sense but i’m not sure about this because i am woman with a dual nationality and one with birthright citizenship but the embassy has told me that i have to chose once i turn 18. May i ask where you got this information from so i can look into it?
Pretty much, and at that point it’s all just numbers. If you make so much money abroad that you’re pained to pay taxes to the US you could literally just buy a passport from one of the low tax high visa tax havens and give us the US passport. It’s not a normal people problem.
They live in different countries she's doing 100% of the parental childcare
I hate that talking point.  That's just regular old MURDER LOL and nobody wants that legal.
That’s not a thing. Trump is an idiot.
you probably a ugly bitch then show yourself
bruh………… too late i guess! Does the girl want to move to states or she wants you to move to SK.
If it were up to me, i would have the child put up for adoption.  Abortion, if i was the women and didnt want to experience the full pregnancy.

But it wasn't up to me. I didn't have any final say in the matter. I was put in a position where she said I'm having this baby, you have to bring to the USA or take care of us here. So I just took the taboo 3rd option and caught my flight. Do I feel any shame? A bit. I obviously don't casually bring it up. But I've told friends the truth. So I guess the answer is slightly? At the end of the day, "it is what it is."
Would never be legal, it is absolute BS
My bf asked for a large sum of money 
I inherited about 50K $ from my father. My boyfriend knew. About a Year later he asked me for 9,700$ to buy a new car. He said he will return the money within a year. What should I do? I really don’t feel comfortable giving him the money. He’s not my husband. We’ve been going out for 7 years and has no intention of marrying me. But he treats me nicely and always supports me. My inheritance is the only back up I have in life. I have no family left. Anything goes wrong I’ll feel devastated. Please tell me, am I being cheap? Also I’m currently unemployed but received a job offer of 2000$ monthly. Which is not enough but it will help me until I look for something better. Appreciate any advice . Thanks .

Banks are for loaning that kind of amounts. Please do not lend him your money or you will regret it
Tell him no, no!
He can get a bank loan.
Don't do it!
Don’t give him 9700 OR 1700. He will try to “settle” for “borrowing” less from you. Don’t fall for it. Not a single cent. 

Also very important: do NOT explain yourself to him or make excuses or be apologetic. Just “no, I am not giving you the money”. I repeat, do not be apologetic. If you have to be anything, be outraged. 
If he can’t get a loan from the bank don’t do it. 
7 years no ring? And he’s asking for 9k absolutely not
That money is all there is between this moment and your living on the street? And your BF wants nearly 10K? Just, no. And $2k per month is better than nothing. Aren't you just going insane not being employed anyway?

If BF pushes you on the loan, I suggest you ask your lawyer to do the paperwork for a loan so that BF must produce some sort of security for the loan and is charged interest.
No. All about the 7 years aside, this initiates an unhealthy dynamic in which he relies on your money. Keep the money as a means of improving yourself or an escape plan if you want to look for a lifelong partner.
Do not give hime one penny of your inheritance! That is all you have left of your parents. Put it in a high yield savings account, Google “her first 100K” and learn how to protect your financial future. It’s a huge red flag that he would even ask you to buy him a car! Would you ask him to buy you a car?
In the words of Judge Judy, "Don't lend money to family or friends that you can't afford to lose." So basically, if you do this, don't count on ever seeing that money again.
Don't lend him one cent. This is not an actual crisis. He somehow feels that he is entitled to some of your money, and you'll never see another penny of it. It's money for your security in life.
Definitely NO.    That is your nest egg for your future.     If you loan it to him, he may not repay it, despite his promises 
That's a no. You have a job offer, so I assume currently unemployed? Tell him you are unemployed and you can't afford it.  Just no.
If he has no intention of marrying you after 7 years together, he doesn't deserve a dime and your time.
N.O. = NO.
Absolutely do not give him any money.
Dont give him that kind of money if you are not married. Even if you are married dont give him that money without any documents that would identify those $9700 as a loan with the intention of paying back within a year. 

But its all up to you whether you are comfortable of loaning that kind of money. Its better to be alone than getting stabbed day by day by your boyfriend. 

But all that I am sorry for your loss, I cannot imagine having no family left.
You have been dating for 7 years and he has no intention of marrying you and now he wants to *borrow* (take) almost $10,000 from you for a NEW car?? Since I’m over seven decades old I’m going to be blunt with you… WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS LEECH! He is not going to pay it $$ back within a year because apparently he thinks you’re an easy mark! How about you dump this moron and find someone who will treat you with respect and not as a cash machine.
Nope. It’s your money. You don’t owe him anything.
Tell him to go to the bank cause you're not one
In respect of your father, no. 
Tell him, your father wouldn’t like that.
$50k will bleed so quickly through your fingers and your bf is asking you to burn 1/5 of that. Your inheritance...  gone in a blink.

Don't lend ANYONE money from this.

He shouldn't have ever asked you to begin with so he immediately put you in an awkward position but if you give him basically $10k you may as well pour lighter fluid on it and ignite it because you're never seeing that money again. If he can't afford to finance it or buy it now he's not going to be able to pay that back anytime in the foreseeable future.

It'll be the seed that destroys your relationship.

Tell him something akin to "I gave it some thought and I believe lending/borrowing money in relationships that are at the stage ours is can create tensions and complications I want to avoid. I'm certain you're going to figure out the car situation, it just cannot be with that money"

If he pushes you on this let him know even asking you put you into an awkward position but that him pushing you is making you really uncomfortable...
> I really don’t feel comfortable giving him the money

You say no. Also, get yourself into therapy. You need to learn to say no when you aren't comfortable. Especially when someone is using you. You should get out of this and find better. Learn you deserve better. You've wasted enough time on this. 


He's nice but has no intention of marrying you, why are you with him? Is a guy who's "nice" to you, but trying to rip you off for nearly 10k really all you think you deserve? He won't marry you, but thinks you should hand him 20% of your inheritance.
NO, don't do it. Tell him the money is invested in stock or something - you don't have access to it, it's in a high interest account and you have to give 6 month's notice to get any of them out. 

DO NOT give him your money!
Never l9an money to anyone esp a significant other.
If u want to.loan him.9700 then give it as a gift cos he won't be paying u back..never lian money to anyone as it will get complicated n can hurt relationships..I been thete dine that and never again and that was only 2k!!!
Don't do it OP.
Regardless of the situation, never lend money and expect it back. This is general rule of life. For the most part, if these people had the means to pay you back, they wouldn’t be asking for money in the first place.
Sis please don’t give him a dime, 7 years and you said he has no intention in marrying you? Why are you even with him? 

Put your money aside for you and you only and end the relationship, because I’m sure if you tell him no then he’ll do that.
If he can’t get a loan from the bank don’t do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Put your money in cd accounts if you're afraid of it being taken out and want to save.
That's a no. You have a job offer, so I assume currently unemployed? Tell him you are unemployed and you can't afford it.  Just no.
Do not give him a dime. Often when people end up lending someone money, especially a large some of money, they often don’t get their money back. Save your money and keep it in your savings, as you never know when you are going to need it. If he wants a new car, then he needs to get a job or a second job and save and earn it on his own, or he can get a loan and pay for it in monthly installments but do not lend him a cent of it because you will not be getting this money back, I assure you. Tell him that you decided to put your money in a cd account at the bank so you can earn some interest and are simply not in the position to be able to lend him the money since there will be penalties for early withdrawal from the savings account. You aren’t his bank and that is a lot of money to ask to borrow. Listen to what everyone is saying here, do not do it. You are not being cheap, you are being smart.
Absolutely don't do it OP
NOPE.
Absolutely not.
Invest the cash for your future 
Make it work for you 
Don’t give in to boyfriend
If he's able to pay you back in a year, he's able to save up the money himself and buy the car in a year. 


No. Don't do it. 
NO, NO, NO. Keep your money safe. Maybe he will break up with you. The sooner, the better.
No. Absolutely not.

Let somebody that see his credit score and real work history take that risk.

Who borrows 10k from their friend or significant other? Especially if there are no plans to get married, definitely don't let him borrow the money. Do you want to marry him? That would be my next question.
I got a small inheritance when my grandna died, and not once has my SO of 14 yrs asked for a dime or told me to get money from it to pay a bill no matter what. It's my money, and he pretends it doesn't exist.
Loans from family and friends are for emergency situations only, not for wants, not for holidays, not for things he can do without. Even if he pays you back it will change your entire relationship. Just him asking has done that. Don't tell people how much you have, just tell him that your money is tied up and you can't help.
Tell him it's a no and be prepared to lose a boyfriend.
You’re unemployed and he’s asking for a loan?! This is all the  money you have in the world until you find more income. Hell no!
I hope this is not real. He has no intention of marrying you but wants you to give him a significant sum for him to buy a car. If he can return the money, he can do so by taking out a loan. You have no job currently, the amount of money isn’t loads so that you can afford to write it off if he pisses off.
Let's be honest. He will not return the money in a year.  OP knows that. Bf knows that. If OP wants to give bf the money, at least do so with your eyes wide open.
Nope. He can get a loan from a bank. You have to ask yourself what sort of person would ask such a thing. Do. Not. Give. Him. That. Money.
Tell him to sling his hook
Go to a bank, get a loan 
Point out your not an atm
You’ll never get that back. Don’t do it!
I'd be saying no.

But if you do lend him the money:

Get a contract drawn up with a repayment plan that he needs to sign. I'm sure he will horrified as he has no intention of paying you back. 
Has he a plan to repay 9700k in a year?
Anything over an amount you are prepared to lose, do it thru a lawyer with a contract.
Anyone who gets mad at this, you know they aren't paying you back. It's that simple.

Remember, it's YOUR money not theirs
Don't you dare stranger!

Also free advice? Take the job offer, focus on that not 7yeardisappointment and put the money in a high yield CD where you don't heccing touch the principle. Then use the job to build a normal savings account as much as possible. 

7yeardisappointment is showing more red flags than a bullfight c. 1850. And he's eying the entirety of that money.
DO NOT GIVE HIM money under ANY circumstances.  Tell him to take loan. If he is going to return it anyway why not bank. IF he is angry or calls u selfish remember he is the one who is being greedy. he will show u his true colors once u say no. no matter what that is accept it. This kind of situations are the ones where u can see persons true character.
Nope! That’s not his money, and you aren’t his banker. Cut him loose now! I have a Roth IRA, and that is what you need to spend $10,000 into. INVEST IN YOURSELF, and not your broke boyfriend of 7 years with no promise of him bettering your life??!!! NEXT!!!!! DUMP HIM!!!!
Say no to giving him the money and break up with him if marriage and kids are something you want in life. He hasn’t committed to you and he will never do it. Plus who wants a man who asks for money from their girl?
No, please don’t do it. Don’t feel obligated just because you may have it to give. It’s yours. You don’t have to give him anything. Explain it’s your cushion for the future.
Absolutely not. That’s YOUR money. Your bf can work, get a loan, and pay it off. I sense that he has no plans to pay you back. Do not give it to him. Keep your money. Honestly, I wouldn’t have told him about my inheritance.
You've been together for 7 years and no proposal. You deserve someone who treats you with respect and loves you for who you are. 

It sounds like the boyfriend is in this relationship for two things only: sex and money. Sorry to be so blunt. This relationship is transactional only and you deserve so much better.
I have many friendships, and a relationship that got ruined when money got involved.
He’s not committing to you so why would you commit a red cent to this guy? I would never dream of asking any woman for money, but I’m a real man.
Tell him you put the money in a CD and cant take it out prematurely without getting penalized.
Unless you are willing to spend $10,000  and 20% of your inheritance to find out he's not going to become the person you want him to be, do NOT do this.


I'd like to add that for me this is enough to break up IMO. If he was taking your situation seriously he would even ask.
#Do not give him this money. 

You’ll never be repaid. He has no intention of marrying you. If you want marriage then this isn’t the relationship for you. 

Keep your finances separate.
If he can afford to "pay it back within a year", why can't he just save his own money?  I promise you that in his mind,  if you loan him that money, he doesn't think he will have to repay it. He will either sweet-talk you onto forgiving the loan ("Come on baby, you know things are tight right now, and besides, the car is for both of us! I thought you loved me?") or else he will guilt you into it it ("It's not like that was your money anyway, so why does it matter? You shouldn't even really have it! I can't believe you're making such a big deal out of this, just forget about it and let's move on!"), or else he will just disappear.
Nope. And he shouldn't have asked you honestly. He doesn't even take you seriously as a life partner. 7 years no proposal......
Nope nope nope. I would never ask my fiance to borrow money. She probably has more than I do, but I’m an adult and I can go to the bank if I need a loan. Doesn’t have credit to get the loan? Prob won’t pay you back.
it's your money, you're not married, he can get a loan
dont.

  
simply, Dont lend him the money.

  
you will never see the money again, and the asshole will blame you when you ask for the money back.
no no no no no no 

(unless you’re happy never seeing it again)
Don't do it, it just never works out.  Tell him you put the money in a CD and won't have access to it for a long time.  Things like that just go south.  He needs to save up his own money.  You're not married and even if you were a true man wouldn't be looking to get your money.  Stop talking about the money with him it's private keep private things to yourself!  My best advice.  I'm old and have been through all of this and never got paid back.  So unless you want to give it as a gift to him!
No is a complete sentence
Bad idea to loan someone money. Even a best friend or a lover. You never know what's going to happen tomorrow and you're the only one who can get totally screwed in that situation.
He can leave you after he gets the money from you. Period. I don't care how long was the relationship but people are not obligated to stay with anyone. So think about it m
Your gut is correct. He’s not your husband and until he is you have no responsibility for his financial situation.
If he cares about you, you should be able to discuss this openly with him, and ‘bf’ should understand. It’s not an emergency and it’s unfair to ask tbh. You’re unemployed and maybe making 2k a month.
DONT DO IT! HAD TO GO THRU 18 MONTHS OF COURT TO GET MY LOAN BACK FROM A POS exBF! DONT DO IT! GIRRRLLL NNOOOOOO!!!!!
You see all that you typed there, OP? That's called maturity, wisdom, and gut instinct, which is *very* rarely wrong. Do not do huge things like this with someone you're not in a life commitment with. Someone who loves and respects you wouldn't put you in this uncomfortable position. No intention of marrying you? Girl, get real. Keep your money. He's a big boy. He can do a big boy thing, and hit the bank for a loan, instead of using his gf to take the easy way out.
DONT DO IT I've been married for 13 years & I would never do that to my wife. It doesn't matter if we share everything, it doesn't take away the fact that it is her money. Also 9000 is too much for a used car. He can get a good car for 4-6k so that makes me think he wants a little side money too.
Hi, please do not give him money, 7seven year and no ring its kind of weird.... and hes asking because he know about your 50k, maybe you can say that you had to pay something urgent and do not have enough to borrow
No do not give him the money. 

And the dollar sign comes before the number.
Lock all but a small amount 2 or 3k in CDs . That way you can say you have the $ in accounts that can't be moved for the term or whatever. If you aren't getting married, 10k is an investment you make in real property, not an auto you won't even own.
He'll never pay you back don't do it
I wouldn't let a single person $9000
Nope
Tell him you invested it in fixed term bonds and cannot access the money.
Your inheritance is not something you let other people bully you into giving up. If the bank won’t even give him a loan, what makes you think it is safe to give him anything?
Who is currently paying your bills?
Don’t lend him anything.
an ABSOLUTE NO! please, he won't stop there, he'll drain your entire inheritance. 🏃🏽‍♀️ away from him as fast as you can.
Do not lend him money. If it's a gift, do not expect it back. I won't tell you what to do, but I would not "lend" it to him or anyone.
If he has no interest in marrying you, maybe tell him that you want marriage and kids, and if he can't provide that for you, it's time to move on. 7 years is a long time unless you were like 15 years old when you started dating.
DON'T. I repeat DON'T GIVE HIM THE MONEY. That's a fairly large amount of money to give to your boyfriend who hasn't any intention of marrying you.
Heck no! Never lend money to a friend or family member. You’re not married and owe him nothing. That’s a good way to damage a relationship.
Follow your gut.  


Never personally lend any money to anyone without being willing, if needed, to consider it a gift that you will never get back .


And you didn't say anything about this, but please do yourself a favor and don't marry someone who tries to take advantage of you like that
Invest the moneyfor you and think about what your boyfriend’s request says about him.
don't give him even 1$; you will regret it. Also don't get marry to him.. 7 years is not a joke..
My friend has lent 50k (over Covid) to her partner of 10 years he just inherited 250k and she’s nervous of asking for it back! I don’t get these entitled assholes? He should have paid her back in instalments to show willing! They are intelligent working people with great jobs and property and money is still a ‘difficult’ topic. Don’t lend anyone money. You can’t guarantee that you’ll get it back and 50k is a nice savings pot. It’s not for him.
First dont loan him any money.  Think of this,  If he says can pay back nearly $10,000 not including interest in a year that’s $200 per week ,every week. Has he saved $800 in the last month? $2500 in the last 3 months? I doubt it. He won’t be able to do it in the future either. A big NO.
One of life's hardest lesson is learning how to say no.
A weird amount of money to request for a car. This probably means he doesn't need it, but wants it.

It would be okay to help him out with a bit of money if he really needed a car, or car repairs to get to work. If he can save up 10k in the next year, he xan save up 2k in the next couple of months and get himself an ok car until he has saved up enough for a better car. He is just seeing your inheritance as an easy way to get what he wants. No.
Your inheritance, your money. Put it away somewhere as a rainy day fund for when you need it.
What would your father want you to do with it? I assume he wanted it used for and by you. 50k is a nice nest egg but it’s not going to last forever if you’re already living on some of it. Don’t lend it to him. He wants it for something extra and non essential.  The way you say he has “no intention of marrying” sounds like you either would like to at some point or don’t think this is forever. Don’t give him your money.
Don't do it. I wish you didn't disclose to him your inheritance, you two are not married. This may also cause issues in your relationship so just don't go there.
Your Father did not give you this money to give it away.

You have stated it is your only back up, lending money is the ruination of all relationships, you spend your time chasing it, listening to excuses, and feeling awkward asking for your own money back.

Your partner shouldn’t even be putting this kind of pressure on you, explain you simply can’t and won’t, and if he walks away; well then that is further confirmation that you have done the right thing.
Me and my fiancé own a house together and we wouldn’t even to this to each other
Need more context. After 7 years yous should be working together to build your wealth. Do you live together?. Could the car help him get a better job?. How do you know he doesn't want to marry. Have you talked about it or is he maybe waiting to have more money for a marriage. How old are yous
If he can pay it back within a year, he can simply just save for a year instead?

Yeah, that’s never happening, you’ll probably get a token 250 back before the excuses roll in.
You haven’t provided any information about what your partner is like or relationship is actually like other than he doesn’t have plans to marry you. 

* Is he a dependable, trustworthy person with solid integrity and work ethic? Is there a reason you don’t think he’ll pay you back? If there is, why are you with him?

* Do you currently live together? Do you both imagine your future is going to be together? If so, him taking out a loan will impact you both. He will have to pay interest on the loan which is money that could otherwise go towards your shared goals. 

If you don’t have a shared future in mind and just plan on dating forever, that’s absolutely fine. Just tell him the truth: you don’t feel comfortable loaning anyone that amount of money because you are worried it won’t come back. If he is upset about it, it might be a sign of entitlement. Or it might be a sign he had a different view of your relationship.

Reddit advice on matters of money and family trend towards alarmism. The advice is usually along the lines of ‘keep everything you own, never share, everyone is trying to scam you.’ A lot of people talk about never combining their finances with their partners, which is their choice, but they usually fail to mention if, or how, they deal with these situations when they come up. Telling your partner you love them and want to be with them but don’t want to help them because you don’t trust them to not to scam you is a hard thing for a relationship to come back from.
No is a whole sentence. Plus learn to love and respect yourself and find someone who loves and values you more than your current partner does. 

Your dad would probably not be pleased if you lent the money. If you do decide to be bullied into it. Get the loan and payment timeframe, plan, all into writing in a legal agreement so he can't fuck you over. 

50,000 seems like a lot but it will go quickly if you're not careful. 

Good luck op
I couldn't even finish reading your post!! Do not lend him money! Especially for a car wtf.
If he can save up $9700 within a year to pay you back then he can easily save up $9700 within a year to buy a car. He doesn’t need your money, he needs to wait on buying a car until he can afford it. 

My rule of thumb is that I never loan any money I would be uncomfortable with not getting back. $50? That sucks but whatever. I will move on with my life. $9700? No. I would not be comfortable not getting that back. It would cause major problems for the relationship.
No. 

Also, why waste your time with this guy?
Don't be your boyfriends ATM, purse, or wallet. Tell him no.  Let him be mad.
I would wonder why he would put you in that position?  He needs to go through the normal process.  If he doesn’t have money that should say something.  If his credit is shot that tells you something too.  Don’t do it.
Don't do it. You'll never see that money again, plus he might start resenting you because he's indebted to you, and you might start resenting him for not paying it back/feeling anxious when you start seeing signs that you aren't gonna get it back.
Don’t give it to him. He’s never going to pay you back. You’ve been dating for 7 years and he has no intention of marrying you leave him. You deserve someone way better than a time waster who wants your money. Plus you’re unemployed, how can he borrow money from someone who’s unemployed. I’m sure he knows that the inheritance is your backup. He sounds like an AH. He should go and borrow money from the bank not you.
Do you want to get married? If not, then why are y9u still with him? You don't seem to trust him... are you living together? Have you built a life together? This story is so odd.
Your bf should not put u in this situation.
Tell him you want to invest it in a high savings account.  Cars lose their value really quick.  He sounds like he's really bad with money.  Stand your ground or he'll spend it all.
Not worth the risk for now
You are being smart. Do not give him anything. If he can save $9700 in a year then he will have to wait the year to buy a car
Never loan money. 💴
No is a complete sentence
ABSOLUTELY NOT! He has not committed to you. Why is he entitled to anything?
Tell him you don't have access to it at the moment it's invested in a term deposit.
$50k is really not a lot of money. You should use that money on something that will provide a tangible long term benefit to YOU, not your non-committal boyfriend.

Put a down payment on a house. Pay for tuition and get a degree. Buy a reliable but affordable vehicle. Use it to put yourself in a position to have a more secure future. 

DO NOT give that money to anyone else. And do not sit on unemployment and live off that money either. It will disappear faster than you think and the shame you’ll feel will be crippling. 

You have an opportunity to honor your father by using this money responsibly to improve your life long-term. Please don’t squander it.
Don’t do it.  He has no intentions of paying you back
Tell him that you are not willing to loan him the money. Period.  I just can't. 

If he gets mad and starts to 'punish' you for not giving him the money, he has shown you who he really is. 

OR

Develop a formal promissory note, with details of repayment. If he refuses to sign it, you know that he NEVER intended to repay you.
Don't do it, don't make your relationship a transactional experience. The same awkward struggle you're having now to know what to say and navigate will be worse when you want or need the money back.
No

You will never see that money. Somewhere between the loan and the "year" your relationship will go south and he will leave.

That would at least be my concern. A loan like this could kill your relationship all in itself.

Ya boy needs to establish a regular income and repair his credit. Then get a loan like everyone else has to do.
“I would never even consider loaning money to a man who wasn’t only not married to me, but has made it clear he never intends to marry me. That would be utterly foolish.”
Do NOT give him money.  Run.  Do not be with this man.
Pull out your inner Meghan Trainor and just say NO.
OP, PLEASE don't let him make you feel guilty or pressured into making a very poor decision

I find it very inconsiderate of him that he'd even ask in the first place - regarding your financial situation. 

Just because you have money now doesn't mean that your financial responsibilities have evaporated, and you can just spoil him whenever he feels like it.

Especially 7 years with no intention to marry - you don't owe him that. And despite having $50k, you are not in a position to AFFORD doing that.
Do NOT loan him money. He’s not asking to borrow $ for a ring. Please don’t get duped. If he can’t get a loan from a bank, there’s a reason!!! Life has MANY twists and turns and you will encounter tough times, that money was from your father, respect his wishes. Most parents want their children with an adult who makes your life better and easier, someone who lifts you up not one who makes it harder.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;  
Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.  
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy;  
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,  
And they in France of the best rank and station  
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.  
**Neither a borrower nor a lender be;**  
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,  
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.  
This above all: to thine ownself be true,  
And it must follow, as the night the day,  
Thou canst not then be false to any man.  
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

From Hamlet, William Shakspeare
Don't do it, my mom passed when I was in college and my GF at the time was a few months back on rent, and me being stupid gave her about 4k so she wouldn't get evicted. She never paid me back and she eventually ended the relationship. We were in love or at least I thought we were. I know I was and it just bit me in the ass
ABSOLUTELY NOT!!

And don't you dare let him manipulate or guilt you into doing it by throwing your lack of family in your face. 

ABSOLUTELY NOT!!
Please don't do this. I was with a guy for a few years and lost 25,000 this way like an absolute dummy. Don't take the risk. Learn from my only regret in life!
Tell him to borrow money from a bank. Never ever ever loan money to someone you care about - it's the quickest way to fuck up a relationship. 

Now,. If you were inclined to give money to someone you care about, that is different. You don't wanna do that here and you don't have to. But chasing him down for payments will ruin what you have.
Don't lend him this kinda money. Talk with him and maybe if you're comfortable with it, you buy the car keep it solely in your name and let him pay you for it and carry insurance until it's paid off. You have to protect yourself. This is the only way if you want to help him.
IF you decide to, make a written agreement that you can get signed by both that will stand up in court. amount loaned and expected payback date and how much they are expected to pay back monthly so that it is paid back within a year. I’ve watched enough judge Judy to know that you need in writing.
If you are not comfortable with it, do not let him guilt you into lending him that much money.  Plus if you aren't currently employed and the job offer you have currently isn't going to be enough money to pay your bills, I would not borrow anyone any money- you may need to rely on that savings to get by until you can find a better paying job.

Also, as a general rule of thumb, I never lend more money than I can afford to lose forever.  That way I'm not hurt financially if I don't get paid back because sadly, even people who you think you can trust will sometimes leave you hanging.
Please do not fall for this 
He has no plans to return it to you 
Let him get from the bank
Tell him you’ve invested the money and can’t take it out 
I repeat, please do not lend him
I wouldn’t do it, it’s like lending a friend 9K. You’ll never get it back and it will ruin the relationship
This is a hard no

Do not lend him any money. This will end in disaster. 

If he wants to buy a car, then he can get balance like everyone else.
Don't give him money and also don't contribute more than 50% to any joint account you share with this man
He's been counting down the last 12 months to ask you.  Even a bigger prick knowing it's from your father's passing.  Recommend Upstart. Ha. Don't give him a cent.
You have to learn to follow your first mind as it is your best defense. Your mind will protect you from danger. Your heart will lead you to destruction. Your mind said to not "give" (because he will NOT pay this back) this guy any money, that this guy won't be marrying you, and that you need to take a low paying job and supplement it with your inheritance until you find a better job. Sounds like you think very reasonably and responsibly. If this guy doesn't have the money himself already, he won't have it to pay you back either. Please don't let him tempt or trick you into giving him money. Also, don't let the fear of losing him force you into giving him the money either. You sound like you already have a good, solid plan, but you are questioning yourself as to allow this guy to help ruin your plans. Don't do it and it's perfectly ok to say no. Say no OP. Good luck OP!
Don’t not give him the money and if anything this guy seems like a low life no ring and asking to borrow your parents inheritance you should break up with him you deserve so much better than that a man that can pay for his own things and is an actual provider you deserve someone that knows he wants to marry you and has intentions of marrying you
My two sisters borrowed almost that amount when my mom got her inheritance, years later and many false promises, they haven't paid a dime. DO NOT lend that money to anyone.
Don’t do it! Let me say it again “ DON’T DO IT!” Money is a tricky thing. You can’t let people know what you have!!!!!
If you got it to him it’s a gift, not a loan.

What I would do is put it in a high yield savings account while you figure out what you’re going to do with it and either talk to a financial planner or put it in time to learn solid investment tips. The fact that you’re currently underemployed means it will be very easy to spend it all over the next year on small purchases.

Also, if marriage is a goal of yours, I’d leave him. You will not find someone to marry and build a life with while in a (dead end) relationship.
No
Take it from an older lady. 
No
No
No
Very sorry you lost your father.

I would highly recommend not loaning him the money.  I would instead encourage you to invest the money wisely and forget about it for the next 20-30 years. 

This could end up being a turning point in your relationship but stay strong, stand your ground, and tell him to go to a bank.

You can tell him the reasons are exactly what you told us here on reddit.  That's all you have left from your father, your employment situation is not where you want it to be, and the money is being set aside for a safety net.  He should be 100% ok with that and he should be happy with that decision cause it is a smart decision.  If he is not happy, that could be a red flag and I would question his motive about the money.  Hope this helps.
NO, never! It’s your money. If he gets mad you need a better boyfriend. No no no no!!  Never ever give away or “loan” money to a potential partner.
Do not loan him the money. No is a completed sentence. If he presses for a reason, tell him you believe a bank is better suited to his needs.

Think of it in these terms, $50k now invested carefully can be worth more than twice that in 30 years. That money is your nest egg, safety net, or retirement. Put the funds in a diversified fund for investing. Like a Roth IRA. Savings accounts aren’t going to outpace inflation. With the funds in investments, they aren’t liquid and accessible in the same way. This means if he sees your bank statement, it can say you have $3k and is not a temptation to him in the same way.

If you choose to ‘loan’ the money to him, you’d basically just be buying him a car and he will see you as an ATM. You won’t see that money again.
Absolutely not!  You’re unemployed. That man should be buying you things and taking care of you right now, not scheming to mooch. Tell him to go get a loan at a bank line everyone else. Trust me, you’ll never see it again and it’s the door opener to the rest. He’ll just step up his urgency next time.  He’ll bleed you dry and you’ve wasted 7 years on someone when you could’ve found someone who can afford to finance himself. Also $50k can be gone in the blink of an eye. Put that away and try not to spend much. Replenish it as soon as you can. Be thankful you have that gift.
No you are unemployed and need to catch up! That money needs to be invested not given away
No you're not married. Do not give him almost 10k when you don't have a job
Ladies please learn that whatever you earn is yours and yours to keep! Even when married, I’m not sure if it works everywhere but try to make a secret account and save your money there and help your partner when it’s really needed, otherwise lie that you are broke or you need the money.
Do not lend money to family or friends. You will damage the relationship. 

He can save up for a car. You aren’t married, nothing that is yours is his. 
Girl…. No ring = no bling

Take the money and finance your new single life you absolute goofball.
Don’t lend. Only married couples share finances and assets. Neither of you qualify at the moment.
A bf? That's not a money exchange type level of relationship yet
So your boyfriend has asked you for a 5th of your inheritance? That’s a big chunk, that’s greedy. In the grand scheme of things 50k can go pretty quickly.  He shouldn’t be putting this kind of pressure on you.  You ain’t a stepping stone, no.  The answer is NO
No, I was in your position twice 

The first time it sucked and destroyed the relationship 

The 2nd time, I assumed I wouldn't get anything (proven correct), which was ok but only because I knew beforehand
Tell him, the same way he feels about marriage, is the exact same way you feel about the loan. Absolutely not.
If you give him this $, you will never see it again. Do NOT, I repeat, do not give him any of your $. If he needs a loan, he can go to a bank. Just because you inherited $, it doesn’t mean you owe him a dime of it. Save that $ for yourself. That’s who your father wanted it to go to. I think it would be disrespectful to give any of it to your bf. So, if it makes it easier for you, think of it that way. That is absolutely not what your father would want.
Nope. Do not give away your inheritance. INVEST IN YOUR future.
It's never a loan to a loved one. You're giving a gift and maybe they'll give it back someday. This is the way to preserve loving relationships and not let money get in the way — you never "loan" an amount that doesn't feel easy to say goodbye to as a gift, on the spot. That way it never has enough power over that relationship to topple its course if it isn't returned. 

Hard and fast rule for me. I consider the money basically gone. Then when someone pays me back, it's like a wonderful surprise and my heart experiences it as generosity twice. 

The exception would be a spouse when your finances are blended; they're not, so I wouldn't. If it makes you at all uncomfortable, it's a no. Especially for a non emergency.
Your absolutely correct, direct your BF to a local lending institution, he's trying to take advantage of you and it's not fair.
Why are you with him? That’s awful. 

Help him or break it off. You just said he treats you well after SEVEN years.
Just give him what you feel comfortable with knowing (1)you need to think of it as a gift, not a loan, and (2)you should expect to never see it again.
If someone asks me for money, I just give it to them and I don’t think of it as something I’ll ever see again and I’m comfortable with that. Its simplifies matters a lot.
No, don’t loan him the money. If you give it don’t expect to get it back. He shouldn’t have even asked you. I would dump this guy, who does that?
NTA - Someone who really cares about YOU would NEVER ask you to give them almost 10K for a car!!! 💜💜💜



💜Tell him the inheritance is a lot LESS than what you thought it was for because your father gave most of it to charities. And it’s only $3,000.00 that you are getting.


Do not have him go with you when you meet with the Lawyer. Do not leave ANY papers around where he can snoop and see what your inheritance is.

If you live with your boyfriend or he has access to your mail, get a PO Box and a separate bank account for the money. 

DO NOT CO-SIGN A LIAN FOR HIM TO GET A CAR!!! 💜 NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE PRESSURES YOU TO DO IT!!!!!!!! 💜

If you co-sign the loan he will stop paying on it at some point, which is WHY he las low credit!!!

Which means you will be responsible for paying off the entire loan AND HE KNOWS THIS! 

He will use that co-signed loan to make you do WHATEVER he wants to do, because if he defaults on the loan then YOUR CREDIT WILL BE RUINED & LOW TOO!!! 

As much as you want to Trust him, your brain & your heart is RIGHTFULLY hesitating which is why you came here 💜
Please don't do it. Your boyfriend should get whatever car he can afford on his own. You have no family, you're unemployed and you're not married to him. Its horrible that he would even ask. 

Idk if your boyfriend would try anything sneaky but please be sure that he can't access your financial accounts. If you have doubts consider switching banks.
Don't do it. Please. A committed relationship with open finances is one thing, but this sounds like trouble. 😬
No
Never ever give anyone that large sum of money to ANYBODY. Specially when there’s no future with him. Keep it and work on yourself.
If you can't afford to lose it, do not loan it out. If he could pay it back that quickly why doesn't he have any savings? Where is the "car payment" money coming from? If he ends up leaving bc you won't loan him money then consider it a bullet dodged, bc if he'd leave over that, he'll probably leave when you ask him to pay you back
Tell him it's been put in a retirement fund and is untouchable.
So he’s going to pay you $808.83 a month for 12 months? I doubt that would actually go well.
He's not marrying you at this point. Don't loan it. If he leaves because of that, sayounara
No.
Please don’t do it - you won’t get it back. It’s a size able amount but once you start taking nearly $10K out, it’ll be gone in no time. Bank it, put a chunk in a CD, make sure it’s all there, hopefully collecting interest, and ready when YOU need it. Be wise.
Please don't lend him any money. That money is for your future. Search for bank accounts with the best interest rates so you can get a good return.

Please be careful.
I would take the job offer, as for loaning out that money I wouldn't let him borrow it unless I fully trusted him and knew for a fact he was going to pay it back, if you know he keeps his word then I would loan it to him.
he can get a loan through the bank
Yah, no. He has no business asking you for money.
If he can raise $9,700 in a year, tell him to do that, and buy the car next year.
I don't borrow money to friends, family, anyone I have a close bond with. That's my rule. By sticking to this I show I'm reliable. I'd never break this rule. You could borrow my rule if you'd like :)
Please don’t make that mistake. if he wants a car, he can save for it. The 10K he would be paying you back next year, he can save now and buy the car next year. Please don’t give him the money, you will never ever see a dime of it back. Been there done that! 
Loaning money is a terrible practice, it ruins relationships. Odds are that you would never see the money again. If you want to help him just buy him the car, without expectation of getting the money back, but I'm not suggesting you put yourself in financial distress for him. It's really kind of a big ask and he's kind of an ass for even asking.
Never loan money to anyone. Doesn’t matter who it is. There’s a high chance you’ll never see it again.
Never loan money to friends or relatives, including partners.  It never ends well.
You lend him that money  and you will never see a penny of it back. 7 years and no marriage? He is not serious about you and chances are he would be willing to dump you if you start hounding him for your money back.
>We’ve been going out for 7 years and has no intention of marrying me.

Op, this makes me worry for you. Noncommitment is not a kind thing to do to someone, you deserve a happy secure future.

Do not lend the money to anyone. You need it for your own hopes, dreams, and security.
Tell him it’s currently tied up in an investment account, a CD , something. (This actually isn’t a bad idea) so that you can’t loan it out. Like others said, he can secure a loan from other places.
You are not being cheap. His request is selfish. I hope you are reevaluating your relationship.

 Lending money is almost always giving money away. Please don't give him any money.
Is he financially supporting you now, while you're unemployed? If you keep your money separate than zero question, you don't give or loan that kind of money. That's your emergency fund and his new car isn't your emergency. If he's been supporting you while you're unemployed this gets murky. You can't really take his money on a month by month basis and then stand firm on keeping your money separate because it's not separate. If he's financially supporting you then I would ask him if he's ready to get married and truly blend your finances. If so, you go to a money management class and build a budget together and make sure it has some money dedicated to car needs and some money dedicated to emergency funds. 

If he doesn't want to get married or you don't want to marry him, you move out, get up on your own two feet and as soon as you're fully employed the rest of the 50k goes into a CD as your emergency fund.
Breakup asap. You need a real man and not a scrub 7 years and no intentions to marry? The fuck you wasting time girl.
Only lend money to people if you don't expect them to pay it back.
The answer is simple, if you don't feel comfortable doing it, there's a reason. So don't do it ♥️.
No NO NO. Don't do it. Don't even think about it unless you plan to freely 'gift' this man your money because you will never see it again. If he does not qualify to get himself a car loan, why would you think he would pay you back? You already know he is stringing you along as far as commitment goes, so my suggestion is to break free now. You will still have your inheritance and you might actually find a man who wants to be with you for real.
Do not do it!!.. You have to ask yourself why he feels entitled to your money.. As you said, he is not even your husband... he should respect you enough not to even ask you for that money.
DO NOT LOAN HIM. I will recommend you break up with him. He does not love u. If he did, he wont be looking in ur pocket knowing u have no one. He will be actively helping you make the best financial decisions and he will advising u to save your money. Not take it from you. Tell him to go get an auto loan like every normal person
Don’t
I loaned my cousin $100 she said she’d pay me right back in a week, the week came and she said she really need another $100 and she is sure to pay me back the following week. I was dumb as fuck! It’s been 6 years and she never paid me back! I don’t even care anymore and I don’t talk to her anymore and she knows why.
Tell him it’s all tied up for your future. 9700 for a new car??!!!!! Tell his ass to be humble and buy a beater until he can afford a new car.
Why does he have no intentions of marrying you and are you ok with that? 


I wouldn't 

If you do make a contract and have witnesses sign it and make sure each payment is online in your bank or you use a receipt book to both have copies of the payments for court which you'll likely have to use if y'all break up
Just tell him it’s in a CD and you can’t pull it out.
When my mother passed years ago I had some life insurance money left over after I paid her funeral and settled her bills. Months later a relative calls me and asks to borrow money to buy concert tickets. She asked " you've still got some of that money left, don't you?". If I recall she wanted to borrow something like $200-250, so not as much as OPs bf. And I did have the money. It just ticked me off that she brought up the life insurance money. I told her no, use a credit card. She said a private person was selling them. I told her sorry, can't help you.
No no no…do not fall into this trap. Been there done that. You won’t get your money back.
Tell him it's in a Trust until age 'x' and there's nothing you can do sorry
If you decide to to lend him the money do yourself a favor and set up a contract with monthly terms, penalties  if paid late etc. have this notorized and witnessed.  then put yourself on title as a lienholder. You will only be able to do this if he is buying a $9700 car. Lastly get a second set of keys to said car ( this will also be referenced in said contract). It will be realy easy to sell or repo said car if he defaults. Oh and make sure he gets full coverage insurance is in the contact too. Cya!
Don't do it, tell him he needs to try to get his own loan at a credit union. If he doesn't have the credit score to get a car loan, then he is not fit for a new car. Boo hoo his own problem not yours. If you were married for years and had a trustful relationship then this could be a different situation, but a boyfriend..... No, don't do it. You will regret it.
If he pay you back within a year, he can save that money within a year and then buy the car.
DON’T DO IT. If he holds it against you then he doesn’t really care about you anyway. I got screwed over so much giving people money when I was younger, when I really just wanted to be loved.
Honestly 50k is a small amount for a retirement savings. Here's what you do, talk to a financial advisor and follow their advice. None of it is going to include letting your boyfriend $10,000 for a car. You need to save and invest a good portion of it to keep it away from people who want to borrow it or exploit you. By the way a car is a terrible investment because it consistently loses value unless it's some kind of collectors automobile.

 If you end up doing it, (please don't) make sure that your name is on the title as well as his so that you are partial owner of that vehicle. Make this a no negotiation part of the deal if you cave on lending him the money.

From some of your comments it doesn't sound like you to have the same goals for the future and maybe it is time to move on and find somebody that wants to marry you and actually build a life together living in the same spot.
Don't do it. I leant an ex bf 3000 which was half my savings at the time. He said he would have it back to me within a month. Several months later and nothing and I got tired of his angry controlling behavior and ended things and he said he was still going to pay me back, but never did and having him in my life in any form was not worth the money so I didn't push for it. Wish I had never given it to him though
In my experience everytime I’ve given someone a large amount of money and I REALLY trusted this person they didn’t give it back to me and it really put a strain on the way I felt about them.. money brings out things you would never think it would. Obviously that was just what happened to me tho..
No way. Don’t do it. $50000 is not a lot in a lifespan, and and you’re already needing to dip into it. Your father isn’t able to bail you out of tough times now (my condolences btw). The boyfriend casually asks for a fifth of it within a year but you’ve been together 7 years and he hasn’t had any interest in marriage? Don’t invest in someone who doesn’t invest in you but even if you were engaged, that would have been a big ask that was out of line.
Any loans over $590 needs a contract.
If he can't get a loan for the car, he won't be able to pay you almost 10k in a year....don't do it
Keep your finances strictly separated from the love life. 
Your BF can go to his parents, his bank, a loanshark, whatever, but you should refrain yourself from financing any of his actions.
Do not do this. 

Unless your married DO NOT DO THIS
When you tell him no, you'll learn a lot about him.
Let your boyfriend pay his own way. Money is security. Boyfriends aren't
He’s NOT going to return the money. So do you want to just give it to him?
Don’t loan him money. He wouldn’t pay back. He has been dating you for 7 years and that’s a long time he wouldn’t marry you. If he really wants the car of $9700. Let him get a bank loan.
Don't be dumb, love. As one of the comments said,  if you give away that type of money, you have to be okay with it. Why do people feel comfortable enough to ask for that amount of money? Knowing that they are not going to pay you back.
With NO intentions of marriage!!!! 😡Gurl, you can do better than him, so what if he treats you nice? THAT'S THE BARE MINIMUM! Another man will do that and more without asking to take your money 💰 get out of there. He's going to become mean when you don't give him the sum.
Nope. Nope. Nope. Did i mention Nope? Tooooooo risky.
Nope, don’t even think of doing it.  He can get a loan from a bank.
How is he trying to borrow money from an unemployed person???? Why are you considering lending money as an unemployed person???
Yeah. Say no nicely. Like “I really don’t feel comfortable loaning money to people I’m close to”. If he pushes you might have to leave him. It means he’s not respecting your boundary. Also don’t tell
your next boyfriend about the money.
Girl no
If you do feel like it the only way i can think of is singing a legal agreement with him.

But even then in a worst case scenario court will be a pain and more expenses to deal with 

I believe it is better to make your own choice and if you do take a leap off a fate with this better talk to a lawyer or something to get advice on how to at least have a safety net

Personally i wouldn't have loaned money since it is a big factor in breaking up families not just relationships.
Tell him it's invested. Better yet, invest it and tell him it's tied up in investments.  This man probably wouldn't give you any of his inheritance if the roles were reversed.
Please raise your bar. And don't buy him a car. Because that is what you would be doing; you wouldn't see a dime back.
It sounds like you would need the money if something went wrong. You need some sort of Margin of Error or life gets stressful. You are not been cheap you are been financial responsible. Until you have combined finances you never really know someone's saving and spending habits.

The only reason to give him the money is if not having a car prevented him from working. I say give here because the likely hood of getting it back are low. Lending money as a loan in a long term relationship tends to reshape relationship dynamics in unpredictable aways
If you are uncomfortable that tells you not to do it.

If you do lend the money then be prepared you will never get it back.
Some/most relationships are temporary until something happens. Any money you lent or spent on your partner could be for nothing in the end. My brother spent $1.2k recently on a bracelet for his gf. A week later and they are breaking up. Money gone just like that. Not every relationship is the same and could actually last long/forever but it's more rare. Keep your money in savings and don't touch unless you personally needed it. It's your inheritance not anyone elses.
Go to a lawyer for contracts have him right one up for you if he is not willing to sign it then don’t loan him the money.
You've mentioned that he loaned money to his friend.. then he should ask those friends for help!

New car isn't an emergency, don't give him any money!
If you choose to loan him this money, put it on paper. He has one year to pay you back in full at no interest. Have it notarized. If he’s not willing to put it on paper, then he had no intention of paying you back.
Don't do it.

>I really don’t feel comfortable giving him the money.

Trust your gut. Don't give him money!!
DO NOT DO IT
Tell him the money is tied up, sorry.
Put on fixed rate CD and tell him you can’t touch it
You are allowed to say no to him.
Don’t do it. You will regret it. He has no intention of marrying you yet you know this and are still with him? Why? Hope you don’t mind me asking. Also, if you didn’t have that money, how would he buy his car? Don’t do it. You will regret it.
Buy a house with only your name on the deeds x
7 years and bro doesn't want to get married? Idk if it's just your preference but like what is the goal of this relationship then? Hell no to giving him the money. Has he known you were going to get an inheritance? Maybe he just stayed with you because of it and is planning to dip after taking the money. I don't know though I'm an overthinker BUT YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO SAFE MANNNN.
Don't give him a dime.

I always said if you want someone out of your life, loan them $20.
Yea, don't.  Wth. Shouldn't even be a question.
He can finance his car.
Tell him to save up for a year.
Don't do it, it will end awfully. Take it from me, I loaned an ex £1000 to help him pay off a debt when we were together, he then cheated on me, raped me when I found out and confronted him, and I still don't have that £1000 back. (I'm absolutely not saying that this will happen, but this was my experience) just do not do it. If he has a good enough credit rating then his bank will loan him the money he needs
He doesn’t NEED a $9700 car - if he really needs a vehicle to get to work then he can get one for far less money than that. Car cost aside, say no - not only can lending money to the people close to you really impact the relationship, there’s no real guarantee he’ll pay you back (particularly if you break up) 

Just say you’ve put the money into savings and can’t access it. And speaking of savings accounts, look into the best interest earning savings account in your country if you haven’t done so already - some really increase yearly if you don’t withdraw any of the funds
NO NO NO!
Money-lending poisons all. Do not do it.
Nope
NEVER ever lend that kind of money to anybody! Only do so if you are willing to lose every single cent of it. If he needs that kind of money he should go to a bank for a loan. If a bank won't give him a loan that says he's a major risk.
That's 20 percent of your money. Don't give him any money and don't co-sign a loan either!
Don’t, say you used it up during your unemployment and quit telling anybody how much money you have.
Tell him you’ve put every cent of this sum of money into an account that will penalize you if you attempt to move or withdraw it. These types of accounts do exist and it would not be some weird lie.

Also, consider putting that money away, let it make money for you!
no no no no no
I would say, no. I am married, taking care of my dying aunt, my father left me with an inheritance, that is in a trust. Once my aunt passes, my husband doesn’t even get to touch the money. What we get, is ours, which I understand. But, does he NEED a new car? If the answer is no, then the answer to your question is HELL NO.
7 years and no intention of marrying you.  Do you really want to have to stay around for another year to collect your money back?? Why are you still there and you'll have no way to claw that money back if things go south.
Don’t.. Never do loans in a relationship. No matter how serious it’s.
Absolutely never give anyone, unless they are your legal significant other, money that you ever want back. Family, friends, strangers, doesn't matter. You can give money with the assumption that they are going to pay you back but you should always count on them not.
Break up. 7 years no intention of marrying you AND THE MAN WANTS YOUR FAMILY MONEY?
You will never see that money. He thinks he will pay you back but he won’t.

If the car dealership won’t even finance him you sure as shit shouldn’t.

Also, he should be strong enough to stand on his own,  it mooching off them women in his life. Weak sauce.
Don’t do it. You know it’s a bad idea. Be smart and kind to yourself.
Do not do it. If you want to help, give him a minimal down payment, & let him make payments on the car. You'll find out soon enough if hes good for you.
Tell him you’ve invested the money for your retirement and can’t withdraw any without a penalty.
Don’t give money to your boyfriend. He will not pay you back at all. If he wants to get a new car then he has to earn money by the right of way of things like getting a job.
Your boyfriend will not repay you, and he will keep asking for more money, until it is gone. Be smart, and protect your assets. Your security first, not “a” boyfriend. You owe him nothing.
Tell him your accountant friends say no.
If you do loan the money, at least put a lean on the title so if something happens and he doesn't make a payment you can repo the car as it's technically yours.
You dump the boyfriend for even asking for that much money.
I recently received the same amount for the same reason  this first thing I did was send my women of 8 years a $1000 she ask me why, because I love you and I want to. Her please take it back it’s your money!
No matter what your decision is, this will poison the relationship forever.
Loaned 5k to my best friend and she wrote a contract saying she would pay it back. Guess who moved to Columbia. I’m not joking. 

DO NOT LOAN HIM MONEY.
You should leave him if he doesn’t want to marry you after 7 years…. (I’m also a male)
He treats you nicely and always supports you? He’s asking for almost 10000 and feels entitled to your money. I would run. I totaled my car and an ex offered me to help with a car and could have afforded one at the same price point but I shopped and called places until I could find a running van for less than $4,000. Don’t let him know about your money anymore and look for an exit plan if he harasses you about money at all
You are unemployed. You aren’t in a position to loan anyone anything. This isn’t even a conversation.
If you lend the money, you won't get it back.

He can ask his parents or go to a bank to get the money.

Don't let go of your safety net.
Um, he should NOT be your boyfriend. A man does not beg for money from his girl. If you inherited the money from your father, that money is intended for YOU. I’ve been married 24 years. If my wife inherited 50k I would tell her to spend it on herself, because her relative intended it to be that way.
Key word.....BF......NOT Husband.
Also, I’m very very sorry for your loss.
do not do it.... i gave my ex $2400 and never got a penny back despite us being together for just as long.
Trust your gut
Okay this is something I learned a while back. If you can't afford to give it away then don't give it away. No loans to anyone. And if you already know that he has no plans on marrying you, what are you doing with that chump? DUMP that loser. HIS INTENTIONS ARE NOT HONORABLE. HE'LL GET WHAT HE WANTS AND HE'LL TELL YOU GOODBYE. A good man is supposed to be taking care of his woman, isn't that the way it's always been?
Don’t lend, 7 years? Bail. He’s a freeloader in life and love. You’re unemployed don’t lend.
Friends and family screw you more than restaurant drive throughs do.
You're a gf, not a bank.  Never lend money to someone you're dating if you expect it to be paid back.
I lent 2K to people that I thought were friends. 1K each. To make a long story short, it’s been over a year for one and six months for the other. They’ve ghosted me ever since. I’m not rich by any means but do well for myself. You try to do the right thing but there’s always a conniving individual to take advantage of your generosity. They’ll need it more than I. Don’t lend any money. Tell him you invested it.
YOU WILL NOT GET THIS MONEY BACK

Understand that you will not get this money back, and when you ask about it, there will be a story of how you can see them working, or putting the money that should give you they are spending on you. The sum you give them, you will not get back. 

They will leave with your money. They can go to the bank.
I’m sure your money is tied up in a way that isn’t easy to access capital. This is what you tell bf. Let him get loan like any other dude. Or suggest he save his money for a year and then buy car, no loan needed. Protect your inheritance for your future. 

But if you fall to the pressure to loan, get airtight loan documents signed with plenty of collateral. Not just the car, if he used your cash as down payment.
Do not loan him any money.

Do not give him any money.

Do not co-sign a loan for him.

He’s a grown adult and needs to get a loan himself, just like everybody else. If he tries to guilt trip you and say that you don’t love him if you don’t do this, dump his money-grabbing ass.
No. No fucking way. Thats your father gift to you not him. Please, when he blows up when you say no and starts an argument. Just leave and never look back. Tell him you already stuck in an ira or somewhere where you can’t get to it for years.
That amount will not return back to you within a year, or even 10, or even if you got married.  
  
If you decide to go on with it, I am willing to bet you $40,300 that you won't get it back!
Get rid of this fucking loser. I’m 30 myself without a vehicle but I would never have the fucking audacity to ask my gf to buy me a vehicle. FFS I wont let anyone do anything for me the way it is, I feel like shit when people pay for me, thats why I keep my ass at home and on games at the moment.
You can do the underwriting. Does he make enough money to make the monthly payments? (At least 1.5 times disposable income after all expenses and monthly spending free cash flow over what a monthly payment should be) to find out you need to see his pay stubs and copies of his bank statements. I’d say go back at least three months. If yes then has he shown himself to be reliable in repaying debts? You could do a credit pull to be sure. If yes then at least get it in writing, I am lending you $x for (purpose) at x% interest to be repaid over x months. This will mean $x per month. You promise to pay by the xth day of each month and if you miss three payments in a row you forfeit the car to me. Then when he purchases the car you can put your name on the title until he pays you off. So it’s not his car until he pays it off. If you don’t want to do that then either be ready to say good bye to the money and take it on faith that he repays but if he doesn’t you’ll just forgive it(so it isn’t an issue for the relationship) or don’t do it (so it isn’t an issue for the relationship).
No, no no, hell to the no. No. 

Loaning money always goes sideways. Never ever hand someone else money you can’t afford or don’t want to lose. And never ever do this transaction with a person you don’t want to lose.
Keep your money, take the job.
Girl, if you want a family, you need to find someone who is willing to commit. This guy stringing you along is not doing you a favor. If you don’t want a family, it still sounds like you would be better off with a guy who isn’t in it to mooch off your life savings.
Please don't do it. You need that money and it was from your father who wanted YOU to have it.
Even if he was going to marry you the answer is no. That's a down payment on a house.

Don't give him a penny. You will not see that money again. Excuses will start. He can get a 0% credit card and get a loan. Please do not give him the money.
I'm sorry but it's tied up in investments right now I don't have that amount of money
I would say his request is wifey level and he’s just subscribed to girlfriend level, but I don’t think I would lend it to him even if you were married. It’s your safety net and you need that. And to be quite honest, I doubt he would pay it back, even if he promised. If you do decide to lend it to him, make sure you get him to sign something like a promissory note or something so you could actually sue him if he doesn’t pay.
$9k is a lot of money to never see again.
Don't do it. I got $40k when my father passed less than two years ago. Spent it all with and on my "boyfriend" in less than a year and as soon as the money was gone, so was he. Now my safety net is gone and I'm busting my ass working 2 jobs, 7 days a week just to make ends meet. Let him go sister!
Here is an excuse other than the fact that you cannot expect the money to be returned. You are job hunting. You cannot take the risk.
Absolutely not. That’s not even an appropriate ask as a boyfriend. He has lost his mind. you will regret giving it to him if you do.
We loaned my husband’s cousin $1000, which he promised to pay back in a month when he got his tax return back. That was 15 years ago. Don’t do it.
He wants 20% of your personal lifeline.  This is not a medical emergency.  Your dad made Huge sacrifices so that he could be Here for You, after he actually passed on.  Honor that sacrifice he made for YOU.  

JUST SAY NO.
My bf is very well off and has a rule never to loan money to friends, family, or partners. Never bothered me. 

Do not loan him that money you won't get it back
Never ever under any circumstances loan anybody any money anytime for any reason unless you're a scmuck. If I like someone or love them. I definitely will not give them any money. Because I like having them around and don't want to be avoided. Which is what 98% of people do when they owe you money. So always "never loan money to anybody you wanna see again." On occasions, I'll just loan money to people I want out of my life for good. it's worth every penny then... But if you do, decide to loan money right up a contract with the  interest rate and payment plan that has to be followed and have both parties sign it and notarize it then you're basically just giving a loan that the bank would with a better interest rate.
He thinks "we" got $50k. Why does he need a new car exactly? You haven't said he doesn't have a car or needs one desperately for a job or something. He wants to waste "our" (only your) inheritance on something stupid out of greed cus "we have all this money now so we can play with it". A loan for $9700 is $808 a month to pay you back in a year. He can get a loan for a bank for less a month that that. You really think he can afford to pay you back? Think about it.
Im sorry but no man should be asking his woman for that lump of money. Specially when the man is NOT your husband. I feel like that’s too much
I would never ask someone, anyone, for a $10000 loan. You’ve been together 7 years and he has no intention of marrying you. Do you want to be married? You clearly put his needs and wants first. Do not give this man money. When he leaves you for someone else, you are going to be glad you didn’t give him money. Use the money for its intended purpose and that is to give you a good start in life. Preferably without him. 

Also, please understand that $50000 in the whole scheme of things is not that much money. And he’s asking for 20% of it. Hard no. Take care of yourself and your future.
NOPE.  $50k is not a lot of money.  Where I live in California, it's barely 3 months living wage. Do not give him a cent. Tell h im to get his loan from a bank like everyone else.  No intention of marrying you after 7 years but he thinks he can ask you for a loan and wants to take a year to pay it back? NFW.  I think you know what you want to do, you just wanted to make sure that it was the right thing to do. He doesn't seem worth his weight in salt. Go invest that money and get rid of that dude.
Not a good idea. If any this goes sideways then you’ll have to deal with (1) a potential breakup with (2) a person that owes you money and (3) you may end up having to go to court to get a judgment that (4) you will then need to go to the courts to enforce. 

Sound messy?

Couch your denial as an unwillingness to get financially entangled at this time in your life. You do not have regular income and need to maintain what little security you have.
This is every Judge Judy episode ever. If you loan him the money, get a notarized note with a payment schedule. Sums of money in relationships are legally considered gifts unless you have loan paperwork.
if you have to come to Reddit, then that shows you don't trust him.
I wouldn't give a guy $10k who has no intentions of marrying me. I think you have already given him more than enough and should give yourself the gift of finding someone better.
best way to ruin a relationship is to add a loan to the equation

keep your money.-he can get a car loan
How old are you OP? Why do you continue with this relationship? You have been with him for 7 years and he won’t marry you!! That is a 🚩🚩 to me.DO NOT GIVE HIM ANYTHING!
Would your dad want you to give him that money? I doubt it.
Taking into consideration that you don't feel okay with the idea, simply don't lend him the money. Secure the money, minimum and safe way is the bank CD. Advice your bf to secure a loan, and that you would possibly help pay part of the loan whenever it is difficult for him and if it is possible for you.
Treating you nicely and supporting you is great and all — I am assuming this is emotional support not monetary, but it doesn’t entitle you to loan/shared finance type things like he is asking for. Why does he have no intention of marrying you? At the point where you are floating him car money, you all are pretty much there already. Sort of seems like a red flag that he’s okay with you making such a large investment in a relationship that he hasn’t invested into
I can't imagine thinking that any money inherited by my partner is mine.  This guy sounds like an absolute loser and a leach.  Time to dump him.  Invest in yourself.  Pay for some sort of training that will allow you to earn more and find a better quality of men.  The one you're with now seems like a deadbeat.  
I have loaned money to 2 of my siblings with not one penny paid back. Don’t loan family or significant others money. You will NOT get it back.
don’t do it. take it from someone who shared a $400,000 inheritance with their partner and not a penny exists 8 years later.
Don’t do it.  This ends badly MOST of the time. 

This is a nest egg. I wouldn’t take out of my own nest egg to buy a car, I’d figure it out.  

He can get a part time job and pay off a loan in a year or so.
Absolutely not, if he wants to share resources he needs to marry you. As is it sounds like you are wasting each other's time and energy, the point of dating is to determine if marriage is a good idea, if marriage isn't happening then the dating needs to stop so you can both move on.
“He is not my husband but we been dating for 7 years”, dude wtf are you doing with your life. If you are with this person, either you are full in or not. 
If he doesn’t plan to marry you or built a life together under the same roof, wtf are you really doing. You need to get your priorities straight and consider leaving him if you can’t even lend him $10k.
I think you kinda answered your own question.  $20 bucks, sure.  Almost $10K to someone you are not even married too, nah.....
Girl what. The real question is why are you still wasting your time with someone who has no intention of marrying you after SEVEN YEARS and has the audacity to ask your for 10k. Fuck that shit.
No, you should not give it to him, especially if he has no intention of marrying you. Wtf? You'll never see that money again.
You’re unemployed and he still asked for almost $10,000 for a car? Not only should you say no, you should think about leaving. That is wild. Tell him to go to the bank and get a loan for it
Don’t give up your next egg… my wife has a mutual she got from an accident… it’s not a lifestyle change but it’s enough money to at least cover our essentials (we want kids but haven’t been successful yet so after a year of bitching I’ve become more apathetic).

But I wouldn’t never ask her to touch it. That’s the “when things go sideways fund.” And it’s not my place to request any of it… it’s actually my duty to get money together.
I have given money to a couple of relatives who have asked me for loans.  I have said that this is not a loan, but a gift with the condition that you never ask me for money again, because this is a one-time deal. That has worked so far, and I only give an amount I am comfortable giving away. 

One of my best friends is like you (nice inheritance, no family left) and her then bf borrowed a large sum of money. Soon after, he wasn't her bf anymore and her inheritance is about half of what it was. Several years later, she now is struggling financially and really could have used that money.

Take your inheritance and invest it. It sounds like you just have it sitting in a savings account.  Your bf can buy a used car through a bank. Or, if he is so confident he would be able to pay you back in a year, then he can just save up the cash and wait to buy a car in a year, right?
tell him you already lent me 50k, I'll back you up.
Despite your relationship, DON'T lend him the money. Your gut is telling you not to do. 

Your inheritance is your nest egg. 
You're getting $2000 a month. 

Tell him to finance the car or get a loan from the bank. 

Better to have the money in your pocket than his. He just might leave you and you're on the hook. 

At the least bit lend him $3000. Tell him that's the best you can do. Be smart.
If the guy intended to pay it back then he would have gone to a bank and not had the audacity to ask for such an obscene amount of money to buy something so pointlessly expensive. A car is something to get you from A to B, it doesn't need to be expensive or flashy and if he has money he wants to waste getting himself a nice flashy car then that's fine but don't let him use your money for it
that’s why you never tell anyone when you get money
Don’t lend money that you are not okay not getting back. If he doesn’t pay you back, will you be upset? If so, the answer should be no.
Nope do NOT do it..  He can get a loan from his bank or CU. It is always a bad idea to loan money in friend/relationships.
61m here. Absolutely do not give/lend him the money. Shame on him for putting you in this position and making you feel this way. He's showing you his true colors.
Follow your gut!!! My ex husband did this to his new gf when he found out she was a trust fund baby. Called her dad and demanded he pay her out asap instead of overtime cuz it was “her money”. So embarrassing. Please don’t give a dime to him.
Lol no . Just no. It's a recipe for disaster. He might break up with you over it but he could potentially ruin the relationship by not paying you back.  Tell him the money is tied up in something that you can't just pull out the money whenever. 

He needs to get a loan on his own. You aren't married. If you choose to give that money he could continue to ask for more "loans" that he never pays back. If he can pay you a monthly payment he can pay an auto lender.

If you feel the need you can "gift" him a low amount toward a down payment, like a few hundred dollars at most  and say it's his birthday or Christmas or something. 


.........and DO NOT cosign on a loan with him. 


If he comes around asking for money again or is angry or persistent or tries to guilt you about it, he's showing you who he is..be careful.
If it takes a year for him to come up with that money then he can wait a year to get that car.
Nonononononononononononono NO
Say no!  Learning how to have the hard conversations is a valuable skill.
Don’t even think about it and if he has a problem with him….thank you, next!
I'm not saying to loan him the money, but after 7 yrs and you still don't trust him to pay it back.... You may need to reevaluate the relationship.
No, no, no.  NO, NO, NO.
Do not do it. That’s alarming that he would even ask you that. 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
If his credit isn’t good enough for the lender then please know that it’s not good enough for you. Also, add all of the others he owes. One disagreement and it’s definitely gone. So that’ll be a hard no. Unless perhaps he can come up with 1000 or half that you can match.
No!!! Do not lend him any money, you guys are not married, and it is not your responsibility to loan him money
Nope nope nope!!!
If you’re not married, don’t loan someone 10k. Is that really a question?
I lost my father last year. As the only child to a divorced man, he left me everything. Of course everyone wanted something. 

My father told everyone before he died, "If I wanted you to have it, I'd have given it to you." And then told me, "Do NOT let anyone bully you for what I leave you. 

So.

That money is yours. You do what you want with it. If you don't want to give it to your bf, don't. He's an adult and can buy his own car. He's not entitled to it just because you can spare it and he's not entitled to it just because you are in a relationship.
Your feelings are giving you the answer to follow.
So rude of him to ask that of you even. This would only be the start of him taking advantage
Absolutely not and if threatens to end the relationship then you really know his intentions.
Do not co sign on his car loan either.
No. Keep it safe and for what you need.
sounds like you can't afford to be lending money. It's that simple
No. Please don’t. You already said you don’t feel comfortable about so don’t go against that feeling. He can figure it out on his own. There’s plenty of options for him. That’s a lot of money to pay off.
I have this personal policy myself.  I don't loan money to people. 

I have been asked a few times and usually respond with saying essentially that BECAUSE I value the relationship, I won't loan money.
Do NOT loan him ANY money!!! Also, find a new boyfriend. One that does want to marry you!
Don’t!!!’!!!!!!!!! I trusted  my ex husband with my savings .. and he spent it all,, this savings  were from years of saving even before him. So please do t do it. When it comes to money never trust anyone
I would never loan anyone this amount of money ever.
Don't do it. If you didnt have the money, what would he do to get a car? You are number, especially if you are not married.
Don’t. You owe him nothing. In the future, don’t share that information with anyone. He’s not your husband. Don’t share that info or money. Good luck to you.
Your boyfriend is a lout for even asking you this, instead of going to a BANK like a real man, or -- eek! -- SAVING the money up first.
Say no. This money is your inheritance. If your father had intended money to go to your boyfriend, he could have given him some. Your dad gave the money to you as a way to take care of you after he was gone. You boyfriend isn’t interested in taking care of you — he’s only interested in taking from you.
If you decide not to loan him the money, his reaction will tell you everything that you need to know about your relationship.
“… I really don’t feel comfortable giving him the money. …”

You have your answer and it’s your gut instinct. It is far more accurate opinion than anyone here can provide.
You’re not cheap, you’re not a lender. You aren’t married. 7 years is a long ass time without proposing. Paying him almost 10k to stay together will definitely blow up in your face. Hopefully you have a strong support system of “chosen family” of your blood relatives are gone. Lean on them and get their input too. Hopefully they will support you not to wanting to be in that position.
You wanna know how people who win millions in lottery money go broke within a year or two? “Friends and family” come crawling out of the woodwork asking for loans they “plan” to pay back but never do.
7 years, and he has made it clear to you he has no means to marry you?  

Now he's asking to borrow almost $10,000?

Girl, it's time to move on.
Bro dont do it f9r car especially? Wtf
Cause i would understand for whateber emergency but a acar is not an emergency wtf xd
Aye just ended an 8 year long relationship, gave dude a little over $2,500 from my father’s $25,000 inheritance. Never saw any of it. Don’t do it!!
I completely get what everyone is saying but if after 7 years together you can't trust this man to pay you back do you not have a bigger problem?
As a former long term boyfriend (11 years) who did eventually marry the girl, let me offer some advice:

No.
Dump him. 

Yes easier said than done after 7 years but think about it. 

Anyone who tries to take your inheritance from you with no plans to marry is not someone you want to be with. This isn’t like using it to buy property which would benefit you -  he wants a new toy for himself. 

He does NOT have your back if he knows you have no family to lean on in the future and will need that money to survive. He sounds selfish. 

Figure out how to invest that money so you can double it in 5 or 10 years and live off dividend income if needed - you will need it later in life. 

NTA and you know it - hopefully you get some good talking points to throw back at him even though NO is a complete sentence.
NO! Er, sorry, I meant “NONONONONONONOOOOOOOOO! No.”
At that amount and your circumstance absolutely not. Be upfront in saying that “hey I can’t afford to do that”. If he’s cool with it he will look into banks that provide loans. If he’s not cool with it, sorry for however it shakes out.
Hell no. Find a new boyfriend. He's just passing time with you. He will get a new car, find a new girl friend and you will never see him or the money again.
As someone who was the recipient of a similarly sized loan from a friend recently, don’t do it. I make my payments on time, and my friend is in a significantly better financial position than you described yourself as being in, but it adds unnecessary stress on both parties for the duration of the loan. 

If I could go back and do it over, I’d just go to the bank.
Girl no, almost 10 years and he can’t ask for commitment but can ask for money??

Wake up.
Girl do not do this unless you never want to see that money again.  

As a rule I don't ask for money, I don't loan money and I try to screen the types of people who would ask.

ETA: either lock it in a high yield CD or tell him you did and you can't access the money.
Don’t lend him that money. He clearly isn’t going to commit with marriage, why would he commit to paying back 10k?
He shouldn't be asking you for that kind of money.  

If that is the downpayment on a car, the car is too expensive for him.  If that is the price of the car, then MAYBE you could loan him the downpayment, but that's still a lot of money especially if you're not in a position to replace it on your own.
He won't marry you AND has the audacity to ask for basically 20% of your inheritance? 

You might need a new boyfriend. 

Which... He might dump you for not giving him basically 10k.

Win-win, even though it's still going to hurt and feel bad. 

I wouldn't disclose your financials to your next partner, just state that you're working and you make ends meet.
Don't do it follow your gut. OR find him a car for $3,500 and make him pay you back
Hard no. Inappropriate to even ask.
The fact that you felt the need to tell us "he has no intention of marrying me" is telling. Why are you even with him then? just break up and go live your life.
\- Doesn't want to marry

\- $50k's all you have left

Reasonable answer: tell him to go to the bank. If he gets angry about it and acts like a little sore pussy, I think it's time to move on.
I'd say no, but if you feel you must, at the very least, draw up a contract.  Have it looked over by a legal person and have it notarized. You can always take him to court if he goes beyond what the contract entails for payback. You'll still have to pay court fees and such so it's not really much assurance.  

To be safe, just say "no". If he gets upset, this is the perfect opportunity to split because as someone up top posted, THIS IS WHAT BANKS ARE FOR. 
Good luck and I wish you the very best outcome with this!!
As someone who was dumb enough to do this, I never saw a penny back.
Absolutely not tell him you're not his bank, if he can't get a bank loan that's on him not you. Guys can be Gold diggers too. If he harasses you tell him you've already locked the money into an investment. Better yet dump him.
Only lend money that you can afford to lose, and only loan money to people you don’t mind losing.  So many “responsible “ people don’t make paying back loans to friends a priority, esp when they think you’re well off and can afford it. Fastest way to lose a friend? Loan them money, them not paying you back alters your opinion of them and builds resentment.
Do not loan money out that you can not afford to not get back. 

Also, if he needs to borrow $9700 to buy a car, he shouldn't buy that car. Or he should just wait and save until he can buy it himself. He shouldn't count on YOUR inheritance. 

And taking a year to pay back $9700 is wild. Please don't loan him this money. 

How he reacts to this rejection will also likely show you his true colors.
"Never loan money unless you're okay with losing it" 

A piece of advice that I live by.
“I really don’t feel comfortable giving him the money”
My job is done here thank you have a good night.
Definitely don't give it to him. When it was left to you it wasn't with the intention of letting people borrow it from you.
This OP^ 

Never loan money to family or friends, unless you are okay with not getting that money back. 

My best friends birthday present to her bf this year was saying he no longer owed her the remaining 8k he owed her for his car.
Tell him you bought fixed term bonds and can't pull any money out without penalty but the good news for him is that interest rates just dropped on auto loans.
And DO NOT CO SIGN A LOAN!
Yep. There are people whose job it is lending money to people who can pay it back and make a profit doing it. If they won't lend money to a friend/partner/family member then you sure as shit shouldn't.
Yeah & if a bank *won’t* lend him that amount, there’s a good reason why.
Can just tell him the money is locked up (in long term investment) and better for him to get a loan (bonus - him paying off his loan can improve his credit score)
So true! My SIL agreed to help her bf to pay for a car 16k and he wont need to reimburse her over a year or so. The car is under his name, he still has not pay a dime back a year later. She then put his name of the house she put the deposit on (he didn’t put a cent). OP dont be like her. Dont let people take advantage of you
And do NOT co-sign a loan
I agree with this, and TRUST YOUR GUT. It’s totally ok to lend money to someone you fully trust but if something in you is saying it’s not right, to a man you e been with for almost a decade, I would trust that feeling.
Solid advice. I would extend this to anyone in a situation where someone is trying to get something out of you. You rarely need to explain your decisions to anybody in these circumstances. Please get into the habit of providing your decisions as authoritatively as possible with minimal explanation as necessary. It is very rarely required that you need to explain yourself for making this decision. Show confidence and remove others ability to weasel their way into having you change your mind by guilting you or finding flaws in your logic.
This reminds me of a funny story. Around the year 2000 I was talking to one of my coworkers during lunchtime and his daughter (about 16ish I figured) comes in to visit. So she asks her dad if she can have $2000 to buy a new computer. He freaks out over the money and then she says it's not even the expensive one. I told her "you're doing this all wrong. you should have asked for the $5000 and then Bill (her dad) would have been relieved to only have to spend $2000."
Even if he can I would advise against it
💯
not even having the intention to marry her either but wanting her to hand over 9k
Boom!
Time to move on.
This situation is exactly what we mean when we say, "Don't do wife work for girlfriend wages." There should be absolutely *no* financial entanglement until an engagement at the very, very least.

OP, tell him no and Guage his reaction. It will tell you everything that you need to know about how much he values you.
🎶🎶if he needs a loan he should have put a ring on it🎶🎶
Not everyone actually wants to get married, and that is okay. I agree about the $9k though
Right? It's the audacity for me
Shit, I feel bad whenever my GF gets me a gift. I couldn't imagine asking for any amount of money. 

Difference is I have every intention of marrying this one. Still wouldn't ask.
Apparently HE has no problem telling OP “no.”  🤔
True. Unless they met in high school freshman year, this guy doesn’t sound like somebody whose ever going to commit. Huge red flag
That was my first thought too. He has no intention of marrying her so why should she feel obligated to loan him money.. not only should she tell him no, but she needs to throw the whole man child away.
He made the decision he doesn’t want to share finances which marriage basically stipulates. OP shouldn’t feel the need to agree to a “loan”
Excellent advice, but I still would not do it.
Even with a lawyer, dude can default and then not pay on a judgment, then you’re stuck trying to garnish wages, each step being a complete pain in the butt that still might lead to nothing but more attorney fees
It makes you think how was she making it with no money before this? Does she still live with her parents? 50k won't last too long either
Right? As soon as she comes Into a bit of money, suddenly he "needs" something. What were his plans before she got the money? That's what he should do.

Please don't tell yourself "but, I love him, i have to show faith in him." 

He doesn't love you. Not the way you should be loved. Financial decisions should always be separate from decisions of the heart.

You'll really see how low he is, if he suddenly starts changing his mind about marriage. 

Mark my words, after you give him the money,  he'll say marriage needs to wait, because reasons.

Break up with this man. Even if he married you, You'll be sorry in the end. He is NOT marriage material! He's reliably unreliable. Do not hitch your wagon to a falling star. How many ways are there to say this? And why do nearly all the posters here say don't do it?

Here's a fun exercise; banks do their homework on someone before they lend money, yes?

Call a couple of his siblings, if there are any. Or a couple friends. Just tell them you are thinking of lending him a fair chunk of money, and ask them if they've lent him any money that he's not paid back. 

If he owes any of them money, you have just discovered the family sponge. 

I know these things from from personal experiences. I have perfect credit, (over 800) and I am 73 yrs old, (there is a lot people can learn from us baby boomers, believe it or not). I've seen and done some things that would curl your toes. 😉

Good luck to you Hon. But you won't need luck, if you use your head.
I agree ^

(You’re good enough for him to take money from you without security but not good nor important enough for him to have wanted to marry you after 4  years together, let alone 7? And if he asks you now,  you know he’s after your inheritance…)

He wants an interest free loan that you are likely to have trouble collecting on. You will only lose out with this. Leave your money in the bank collecting interest for you. 

Your inheritance is not his 

I would never lend money like this - It changes your relationship. 
 
He can get a loan in his name from a bank. He can buy a cheaper car if he can’t afford bank loan in it.
She wd be dodging a bullet by not marrying him
100%. This is going to offend some people, but as a man, real men don't ask for $10k (for a freaking new car) from a GF of 7 years. Guy sounds like a piece of work. This is a call for Dave Ramsey
This ⬆️ is excellent advice. If he is annoyed about it then he’s not the guy for you, he doesn’t love you in the way you deserve.
I don't think a reason is necessary.
Too scared to start over with someone new. This is the first time he asked for money and I know he always lend his friends money but I never asked him for money even though I was unemployed for 5 months and relied on my savings. I can lend 2K max but what he’s asking is too much. And a lot can happen in a year.
Wish my bf was the same. I feel he always had his eyes on this money and was just waiting for a real reason to ask for it.
All things considered a good thing.
This is what I’m saying. How does he not get that? Have I been with a selfish opportunist all this time?
OP does not need a reason. He'll just argue how that can be figured out. Just sorry. No.
No he doesn’t “need” it he has a car already but his friend is selling her Honda Civic 2017 for this amount of money. He said the car is in good condition it would be stupid of him to let it go to someone else. He will ship his current car back to his country for his mother and brother to use. And keep the new car for himself.
I want to get married. He doesn’t. We are living in two different cities about 1 hr and half away. We used to live together and worked together. I actually accepted another offer far away because I thought I can lead a new life away from him since our relationship was a dead end. But he started treating me even better and increased his efforts, time and energy so I stayed in this relationship. But I don’t trust him to give me back the loan. His timing is inconsiderate which makes me doubt him.
We were friends before getting together. He still treats me fine. If I get sick he’ll come and prepare soup. If I need something he’ll go and do it for me. He provides companionship. But at the same time he’s a bit controlling. And sometimes I feel like he is the girl is the relationship.
Funny I came to say THIS

If Op lends the bf the money, she needs to assume it’s a gift and she’ll never see it again 

If the bf can afford to pay it back within the year, he can afford to get a loan elsewhere
I'm still waiting for a BIL to pay back a 37 year old loan for down payment on his house; still waiting for another BIL to pay back a 20+ year old loan on a van (even though he now has a 5th wheel and a pontoon boat and trailer).

Another BIL didn't pay back a couple hundred dollar loan.

Do NOT "loan" ANY money to relatives!!!
This. If they choose to not pay you back, they will ultimately lose out more in the end. 

Same mantra as gambling. Dont gamble what you can't afford to lose.
I borrowed $19000 from my brother-he charged me a set interest sum and yes I did pay him back. It can work but the people involved have to be on the same page
Operative word is - NEVER.  It always ends bad - typically never paid back and bad blood forever more.  Go to the bank, if you have bad credit - it’s typically because you are a bad risk.
That’s exactly it. Also note how he fell just short of 10k by $300? He knew 10k would sound too much and she may balk at that but 9.7k is safe. Then he will work it till he can get her to a number that feels like she won. He is a pro who knows what he’s doing. 

Also can’t get over about how confident he must be to be broke and trying to buy a 10k car. 
>"you're doing this all wrong. you should have asked for the $5000 and then Bill (her dad) would have been relieved to only have to spend $2000."

She should have asked for a pony.

A computer is at least a tool and can be used for schoolwork.

If she had started with a pony, she could have gotten the $5K computer.  😀
Yes, this! Plus NEVER CO-SIGN for ANYONE !!!
Right crazy work
Even if he falls to his knees with a $10k diamond ring…   No reason she should buy him a damn car!!
Not even if he marrys her.  He will feel entitled to that money and see it as family assets to be used by him, and her too, if any, is left over when he's done.
It's the fact that her dad gave her that money. He likely worked hard for it.
OMG, me neither, but some people in the end can't say no. In the end he won't be grateful no matter what.
And before anyone says she can repo the car, he could not have insurance on it, total it, and then refuse to keep paying her. Classic Judge Judy case 🤣 then she has to go after him personally, and if dude has no assets to satisfy the judgement, you’re kinda shit out of luck
Helped
Lol thank god she asked on here before doing it
Definitely don't need a reason and definitely don't need to lie to your s/o just to have a reason.
I seriously doubt he'll repay you. Even if he does it could take him years. You need that money now. And if he took the money and broke up with you, it'd be even harder to get the money back. Don't let your loneliness control your decision. He's trying to take advantage of you. He will come back expecting you to give him even more money.
He should ask his friends to pay him back. Please know when you lend money to friends/family you rarely get it back. Just consider it a gift. If you can’t afford the gift don’t give the money. 

Don’t be scared of starting over. You already take care of yourself pretty well.  You might be preventing yourself from a better life.
Too scared?! Say goodbye to your money. No wonder he treats you like a chump. Get rid of him or he will get all your money for no return and leave you dry.
He still doesn't have a reason. He doesn't need this car, he wants it. He created the reason. We're not talking about rent here, it's a good deal on a car, so he just wants it.
Do you even hear yourself? He's taking care of himself and his family, and doing right by them. But taking money from a woman alone in the world to do it. Shame on him, just shame on him.
If it was HIS money, he should take that opportunity to help himself to a better car, and support his family. But it's not his money. 
If you are really going to give him the money, insist on a written contract about the repayments.
The more I read about this situation, the more concerned I feel. Not just about the money, but for the time you continue to put into the relationship. Every relationship has value, but it sounds like this one might have run its course. Please remember the reasons you wanted to move away.
Yup, I paid for my ex best friend’s mammoth trip on the pretense that he’d pay me back as soon as possible.  Almost a year went by and he never even mentioned it.  When I finally brought it up he said that I pulled a fast one on him and pressured him into going so he shouldn’t have to pay me back the near $500 it cost to go.  This was after already giving him $900 for other snowboarding trips that season as a gift.  Told him I couldn’t afford to take him to Mammoth unless he paid me back.  Son of a bitch decided $500 was worth more than a 25 year relationship.  Never give money to friends or family.  You won’t ever see it, and you’ll be the bad guy when you ask for it back.
Took you three gos to realise. You’re far too kind.
Or the car seller is using the tactic all businesses use, which is to not advertise at a big round number but a slightly lesser one.
Probably in the minority with this, but I was so glad that my sister offered to cosign my 1st apartment. Even though I made 3 times the rent per paycheck, they were skeptical because of my lack of rental history. Not sure how much my shotty credit went into the decision (I was a foolish teenager (19-20 yrs old). 

Anyway, I made sure my rent was paid first and always on time; I'd feel disgusting ruining someone else's credit the way I did mine. You live and you learn, though. My sister trusted me, and I made damn sure it wasn't misplaced. 

Thinking back now, I still can't believe she did that! And I'd never put someone in that stressful position again 🫣
"Ill get you a $10k ring, baby I swear. By the way can I borrow 11 grand?"
You have all convinced me that there is really no way most individuals could legally protect themselves in making a private loan. I hope OP is reading these comments!
I agree
I just know you are right
500$ for 25 year relationship.... that is insane.
So sorry.  It must have hurt, but the truth of the matter is that the trash took itself out.
Whether it's $5 or $500, lending money to someone isn't a big deal as long as it's not an amount that financially ruins you.....If they don't pay you back, it's a display of their morals/standards, and lets you know you should break off contact with them. 

People say don't give money to friends/family. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who isn't trustworthy in the first place.
I borrowed a friend of mine £2000 (we’d been friends for over 15 years, really close. Anyway time is passing and no attempt at all at paying me back.Whenever I approached her about paying me back it was always “oh I will when I get my settlement”, I told you. But she’d bought a new car, been on holiday and made a few other expensive purchases. Two years later, not a penny had been paid back and I asked her if she could maybe start giving me £50 that she’d have cleared before her settlement came through, because she still hadn’t been given any idea of how long it would take.She called me selfish, said I could wait ect but I decided I’d had enough. She eventually paid me back, but our friendship broke down, it also stripped away the obvious rose tinted lenses I’d been viewing that friendship with, because I noticed lots of other awful behaviours from her and distanced myself. So no! Do not lend him money. He can get finance.If he can afford to “borrow” from you and pay it back, he can borrow from the bank/credit company. He’ll probably be upset, but it’s your money and it’s all you have.
Meanwhile the BILs are all stooging him out to the next BIL that he gives out money.
Our relationship was like the giving tree story.  He just takes and takes and takes without reciprocity.  He’s lost his two best friends because of it.  🤷‍♂️ he’s almost 40 and has lived off of handouts for most of his life.  The only job he’s ever had for more than a few months is Uber driving because he can’t deal with someone telling him what to do; I got him a job at my restaurant and boy what a mistake that was!  He was the worst expo the restaurant has ever had.  They simply stopped scheduling him because he was so bad.  Mostly cause of his attitude problem.  He is too dysfunctional to start his own business doing anything.  I’m tired of spending all my time and money helping him out.  Ever since he totaled his car driving Uber it’s been a mess.  His ego problem gets in the way of everything.  Can’t even play video games with him because he hates losing so much and lashes out, so I have to let him win.  And if we’re playing co-op games he needs to take control and not let me do my own thing.  Baldurs Gate 3 was supposed to be fun, but if I don’t do exactly what he tells me to do he gets upset and lashes out again.  Honestly I don’t even know why it’s taken me so long to leave this toxic friendship. I guess I have my own issues to work through.  🤷‍♂️
First BIL gets a pyramid-style cut of subsequent loans to BIL's. Beautiful actually.
I find that after some sort of betrayal happens that we can't simply overlook we look back and see many red flags, times we made excuses for their behavior, situations where we've overlooked something we normally wouldn't have etc. and we see who they really are, we have ideas in our head of who we think they are rather than who they really are and it's hard not to do that when you are genuinely a decent person.
This is exactly what I'm going through right now with my best friend of 33 years. The saying "the straw that broke the camel's back" means that there was already a huge pile of straws.
It's an extreme case, but a family member died because of a friendship; he felt sorry for the other dude because he was an outsider no one liked due to his weirdness. No one could convince my cousin he shouldn't be buddies with this boy. Dude lost control of the car they were riding in and hit an incline in the road at an excessive speed. Looked like a train hit them and car and boys exploded. Sad, but being nice should be accomplished with self-protection.
All my straws have been broken. Happier for it. The way fewer connections that I do have are way stronger than straws.
I feel this keeping my circle small is much better.
I found my best friend dead
M29 found my best friend of 7 years M27 dead today in his house after he ghosted me about a camping trip we were supposed to go on. I felt something was up, went to his house and found him dead and naked in bed. I was with police for 4 hours and even now 14 hours later I can’t sleep. 

It was a seizure. 

I’m sad, any advice would be appreciated I think I’m in shock. At least that’s
What the police said. I’ll take whatever I can get from yall. ❤️

Update: I woke to an astounding amount of advice and condolences and it truly means the world to me. It will take me a sec but I will read them as I’m so grateful all of you have taken the time to reach out to me. With the humble heart, thank you 🙏🏾 
Not the same but similar. 

Go talk to a professional my friend. This is deeper embedded in your mind than you know. It’s gonna stick around. 

It’s a weird thing to be “first on the scene”. There are likely some free resources in your town that can help out. I can help search if you dm a location if you feel comfortable with that. 

You’re not going to be able to sweep this under the rug. 

Do you have anyone you can sit and talk to and say “fuckin god dammit what the fuck” to? If not dm me and I’ll pick up the phone.
You’re allowed to be sad. This is exactly how you’re supposed to feel. It is sad. And you are in shock, because it’s a shocking thing to happen.

Hell, it’s a shocking thing to happen at any age, but it’s especially shocking at 27. It’s horrible, and I’m sorry you’re going through it.

There’s no right or wrong way to grieve, and you’re probably going to experience emotions that feel strange and confusing - that’s because they **are** strange and confusing. You’ve not had to deal with this before.

In fact, most people never have to face this - discovering an unexpected body is unusual.

So don’t worry about your feelings, they’re going to be weird and confusing for some time (possibly weeks, on-and-off). 

Just give yourself time and space. Perhaps even go on that camping trip for some alone time. And don’t be afraid or ashamed of grieving. It’s normal and natural.
i'm so sorry for your loss :( get yourself some therapy to work through the grief and surround yourself with those you love. losing someone you love so much is hard, but you will get through this.
I'm so sorry! I can't say anything to comfort you, but it's completely understandable to be in shock. I'm sure you two were really good friends, and it must have been really unexpected. I'm so sorry for your loss ❤️
I’m sorry for your loss. I want you to go and talk it out with a therapist, maybe do group therapy. There’s been evidence showing that each time you share your story, a bit of the anxiety and stress leaves you. It helps you to process things I guess. I learned that in an art therapy class I took recently.

The situation is bad all around, but I can say it could be a much worse situation. My group of friends lost one of our members a little over twenty years ago after a choice he made. Another friend of ours found him in much the same way you described but with a different cause of death. And it was extremely difficult and traumatic for all of us. 

If nothing else, at the very least, you know that this was something beyond anyone’s control. Don’t sit on your feelings. Don’t isolate yourself. And don’t be afraid to ask someone for help if it’s offered. Even if it’s just for them to sit with you at home while you do laundry or take a nap. Don’t forget to take care of yourself.
I'm so sorry.  I found my late husband dead,  and then 2.5 years later my best friend was murdered. 

My advice is to be patient and kind to yourself.  Let yourself grieve.  Don't try to "be strong," but also try to keep living/ enjoying life as much as possible.  I definitely relied on my friends as much as possible during those times. 

It's a really terrible thing to go through,  and while it will get better for sure,  it still sucks so bad. 

Also,  seek counseling if you need it.  No shame in that.  It really helps me a lot.
Get a good therapist in the meantime get playing Tetris
I'm sorry for your loss, internet stranger.

My only advice is to do what you need to do in the short term to get you through what is - and I am so sad that I need to have to tell you this in words on a webpage and not in person - going to be a very painful few months. Go crazy (within reason) but do it without hurting yourself or anyone. Please, please, please do not get lost in drink and/or drugs, if it can be avoided. 

Grief hits everyone different so there's no one true route. I'm still processing a loss from 13 years ago, another one from 26 years ago.

I am so sorry man, losing a loved one who was only 27 sucks like fuck - I know your pain. I hope you have other friends that you can gather around you.

Long term, if you can, check in with his parents now and then if they are still with us. You'll find it both painful and beneficial. It's weird how it functions, but the natural order of things are now upside down. His parents, I would assume, could not have expected this loss. They'll need just as much help as you in this bewildering time.  

Haven't ever done the therapy route, so cannot advise you on that, but that will be something others will advise you to look into and they will be correct to so.

Final thoughts. You were a great friend for checking in on your late best friend. Not everyone cares enough to do that kind of thing. You are a diamond. Nature sucks man...seizures/aneurysms/strokes...these are not things that \*anyone\* can plan for. Not knowing the full story, I can only assume that this is not something you could have helped prevent. Again, I am truly sorry for your loss.
One of my closest friends died three years ago. 

I didn’t find him (and long story, but I still don’t know how he died so I’m hiring a PI) — but even then, it was surreal and my mind wouldn’t accept that he’s just gone forever. Like, I’ll never again do xxxxx or yyyyy with him, ever? And you look around just flabbergasted at how life is just going on like nothing happened when someone so critical to your life is just gone…. 

I guess it says something that even after three years, my friend’s death is on my mind so often that now I’ll hire a private investigator to find out how he died.

We were in our 40s then and it’s rough. You guys are so much younger so it’s unimaginable. You just don’t think in such terminal ways at that age.

Seeing any dead person at all is a form of trauma, even when it’s a stranger. To find your own friend without life left is incomparably difficult, I can imagine. 

I’m sorry you had to be the one, but I’m also glad he was found because you cared to look into what’s up, and made sure he was taken care of. It’ll take time and the grief and anger may come in waves. Those are valid feelings so the only way is through it.
Dude it is completely normal to be sad. 

Take your time to pull your shit together and find a professional if you feel like you need it. 

Plus, you are a good friend, most people don't even check the person after being ghosted.
I found a family member.  I strongly recommend that you try not to summon up the image in your mind.  Make every effort to release that image by not reliving it.  I made the mistake of replaying it over and over, and all it did was etch it, and the horror of it, into my brain.
As someone with a bad case of epilepsy, SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy patients) is my greatest fear. 


Just rest sure that he didn't even know it happened. It's like someone flips a switch and then nothing.
Found my mum dead just over a month ago.  Happy to chat if it helps.  I had to wait hours for the police, so I had time to say my goodbyes.

Many hugs.
I've been through a similar thing, lost a very close friend to me.

The only advice I can give is take one day at a time, you'll have moments of remembering the good times with sadness knowing these times will never happen again, it's a really tough pill to swallow, it's been two and a half years since my friend past and I still think of him nearly everyday, see his face in my head and just think of scenarios and conversations I would have with him about current life stuff if he were still here.

I don't think we ever heal from these situations we just become more accepting of them as time passes.

Keep your head up and grieve however you want too.

If you wanna chat more DM me im more than welcome to discuss this further.

Sorry for your loss ❤️
Maybe this is stupid and I hope it’s not offensive but I’ve heard that playing a game of Tetris after a potentially traumatizing experience (like the one you’ve just had) can actually help prevent you from developing PTSD from the event.
i mean this in the best way but.. as someone with life threatening seizures, your friend most likely didn't feel a single thing. i have told my friends and family that i ever go from one, just know it was painless.

i am so sorry for your loss and i apologize if this text upset you. wish you the absolute best.
I went upstairs to find my mum dead on the floor two weeks ago. They still don't know what happened.
This will sound so stupid but play Tetris. It's known to help adjusting brains after traumatic events.
There has been a study that playing tetris early after a traumatic event may protect from developing ptsd with intrusive flash backs

I am so sorry for your loss and that you found your friend like that. You are definitely in a state of shock. What you just went through is traumatizing. Please see a therapist as soon as you can. In the meantime, it’s probably not a good idea to be alone right now. The mind can play a lot of evil tricks when someone is going through major trauma. I suggest calling someone you know and talking about how you are feeling right now. You probably need to really decompress. I truly wish you the best.
I don’t think I can offer any sound advice other than find yourself a therapist ASAP! You’ve got to be able to sleep or you’ll be non-functioning. Get a sleep aide.  I know this is much easier said than done. I’ve seen things I never should or wanted to see myself. So I can relate a little to this.
I’m so proud of you being able to write your feelings. When I found my loved one dead after not taking and blamed myself for years the conclusion I came to was that We found them because they wouldn’t want anyone else to find them ‼️ Even through thick and thin and everyone else that could’ve found them we found them ! Meaning it’s very sad and heartbreaking but I would rather me find them dead than anyone else and I hope you can somewhat understand and I want you to know it’s not your fault and finding them is more than what they could ask for 🙏
Therapy. Even if you get to the point where you feel fine, you're not. And trust me, you don't want to find out 10 years later it broke you a decade ago, and you've been a worse person to your loved ones then you wanted to be. 

Ask me how I know.
You are not okay right now and that's okay.  The only advice you really need is to take care of yourself.  It's okay to feel everything, it's okay to be sad, it's okay to be angry.  Talk to someone or be alone for a while.  Dwell on memories and cry a lot or do something to take your mind off of it.  

There's no wrong thing to think or feel and right now it's just about getting through the next day and the day after that in whatever way you can.

Time will give you the perspective to process things and figure out what you need to get past this (likely therapy and even more time) but for now it's not about getting past anything.  

You're in the middle of something awful and so just feel awful for a while.  That's what your mind needs to feel right now while you work through this traumatic experience. 

Good luck to you.
I highly recommend talking to a professional. I’ve unfortunately been the first person on a few gnarly scenes. One of them haunted me. I start by saying I’m a fairly cold gal. I’m covered in tattoos, ride Harley’s for many many years, am an avid gun owner and enthusiast, worked in the morgue, etc, so I’m not usually very sad or tearful or emotional. I witnessed a man get stabbed multiple times in his gut. I just so happened to be taking the trash out at work. I held the man’s intestines in his torso for 8 long minutes as I called 911 on voice command. In the moment it was like the eye of a tornado. Pretty calm and focused. Thoughts went fast but with such clarity. But when I stepped back it was like being hit by the tornado itself. I was covered in blood and in shock. I had to id the perp and the whole nine yards. So I went back to work after like two days off. I felt fine. So many people were asking me questions and I didn’t feel fazed. I just felt matter of fact about it. Then one day tears just started flowing out of my face. I couldn’t even explain or understand why. I suddenly became the opposite of who I am and was weak and fearful every time I was at work. My job (huge coffee chain) refused to trespass the guy who did the stabbing. I was losing my mind some. I realized this was bigger than me and I needed a professional to help me through this. 
The dr gave me an amazing analogy. She said “our fears and emotions are like children in the backseat of a car on a road trip. You may be in high spirits and focused on the end result but along the drive your kids start saying they need to pee.  You say “ok just a few more exits. It’s too soon to pull over”. Then an hour later two kids are whiny saying they really need to go to the bathroom.  You say “I promise only a little bit longer”. All of the sudden one kid peed themselves and worst yet, one pooped. They have absolutely destroyed the backseat of your car! They told you they needed to go but you kept going…the moral is that you have to pull over and let your kids out to go to the bathroom before they lose control and pee themselves. Your emotions are like your backseat passengers. Pull over and let your emotions out”.  
Sorry for the long message. Mostly I am sorry you found your best friend that way. Let yourself go through every step of the grieving process. It won’t go away but it will get a little less painful in time. Sending you so much love and support 💙
Please man don't underestimate what things like this traumatic event can do to your body. You may not feel extremely stressed by it now but the brain can suffer extremely without you even knowing about it. I had panic disorder for 3 year becouse of a similar reason thinking it's not stressing me out much thankfully i recovered. Please see a doctor or therapist things like this can really mess us up and the earlier you deal with the problem the less consequences it will have on your soul and body. Stay strong friend don't be hard on yourself speak to anyone about it don't hold it inside you it's better to someone cry to me 24/7 than for him to suffer in silence ❤️
So sorry for your loss op! I hope you can heal from this terrible event ❤️ wishing you strength and peace in what I’m sure is a very difficult time 🥺
Start playing tetris. It is known to prevent ptsd little. Is helps your brain to just not break right now
I’m so sorry for your loss. Please surround yourself with loved ones, take your time to grief. This is such a horrible and traumatic situation, try not to be alone for a while
As a healthcare professional, we always had a “debriefing” after an incident/event. It is important to understand and process quickly. It’s the key. I’m sorry you had to find him but I’m glad you did, too. Who else would he wanted? Btw he’s good. Hand on your shoulder, good. 💐🙏
I found a friend dead in his bed too. He hadn't talked to anyone in a few days so I checked in on him and he had died in his bed. He looked liked he was sleeping and just never got up. 

I look at it like this, dude didn't die a painful death, didn't have to stress out over work all his life, had a kid and a Mercedes. Can't ask for much more than that tbh.
Play some Tetris or another visually demanding video game. Research found that when done within 6 hours it reduces intrusive memories later. I'm so sorry for all of this.
Very sorry that you had to go through this. The same thing happened to my cousin, he was around your friend’s age. He went to take a nap and a few hours later when it was time for him to wake up they found him already passed away from a seizure. I don’t know what you believe in, but regardless you will eventually accept this as his fate. Until this happens, find a good friend or family member, even a counselor and talk about your feelings and thoughts. I hope you manage to get some sleep and update us on how you are doing.
Very sorry for your loss, may they rest in peace. Can't imagine what you must be going thru. Please take some time to process and allow yourself to feel sad. There's nothing wrong with going to a therapist to seek help or just having someone to talk to.
The best way to prevent bad PTSD is to talk to a professional ASAP. Don't deal with this alone. I'm very sorry you lost your friend like this. I hope you go on that camping trip for him one day.
Man, I'm sorry for your loss, and experience. 

I had a period last year that I went through a few very unexpected losses.  My father was a victim of a senseless homicide to kick it off.  I didn't witness it, but I'll never forget the State Trooper visit.

It can and will be overwhelming for a while.  It comes in waves.  Someone once told me it's like trying to swim in the ocean.  The waves are large and hard to handle.  But over time, you learn to go with them and overcome, you learn to swim.  They seem to get a little smaller over time.

The waves never stop, they sometimes come at the worst time.  But stay strong and you will get through this friend.

You have a lot of people that love you, you have a lot of people that care.  Reach out when you need to talk, vent, or distract yourself. 

I play guitar,  have for years, it has been my therapy at times and got me out of some dark places. Do something you enjoy.  

You got this, we're rooting for you, you're strong, we love you
Friends til the end. You had a feeling, and you went and checked. I want nothing but this type of person around me. 

The trauma is probably rough. I'm sorry for that, I can't imagine this lose.
So sorry for your loss.
I am so sorry. Give yourself all the time in the world to heal and understand the nature of his passing. It is okay to cry. Stay strong friend
The first few days and weeks after this happens are going to be most important in how your brain processes it. The same thing happened to me. My suggestion is to Google your town + walk in crisis center and go there. They can do on the spot therapy and give you some resources. They won't lock you up or anything, don't worry. Alternatively, you can call 988 and ask for a referral to one. Just explain the situation.
That is extremely sad and traumatic, I am so sorry. Download Tetris and play it. Not a scientist but there is some research that suggests it may reduce your brain reliving this and bringing on PTSD. [Linked here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7828932/)
Did he have epilepsy?
How did he have a seizure bro ? :( I’m so sorry for ur loss
I am so sorry.  I can't even imagine how you are feeling.  Please, let yourself grieve and go through the feelings.

Tetris.  I'm serious, it will help.
That’s really rough. Time to play Tetris. Not kidding, many posts re: traumatic events recommend this to prevent the image from worming too deeply into your brain. 

Therapy. 

Be kind to yourself.
Another member of the 27 club. Very sad
Sorry, man ❤️‍🩹
I’ve been through something similar and for whatever reason couldn’t remember them alive anymore… I found watching old videos or looking at old photos helps. I’m so sorry this happened to you 🤍
I don't have much advice to give but in case no one's told you: it's not your fault.

there's no real way you could've known for sure something had happened, in any other circumstance it'd be unreasonable for someone to expect you to magically know the reason why someone wasn't answering texts.

just remember to be kind to yourself, friend.
Grief and loss are two of the most powerful experiences in life. I'd recommend a grief support group, and counseling. Don't sweep this under the rug. You both deserve full support.  And, I'd recommend engaging in some loving, compassionate and wise spiritual ceremony, far beyond a memorial of life to honor your friend. I always plant trees through reforestation non-profits to honor loved one's who have passed. Many blessings for healing to you.
It’s so hard to lose someone. It’s so devastating if you know that if you were really connected and we’re friends and just part of your whole thing right and all sudden gone, I was in seventh grade and my best friend since we were babies in Chicago did some PCP and he hung himself on the school slide at a playground, he didn’t meet me to walk to school as we always did every day and when I got to school, the vice principal said that he needed to talk to me that my friend killed himself last night and I said you’re a liar and it was devastating to me and then 40 years later, my mom killed herselfand I don’t know why I said this, but I am if you ever wanna talk, you know that would be great. I’d be more than happy to her. Keep busy whatever you like. Doing just dive into it. It’s hard I know.
I'm sorry you're going thru this.  It's unfathomable, your friend , your best friend is just gone. The sheer pain of finding him is enough to stop anyone. 

Try to focus on good memories, don't be afraid to talk to a professional counselor if you have problems copeing with your loss. 

You are not alone in this. It really sucks you lost your best friend. I really wish you all the best.
I’m very sorry that your friend died and that you had to find him that way.It may be a good idea to get into therapy. Situations like this can haunt you for years . If not handled properly
I’m sorry for your loss.

The term “ghosted me” is unfortunately accurate.
This is indeed shocking and alot to process..Take your time to heal from this and so sorry for your loss. I hope you get better soon.
Its always a shock when someone younger than you number is up. Even more of a shock if you are the one to find them. You need to talk with a local pastor about it.
Im so sorry. As every comment says, please get therapy. But id like you to know something. I have had epilepsy for over 10 years. I can tell you that your friend did not suffer. He went unconscious but did not feel any pain. The discomfort and pain of a seizure is when you wake up. I hope you find comfort in the fact that he did not suffer or feel pain
I’m sick w covid but wanted to say 
There is evidence that playing Tetris after trauma helps reverse
There’s nothing you could have done and no way you could have known. Be grateful you had such a friend. Tomorrow is never promised and tragedies like this remind us how fragile and precious life is. I’m sorry for your loss, and all i can really suggest is to lean on your loved ones and try to keep yourself busy. After losing my father, it took a little time to rebound. Cherish the memories and be sure to make new ones as much as possible. Don’t take today or tomorrow for granted. You are loved and your best friend will be there for you always. Love you ❤️
I saw my mom die. There are just some things that don’t leave you. Definitely talk to a trusted friend AND a therapist. If you find a therapist you don’t think is working for you, keep looking until you find a good fit. You are not alone. I am so sorry for your loss, but carry on his legacy for the good, don’t drown.
Sorry for your loss and experiencing that. That fact you went to check up on your friend shows how much you really cared for him. The grieving process sucks, and there will be times where you’ll be reminded of him randomly and be overcome with grief, but treasure the 7 years you had.
A grief/trauma counselor might prove very beneficial. 

Also, playing Tetris now can help reduce intrusive memories/flashbacks surrounding what you were a witness too. 

Much love and light to you. I hope you find peace. ❤️
I’m very sorry for your loss. Please see a professional, it’s very hard to get through something this traumatic alone. I would suggest EMDR therapy, which is very helpful with trauma. Your friend would not want you to remember him the way you last saw him and EMDR can help you replace the bad imagine with a positive one. Happy to share more about EMDR but google also has some good videos and details
Play some Tetris or another visually demanding video game. Research found that when done within 6 hours it reduces intrusive memories later. I'm so sorry for all of this.
Find someone to speak about Sammartians ect they can help or your local mental health team will be able to support you. Sending strength and support through the void.
Something similar happened on deployment. I won’t go into specifics but the higher ups did NOT help us cope properly. 

Please please please get into therapy. If you’re feeling stuck at the moment or feeling like you just can’t, during that interim I’m here. Dm me if you ever feel the need. I will pick up the phone, even if it’s just you needing the assurance someone is with you. 

Much love my friend, many hugs

Fuck, man. Sorry for your loss, first of all.

Second, get yourself some professional help. There is no shame in speaking to someone especially after a bereavement. You need to get out how you’re feeling especially after losing someone that dear to you.
Don’t try to minimize your pain or your grief. Let those feelings out in healthy ways. Find people you can lean on for support and talk to a therapist. If you are sad, be sad, don’t think you are a burden on others for feeling how you are feeling.
I have come to the conclusion that this will happen to atleast   to 85% of the human population.Im a 58f and this has happened to me 3 times in my lifetime one being a family member I don't believe you need a phycologist to tell you this You  have to learn to accept it. In a  healthy way, perhaps if you're a religious person you might think your friend has made his peace with God, family, friends, and himself and has moved on to a better place. Of course we are selfish in some ways and want them with us forever but logically, that's not an option. Everyone sucomes to health problems. So don't beat yourself thinking that you could have saved him perhaps visit with your local church  talk to someone a parent, teacher, I believe you will have a greater understanding saying goodbye so sorry for your loss and good luck.
And please don’t listen to these people saying you won’t ever get over it and you need therapy they are wrong. You will never forget it but you will get over it, therapy is good if you need someone to vent to I did it after I found my loved one dead; but it’s all mental, finding someone you love dead is horrible but you will get through it. It will take time it will take tear, it will take regrets,etc it will take a lot because whoever you found won’t be able to move on in peace knowing you are blaming yourself/angry/sad. In order for them to move on you need to move on and moving on doesn’t mean forgetting it means you’re bringing them along for the ride to see your growth/success etc.
Hey, 3 years ago (coming up on 4 next month) I hadn’t heard from my best friend all day. I started having a sinking feeling in my stomach because i knew something was wrong. She hadn’t been on social media or anything, and she was the type to update her insta story constantly. I got home from work and tried to call her but no answer. About 3 minutes later her sister told me she was dead. She went into cardiac arrest and couldn’t be revived. All I could do was sob uncontrollably. I came home with food from my favorite spot and couldn’t even stomach a bite. I immediately started going through my camera roll and story archives looking at pictures of her and thinking of how beautiful she was. Nothing felt real. I cried every single night, I still do at times. I finally moved out of our city. I’d always been too scared but she always told me if i just pack up and go everything would fall into place, and it did. Some days I didn’t have energy to do anything, others I did really fun things that we both enjoyed. At first I avoided anything that reminded me of her, now I embrace it all. I have a small altar in my room where I go to honor and speak to her. I still have bad days, sometimes terrible ones. Healing isn’t linear and there is no “finish line” for grief. Sometimes it’s a steady incline, sometimes a plateau, sometimes a zigzag and loop. I can say with certainty though that grieving is much easier with a support system. You may feel like isolating yourself is the best thing but it’ll only make you worse. Hangout with his family and your mutual friends, reminisce together. Just hold onto all of your best memories and be great for him. Celebrate his life, remember his favorite things, write him letters.On my best friend’s birthday I like to make a small cake, cook her favorite foods, listen to her playlists and do something fun for her. Grief is never ending, but you begin to grow around it and welcome it instead of dismissing it. You can do this ❤️
Therapy. Even if you think you can do it without it…it is worth it. Greif is so different for everyone and so is trauma. You might feel numb for a very long time but you need therapy. Cry, scream, curse, call the crisis hotline, anything you feel you need to do that’s not hurting you or others, do it. Talk as much as you can, feel as much as you can feel. You are not alone. Ive had PTSD for years and recently went through another very traumatic experience very similar to yours. There are people to talk to and people who want to help. I’m sending you all my love and the biggest hugs!
I found my mother like this. (I can't spell) Arrhythmia, she had her bath and felt sleepy so lied down. Please talk to a professional. I'm so sorry for you going through this. 

Time will heal, sure, but it takes time. Get all the support you can.
I found my dad dead in his living room a few years back. It was sudden, and unexpected. Shock comes first. And then comes questioning life, and it's purpose, and deep, overwhelming grief. Take time to yourself to grieve. Spend time with other close friends, family, etc. Anyone who you can share good memories with. Acceptance can be a long, painful process, so be patient with yourself. Keeping busy is a good way to distract yourself. I'm sorry that it happened like that for you, but how lucky your friend was to have a good friend like you to check up on him.
I watched my wife die.  It is something that will always stay with me.
It's okay to feel bad or sad or numb or angry.  Those are all normal things to feel. i went through something extremely similar with my sister in law and I just felt shock and numbness and a sense of unreality like it wasn't real. I felt regret and grief inside me and this profound sense of "please give me another chance and I can fix it, I can save her, I can undo it" like If I had been there or done this or something it would be different and she'd still be here.


Talk to people. If you are struggling, call a hot line or a warm line. Google things like "number to call I need to talk help" with the area you live in or "crisis line mental health". There are good people out there who can help you find mental health resources or just listen to you vent for a while.
Sorry to hear that, tragic.
I am so sorry for your loss. I think it would be a good idea to go and talk to a professional. Once the shock wears off you may be in for a horrible surprise. Try to keep busy with stuff you enjoy doing. Go and visit your family or other friends. Once again I am sorry for your loss, I hope that in time you can heal and things get better. I could only imagine how terrifying that must have been to see your friend like that. It just goes to show that you never know when it is your time to leave.
I don't really have any good advice for this but I am so so sorry you and to go through it.  Try to stay around people and don't be scared to talk about your feelings.
You did the best thing by just reaching out. Find peace, go to therapy and be better! We're all human and what you witnessed is not usual. I hope your friend went peacefully. ❤️
It feels like words like 'I'm so sorry' just can't convey it. I suddenly lost one of my best friends on the 11th. I have two best friends. She was one of them. 

She felt sick Friday evening. Flu like symtoms, they said. Then, she felt fine Saturday, to the best of my knowledge. Sunday, she felt ill again and went to lie down and take a nap. She died in her sleep. 

I again was not there. But, I heard the story of how she was found. That of course doesn't compare at all.. but, I can't imagining it in my mind's eye. 

Please get professional help if you can. I know the support for mental health sucks, but I say this from the bottom of my heart, as osmeone that just lost someone very dear to them, having a therapist help me sort my shit out helps a ton. 

You'll be  in shock for a while. I would, at least. You might find it hard to process, or find delayed grief. I dissociated for a while to deal. Not the best but eh, do what you can do.

If you need someone to talk to that's dealing with something kinda similar (losing best friend suddenly) feel free to DM me. 

It's rough. It's really fucking rough. Sending you love, my dude.
Saw my uncle in a similar fashion, naked and dead sitting in walker/chair in his kitchen. Had only been dead for a few hours and was very shocking to see. 

It took a good 2 weeks or so for the image to not be constantly in my head, and then only sometimes after that. It's been like 2 years and I only think about it now if I do on purpose. It'll get better with time.
When I was hit by a grenade, the worst thing I did to myself was not talk about it. Just be you man. Feel life. It’s a sharp knife and one that’s hot and ready to cauterize you as it wounds. Life is numb. But remember: life is feeling, seeing, listening, smelling, tasting. And you experienced all of those. Talk to someone (my dm is open). Your friend was looking down at you looking at him with the grandest smile, glisten in their eyes. They are proud of you. They love you.
I’m super sorry for your loss. 

I lost my friend at 14 when we were on an outdoor trip. We went swimming in the lake, she drowned and I made it. I harboured so much guilt for so many years and never went near water. It was in my 30s now that I finally began to swim again. The point here is, it’s not easy and this will mentally affect you for however long it may be. But, with therapy, healing and time, you will be able to process it all.
Let yourself experience the grief
My heart goes out to you. I’m so sorry this happened to your friend and you. I’m sure you’ve got so many emotions, questions, feelings running through you at the moment that you can’t decide which end is up and that’s okay. It’s okay to be numb right now. It’s okay to be angry. It’s okay to ask why?! Remember to take time for yourself. You need to process this situation. The whole thing. Reach out to others. There are plenty who will listen. Myself included. Feel free to DM me anytime. I’m here for you. Sending you lots of love and support now and always 💕 always remember there is absolutely no right or wrong way for grief and there is no time line for it either!!! ❤️‍🩹
Play Tetris! Please look up the link for PTSD and Tetris!
I am so very sorry. Please make sure to eat when you can and please stay hydrated. Mom hugs sent your way dear.
My best friend passed away at the end of June and life has been very tough ever since. I hope you have support around you and can stay strong, I’m so sorry you had to find him like that.
Make a bright positive collage of him with pictures
Every thing gets fine as time passes, hold on to hope, deep condolences for your best friend.
I’m deeply sorry for your loss. It’s incredibly shocking and painful to lose someone so close, especially under such sudden and unexpected circumstances. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed and in shock right now.
Jjjjjjjkk
Deepest condolences. Really sorry for your loss. I hope you got the help that you need. Sending virtual hugs
My Sincere Condolences🙏🏾
My condolences on the loss. I’m so sorry you had to go through that. It’s hard to lose a best friend. It has been two years since I lost mine and not a day goes by that I don’t miss him. It does get better though. Remember the good times and it helps to talk about him to those who  knew him well.
I'm so sorry for your loss. And having to find him can be traumatic. I read somewhere. (I'll try and locate the link) Playing Tetris after a trauma can help. I know it's not the best advice but it's supposed to help with intrusive memories. I hope you will also find a support group or therapist to help you through this.
Wow a lot of people telling their stories without any words of advice. I’m sorry for your loss but sometimes you can’t do anything but go through it. Feel the sadness and then after some time you’ll start to feel it better. The best advice I can recommend is talk with your friends family. Reach out to their siblings. Uggkiuup

That is a very traumatic thing to go through. The above link is a resource that I learned about while volunteering for Crisis Text Line. You can put in your zipcode and it will bring up any social services and safety nets or mutual aid in your area.  You might try looking to see if there is a therapist, grief counselor, or support organization that could connect you with someone to help you process what you went through and the loss of your friend.
Must have been a painful experience. KNow that you will be going to the 5 stages of grief, while being aware of this situation you will be able to navigate through them better. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five\_stages\_of\_grief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief)

  
You might be at Stage 1 or 2, the more aware you are, the faster you'll reach Stage 5 Acceptance
I am sorry for your lost 🙏🏽 and I can understand the pain. I lost a friend to suicide last year.. it wasn’t easy, but with therapy and making peaces with death you can find comfort. sending you a hug!
I am so sorry OP. I had a close friend die from a seizure at age 19. That shit is so hard. 💚
He didn't feel any pain or anything at all. I hope I die that way.
So sorry for your loss 
U have experienced a huge shock and loss-I pray u will be better in dealing w this
I’m so sorry you went through this and I’m sorry for losing your friend. You’re in shock at the moment so give yourself time to absorb everything . I agree with others, you should definitely speak to a therapist as they will help you navigate this a lot smoother than if you try to do it yourself. This of it like physio after an injury, if that makes sense. Also, try to spend time with family and friends and most importantly, look after yourself during this time.
My condolences on your loss. 

Your friend was lucky to have a friend like you. 

Someone to camp with, someone who knew he might be in need.
I know I'm gonna get shit but judging by OP's post history, idk if this a real story. He kinda sounds like a dick anyway.
Geez hope you recover soon.
I don’t think it’s ghosting if was dead
this is such a kind response 🩷 it’s nice to know there’s people like you out there
Thank you for your compassion. It sounds as though you might be have been in the past a first responder. If so thank you for carrying those burdons too. Your response is the best reply I have ever read. OP if you do not have  any of the options this person spoke of. The olive branch he is extending is a rare one on redit. Many people give advice less people offer help. My condolences.
Your an amazing dude, I  wish you the best
My brother found my dad, I can’t imagine what goes through his head.
"fucking God damn it what the fuck" is the perfect way to describe the vibe of these kinda situations in life
I have people in fact it’s kinda overwhelming. But yeah I know I won’t be able to just sweep this under the rug
Just wanted to say thank you. Post gave me the last bit of 'oomph' i needed to make an appointment with a grief counselor. One of my two best friends died Aug 11th. It was unexpected and sudden. They were 1/3 of my support network. I want to burn something down.
And definitely do this before the disbelief and empty feeling goes away.  Because once it hits it’s all at once and with no filter or mercy.
I’m not great at words, but this. Please talk to a professional asap. Lost my best friend in 2016 to an Overdose and shit still hurts like it happened yesterday, but also feels like it has been 20 lifetimes without him. 
Im so soo so sorry OP.

I hope OP reads this and takes it to heart… your words are “just right” for this sad situation when he found his friend.
I was just about to say this! They’ve done studies on playing Tetris helping with trauma
Absolutely this. Tetris has shown to have similar success to EMDR treatment. The quicker you get on it the better for your brain to process. The heart takes a while longer ❤️ Take care and be kind to yourself.
This comment should be higher!
I don’t know if you saw above, but it’s recommended you play Tetris after a traumatic event in order to prevent PTSD. It’s a bit nested under the first post! (I know not helpful now but sharing for you and others who may find it useful in the future.)
I've heard this too.
Quite the opposite. I found it very comforting. Thank you.
I really can’t imagine that. And I am so sorry you went thru that. I would be wrecked. I pray you find some splice. I’m with you mate.
You have my condolences my guy ❤️
Thank you for sharing, that was well put and your perspective is very helpful. I can’t imagine being at such a horrific scene. My heart goes out to you. I will definitely seek therapy.
Yes
I know people who've died from seizures. 


There a few ways to die from a seizure. Hitting your head, biting your tongue and aspirating the blood, throwing up and aspirating it, go into a seizure and not stoping or something called SUDEP. You don't really breathe when you're having a full grand mal seizure so anything over 5 minutes is life or death. 


I have a nasty case of epilepsy and can arrest that a seizure can and do kill. I keep a benzodiazependence nose spray to stop them if needed.
Yeah it’s not lost on me. Tragedy and comedy are cousins after all
Saving in case mods delete it

> M29 found my best friend of 7 years M27 dead today in his house after he ghosted me about a camping trip we were supposed to go on. I felt something was up, went to his house and found him dead and naked in bed. I was with police for 4 hours and even now 14 hours later I can’t sleep.

> It was a seizure.

> I’m sad, any advice would be appreciated I think I’m in shock. At least that’s What the police said. I’ll take whatever I can get from yall. ❤️
There’s nothing wrong with therapy, it may actually help. Just saying.
TRUEE that or the friend is trans and there's a romance subplot going on
Ima stand up comic so I can appreciate the comment in its own. But you know what I meant. And in fact it’s actually ghosting personified
There's a very important trick to prevent trauma from becoming long-term PTSD but I can't remember it off the top of my head. 

Found it! It's playing the 1990's game "Tetris" for 30 minutes!

I’ve seen my share of shit. Likely to see more. It’s probably why I wear a straight face most of the time and look angry, I’m not, I’m aware of surroundings. 

Thanks for your response 👊
That’s a rough one. Does he have a good support system? When it’s random people it’s hard, when it’s friends it’s full on painful, when it’s family it’s debilitating. Wish you and yours the best.
My 15, 17, year old sisters and i found our mom on xmas eve 2020. She had been dead 6 days and locked in trailer w pitbull puppy.....i will never forget the screams and absolute terror on my sisters faces😭
It's so true. I found out Monday morning a few weeks ago that (one of) my two best friends had suddenly passed away. I ate with her everyday. I ate lunch with her. I saw her that last Friday. She felt sick. Sat she felt better. Sunday she felt sick, laid down to take a nap, and never woke up.

WTF man. just WTF
When I was younger we lost someone. The friend group was at the hospital. Some of us needed to do something so we grabbed a deck of cards, we each flipped a card over and that’s how many push ups we did. We must have gone through that deck of cards 20 times waiting to hear she didn’t make it. 

Now a days I shot distance, gotta have a calm sole and steady breath to shot long range rifles. Not only do you have to calm yourself but you get to destroy things in a calm manner 😂
It can be. 

I have wanted to just stay in bed after some of my situations. In my opinion that is fine to an extent. Going for a walk in fresh air is also needed. 

Godspeed friend. Still available if you want to shoot the shit with a stranger.

You are more than welcome. 

It’s not an easy thing to go through. I’ve done it too many times in damn near all of the ways. 

As a thick headed man who can “figure it out myself” I’ve seen the benefit. I’m still thick headed but I can at least help others with my knowledge. 

I was able to find OP some resources after they DMd me their city. I can do the same for you if you’re comfortable with it. 

Lost a a very close friend as a teenager and my dad was able to setup a group therapy thing for all of the friends. We met at a park. We planted a tree in the park. It was really nice. 25 years later I can still visit that tree and it makes me smile. Since then there have been more I have seen and it doesn’t get easier. I chose the path of being hard about emotions which I don’t recommend. 

Good luck friend.
That’s what the professional helps you figure out ya DF. 

20 years later those images in my head still pop in to say hi every now and then. It more sounds like you’ve never been in this situation. Im at peace with all of the things I’ve seen, doesn’t mean they don’t show up at random times.
Clearly you’ve never been depressed a day in your life
“what you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.”
Ultimately I'm glad OP has an answer. Having an answer makes it easier to accept and grieve, if I didn't know with my sister that it was suicide I never would've accepted she was gone
I appreciate your kindness. And I think it’s great that you are open and ready to work through this. I can’t imagine what you are going through. I think your experience is worse than mine because you had a connection and memories. I’m very sorry this happened. I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. You are stronger than you know. I hope you update some time. I know you’ll do great things
I’m so happy that you understand gallows humor!

I’ve personally seen so much death in my lifetime that it’s how I have learned to cope with trauma.

Again I’m very sorry for your loss.

Stay blessed brother!

I absolutely love this 💙
Oh wow, this is so nice of you!
This actually will work with any task that requires focus and fine motor dexterity! You can play tetris, sew something, crochet, beading, sorting small objects etc.  

  
[Somatic Therapies](https://psychcentral.com/lib/somatic-therapy-exercises-for-trauma) are also helpful in processing trauma so that the long term effects are not as profoundly disabling.
This is EMDR and doesn't work until 4 or 5 years after the trauma
Thanks, he has a good partner, she helps him cope. He had to go on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds.
My advice is get into therapy asap. Its gna be a long road but know you are not alone....no matter what ...it was your friends time to go.❤️
For me, I've been to rehab a LOT. like no joke, 20+ times before I got sober. Collectively I spent probably 12 months in treatment centers.


I'm sober now, but needless to say I've met a lot of good people who didn't make it. Didn't take it seriously, I was just a lost soul and had nowhere else to go and my entire personality just became getting high until I couldn't anymore, getting sober for a month, doing it again. I was so fucked off and detached 


I went to one rehab like 3 times...  Months apart each time. And I think the moment the gravity of the situation really hit me, was when I came in the 3rd time and started joking about some of the dudes I knew from the first 2 times and stories about them... And then the person running the rehab was like "oh George... He's dead now you know. Charles too. Overdose."

I was like holy fuck... What....

I only saw them when they weren't using and cleaned up a bit and just didn't even conceive that they could be dead like that. Young dudes too, early 20s.



There was one friend in sober living I had the time I finally actually stayed sober. He was such a wreck.... So depressed. Had bad hygeine, smelled realllllly bad which made him the butt of jokes and such. But he was such a nice gentle soul. He was always struggling and even eluded to like mass shooting stuff.. Scared people, but I knew he was just desperately asking for help because he was in that much of a dark place. 

I know that dude, he would never hurt a fly. He was just in that much of a spiral I think he was just desperate for literally anything to get some semblance of control over his surroundings or at least have people see how bad he needed help  

Wed stay in touch on FB but sometimes it got too dark and I had to distance myself. 

After I'd been sober and moved away a few months he sent me a video on FB... He I guess had been playing with a gun drunk and pretty much shot his hand off. Bones and everything sticking out... I felt fucking awful but didn't know how to respond to something like that it was just too stressful to process.

Couple weeks later he killed himself

Fucked me up. He was my closest friend in rehab. I just feel like it's my fault for not reaching out more even tho I did more than anyone else there.

What really bothered me was when I reached out to tell other people who'd been in the same rehab at the same time about it. Let's say the friend I've been discussings name is Kevin. There was a worker there named Kevin too. 


When I told other people they were like "who, smelly Kevin?"

Like cmon
Ironically, YOU have major issues.
Dude. Someones friend died and your over here trying to be macho. You're not cool just a jerk.

You are just had because you can’t move on and because you are so weak minded that you can’t learn how to accept and grow as a human being. That’s why you are here commenting post about some things. You will never be able to do it. And that’s why you have nightmares and it’s probably why you go to a therapist and that’s probably why you most likely have some type of addiction whether it’s gambling, drinking drugs, etc. I hope you get your life together and judge yourself before you judge others with your goofy ass
You clearly said that “those people saying you need therapy are wrong”
> This actually will work with any task that requires focus and fine motor dexterity!

Right, but with an issue with as profound consequences, it's best not to reinvent the wheel (metaphorically speaking). Another interesting thing I learned is something called "mirror therapy" for iraq & afghanistan soldiers who lost an arm or leg due to an improvised explosive devise (IED). 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vkb2iz5Ue0
in that study it said 4 days not years?
Haha, you’re a fucking dumbass. I only use that word for top tier dumb fucks and dimwits.
Agreed. If people have access to tetris it's a good option. Just wanted to add that there are other things if people don't have that option.
I haven't read this article. I read it 15 years ago, when i did emdr. And the doctor asked me before doing it because it doesn't work if it hasn't been several years.

My friend has a stinky coochie
I set my best friend up (24F) with my husband’s coworker (30M).  Both attractive people. Things were going well, until they had sex. Afterwards, he ghosted her. My husband’s coworker told my husband that she has a stinky coochie. Like bad. I never told her because I felt like she would feel extremely embarrassed. 

She recently had another situationship who ghosted her after intercourse. She feels confused and doesn’t know why she keeps getting ghosted. 

As her friend, in the back of my mind I know why, I just don’t know how to tell her. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I go about this? 

It might be uncomfortable for her to be told direct but think how much pain and discomfort the ghosting is causing. 

I would tell her direct but preface it with "I know this might be uncomfortable but I am just passing on what I heard" type of statement. If you are best friends then this is something only really you can communicate without it being too weird. Then go over treatment options while finding out if she is aware...

You are stuck in a hard place but being ghosted is one of the worst feeling imo. Causes a lot more pain compared to a conversation that provides a fix. Better that than her still wondering a cpl years from now about why this is still happening.
If you are close enough talk to her.

My guess it is BV. Doctor could prescribe metrogel. Should get rid of it. Then the usual talk of pee and shower immediately after sex. No soap in your lady parts.
Start brainstorming ideas with her as to possible reasons why she’s being ghosted. Make it exhaustive, go over a handful of options in detail with her and include hygiene in there somewhere in the middle. That way it’s not fishy when you bring it up (pun intended) and at least it’s still covered.
"What I am about to tell you is going to be extremely awkward and uncomfortable for both of us, but I am going to do it because I care so much about you.  I found out the reason why XYZ ghosted you.  It was a body odor issue.  I think you might have BV and need to go to the doctor to get it treated.  I know this is so embarrassing but I am here for you.  I would hope you would tell me the same thing if the roles were reversed."
It's BV and she needs antibiotics. If she's your "best friend" you should tell her
You need to pull her aside. Tell her you are not attacking her, but you need to tell her...
So these guys smell her stinky coochie, then proceed with intercourse???
Tell her you just tried these things called ‘boric acid suppositories’ and she has to try them because they’re amazing.
If it was me I’d want to know especially if the partners are telling other people about it. It’ll be worse if she finds out from someone else. I’d just say exactly what hubby said and make sure it’s word for word. Maybe even say hey you know there’s nothing to be embarrassed about. I wish he was man enough to just tell her himself. She dodged a bullet honestly cause my husband would def tell me if something was going on, considering he’s down there often lmao. Just try to keep it light and remind her it happens to everyone at some point. Then help her figure out what’s going on, suggest she See a doctor if possible? Help her Get things straightened out and then as a Good friend, follow up about it. Honesty is usually the best policy.
Get a German person to tell her.  Brutal honesty is their national anthem.
Do you know what the definition of a best friend is?

If you can’t be honest with your best friend, change the title. If the shoe was on the other foot, wouldn’t you like your “best friend” to be honest?

Maybe it’s a medical condition or maybe she just has poor hygiene… but if you care about her, you should be mature and honest enough to have a frank conversation.
"Yo wanna do something spontaneous and fun like washing our coochies?"
I would erase the phrase "stinky coochie" from your vocabulary when you talk to her.
Be honest with her
Do NOT preface it with how “embarrassing and awkward” the conversation is about to be like some people are suggesting lol. That’ll guarantee an embarrassing and awkward conversation. 

Just maintain a gentle, matter-of fact tone and say your husband asked (so she doesn’t think he’s just going around spreading this info), the guy said her cooch smelled off, and that he probably didn’t realize it’s a temporary thing almost all ladies get at one point or another (“obviously he’s clueless!”). 

Mention that you’ve had it (or you’ve had other friends talk about it) before and that it’s super easy to fix. And that she dodged a bullet because who would want to date a guy who’s afraid of women’s bodies anyway. (Or something haha)
I think it would hurt her more to find out that you knew the problem but didn’t tell her and allow her to fix it. Sure, it would be uncomfortable, but just think about how much pain she is being caused by a bunch of different guys ghosting her after sex.
This is a tough one because no matter what you say it's gonna hurt her feelings.
if she's your best friend, why are you beating around the bush.... 

should had told her the first time you found out. kinda messed up u didn't
You’re assuming a lot of things here.  

Yes, she could have an odor issue but there are other explanations for this ghosting.  

Maybe these guys are hanging around until they have sex, then disappearing because the guy got what he wanted.  

Your husband’s coworker is a jerk for ghosting her, so maybe he simply made up this “reason” to tell your husband.   

Why exactly would he say something like that, even if it were true?  He’s not a nice person.  The coworker could have just told your husband it didn’t work out.  He didn’t have to be graphic or mean.  

It sounds to me like your best friend needs to choose better partners.
It is very possible she has an STD and is not aware of it. Needs to go to clinic and be tested. It could be common as activities Gardnerella or be worse. She needs to be checked as it may hinder her fertility.
your husband and his coworker are weird for discussing her coochie at work. imagine what they say about you and your naked body 🤫. but anyways, just tell her what the coworker told your husband.
This doesn’t excuse what he did, but I would want my friend to be honest with me. Tell her that her pussy stank.
Friends tell friends hard truths.
My friend would tell me.  Damn my uncomfortable feeling.  

Are you a real friend or just a fake social person.  

TELL HER.  She needs a doctor more then likely or she needs help in the hygiene department.  

GF don’t let GFs run around with stinky Coochies!
Anonymous "STD" Text message from one of those random anonymous services.

  
There's services that will text something like "Hey bro, you slept with someone recently and well... they have an STD and used this service to anonymously tell you. Go get tested" from an anonymous online number that can't be tracked back to you.



If you text her that shit, then she might go to the Gynecologic and get herself checked out "for STDs". Chances are, whatever's causing the stench will be caught during the checking process and handled.
Friends don’t let friends have coochie stank
You need to tell her. Obviously she is unaware. It shouldn’t smell so there is a medical reason why it does
"could the reason possibly be that something is going on with you down there, since sex seems to be the issue? It could be a good idea to be seen by a gynecologist just to make sure."

Or

" I read something online about a similar situation once. It turns out that she had an infection down there and only knew because a guy let her know. Maybe you should have it checked?"
Im just curious how she wouldn't make that connection in her own head. Like...she can smell it herself, can't she? And I know that we can go "nose deaf" to our own scents, but I've smelled stinky coochie before and it is pretty unforgettable (it actually made me vomit, thats a whole other story). I cant imagine ever being able to get used to that smell. 😒
First off a lotttt of misinformation on this thread. Tbh I would tell her. I had to go through it with my best friend when she slept with my husband's brother. He said she smelled foul and I never told her then. Well she got married and her husband wouldn't go down on her and I finally told her after she broke down crying. She said she wishes I would have told her sooner but turns out she was using scented body wash to clean and wearing underwear that baked her down south and for HER that was a no. She changed to just mild water and special PH wash. Started wearing cotton undies and it worked wonders. 

So for my ladies on here who feel bad about having a vaginal smell and the men who are pretty misinformed. 

Normal vaginal discharge has a mild, musky scent that is not unpleasant. Think Sour Dough Bread or it could smell like nothing.  This means that a slight smell is normal. Any foul (bad) or strong smell, or a smell that is unusual, is a sign that things are out of balance, and that you should get yourself checked out. This odor is caused by the good bacteria in the vagina, called lactobacilli, which produce lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide to keep harmful bacteria at bay. 

If your vagina smells like fish or has an odd smell? The most likely cause is you are using scented body wash to clean or perfume. Your VULVA only needs water & a mild soap (Think Dove non scented hypoallergenic) as the vagina is self cleaning. It COULD be Bacterial. Could be from not properly washing toys after using them. Does she take baths with bath bombs? Those are awful. Is she washing herself everyday and peeing after sex? Scented Tampons? The WORST. These are ALL factors. Could be a load of reasons but they absolutely are medical. 

You should NOT be using anything scented in your privates. Don't listen to these social media people, stop buying all those BS products, stop being ashamed of your vag/vulva and the various smells. You should not douche or put anything in your vagina to wash it. STOP listening to men who make comments about it and if they do make comments please let them know that BALLS should not smell either. Let your bits breatheeeee with cotton. Wash yourself everyday with some warm water, soap is optional. Keep your vuvla clean and your vagina will thank you.
Tell her or her whole life she’ll keep encountering the issue. Please as her friend tell her there are just some things we overlook.
If you two guys are really good friends, it'll be nicer to hear it from you and not someone else she doesn't even know.

Maybe she has a medical issue, I don't think she has the hygiene to make everyone ghost her.
I would probably ask what happened with the dude and then make up a story about how I had a dude dump me and then later discovered during an obgyn visit I had an infection.  And lightly suggest she also get checked out. "Just in case."
you that friend that let's the bff walk around all day with spinach stuck in they teeth

see somethi......smell something, say something
hallmark is obv sleeping on the sorry abt your cooch stank greeting card market and it’s time somebody brought that to their attention thanks OP
Do NOT directly tell her!!!!!!! She will think that it’s a hot topic of convo behind her back, I’m speaking from experience. 

Gently suggest maybe a ob appointment, word it like “one time when I was dating this guy, he ghosted me and later told me it was because of the way I smelled down there. Could that possibly be it? Obviously I’ve never been down there so I don’t know, but I’m getting the same vibes from that situation as what I’m getting from yours?” SAY IT GENTLY. Plant the seed. She’s a grown woman and should be capable of putting 2 and 2 together herself.
I always used to go the route of kinda leaving the embarrassment on myself. Even if it wasn't true. " When that happened to me, it was because... "
Here’s how I’d go about this…

Go out to a bar with your friend and at some point go to the bathroom together. Once she’s drunk of course. Sharing a 1 person bathroom will work best. After she goes, say “hey boo I’m only saying this because I love you, but I think you might have bacterial vaginosis. You need to get some antibiotics to get that cleared up.” If she feels embarrassed just say “it’s fine I’ve had it before, it’s normal!” 

That way her feelings are spared and she isn’t going to feel embarrassed about the guy thing for months or years. Also, I’d tell the male coworker that it happens to girls sometimes and she just needs to balance out her ph levels. You can also recommend her to take garlic tablets every day to keep her ph at a healthy level. 

Men are usually the culprits of our ph being off. Bad ph can cause bacterial vaginosis. There’s nothing to be ashamed about and girls should be able to talk to each other about these things. 

Please don’t let her keep walking around with a possible infection. I definitely do NOT recommend telling her this information came from a man. GOOD LUCK 👍
Absolutely do not mention that you heard it from men but absolutely take one for your friendship and mention something about her health.

You don’t have to say that it stinks, but you can say that you smell something on her that seems similar to last time you had BV or something. A scent that is following her around that made you concerned you had it again. It’s not strong, just unique?  - explain that it took antibiotics for you for it to go away and you only told her because you don’t want anybody else to recognize what it is?

The above is literally the most gentle way you could tell her. It’s going to suck no matter what approach you take, but you are a better friend for saying something if you really want to see her happy.
You forgot to include video of the conversation:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WPKlYecE0lY
Honestly, it's not an easy thing to bring up. But the discomfort of having a conversation with a best friend is monumentally less than unknowingly having sexual experiences and the word getting around. 

It certainly feels like there's no way around it being a hard conversation. But, as a best friend, I would want to protect them from the social and emotional damages that not having the conversation would have.

Be tactful and come from a place of compassion. I imagine myself going down the road of asking questions to both try and figure it out so it's not so pointed. Like, maybe you've read an article about how one can be oblivious to their sexual organs scent that others notice. Followed by how easy a fix it can be, and why not try it out anyway?
Poor lady
just tell her? You’re not saving her any grief by trying to sugar coat it
If she's your best friend, just tell her. Honestly, I don't think it was smart not telling her the first time, because if you tell her now, she'll probably be annoyed/pissed you didn't. Either way, if you care about her and know what's going on (and it's likely quite fixable) you should always tell her. That's what friends are for, telling you the awkward truth so you can better yourself/don't keep grasping at straws. You'll do her much more of a favour by speaking up than by being too afraid to make her feel awkward for a minute.
Send her an email about vagina health, under the guise of it being “vagina month”, something all women should read (or excuse along those lines)
I would ask her when her last pap smear and exam was.

This is a medical issue. 

Your friend will be embarrassed if you say something. And that's OK. I would be devastated if someone close to me didn't say something if I had this problem.

Many STD's can cause strong odor problems, as can other types of infections. Even if she uses condoms, she could still be passing on whatever she has.

STDs can cause serious reproductive problems, some of which cannot be reversed.

But here's the biggest health problem. Cervical cancer can cause some pretty severe odor. Women in their 20s aren't too young for cervical cancer.

Be a real friend. Tell her.
Get a burner phone and send her a text pretending to be one of the guys that ghosted her and tell her the truth that way. 
I had a classmate once who always sat next to me and her vag smelled like a bag of rotting fish heads soaking in water in the hot sun. You could smell her before you saw her. She had a bf too…I’m assuming he lacked his sense of smell. This odor made me vomit on a few occasions. I finally just had to tell her that her snatch smelled worse than a whales carcass washed up on shore discovered days later. I might have done it in front of the whole class who then began laughing and agreeing with me. I felt bad. But after months of smelling her I couldn’t anymore. Never saw her in class again. Just around the university.
In college I had roommates. After a few months one brought his girlfriend over from back home. A few hours later we all smelled it. We had to leave the house. It was baaaaaad oh my was it bad
She could have bacterial vaginosis. I know it’s a super sensitive topic to bring up but you would be helping her. Your friend needs to bring this issue to her gynecologist. Otherwise she’s going to continue getting hurt by these men ghosting her after sex. It’s sending her a message that can be, and usually is, very damaging emotionally.
The fact that a lot of girls smell bad and have no idea is really scary to me
I understand being an uncomfortable talk and I get I'm a weird person but I never understood fully why not say something to someone when you know it will benefit them in the long run. If people were just honest with the people close to them and talked about stuff it would seemingly workout better. People always say I'm too open about everything but hell, this life's short as fuck. I want to know everything I can to make my experience here better. I get sometimes it will be embarrassing but if everyone else already knows and I don't to me that's just way worse. I see it as if you're my friend damn the embarrassment help me out and tell me what I can't see. That being said she needs to know, if it's a medical thing I can be fixed and she might nail the love of her life next and get married since you told her and now her vag is like a field of roses. Definitely help the girl out. Fuck we all stink at some point. No one is beyond that in this life.
The title caught my eye instantly
Be extremely careful. Don't follow the suggestions some are making here when they say it's best to just be direct. It's not. . 

I lost a dearly beloved friend because I told him he had seriously nasty halitosis. I started with a gentle hint or two, like "how often do you go for dental checks and do you get hygiene treatments?" Which I'd weave seamlessly into the conversation thread. 

He brushed it off each time, changing the subject, so one night we were out having drinks and he was telling me about his bad luck in love. Never getting the girls he wants. So I said him, look here, the number one thing is that you absolutely MUST have good dental hygiene. I said he'd never get a girl until he fixed his bad breath. 

From then on the friendship deteriorated rapidly and broke down completely. 2 years later he still has stinking breath and dirty, skew teeth. And if course, still no girlfriend. 

I still feel like he's left a hole in my life since he dumped me. But there's nothing I can look do fix it. I caused irreparable harm
I wish men realized that it’s often their stinky d*cks that throw off the ph balance in women’s coochies thus making them stinky.
Addressing a sensitive issue like body odor with a friend requires a balance of honesty, empathy, and tact. Here’s a step-by-step approach that might help:

1. **Choose the Right Moment**: Find a private, comfortable setting where you won’t be interrupted. Ensure the timing is appropriate and your friend is in a good state of mind.

2. **Be Compassionate and Supportive**: Start the conversation by expressing your care and concern for her well-being. For example, you might say, “I value our friendship a lot and want to talk to you about something sensitive because I care about you.”

3. **Be Direct but Gentle**: It’s important to be honest but also gentle in your delivery. You could say, “I’ve noticed that there might be an issue with body odor, and I wanted to bring it to your attention because I thought you might not be aware of it.”

4. **Frame it as a Health Concern**: Emphasize that body odor can sometimes be a sign of an underlying health issue that may need medical attention. Suggest that she might want to see a doctor to rule out any health problems.

5. **Offer Support and Solutions**: Let her know that you’re there to support her and offer practical solutions. For instance, “There are many reasons this can happen, and it might be helpful to talk to a doctor or a specialist who can give you some advice.”

6. **Reassure Her of Your Friendship**: Reiterate that your intention is to help and that this doesn’t change how you view her as a friend. For example, “I hope you know that I think the world of you, and this conversation is coming from a place of concern and friendship.”

7. **Be Prepared for Any Reaction**: Understand that she might feel embarrassed, upset, or even defensive. Be patient and give her space to process the information. Let her know you’re there for her no matter what.

Ultimately, your goal is to help her without damaging your friendship. Being considerate and showing genuine care will help navigate this difficult conversation.
I don’t have any advice but I am at a loss as to how people don’t know when they smell.

I am a man. I am stinky. If the possibility of sex even remotely exists I scour my body with soap, cloth and water until the faintest idea of a smell doesn’t exist. I can’t imagine not doing a thorough smell check before intercourse. 

I see a lot of these posts, on both men and women, and it confuses me every time.
CVS has a nice selection of feminine hygiene I products.  If I were you, I’d go there and get a box of boric acid suppositories, vaginal health vitamins (help promote healthy flora and healthy bacteria) and some ph balanced feminine wash and wipes. Just give them to her with a little note saying you hate to have to do this but it’s for her own best interest. She likely doesn’t know there’s an issue and if she does, perhaps she doesn’t know how to fix it. 

This way, you’re letting her know and at the same time, giving her the needed items to fix the issue.
This is such a woman's problem: the refusal to provide criticism.

How men would deal with this:

"Dude, the girl said your dick smelt."

"Oh."

"Wash it or see a Doctor."

"Ok."

Problem solved.
If your her good friend, you should clue her in on what you know sooner than later, poor girl could deal with the issue if she only knew.
U either tell her or she gonna go walk around stanky unfortunately
Eventually someone else will say something to her, a rude dude on another date/hookup. Then she'll ask you what you think and you'll have the choice to lie to her or tell her you already knew from your husband and friends telling you. Then, she will feel even more ashamed because everyone already knew but no one told her. 

IF you are best friends, don't wait, tell her. You're meant to be able to have uncomfortable conversations with the people you love and care about. It is NOT doing her any favours by letting it go on without talking about it.

It's like if your friends fly was down all the time, you'd say something, yeah? Be a good friend and don't keep it from her.
Tell her what your husband said. Be honest with her cuz some women are completely clueless to their smell.
I personally think, if homeboy was really into her, he would be able to figure it out. Yeah it's gross, but it's not a reason to give up unless you aren't really all that interested anyway. At least without trying first. If you can, tell dude to make sure he makes a point to tell her HE wants to take a shower before sex to make sure she gets the best of him. And/or start subtlety talking about how important it is to respect ourselves and our bodies by taking care of and cleaning them.
You def need to tell her. But obviously in a respectful way. So, you know your relationship best and how she'd likely best respond to whatever tact. If any of my close friends had things like this going on I'd definitely tell them. Because I'm helping them and and that's what friends do. Even when it's difficult and awkward. Good luck.
Your not a true friend if you can’t talk to her your more of an acquaintance
I haven't read all the comments so I don't know if this was already stated. But me, personally, I would take the grunt of it by saying that my husband stopped wanting to be intimate with me and when I finally asked him why he told me it was because there was a strong smell but he didn't want me to feel bad so he just stopped intimacy and so I had to up my hygiene.(maybe even go to a gynecologist)  That way she doesn't feel embarrassed about it because it's somebody else and hopefully she's smart enough to think maybe that could be my problem too? All the while, not feeling insecure about it.Because it happened to somebody else too.
Gift her a Billie v smooth wash and say hey you should try this and hope she tries it n it works
She should go you a GYN.

A woman eill have issues like that felt many reasons but she needs yo see a GYN.


Before she does anything to her body
Bro, if she's a good friend, you have to be able to talk about shit like this. It's gonna be hard, but it's necessary.
Tell her. 

You're not being a good friend by avoiding an awkward situation. If your friend has bad breath tell them so they can fix it. That's what a good friend does.

Same applies here.
Just straight up ask her if she has ever had BV and discuss what it is and how to treat it.
Maybe just tell her and be honest, she's probably really confused. Even if it seems harsh, honesty is always the best policy. If she doesn't know, how is she gonna learn.
Politest way: "Do you use products like...vagisil? I see them on the shelf and wonder if I need to use them if they make products specifically for washing down there. Do you use them? What do you think?"

If she says she doesn't, then you could say, "Aren't you afraid of guys going down there?" etc. until she gets it or you have to resort to brutal honesty.
Probably easier just to ghost her too at this point, wild horses couldn't drag genital hygiene comments out of me
Ngl if I knew that was the reason that dudes kept ghosting me, I’d be so happy - mortified, but happy - because then I can fix it and stop getting ghosted lol
I almost spit out my cereal at that tittle 😭 anyhow, just tell her that it stinks and thats why, tell her to get her shit together.
I would say it this way, you know I love you and it pains me to see you like this but, and I didn’t tell you this before because I didn’t know if the guy was sensitive or if it was a weird time of the month but the guy that I set you up with said that you have a weird smell down there
Damn this is a tough one. Be prepared to be there for your friend because this is going to hurt her on many levels. Probably the thing that will devastate her the most is her business getting back to her through other people. But she definitely needs to know. Have some suggestions ready. Or begin it with a sexual health conversation, something of this nature. Or maybe tell her without telling her but make it obvious that you know what's going on? For instance, when you decide to bring it up, first tell her that she needs to visit her OB before considering anymore dates. Emphasize std risk since she has had other partners and make sure her sexual health is taken care of first. Simply because this may be a way to help her retain her dignity. It's not about saving face for yourself. It's for her. Idk, that may or may not be an okay idea to you, but just an idea!
For it to be going on for an extended period, aaand be bad enough a guy would not go back for seconds.
Its more than just the occasional imbalance.

Vaginas are incredibly resiliant.
They fix themselves rather quickly.
UNLESS they are constantly being exposed to something throwing off their balance.
Like improper wiping or harsh soaps.

Also, there's the worst case scenario of trichinosis. It's one sti that very commonly causes a strong smell. Especially in men's ejaculate 

I would just tell her straight up.
She's gonna be upset you didn't tell her the first time it happened 

So just tell her you didn't because you assumed it was just a random imbalance that he handled immaturely.

But now that it's happened again, you're concerned.

Women should be smell and color checking their discharge regularly.  It's not that difficult.

 There's no reason to have this happen (having intercourse when your vagina is whiling out) if you are mindful of your body and it's care. 

She could even by a bad wiper after a bowel movement 

Whatever it is, its not something to soft pedal about. She needs to pay better attention to her body. For her own well being. Which is Far more important than potential embarassment.
chances are she’s probably aware and overcompensating via use of “feminine hygiene products” which do much more destruction. 

here’s my idea for addressing it: you can turn it into a personal anecdote/advice convo between girlies. be like “ugh i finally just recovered from the nastiest bout of BV, turns out the wipes and sprays I was using made it so so much worse… my coochie smelled like a dead animal girl 💀😭 BUT my gyno was able to fix the problem with just one visit and im now doing better. woman to woman, if you’ve ever got something weird going on, ditch the fake bs products and see the gyno, you’ll be fresh and happy again in NO time!!”
Don't brainstorm this isn't fucking a movie. This isn't friends where you can sneakly put something up there clean it all out. 

You go to her You tell her what's wrong You make it clear that you are not trying to make fun of her You're just trying to make sure that she's safe and healthy and she will understand. So many fucking times situations could be easily fixed by just talking but people are so stuck up fucking movies and TV show bullshit that they cause almost every problem.
Tell her gently…I had that and it was a bacterial infection. My spouse told me and I was embarrassed but could fix the problem.
If you think that the direct honesty route won’t go well - Come up with a way to ask her hygiene routine? Something along the lines of “I’m thinking of buying Honey Pot intimate wash, but I have sensitive skin and am worried about irritation, have you ever tried it? What do you use?”
It could inspire her to begin an intimate hygiene routine if she doesn’t already have one. Tbh we’re not all raised being taught to use a gentle soap down there.
If you really are her friend you will tell her so she has a chance to deal with it and grow as a person. I'm tired of people saying they are a "friend" to someone they are not honest with. Being a real friend starts with honesty. Have her back and give her the information she needs to make her life better.
Unless you know for sure that this is true, and the guy isn't just a creep who didn't want to be honest about just wanting a one night stand, make the guy tell her! He can be an adult and communicate himself what his own feelings are
Tell her that her coochie stanks, problem solved. If she wants men to stick around, she’s gotta clean up.
Umm, so my best friend's wife has a friend that had this issue. It turned out that she and a partner lost a condom during intercourse. Turns out it was lost inside her for quite a long time. After it was removed she went back to normal in a few months.

Could this have happened to her?
Truth hurts, go tell her before she ruins more potential relationships
Tell her, better to hear it from a friend before a hook up eventually says something.
This worked for one of my friends. Just casually I told my friend about how I maintain and keep everything fresh and smelling good. What vitamins I take and what drinks are good. And would recommend products and send videos in group chats. Just making it about me. And that made her more aware of her own self and things got fresher! Sometimes you can say something without actually saying it.
She might have bacterial vaginosis, it's not a reflection of poor hygiene, but she will need an antibiotic to fix it
If she’s your best friend I would’ve told her the first time it happened. She most likely has BV which is extremely common. Antibiotics can help from her gyno and in most cases it returns so she can take boric acid for a few days to clear it up again. 

I’m kinda surprised she’s not able to smell herself? Like when you go to the bathroom you can clearly smell it. But, please tell her. I’m not sure why ppl come to the internet to ask strangers these kinda questions. It’s kinda given what you should do IF she’s your best friend.
Any update?! Hope your friend takes it well and in the long run she will appreciate you
maybe just telling her? i‘d tell my best friend everything, especially when it‘s about her
I would just share this reddit post to her and then wait for her to come and confront you or not about it. Problem solved no confrontation on your end. /s
Idk she going to ask you questions about everything if you say it to her. She's going to ask who said it what they said, how bad it is, why you didnt tell her sooner, the list goes on, and the fact that your husband knows she has a stanky coochie might ruin your friendship as that alone is super embarrassing.  That means there is the possibility his other friends know as well. Honestly, get what's app and send her an anonymous text or a letter under her door? I know that telling people the truth is the best policy, but sometimes people do strange things when you tell them the truth. (Talking from experience) you might end up the one ghosted.
She might just need a round of antibiotics to get the good/bad bacteria balance right and then probiotics to maintain it. Just casually talk to her about how you read women’s private’s can smell different or read some article about how a fishy smell could be an off balance. Bring it up In a non confrontational way
A friend would tell if they know! 

Do it in the nicest, kindest, softest way possible, but you have to tell. 
Get her a cake that says "sorry about the stinky coochie"
Why are stinky coochie so prevalent. Like if a 10/10 girl has an odor the boner is gone and then what’s the point
It could be caused by precancerous cells on her cervix. This is of course, an extreme situation but not uncommon. Guess how I know.

I would urge her to go to the gyno hand get some testing done, in any case.
BV. She needs Metrogel, and then she he needs to manage her pH and vaginal flora. She's too acidic, including her gut. She needs to treat both naturally, with diet. NO processed food is the best way to go. 

The American diet is now ultra processed and the absolute wrong thing for our gut. It's causing metabolic disease, autoimmune disease, and cancer*.

Make sure she knows all this, and about wiping properly and sexual hygiene, as other people have mentioned. Many women haven't learned these things! Some of us had shite mothers. 

To the female bullies who make wisecracks at other women's issues to demean them; fuck you, you worthless cunt. You have issues. Fix them.

*Gen X'rs have skyrocketing rates of cancer, and it's not all the same cancers as in the past! More cancer than any previous generation! They are aggressive, and not being caught until stage 3 or 4. We won't know what's happening in the younger generations' bodies for years, until the research catches up. Please see your doctor regularly, report any strange changes or issues, and get your tests done! They're now recommending mammograms for younger women, and colonoscopy for younger people than in the past.
Tell your friend to sell her stinky coochie undies online for $50+ it’s a niche business but she has potential. I can smell it! 👃
Tell her you had a similar problem and offer her solutions.
Tbh , id just tell her directlyso something like  hey, so I thi k i know why they ghosted you, remember the guy we set u up with? he didn't want to be mean and and brought up the issue to me bcs I was ur friend but he said your coochie smelling really bad and I got upset at that bcs ur my bestie I wasn't sure how to bring it up but you have just told me about this other situation and I felt I might need to tell u now since I don't want you to be hurt again, id check a doc to see what they can do to help you also include that uv had it happen before too (wether its trueth or not) just so she knows its okay and ur coming from a good place
Real friends should be able to be 100% around one another. Just be honest—the longer you wait, the worse it’ll be.
This happened to me recently. I was semi- dating this woman. Her vag smelled not so fresh and I was done. 

Couldn't look at her the same or her turned on by her. She effectively turned me off. I didn't want to say anything, so I ghosted her.
She needs to be tested for a bacterial/yeast infection , STI’s. “Coochies” don’t stink naturally
I agree with others about approaching this with care but being direct too. 

She could have a medical condition or something uncontrollable that she had her whole life so she may have thought this was her normal.  She needs to see a gyno to get to the bottom of this. She could have a yeast infection or other issues and just not know about it.  She’s probably nose blind to her smell. 

You can tell her you didn’t know how to tell her and at first he was just being rude telling your husband that she smelled but since another guy ghosted her you thought you should tell her incase that’s really an issue she’s having down there to see a doctor and see if they can help her. 

I wouldn’t advise her to douche or wash in there without seeing a gyno first. That is a PH sensitive area and to take care of down there internal issues needs to handled by a professional otherwise she could make it smell worse by messing with it or putting fragrances or random washes inside herself will just make the situation worse for herself….
Whatever you do, don’t say “people have been saying that…”
Just tell her. If she’s upset that you’re being honest with her, vaginal odor isn’t her only problem.
Why don’t dudes have the balls to be like, lady your cooter stinks? 😷 

I would think if the guy is really into her, that it wouldn’t be a “deal breaker”. But, then again if we’re talking about 20 year olds that haven’t had a lot of experience with women, I could see how this might scar them. 

I’ve had BV because of an incorrectly placed IUD. My fiancé was like… you need to get that thing checked out. I don’t have a great nose, so I had no freaking idea. 

But, think of it like this… it’s better to come from someone you care about instead of a stranger. If that girls punanie really is stinky… next time she wears a dress to CVS and is standing in line and that air hits just right, Granny in line next to her might not be so nice. ❤️ Don’t forget to tell her it’s normal, these things happen and it’s fixable. I’m not sure how I would react if someone told me this and then I was left with my own thoughts and Google…. I’d probably think I was dying or something 😂
Idk this seems like a coincidence.. ofc an asshole who ghosted her would say her coochie stinks to excuse his shitty behavior. Idk just me though. Think critically.
She either has a Ph thing going on or someone recently jizzed in her..depends on how close yall are or how you put it to her..me personally if I walked by you and you wee like wtf is that smell..I’d want you tell me..just tell her the truth in a nice way..sometimes odor can be from a serious problem
Definitely tell as soon as possible if you are a real friend the embarrassment she feels with you is not comparable to the pain of being ghosted. Also, it may have some health issues so she should go and get checked by the doctor if a hygiene is on point.
Do it girlfriend to girlfriend "gonna go see the cooch doc. I'm kinda itchy and I think I smell funny... Wanna book at the same time? We can do a morning appt and go get lunch before going back to the office!"

If she refuses, then your gonna need to either be direct and upfront or just leave it alone.
As a girl with a coochie I would know if mine smelled anything other than nothing, it's like water got no smell no flavor ! So how does one not know that it's rotting down there ?
Tell her you want to platonically eat her out as a friend and then when you do tell her “oh girl I think your PH levels are a bit off might want to consider consulting your doctor”
Just tell her you've noticed a bit of an odour and that you think she should go to the doctor because she may need antibiotics.
You don’t need to solve all her problems. Her smelly cooch is just the one guys opinion. If you say something don’t extrapolate it to the other guy who ghosted her. Girls notice these things. If her vag smelled so bad you probably would have picked up on it at some point. It could be that she’s a dead lay. It could be that any number of things. Maybe the coworker has a little dick and she said something. He may have made it up something rather than admit the truth. Maybe she has herpes or warts and she hasn’t clued you in to that because she’s embarrassed and yall aren’t having sex. She can figure it out. She probably knows but would rather deny it than admit to you. Forcing the issue could be backing her into a corner. If she has a skanky scent and has heard it more than once she knows. If she hasn’t been motivated to solve the problem yet, I can’t imagine you telling her is going to motivate her. Don’t set her up. Just listen and be a good friend. It just doesn’t mean you have to solve this mystery.
Put a sticky note on her desk that says

"You have a stinky coochie"
If you wanna be less direct then make it about you. Ask her to recommend you an intimate gel wash cause you are not longer satisfied with the one you use. Ask her if she ever tried any treatment for bacterial infection because you think you have one and you are scared that it might make your husband not go down on you again. This might trigger her to check herself too if you fell such talks can't really take place because she's maybe shy or not the type of person to speak of this. Or maybe say you got a free STI test pack and you want to go together to get checked. (you can buy it for her, she doesn't have to know) 

Never overestimate the amount of sexual health education anyone has had. Maybe her parents never taught her proper care and hygiene nor was she prompted to search for it. Being very straightforward, telling someone you know from one of her one night stands that spoke to your husband that she has a vaginal issue can make a person shut down for ever and not trust any future sexual partners.

Reddit is a very sex positive community, sometimes we forget that a lot of people are not as curious, open, exploring and comfortable with sex talk as we might be. Sometimes the long approach with non obvious ways is better.
Lol all these men. Ok to have a go at the buffet despite the stank. But no second helpings.lol
I could recommend you do it in the worst way possible. I'd probably have a laugh about it if I received anything similar.

Give her the old serial killer letter special.

Cut out letters from a whole bunch of magazines to spell out on that piece of paper that her cooch stanks. Slip it in her mailbox without any identifiers at night. 

Assuming she doesn't have any cameras, you've both told her anonymously and made her take things seriously enough to do something about it.



Again, probably a really horrible idea, but I could definitely see my best friend doing something like this with me should it be necessary to help me. I mean, he used to break into my house and take selfies on my phone just to mess with me, so...
I'll be honest, with the friends I have, there would be no issue with me going "Girl it's cause your coochie stank. I can't tell you if that's true or not cause I'm not in your buisness but I will say that's what I've heard."

Five years ago my friend had a baby and was literally, with consent, sending me pictures of her coochie because she was concerned about her delivery stitches being infected but couldn't really see them.

But again, that's just me and my personal friendships are and I don't know what yours is exactly like.

If you guys aren't "Send me pictures of your incision," close I'd take a couple other folks advice and just start nit picking over every single issue it could be. 

Too be perfectly canded though, if her coochie stanks that badly there's no way she doesn't know unless it's been that way for so long she's gone nose blind to it.
I would just be like “dude, something is going on with me down there” and just make it out like you’re pretty much dealing with the same issue she is and maybe she will be like “holy shit, me too” and then you guys can figure it out together.
Nothing like a stanky cooch to bring two people closer together I always say…
\*\*DON'T\*\* tell her that your hub's coworker and him were talking about her stank ass cooch and then he came home and told you. She will never get over the humiliation and you'll lose a friend. Maybe make up a story about how something like this happened to you once and you realized what it was and went to the doctor to get it checked out. If she does nothing about her putrid punani after that, dust your hands with her and be done with this dirty bitch. Can you really wanna be friends with someone who doesn't wash her vag?
I would've flat out told her. Hey I heard a possible reason. I would maybe make an appointment with your obgyn. Can't call yourself a friend if you can't tell her what it is bluntly. I know it hurts telling her. But it's going to hurt her more and you knowing that you knew and she has no idea and keeps going through men. And let's be honest no man has the balls to tell a woman she stinks.
She might not understand how to properly clean herself and maybe she has bacterial vaginosis idk but she may be just nose blind to her condition or think it’s normal to smell foul
You could tell her you’ve been having hygiene problems, and they are super common and maybe she should get checked out too just in case
Suggest she go to the Dr. and get it checked out. She sounds like she gets around.
Just say it. Truth be told and it doesn't need to be pussy footed lol
I feel like if I was in the position of your bestie, I'd want to know with brutal honesty 😂
shes probably suffering more getting ghosted and sadder about it then she will be if you just tell her. if you tell her directly shell be upset obviously but youll save her tons of future disappointment insecurity and anxiety.
Get some random to text her that she has a stinky cooch.
Oh man. This is soooo awkward. Like.. Ugh. Honestly I would probably say, "When I have been ghosted I start wondering what it could be..like maybe my breath stank, I wasn't that great in bed, I didn't shower thoroughly enough beforehand? So next time, I make sure I floss and bring Tic-Tacs for after dinner, try to be extra enthusiastic, and I make sure to really make sure I'm clean and fresh, haha! I know it sucks to have to wonder what's wrong with you, but I mean, just do everything you can to make sure you're as desirable as possible, this man-centered world requires such things 😠.. There's really no easy way. 
Unless you're bold enough to just say, "Look, babes. I love you so much, I know that there are things I'd want to know if I were you. So I have to tell you something that's gonna suck, but benefit you to know in the long run...." and maybe end it with telling her your chosen body wash or something, bc you want to save her any future pain.. (before people jump on me yes I know the vagina is self-cleaning, not advising to use body wash there, but the outer parts definitely aren't and I bet that's what this girl isn't washing thoroughly or often enough..)
Tell her, it will suck but will also help her in the long run
Tell her
I'm sure she's well aware of the smell if others are
Just be straight with her. If I had a body odor that I wasn’t aware of, I rather someone just give it to me straight. Might feel embraced and mad, but at least I’m aware I got a medical issue I can deal with.
lol personally It would be a good friend if u tell her so she can clean up her self n act
Here is my advice: 

Hey best friend, your coochie may have an infection of some sort. Perhaps an undetected yeast infection. Ya see, this is what’s happening. Then slide into figuring out if there is something wrong down there or if she is just not cleaning well enough.  Good luck.  Remember you’re best friends, and best friends tell each other everything, no secrets, no remorse.
Dude just tell her. Don't do any of this waffling about, just pull her to the side and let her know.
She’s a grown adult so be honest. Just say listen I heard that your coochie has some stank and it could be a medical issue that needs treatment. If she’s having sex with multiple people she could have an sti. If she gets upset that’s on her you’re being a good friend. Tell her what she needs to hear. It may hurt to hear it but she needs to hear it. Don’t beat around the bush about it.
Ik that these things can be awkward and embarrassing but if I was that friend and my friend told me.. ofc I’d feel embarrassed but so thankful that I now know why.
heres what you do, give it to her straight. remind her shes beautiful and its no testament to her character, and that its ok but yk how do we fix this !
This is definitely a tricky situation because you truly do want to be able to make sure you don’t upset her. I’d say on your phone if you have notes try typing several different ways to let her know then pick the one that sounds like it would be easier to tell her
Girl, it's your bestie you need to be honest with her. I know it's not easy and you don't wanna offend her but honestly I'd tell the truth gently.


Edit: "omg dude I started using this new soap on my coochie and ___ can't get enough of me I shower with it everyday check it out!" And hand her a bar of soap that looks feminine. If that doesn't help she prob needs to see a doctor for antibiotics.
Such a difficult one; you’re sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place. One way or another you’re going to have to lie to her - if you don’t tell her then you are lying by omission; if she finds out about the odour comments from someone else and asks if you knew you’re going to have to lie and say No or she’s going to be hurt that you didn’t tell her.

Obviously being tactful is the number one priority but I think you need to be honest (with a little embellishment). Perhaps visit her at home and tell her you have something delicate you need to say. “Hubby ran into ‘John’ today and while they were talking he told him it wasn’t very nice of him to ghost you and John said it was very awkward but he had noticed a very unusual odour from your private parts and he didn’t want to upset you by saying anything. Personally I think that’s a dick move and it could be a lame excuse but (white lie coming) I have had an infection before and didn’t even know until my hubby said something. I went to my gyno and it was sorted out really quickly. Apparently it’s way more common than we realise. It might be worth you getting it checked out just in case.”
If she’s a good friend, tell her outright, no beating around the bush. She would rather hear it from you than from a guy
I mean if something like this happened to me and my friend knew the reason, I'd want to know. Just be mindful with your wording and clarify that you are saying this because you care and that it is not the end of the world, but rather something fixable, probably with medical attention.
My man said he used to hook up with a girl who had to take meds for her stuff bc it smelled so bad.  They didn’t last too long. I mean my question is - how is she unaware of her predicament? Can’t most of us tell when things are getting gamey?
I’d be more hurt that people knew but didn’t tell me! 
I don’t know how she doesn’t know she smells though
How close are you and your husband to his coworker? 

Could you and/or your husband convince the coworker to be man enough to have an adult conversation with her and be honest about why he is no longer interested?  

He has left you in a really shitty position. If he has any respect for either of you he wouldn’t simply ghost her like that.
Play the long game:
1. Watch a video on YouTube about stinky vaginas and bring it up with her, also make sure the videos include PH strips and vagina perfume. Or BV, yeast infections. 
2. Maybe I can ask my husband to ask his coworker you went out with. Wait a couple days, be direct and say “he mentioned that your vagina smells a little off. 
3. Bring vagina probiotics, idk if this is helpful I’m not a doctor 

Or: just tell her. Say something along the lines of I didn’t know how to bring this up with you but my husbands coworker said your vagina stinks. Maybe you can make a doctors appointment and make sure everything is okay down there.
Just tell her!
I would pull her aside and let her know as that could be a sign she has a infection. I would not let her know it is why she was ghosted. you don;t know if that is why the second man.But, for her own health find a means to bring it up. If she is sexually more active sometimes a lil coochie  stank from more bacteria getting down there happens. just gotta wash yourself more.I bet some of those dudes might not think to wash thy from under cheese out enough.

I would also, to comfort/support maybe put together a lil self care package designed to give ehr an at home spa day. a bubblebath, a bath and body works set, scented candle, face mask, PH balancing soap that matches the other scents, face mask and maybe a bottle of her favorite wine with snacks. that way every single part of her from her bum to her tum is taken care of. if she went to the doctors for help, could even help her get her prescriptions if she does need any.

it is normal for some stank to come. it get sweaty down there.
Anonymous note. This is the only way
When someone figures out a good way to say it, let me know… so I can tell my wife the same thing.  It’s rancid smelling.
As someone who used to have bacterial vaginosis, that’s probably what it is. But also please tell her in a nice way. Although the guys she was with really should have brought it up (nicely) versus ghosting her, if no one is, it’s best to tell her.
A bad smell is typically a sign of a bacterial infection (and not bad hygiene). 

Maybe this makes it easier to tell her? The best would be if you could somehow see her in her undies  and casually mention it (maybe lie to say you've had it to soften the blow). Can you go clothes shopping or swimming or something?

I think she'd rather hear it from a friend directly than through a friend's boyfriends grapevine. That is just degrading.
I’d want to know if I were her. Be kind. Tell her you know why and be honest and nice about it. No making fun. It happens to everyone at some point.
How about telling her that you went through a time several years ago when your coochie smelled bad and give her some tips that your other friend gave to you to alleviate this problem. Do you think that would work?
Heard about this exact situation two other times in my life, both from guy friends who did the ghosting post-coitus. They never said anything to her, but really should have. There is a way to do so with tact and respect for the person. I would want to know. I'd be embarrassed, for sure, but I'd want to know if I smelled so bad that people rejected me.
First try to not make it personal. “I’ve read than men prefer a really high level of hygiene down there, and if they think you’re even the slightest big smelly they quickly lose interest. You do shower before each date don’t you as they might be put off by a muff that’s not been washed that day”.  Something like that.
Just tell her. As a friend it’s your job to break all news to your friend, even the hard stuff. It all depends on how you approach it.
Tell her you learned the coworker's had gonorrhea in the past and encourage her to get tested for STDs. This sounds like an infection issue.
What if you said something like hey I found this product that’s made a difference for me blah blah blah and thought you might like it too. That might take away that embarrassment for her
If you can’t bring yourself to directly tell her, you could casually ask what she eats and mention that it can impact her smell?
As a man, I would want you to approach me in a humorous way, not being serious about it. I dont know how women are about that stuff. Just let her know a few guys have told you.
I would never be able to have this conversation and tell her directly. What I would do is ask for advice for me. Like tell her exactly what you think she has about yourself. If it's that smelly it might very well be a bacterial vaginosis or a fungai and she needs to take care of it. So you can say you feel itchy and that your coochie smells and if that ever happened to her and how did she handle it. Then it might occur to her that she has that.
Upvoting for use of the term “stinky coochie” 

Is her sniffer out of order?? I’m a dude but when I start to get the LEAST bit of ball soup I can smell it. I wouldn’t bring it up in relation to the guys ghosting her, but I would maybe tell her about some new soap you got that smells super good and you think she should take some and try it.
Needs a pelvic exam. Maybe start a conversation about routine Well Woman Exam (WWE) and how often they are recommended, and when was her last? Wouldn’t be surprised if she had an old tampon wedged up behind her cervix.  In my experience, women seek out treatment for malodorous discharge, so sounds like something else going on here.
You should preface the conversation very lightly by saying something along the lines of " do you have any routine that you go through before your date?" 

Then maybe you could ask about shaving and then transition to other hygiene habits
No conversation has to be uncomfortable if you use tact
Also, she may have an underlying medical concern and not know it. Being honest is always the best way. Even if it’s uncomfortable.
How does she not catch a whiff of herself and realize that's why she's getting ghosted? I mean, if a guy can smell it, she definitely can too. I'd be trying to turn that stench into a sweet aroma ASAP. It’s like a bad sitcom episode: "The Case of the Mystery Odor!" Honestly, if I were in her shoes, I'd want my friend to just tell me straight up. Sure, I'd turn beet red, but it's crazier to walk around clueless about my own funk!
Send her an anonymous email. Let her figure out who’s sending it. Make a new email account if you don’t already have an anonymous one.
Im very good at delivering bad news; send me your friend’s contact info and tell me your first n last name initials: boom! Fixed someone’s life juss like that
are you really her “best” friend??  

a BEST friend would take control of situation and confront their best friend about it all. for health reasons, obviously. but to save her reputation.
Ph balanced soaps for intimate areas can help.
Surely to God she knows that her pussy stinks. Unless she just thinks that's how it's supposed to smell?
just tell her. why do people make communicating so difficult
This. Is a lot. 😳
This. Is a lot. 😳
She can clear a whole village with her stank
Tell her, be honest so she can improve the situation. 

Could go get checked for bacterial vaginosis, possibly she isn’t washing her panties well enough so they have lingering smell. She could not be practicing proper hygiene. cleaning downstairs properly with mild soap. maybe she isn’t drying off enough and constantly sitting in wet and and warm cloths.
Anonymous letter in mail from an “ex”.
Did she forget to take out a tampon?
Just say it.

It will be done then.  No matter how upset she is, if you are a real friend you’ll just lay it out there.
It's possible she has a lost tampon. She may even have noticed the smell herself. Maybe tell her a story you read about. Here's the story: a woman discovered that a tampon had become lost in her uterus because of a stench. She didn't understand where the smell was coming from so she went on telehealth and described it to her doctor who told her that occasionally a string will fall off a tampon and that while a woman might think that she had already taken it out because of that, the tampon would be floating away in there. He advised her to get into the tub with some warm water and to squat and push as hard as she could. In disbelief she did as instructed and was horrified when a stringless tampon came out with a horrible smell. The doctor advised her to then soak in a warm bath with a cup of white vinegar added to eliminate any smell. 
I read this in a woman's health magazine a while back. I think if you relay this to her, she might come to the conclusion herself.
Ignore everyone here telling you to tell her to her face. Send an anonymous note, pretend it was a previous lover and that's that
If I was her I'd want to know but I know some people who will be offended if you tell them.  It really depends on what type of person she is.  Would she have taken the red pill or blue pill in the Matrix? lol...
Find a way to get her to an obgyn and the problem should solve itself
Not an advice though a question; what, when, or how is a coochie "stinky"?? Because I don't know if I actually have stinky coochie or if it's just normal genital smell.
This is why telling the truth is important.

Everyone keeps ghosting or pussyfooting around.

Who will help her?
Literally just say, ur pussy stanks
It could be caused by a ph imbalance after sex/cum as well. Some people just get that after sex. Either way, I'd bring it up to her and suggest having her see a Dr to figure out what's going on down there.
My sister keeps getting UTIs over and over, yet she’s a neat freak.  Showers every day, washes (front to back) with wipes after every bathroom visit, etc.

I feel so bad for her like, she just got another right after getting rid of one a week ago! 

Her doctor is puzzled.
Can we combine this scenario with all of the questions about whether or not one apartment neighbor should leave another apartment neighbor a challenging/uncomfortable note?

Maybe just leave her an anon note from one of her apartment neighbors?
Definitely talk to her as it may be an easy fix. May be yeast, may be trichomonas, etc. Sometimes just being aware of your underwear material choices can help.
Tell her. Also gf had this until she stopped using bar soap. Or vice versa idk which one. But it could be the soap
Gift her some lume, tell her u love it so much you just HAD to share it, then gush about how amazing it is
My recent ex gf who was also 23-24 had this. It was so bad at one point where you could smell her across the room when she opened her legs and I first noticed when I smelled her on myself going to take a shower after intercourse and after that couldn’t get the smell out of my head. She was depressed and her hygiene was terrible would only shower every 3-4 days. It was a sensitive topic but I had to bring it up and she was very very embarrassed and upset when I did but was glad I said something. People in here saying they can’t smell themselves are incorrect, it was literally 10 feet across the room bad smell. She said she knew it smelled and was trying all the different ways to get it clean herself. It could have also been me as I sweat a lot at work and should probably have showered before intimacy. Live and learn. She went to the doctor tho and they gave her some medication and stuff for BV and she had some utis as well quite a few times. If you’re her best friend just say something. I’d want my buddy to tell me if I smelled like BO after he set me up on a date with a hotty where in my head the date went well but then I get ghosted after.. and all my friends would tell me immediately lol men don’t beat around the bush.
I just want to say a little boric acid before and after your period helps to maintain a healthy non stinky cooch.
If other people can smell it, she can too. Trust me. She knows. It may be mortifying now that YOU know. But she already knows.
She needs to know. She probably needs probiotics to improve the smell of her coochie.

It's not natural, otherwise reproduction would not happen.
tbh, you’re such a good friend for this lol
I'm sorry, but I have to say: this reminds me of the New Girl scene where Jess and Nick are talking about Cece's popcorn maker/coochie. Jess promises if it gets to smelling too bad, she'd let her know herself.
Those guys might be throwing her PH off.
If she’s okay when they aren’t having sex then the men are the issue.

Probably hooking up with other men
Tell her about a post you saw about a girl who kept getting ghosted and come to find out it was because she had BV. 

Then say, “I wonder…is your ph balance good? Because I remembered those guys ghosting and I know how finicky ph balance is. I used to wear tight pants and that threw mine completely off and I needed antibiotics”
Some women don't wipe after they pee, and that has a bad smell. I can always tell if someone doesn't wipe. if it's not an infection issue, it might be a hygiene issue.
Definitely tell her but let her know she’s not alone and she’s just a woman and it happens then inform her that our lady parts are pretty sensitive and everybody’s can react differently, tight clothing, body soap, and even perfumes/lotion. Also as human whatever we consume comes out through us naturally so if we eat a lot of meat and salty/smelly foods our sweat/ PH smell will most likely be affected by this.
Could be vaginosis or vaginitis.
It happens with a lot of women and men should be more knowledgeable about a women’s body. It doesn’t mean they are dirty. She most likely has BV and just needs antibiotics or tell her to go buy boric acid suppositories
My brother's friends in high school used to say "If it smells like fish, clean the dish. If it smells like cologne, leave it alone." I always thought that was backwards, but I guess then it wouldn't rhyme?!
Not that any of them smelled either one back then, but they talked a good game. :)
Just anonymously post her some bv cream or some ph balance stuff or whatever you can get to help her. Leave a little note and say im sorry x
My best friend and I must be really weird cause if this scenario happened, I’d just say to her, “bitch, he told me you gotta stank coochie. Go get yo ass to the gyno.” She’d say the same exact thing to me. We call each other bitch, hoe, slut, so it’s normal. Is that normal? I guess it’s a term of endearment. 

Also, do men not realize we piss from there? Like it’s gonna have a smell to it unless we literally just got out the shower. Just like how dicks never smell good either if they didn’t just get outta the shower.
Telling her to eat a serving of yogurt daily wouldn’t hurt.
That’s your bestie ? Stop beating around the bush and tell her her coochie stank, I mean shit if it’s that bad then she already knows and is playing dumb and as a dude that disrespectful af and is why she’s getting ghosted 🗣️
As a BFF, just swallow hard and tell her the truth. All you're doing is relating information from reliable sources.

And whether it's a medical condition or personal hygiene, this problem is fixable.

No one ever died of embarrassment. But plenty of people have died of loneliness.
Put it on the guy and let him be thought of as the a-hole. He already ghosted, what's a little more hate? "He told my bf that the pink is full of stink. Get ye to the doctor with haste!"
I would want to know. It would be uncomfortable for everyone but tell her.
It might not be hygiene related and coups be a health issue instead.  I would tell her and suggest her to schedule doctors/gyno appt.
Tell her that you’ve been speaking to your OB and bring up ph balances ask her if she’s ever looked into it. If she ask why just tell her some negative side effects that could affect any woman.
Only time I declined intercourse with someone was when I could smell her through her yoga pants when were were doing foreplay.

If she's your friend tell her like it's what you've heard.
I'll be honest I wouldn't have any idea how to handle this situation either and would probably just tell her, like 'hey, I'm not sure if this has been the problem for dudes in the past, but I was told that x was having an issue with intimacy because when you spent the night he could smell you and it wasn't good'. "Have you been having problems with any yeast or bladder infections, did you wash the sheets or wear clean underwear?" You don't want to make her feel like it's a personal defect within her, the above reasons will help keep her from overly identifying the problem, while offering solutions of what it could be. Now, this isn't fool proof, she's feeling raw and could still react poorly or lash out. You don't necessarily have to babysit her especially if she starts going overboard toward you, but understand that no matter how nice you give her the news that doesn't mean she's going to take it well and she doesn't have to (within reason), but as her friend you do owe her the kindness of telling her gently, just because she'll take it bad no matter what doesn't give you the license to be cruel with this information.
Just tell her and save her future heartache!
Ultimate girls girl is telling friend the incomfortable truth.
No matter how you dice it, this is a sticky situation.  Best to be blunt about it.  They'll be mad but genital hygiene is super important.
Try to just be like hey girl I been using boric acid & probiotic suppositories it’s really been making me feel super fresh down there. You can just tell her subtly or be a girls girl n pull the bandage off just make sure to use the right words maybe not mention the word has gotten around but yeah we’re all human if they can smell it I’m sure she can too probably don’t know what to do about it.
The real problem is the men not telling her about it because like sometimes i can see how it is genuinely a problem and how it can effect relationships because there is definitely stuff you can do about it
Maybe put it in another way LIKE “GIRL, I just started using these boric acid suppositories and it’s been a life changer, my husband LOVES how it’s affected our sex life cause it gets me more wet, & I’ve had zero issues with UTIs, yeast infections, etc. and hand her a bottle of em and tell her to try them 2x a week” lmfao that’s what I would do.
If the smell is that pungent, it’s likely BV or an STI/STD


You could suggest she get tested or go to a woman’s clinic, because this indicates some sort of bacterial infection
"Hey, after this recent ghoasting, I pressed xxx ( husband friend) abit more and he said yo pussy stink, I'm sorry this is embarrassing for both of us to talk about, but I would want to know if it was me"

I'm a dude and I would want to know if I had a stinky dick
She needs medical help. Obgyn can assist. Is she getting annual exams?
How does she not know it stinks down there? Anytime something is a bit off for me I can tell right away wth
This happened to a friend of mine. I just said I found a new soap for my lady garden and it works amazing. No soreness or ph changes. She now has her cooch mooched on the regular now
Let her put 2 and 2 together on her own. You can set this up by purposely bending down to pick something up in-front of her and saying something like “hey.. you kind of have a smell going on, everything ok?”
If you are a true friend you will tell her. I would NEVER let my friends walk around stinking badly and then not tell them??? If you can smell it, so can everyone else. Be the friend you wish they were. Would you wanna walk around smelling like bad BO or like fish while everyone can smell you and talk about it behind your back when nobody tells you directly? 

TELL HER. She deserves to know. People don’t smell their own body smells, not like you do. 

If it smells fishy she might have a bacterial infection, if it smells ‘strong’ it might be a fungal infection, if it smells dirty she might not wash properly. Either way, she deserves to know and you are a bad friend if you do not tell her
Sorry, not sorry. But you are not her friend. Can’t be. I could imagine not telling my friend and/or helping her out. Or my friend not telling me and/or policemen’s me out because the situation may be cause embarrassment. Nasty work. That’s crazy that people use the world friend so loosely. It’s ok to be embarrassed, it’s ok to have uncomfortable conversations. I’d understand more if y’all were children but yall are adults. Why are adults shying away from having uncomfortable conversations with friends.

Makes me sad for people who have “friends” like this☹️
Hahahahaha this is hilarious. 
Well first off: 






>My husband’s coworker told my husband that she has a stinky coochie.






This game of telephone is why I'd never have a friends significant other set me up haha. 






On a serious note though, you now know. Maybe you could just recommend it on a while list of other things just so you don't make it obvious.
You have to tell her. It’ll be awkward, but it’s what a true friend does. She’s going to continuously be hurt by ghosting and losing more and more confidence every time. You’d be doing her a huge solid by laying down the facts. Also, if she smells that bad but only when the underwear come off, seems like something medical. You’d also be doing her a health solid
 I had a co worker who everyone was calling musty , I just decided to tell him what I heard , i didnt tell him who I heard it from , but smell is something fixable id rather tell you so you can correct it than have everyone laughing at you behind your back
Jus buy her a douche for Christmas, birthday, thanksgiving, Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday, Easter,, halloween,
You should tell her. It's your duty as her friend. If this was me I'd want to know. She might be mad at first, but hopefully after awhile she'll calm down,  relax and come up with plan to render the situation 
Reading these comments just put me back in high school! She sat on my knee and all I could smell was shrimp boat and battery acid! Like it’s engraved in my smell memory like a dead body🤢
Be upfront as it may be an infection
I definitely think this is the best route to go. “I know this might be a little uncomfortable to discuss, but X said this, and it might be why other people have ghosted too. I think you should see the doctor since it could be a really easy fix and is really common” 

Approaching it like you’re just informing/discussing and not judging/shaming is key with uncomfortable conversations. True friends can have these kinds of conversations. 

If she gets upset, it’s only because she’s embarrassed. Just reiterate that it happens to the best of us and now she’ll have less of a ghosting streak (hopefully)
A good friend is the one that gives tough love. Looks like OP's friend really needs it. The smell might be even an underlying health problem as well.
Agreed. Just be honest. And a true friend. The truth hurts sometimes. At least this is fixable with medication and actual proper hygiene.
I would change "I'm just passing on what I heard" to "I care about you and thought that telling you what I've been told honored our friendship and was in your best interest".
_I'm your friend and please don't be hurt at what I'm about to say, it's only because I care about you..._
This is the best advice. Your adult friends and this kind of difficult conversation will be the most productive.
Yep this is the best advice. It is totally awkward and this is difficult to avoid but as long as you are kind then it will be ok. 

You could say it happens to you sometimes and you have found x thing helpful (not sure what? Femfresh maybe even if not recommended) so that she doesn’t feel on her own and say she can always see a doctor. I would keep it pretty light, but really it’s no different than talking about periods I feel. 
Have her OBGYN test for BV, super common and easy to treat.
The smell could imply some disease, so it's important she knows this
No, no lies, no tipping around the subject, no ‘I heard it from xyz’. She SMELLS the smell on her, she KNOWS why, she needs to say something. If she can smell it when not close to her vulva in any way, other people also smell it. She needs to be a friend to her and tell her the truth. Yes she can say it nicely, but she shouldn’t lie. She can smell it so she should say so. If she makes it seem like people only do it when they are near her vulva, not onky can that make her more self concious, it can make her just stop seeking out romance and not do anything about the problem thinking nobody will know, while they do in fact already know. 

It’s a normal thing that 1 in 3 women go through in their lifetime and it should be treated as such. It’s not embarrassing and we should tell people when they smell. People don’t smell it themselves. They should hear it directly. A good friend tells people to their faces
I would start it with a heartfelt 'I love you very much, and I think you may have some kind of imbalance or medical issue that is getting in the way of you finding love.'
emphasize that you're not making fun, NOR would you breathe a word to anyone
Rather, invite your friend to a Brazilian wax session under the pretext of easing off her mind. Then, stay quiet and feign outrage and confusion once the Beautician pukes all over said funky coochie after your friend undresses and lets her decomposing/rotting kitty on the loose.
Agree, the compassionate thing to do is to tell her. But lord OP pls do it not in public and when no one else is remotely around even in another room nearby. And preface with the fact that you obv have no idea/are not trying to discern whether he is right and you aren’t judging — you’re telling her bc you would want to know (privately) even if it hurts to hear initially. You’re going to have to figure out how to make sure she’s not embarrassed around your boyfriend in the future knowing that he knows though.
And wipe front to back - there are a lot of women who don’t realize that wiping wrong can cause yeast infections and BV along with UTIs and other infections.  Thong underwear and ineffective cleaning after pooping can cause this, too.
Ever since I learned that I had BV 10 years ago, I want to stand on a rooftop and tell every woman I know about it. It’s so common but so embarrassing to have, because you think that there’s something really wrong with you, and no matter how many times you bathe or clean yourself up the smell doesn’t go away. Once I finally told a doctor about it…one course of medication completely eliminated it, and I’ve never had it again. 

Some people say no soap on your vagina (by vagina I mean labia), but I think a mild antibacterial soap is fine on the outside. Definitely no soap on the inside of your vagina. I also rinse really well with the shower hose front and back to make sure there’s no soap or anything left over. Wipe front to back. Dry really well after a shower. Clean underwear before bed. Wash your toys after every use.
What's BV?
Please soap your lady parts, just dont put soap UP INTO YOUR VAGINA. This is why vagueness regarding female anatomy is a problem.
BV can also be caused by an incorrectly placed IUD! I know from experience lol
Yes, I was thinking this. Could also be ureaplasma which is super common. It's also not something routinely checked for unless you specifically ask them to.
Highly recommend adding a bidet or water wipes after BMs too, my recurrent BV went away as soon as I stopped using dry wipes for poops.
Boric acid suppositories are wonderful! Odor gone!
No soap on the vulva is just wrong. Do your pits come clean with just water? Mine don't.
Yup. My first that was yeast infection or UTI.
the pun was definitely intended lol
I wouldn't do this. It's probably just going to make her overthink and assume it's things it's not.
I don’t think this is a bad idea in theory, but if the person in question is just completely ignorant to their own smell and hygiene, they’re probably not going to give that possibility a second glance
It’s likely not a matter of hygiene, though. She needs to see a doctor and take antibiotics.
This might be horrible for her self esteem. “Let’s list every unlovable thing about you that’s driving people away!”
I've literally done this exact thing for both male and female friends 🥲😭😅

It's the only thing I know of to do outside of flatout being like, "ya snatch ain't snatchin."
Some people (guys included) don't take subtle hints about hygene.. I have a Co Worker Ive hinted at that needed more regular bathing and deodorant and the message doesn't seems to land and the "lightbulb" never turns on. It's not a fun topic but some people need a more blunt approach. It can still be done with kindness, it's just not an easy subject to break.
That is way too indirect and roundabout. It could lead to it happening again multiple times, because even if she had the list, there would be no telling exactly what thing on the list was causing her to be ghosted. That could result in the friend being overly critical of herself and paranoid. A good friend would never do this.
Hmmmm. I dont know about this one. As a woman, I would think something was fishing when this topic came up. And she probably isn't aware and is going to say she is fine then the friend must move on. Is she going to ask for a smell or a little nibble? Likely not. Too much Tricky McTricksterson
This is definitely the best way and I hope everyone upvotes it. 

Girlfriends do talk. 

Bring up BG and also discuss seeing her obgyn in general. If it’s this bad, the obgyn can help.

>Bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis often produce a fishy or chemical odor, while a forgotten tampon may begin to smell of rot.
I disagree, why waste time when you already know the reason and make her overthink things that don't even matter or other stuff she doesn't feel comfortable sharing. Tell her directly, no messing around
This sounds like a good idea and be like" well girl if its after sex like you sure ya shit dont stank does it" ? Lol
Most causes of a smelly vag are not hygiene related though.
I think this is good, but instead from suggesting what the issue might be (“I think you have..”), replace with (“you may want to see a gyno and get checked for BV”). Let’s not diagnose anyone.
“Hey you have BV and you need help” perfect
I had an ex who had a very smelly cooch. It wasn't BV. She had just never been taught how to wash right. I honestly wish I could remember how I brought it up. It was awkward. But infinitely less awkward bc we were dating as opposed to just friends, and I think I suggested showering together. Anyway, my point is, it's not always BV. (I'm a girl too. This isn't some weird misogynistic anti-natural-vag-smell thing. I know what's normal, and this was rank.)
"Hey stinkpuss, go see a doctor. You've got BV and need antibiotics."
Doesn't mean it's definitely BV, could be trichomonas
You don’t just have BV and not know it. The smell is a symptom but only one of many. There’s also pain and crazy gross discharge. It’s unlikely this poor girl has BV and is just going about her life unaware. 

Maybe she has a slight pH issue that is causing a smell. I had a friend who juat constantly smelled like vag. Always. Sitting next to her you could smell it. So strong. She’d become accustom. Someone eventually told her (complained to HR actually - brutal), and she went to the doc. He said because her endometriosis caused extra long periods (13ish days of bleeding), the blood had altered her pH and created a chronic smell. She had endo treatment and it helped a lot. 

Point is, your friend needs to be diagnosed by a doctor, not Reddit.
“The only thing going down in this car is the window ‘cause your pussy stank”. - BHG
It depends...if the guy's  head is anywhere near it (big head) then they have already committed this far and resurfacing would be a dead giveaway that something is wrong and they cancelled the mission.... sometimes they do a teardrop motion to check things out  before proceeding too.
It's possible that there wasn't an odor until the deed was in progress. 

I have had that happen once.
Maybe they dont smell it til they pull out. 🫠
Yes, I have committed to acts of sex I didn’t really want to do because I figured it would be better to deal with it than go “this is gross” and leave
AND then talk about her behind her back...  And her "best friend" is too much of a coward to say something without a pow wow on reddit.  This chick has shitty people around her.
Unfortunately i have encountered such and i have a remarkably bad sense of smell. I didnt realize it until after it was over. God just thinking of the smell i tried to get off my hands. I washed my hands 4 times and it still wouldn’t come off. Whats worse is a friend of ours gave them something to put on her vagina to make it smell less and she gave it back unused.  At some point i think people with a bad smell know it.
I don’t think most women would take it well if you just stopped right before the act
Yep, You just have to man up, and hold your breath. 
Boric acid suppositories are a godsend, I use them because my pH gets messed up after my period and they work wonders!
I am not one to venture outside of dr prescribed meds.  

Boric acid was a godsend.  I would buy the capsules and the boric acid and make the little capsules.  They worked like a charm.  I would insert at night and wear a panty liner.  

Eventually my balance normalized and I haven’t had to use them in years.  But I always knew when something was going haywire and I would need to do the boric acid treatment. 

Edit: I also don’t know if I had BV, I don’t think so. I always treated when I had the start of what I thought was a yeast infection.

Doesn't boric acid kill roaches?
Came to suggest these too. Boric acid suppositories make life so much easier.
Start with a story about your own experience with that to dim the spotlight on her own situation. I don't know why those dudes couldn't just say something. I mean, I know why, but they are boys for that
Lucky you!!!
I can confirm... Germans don't give af.... But I'm only half German...
Yes, I’d want my best friend to tell me!! I do wonder though, is BV not something everyone can smell on themselves???
She doesn't know what a best friend is.  Had to wait for the second ghosting and gossiping with hubby first.  Then take it to reddit.  omg...
You made me laugh so hard, and i haven't even had coffee yet!
"Your minge stinks!" Much better.
This is the most solid and well thought-out advice for this situation! OP I hope you take this one.
I would rather have my feelings hurt ten times over than walk around stinky.  But then I have been sniffing mine since I was a teen then cleaning well!
Easier said than done. Very touchy subject for women
I have a a beautiful, wonderful friend who has nose hairs coming out of her nose.  Can’t she see them or her husband? The woman who gives me my facials said I should give her a gift card to pay her a visit!
I agree, what a pussy.
Stank coochie has been an insult for hundreds of years. Same with small dick. The accusation is always suspect.
Yeah it might be this. I see a lot of comments about it being BV but I don't think it smells anywhere near bad enough where multiple men would be dumping her right after. But I've smelt someone that unknowingly had chlamydia and it smelt fucking horrible. It was like a dumpster smell, and it stunk up the whole room. But there's also a chance she doesn't clean herself properly or wipe well enough after pooping though.
I imagine the conversation went like this:

OP's husband: "Hey, man. My wife tells me that you ghosted her friend after your date. Did something go wrong?"

Coworker: "It's just that, and I don't mean to sound rude or anything, but she kind of smelled down there."

OP's husband: "Oh, shit. Really? Damn, I should probably tell my wife about this."
Probably nothing. The other guy mentioned her one-time date. That does not mean her husband discusses his wife.
Why is everyone saying “down there?”  I taught 8th grade science for years and got the kids to call body parts by there correct terms.
No. People absolutely cannot smell themselves. Or whatever theyve been living with for a while. If something rots in your living room and you ignore it, after a couple of days you won’t smell it anymore.

That’s how people with pets get stinky houses. Thats how people with bad breath have no clue about it.
☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽 not bad advice.
I'd do this OP, especially your friend as you say.
Dayum. How cringe for everyone involved. 😬
That’s sad.  I should not drop you like a hot potato just because you told me to see the dentist.  

That’s sad he didn’t get it taken care of
Unclean dicks can cause a lot of trouble down there. Unwashed hands as well. Good point. That stuff gets glossed over way too much.
Anyone but the woman’s fault right?
Doesn’t seem like that applies here though, girl just needs to learn how to wash her cooter better
People get used to the smells they're around all the time. Like animal odor, you get used to it until you're around an animal you aren't usually around
You + are = you’re.  As a friend!😁
Quite the avoidant personality you have. That must have felt cathartic
I feel like this is dancing around the issue and not likely to work. Better to be direct, but tactfully. Friend may get really pissed if you try to do it this way and she finds out you’ve known all along and didn’t tell her but did this instead. She’ll be embarrassed but I feel like she’d be more likely to actually try to fix the issue.
I hope that none of my friends are as round about as you.  If she dodges your question... will you be more direct?
probably the best way to go about it honestly.
Dm me 🥰
Hey babe, your vagina smells bad, you should get that looked at.
I thought about doing the same.
There is such thing as being too clean
If she is sexually active it’ll be the partner causing it by poor hygiene.
She may think it is normal though. It is amazing how uninformed some people are about their own bodies.
We always said “ if it smells like fish and tastes like chicken, hold your nose and keep on lickin”
This takes a lot of the embarrassment away, and let’s her have that “oh crap!” Moment on her own. If she knows that others know, she will feel super embarrassed, and that embarrassment can turn into a big insecurity that stays even after the issue is fixed. Just keep it girl to girl, friend to friend.
I did this (without pinpointing) with a girl I was seeing. Even though she mentioned that she gets yeast infections a lot,  She did not get the damn clue
I would also add with some helpful hints for her to fix it.
You would be surprised how many men and women  have no idea about hygiene because their parents didn't teach them. 
It's not something everyone knows instinctively.
Sometimes it can be soap actually throwing off your PH I got BV and switched to a fragrance free PH balanced soap and never had the issue again.
Yup, antibiotics and learning to wipe front to back only.
Metronidazole is used to treat parasitic infections including Giardia infections of the small intestine, amebic liver abscess, and amebic dysentery (infection of the colon causing bloody diarrhea), bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas vaginal infections, and carriers of trichomonas (both sexual partners) who do not have symptoms of infection.

Be careful who you have sex with.
I think all of this is too much.  Real friend talk:

Giiiiirl!  You coochie is stinky.  Don’t feel bad about it, it happens.  But you keep wondering why you get ghosted after sex… that’s why.!  I love you and lemme know if you need any advice on how to fix it or need to talk.

(Then be there for her when she spirals momentarily) because no matter how you say it… the reaction isn’t going to be great. 🤣 cause it’s
A sucky situation
Yes to this, as the wording here deflects the part that people are all talking about it behind her back amongst each other. That part is the most mortifying
[removed]
Wiping wrong causes WAY more serious UTIs. Both yeast infection and BV are simple imbalances in the normal vaginal flora where some of the NORMAL microorganisms grow too much. 

The bacteria in feces aren’t native of the vaginal or urinary tract. They cause real UTI and pielonephritis. 

Also, definitely there is not "a lot" of woman who doesn’t know not to wipe back to front.
Bidets are the best, you can buy a cheap portable bidet and never use toilet paper again
I think just mild soap and water on the vulva or just warm water. Anti-bacterial would likely be too harsh?
Bacterial Vaginosis
Water is sufficient for inside the labia.
They aren’t the same thing. Vulvas only need warm water or else warm water and a mild soap. That’s the actual medical advice from gynaecologists.
Arm pits you can go crazy with soap. 

Honestly your lady region is VERY sensitive to anything that would throw it off balance. TMI but having a handheld shower wand with decent pressure is great for cleaning that region. Water should be enough. You don’t need to try bending and getting the water up in there. Just applying water to the region is good enough. Soap in your bikini line is okay just not in the parts. If you sweat a lot down there you can look at all over body deodorant and put it in the crevice of your bikini line (where most of the sweat is). Also, diet changes help too!
Fixed it just for you lol
>and assume it's things it's not.

As a dungeon master, I can tell you with absolute certainty that if you give someone a list of possible clues or leads, there's a ***zero*** percent chance they will end up running with the one you were prepared for them to run with.
I know, I thought that is not good advice!
I think overthinking is the right way to go about it, it's a serious problem if you get ghosted twice after sex and don't know why and ghosters aren't going to tell you what problem is that easily.
Every *potential* thing
A lot of the time smelly vaginas are actually from misguided and overzealous hygiene efforts, funnily  enough. There’s been a lot of bad messaging and poor education over the years and so women are out there douching and trying to wash the inside of their self-cleaning vaginas, upsetting the bacteria / pH balance and then causing them to smell. 

There can be other reasons. Hygiene is one; but the most common is BV.
My old roommate once gave me ph balance wipes and was casually like - hey I got these for you💀. I ended up having BV, was embarrassing but I’m glad she told me😂
It could be an sti too.. Just tell her everyone needs to get tested regularly.
I mean yea. You said she was your best friend. Thats what friends do is tell it honestly. Its really common and not something to be ashamed of. At least she'll know why she keeps getting ghosted. Maybe print off a paper about Bacterial Vaginosis if you're afraid to say it out loud. Tell her what your husbands friend said and help her get an appointment booked.
I've got it, but it might embarrass you. Tell her that you've been having some strange smell and your husband noticed. You went to the doctor, and he told you that you have an infection or something and that she should get tested too. Hell, tell her she should get checked out too because it's "common" for some girls to get. That might work. idk it's what popped into my mind.
Yeaah, might be best to leave this one alone on your end. If he liked her enough he would have the willingness to try to resolve the issue in his own way, or at least try again with her. Straight up ghosting after one night means he probably was never that into her to begin with, or the stank was really that bad and irredeemable that he had to move on with his life.
So your alternative is to just keep letting your friend walk around with a stanking ass pussy? 

You inferred you already knew her pussy stinks. So if you have caught whiffs of it, you don’t think other people who are around her casually haven’t?

Like somebody said, it could be an STI. Or it could be toxic shock syndrome. Or a condom could’ve slipped off & the guy never bothered to tell her, and she could have a condom stuck up there she never knew about. 

You could be risking her health to avoid an unpleasant convo. Be an adult.
She may not have it. BV odor is strong, like you can smell it on your coworker type strong. Have you noticed it? She may have just slept with dudes that wanted to get laid and had no interest in her beyond that.
Also. Ureaplasma. It's not routinely checked for when you go get checked for sti's. You have to ask. I had that once and was treated for a UTI twice and also yeast infection because it can mimic those two things. Took a while to figure out what it really was. It was only after reading on reddit that I asked them to check for that! Turns out, that's what it had been the whole time.
I recently saw another post about a girl with a smelly coochie, and the OP (her BF) said she barely washed it when they showered together. She might have never been taught how to wash it properly — my mom didn't teach me too for some reason when I was very little, so I had to figure it out on my own, *after* I realized that just swiping over the lips a couple times is not enough and you need to wash between the lips too. So yeah, there are many possible reasons that might cause the stank problem. 

I feel for the OP, it's a tough subject to bring up, and the friend might get absolutely mortified and offended (which is only natural tbh). But hopefully she'll understand that OP's honestly will benefit her in the long run. It's not just about getting laid — it's about her own health too.

(Though I wonder how she never realized that her coochie smells. If the stank is strong, she had to feel it too. It stays on the underwear, after all.)
honestly, not the worst way of going about it imo. lighten it up a little, it's a solvable issue.
Tact master!!!😡
I had a friend when I was young who forgot to remove a Tampax.  Her doctor found it on a check up!
I’ve had BV before (caused by nuvaring, apparently my body doesn’t like having things left inside) and the odor was the only symptom. But damn was it noticeable. Just pointing out that it COULD be BV, even if the odor is the only symptom!
Smell can totally be the only symptom of BV - and sometimes the smell is only mildly bad (say, oniony or meaty) rather than the dead-fish-rotting-in-the-sun smell you hear about most often. There are a ton of different bacteria in the biome, and all kinds of ways in which they can become imbalanced.
Prolly gonna regret this, but, what is the teardrop motion…
I do the dip & sniff test.

During foreplay, I spend some time with a hand down there and before moving on to the next phase, I bring my hand near my face and check for any offensive odor.
Thinking about the time I had BV unknowingly and all the crazy things that came out afterwards… 😭🤢
Ya but IMO that would be way better than being ghosted time after time after time, etc. etc.
A few years ago, I had a new partner and I was constantly getting yeast infections. My OBGYN recommended boric acid suppositories and boom! No more yeast infections! I bought some from my local pharmacy and would coat them in coconut oil before using since it was recommended.
Like setting moth balls in the closet, ain't got to worry about those little critters now
It’s not the man’s responsibility to explain hygiene to an adult they barely know. The chances of that blowing up and ending with some character assassination, at the least are extremely high. It doesn’t reflect poorly on the men at all for saying not my responsibility.
Same
I was always told that bc you're smelling yourself constantly you eventually get used to the smell and stop noticing it, so you're a lot less likely to notice a bad smell on yourself unless it's very intense. So you should clean well and often even if you don't think you smell bc you're the least likely nose to catch it.
I'm lucky enough to have never had BV so I don't really know what it smells like but I'd imagine that you wouldn't be able to smell it normally unless you had your face near the infected vag (unless it was an extremely serious infection).
I had BV once years ago and had no symptoms. It showed up on a regular  pap test 🤷🏼‍♀️
All she really did was take it to Reddit for some advice on how to bring it up bc she felt too anxious to hold off on it. Which is a good thing bc it shows that she cares enough about her best friend to approach the situation as delicately as possible. Not everyone is great at confronting issues with other people especially with someone they care about. There’s no reason to be so quick to judge especially when ur point is that she’s a fake friend for waiting so long when in reality she sounds remorseful and uncomfortable about the whole situation as well. It’s not like she was laughing it off with her husband.

It was 5 pm then so my joke was sponsored by coffee!
I'd rather gently rip the bandied than be the fake friend that watches it happen a second time.
Agreed. He asked and his coworker was honest about why and may have not even gone into more detail beyond “her coochie smells.”
Result of habits I guess? It sorta feels like it helps to lessen the blow in this particular situation, and somehow feels less awkward.
I can see that which is why, like I said, I always check before anything happens. Day to day I probably don’t notice and am not as thorough as I should be.
I suspect you’re an argumentative personality trolling to find any button to push for the purpose of your own entertainment.
Yes, I would be eventually. But if I know the person is sensitive to criticism or not as relaxed in talking about intimate issues I will do all I can to help her solve this in the gentlest and least damaging way.

I've had a friend who had very strong body odour. It wasn't a bad one just a very specific one. And one day someone told then they smell weird and moved in the other side of the table. He developed an obsession afterwards to the point he would get wounds from scrubbing his skin twice a day while showering and bought all kinds of washing orodusmcts and "miracle treatments". We had multiple interventions to convince him he doesn't smell like anything anymore and to get him to stop before he damaged his skin permanently.

If the friendship is super relaxed then for sure the discussion should be simple and straightforward : hey, I think you need to get checked cause you might have an infection and left untreated can do a lot ta harm.
So … how would that cause a UTI?
True. Especially younger women.
🤢EEWWWWW. 😂🤣
Oh wow that’s unfortunate. Guess pinpointing is the way to go 🫠
A stinky vag is probably more likely to be from bacterial vaginosis. 

Trichomoniasis, an STI, can also lead to vaginal odour. 

Sometimes, some women smell worse right after sex, from sweating and/or a hormonal change. 

Believe it or not, sometimes it’s a forgotten tampon shoved right up in there. 

Sometimes it can be cancer (cervical or vaginal).

On occasion it can be because of a fistula. 

All vaginas have a smell that changes according to your menstrual cycle (more pronounced mid-cycle), pregnancy, post-partum, etc.  

Sometimes they change smell due to diet as well. 

Sometimes a smelly vag can be from poor hygiene, especially during your period. But you’re not supposed to wash the inside of your vag. No soap, no sprays, no gels, not even water. It’s a delicate bacterial balance in there! 

In fact, sometimes women who douche or wash their insides end up smelling bad because they upset the pH balance. It can also lead to irritation, bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections, plus it can interfere with the vagina’s ability to clean itself. 

A PSA to all who read this: wash your vulva, but not your vagina. Use either warm water and a mild soap or just warm water. Front to back. Don’t splash anything up inside. 

✌️
which one do you use? I think I have chronic mild BV 😬
Vulva only, never inside the vagina. And you can also just use warm water and no soap if soaps are irritants.
I think age matters here. I agree with you if these are ppl under like 19-20. But that's because that's how teenagers talk, and that's ok. But if these 2 ppl are adult women, then no. The above responses are def more appropriate then "You coochie is stinky." Ya know?
Omg thank you. Someone just said it how it is. The internet is too soft lol. 😂
Wet wipes work well if soap is not an option.  I always carry a small pack in my purse.
Exactly.

Some girls are more prone to yeast infections or BV. That's just how their body was made. Additionally, some are more prone due to taking certain medications. Hygiene isn't ALWAYS the reason for those things.
It is a life changing device, even for men.  I’ve never felt more clean and holy than having a freshly washed ho-ho.
Thanks
Thanks
Thanks
Warm water and soap work for me.
Honey, I'm 60. Water isn't getting rid of my sweat stank.
solid
The best part about this answer is that it applies to both kinds of dungeon master.
Yep ! Guaranteed she'll think she sucks in bed( not literally) but you know ...
r/unexpecteddnd
As a player, our party has missed so many in-your-face clues.
But why have her overthink it if her friend knows the actual reason she’s being ghosted? Seems totally unnecessary.
That’s GOLD!!
Yup. Especially Trichomoniasis.
Right….. but there’s this thing called tact, she shouldn’t stay silent on the matter but being blunt probably isn’t the right move either.
Or just casually mention you need to make your annual gyno appointment and ask if she has had hers?
Perfect!!!
Where did they infer they already knew? I think the “I never told her” in the post is referring to not telling the friend what the coworker said.
Aww. See, this is a shame. Honestly, I wasn't taught either! I legit just figured it out when I got obsessed with my own parts as a kid and, exactly, realized you gotta really get up in the nooks and crannies, pull back the clit hood (just read a Buzzfeed article a month or so ago that tons of women didn't know you should do this, see how underinformed we all have been?!), go between, on the sides of, and all around the lips, go down near the grundel. 
And I just wondered, jeez, this girl (my ex) seems to have..not been doing much at all in terms of washing. Because maybe she never got curious when she was younger, or just thought, "That is just supposed to smell"?.. I was the first person she had done oral on - that's why I felt I had to teach her, because I didn't want to put my face there, lol, my hands being there had been enough to realize some lessons needed to be learned as gently as possible, before I reciprocated. But maybe being a lesbian but having never got that up close and personal with another vag before also made her able to be unaware of how different she was to others? (In case anyone is thinking I'm creepy, we were both teenagers! I wasn't some predator, haha.)

But that did cross my mind - for OP's friend and my ex, like, just if you happens to, Idk, be super sick or something and you can't shower as often as you want, you definitely can smell yourself when you pee or whatever, I'm very sensitive to the slightest smell, I smell things no one else can, but like, if somebody REALLY stinks, it's unmissable! How does OP's friend not smell herself? That's where I think she assumes it's normal. Does she not visit a gyn though? You'd think the doctor would find a way to gently tell her? I take such a Silkwood shower before my gyn appointments, and go out of my way to not pee or anything beforehand so there's no chance of the slightest odor when I get there. How could this girl's dr just accept that odor and not feel compelled to let her know her hygiene needs work? But, I know people who haven't been to the dentist in 5+ years, maybe this girl is the same with the gyn. :(
Not inside the vag though. Never inside…
I'm glad you asked!!! Once upon a time a comedian named Daniel tosh had a show called tosh.0 right......I think that's where I heard it from lol but basically  before a man (or woman) goes down on another woman they make a tear drop outline around the area before committing to the act itself....also it's known as "whiff test." But done secretly during foreplay or something....so if you see someones head go down there and basically come back up (tear drop) that's what they are doing lol
Yes! What’s that?!?
Nice. If pulled off correctly they have no idea lol. I learned that the hard way back in high school when I couldn't control myself and wait for my then gf to shower after soccer practice....had to commit to it and push through Lol. Only made that mistake once
Omggg I’m currently battling chronic yeast infections 😭 Diflucan doesn’t work for me anymore. What brand of boric acid do you use?
So they can fuck her, tell the reason to *other people*, and ghost her and that’s fine? It is not. The man in OP assassinated his own character.
Exactly, you thoroughly clean often enough that you notice when you start to smell
Not enough good bacteria to fight off the bad bacteria.
I use Eucerin advanced cleansing body and face cleanser
And metronidazole prescription cream gets rid of bv I have reoccurring bv and dove sensitive soap bar has been amazing to me thats what my gyno told me to try
BV is often caused by washing inside your vagina and upsetting your pH balance. You’re not supposed to put anything IN your bag to clean it. Not even water. Only clean your vulva / outer folds. You can use a mild soap and warm water or just warm water. Front to back. 

It can be caused by other things too, so see your doctor if it persists.
I had this issue and found boric acid suppositories. Changed my life! You can grab them off Amazon. Way better than prescription, and I use them whenever something feels off, sometimes after sex. Total game changer.
Usually.  Yeah. ;)
How do you dispose of them when you're out in public?
Im a guy and i want my own personal bidet . I cant afford no japan toilet tho and also would share a toilet with family . I dont want them using my ass sprayer tho
I was 19 and am 34 now, I can still feel the embarrassment 😂, but am definitely grateful she had the guts to do it.  She never spoke of it again and it cleared right up with the wipes lol
A rare case of both parties being acknowledged as right at the same level of rightness by everyone. What a sight to behold ! Damn do I feel like a bot typing this phrase. Maybe I am ? (beep boop) (even the "beep boop" joke I'm sure a seasoned AI would type that) (the internet is cooked) (beep boop)
I like this one. Get her to see a doctor and let the doctor inform her of whatever she has going on down there.
Okay gotcha…so if there’s a gross smell then you just are aware of the grossness and proceed, because, you know, committed to the mission?? 

OP’s bestie, we will call Bestie, would definitely be embarrassed and hurt by being told right away that “there is/seems to be an issue “… 

Bestie has the knowledge now to do what she will.

IMO that’s better than being ghosted time and time again before eventually finding out that her sex partner(s), OP’s boyfriend AND OP are talking about her stinky coochie.

Edit to add I love Daniel Tosh

Interesting … I’ll share that with her.
thank you so much! google was giving me all these expensive boutique brands.
Yeah metronidazole is for parasitic infections which may/can/do migrate to the vaginal canal if they're bad enough. Diet change is needed at this point. If not Stronger medication to be rid of the parasite.
Wrap in toilet paper and put into nearest garbage.
I got a $50 one on Amazon that uses warm water and it’s amazing. You don’t have to go super expensive for a decent one!
Mine is a $400 Toto attachment I bought from Amazon.  And if you’re in cold weather, the seat has a warmer and the water is also warmed, making it a bit more tolerable. The first time, it’s jarring but you get used to it
…and probably saved you from being ghosted!! 👻
But how do wipes (antibacterial or not) clear up something that needs an antibiotic treatment? Isn't BV something that requires a doctor's help to get rid of?
Hey get out of here with your appreciation for reasonable discourse and lack of judgement and instant emotional retaliation! What are you new? Fucking bots.
The beep boop made me start questioning whether this was an actual AI comment
Depends...if you don't play it off and get caught aborting a mission that might cause problems....if your face is already in that area and they are expecting it....you might have to commit...if you're going to marry her/ love her just hold your breath and get it done lol. Don't ever want them to know that you are uncomfortable with anything down there esp odor...lie lie lie if you have to ....they claim to want the truth etc but they will forever hold on to that for the right moment during a fight
You're welcome! I get it on Amazon as a subscription so it's really not a bad price. I was having chronic issues as well, while trying to conceive. I have high standards for hygiene but it can easily happen with mixing two separate biomes constantly 😅
Right! I've used boric acid tablets bc it was coming back after antibiotics. A wipe would be way better than that gritty mess
So during a fight she will throw out “well remember that time you said my coochie was stinky”…”so I learned how to properly care for myself…”

Okay so I added in the second sentence 🥴 but I just can’t wrap my head around EVER bringing THAT up again!! 🫨
I also think shower sex is a good alternative...during foreplay in the shower just casually (sexually) wipe her area with a loofa? Lol idk. There's gotta be a creative way to do it without being obvious
I hate my boyfriend 
My boyfriend 28M and I 29F have been together for about three years. It hasn’t always been rainbows and sunshine. But the good times always did outweigh the bad times. We would get into little disagreements here and there. Two years into our relationship he was struck by a vehicle and landed in the hospital for about five months. He had two shattered legs, broken ribs, broken hand, broken foot, and suffered from a fat embolism which caused some  brain damage(TBI) . I was there for him every step of the way, which obviously isn’t an issue, I definitely am not trying to make myself out to be a martyr or anything but I would go to the hospital and visit him every single day. Working 50+ hours a week and I would i would immediately go to see him after every shift. It was pretty mentally exhausting honestly. But he did eventually get better and he was discharged and able to come home. 

Ever since the accident I literally can’t stand to be around him. He’s so quick to anger and he’s mean a lot of the time. Or he’s flat out neglectful. Of course I didn’t I expect him to go work right away, so for the last year I’ve just been taking care of him, paying all the bills and giving him money to do whatever he wanted with (buy snacks, games, etc) 
I will try to take him on outings on my days off, museums, zoo, nice restaurants, movies etc and he’s on his phone the entire time. He’s always playing Pokemon go. He will not put his phone down. He claims playing the game will help with his brain damage. 

After working long shifts, I expect to come home and chat with my boyfriend and relax with him, but I’m ignored because he’s always on his phone. It makes me sad.

So recently I was diagnosed with Graves’ disease, while I was on a business trip. I landed in the hospital for two days, and he didn’t even call me. At this point he was able to drive and I definitely wasn’t expecting him to drive 4 hours to come see me
In the hospital, but I was expecting him to call me at least. 
I was so incredibly upset, I just needed some comfort. He didn’t seem to understand that he was wrong for not calling me. And he blames everything on brain damage. I completely empathize with him having brain damage and I feel like I’m very understanding of his struggles but I just don’t understand how he has time to drive around, hang out with friends, play Pokemon go all day but not call me? 
Also, he scolds/ yells at me in public. Ex- we were at the pet store trying to find a new leash and collar set for our three year old female boxer, and I saw a cute pink/ floral print one (I am still the only working so I’m providing for him and paying for everything)  and he yelled at me how he isn’t going to walk around with a pink leash, and it’s HIS DOG, he bought her, so what he says goes. I was absolutely mortified when he started yelling at me. I am not terribly sensitive but embarrassment is hard for me to handle so I started to tear up a bit and I asked him if I could have a second to myself. He had no self awareness to realize that he was wrong, he thought I was being unreasonable. 
He will also call me out of my name and curse at me. 

He will also do extremely embarrassing things like scream at the self check when there’s an error on the screen. It’s extremely hateful and intolerant of anything that he isn’t familiar with. 

I’ve tried to reason with him and talk things out but he’s resistant to change. I have gained a lot of self awareness throughout the years and I’m huge on “treat others how you want to be treated”, so I’m extremely careful with my tone, and I’m always making sure to not raise my voice, curse during tense moments, and I especially do not believe in calling my boyfriend out of his name, but he can’t even attempt to give me the same respect. He refuses to go to therapy. He even admitted to being a sociopath, which is extremely alarming.

He also spends my money however he likes. 
I was trying to pay our electric bill but for some reason the app wasn’t working on my phone, so I sent him money  specifically to pay for it, and he used the money for something else (he hasn’t told me what he used the $230 for, still to this day). 

I love him a lot and I care about him a lot but also despise him. I find it hard to look at him sometimes. 

There are still some good times sprinkled in, but now the bad definitely outweighs the good. 

He still isn’t working and I feel bad for him, if I leave then he won’t have money to pay the bills. Also I love beautiful dog with all my being. Yes, he technically bought her, but I came into her life when she was six months old and I’ve been caring her ever since. I home make her food every week, but her toys, treats, take her on walks, take her to the vet etc she’s my heart and soul, my pride and joy, I honestly feel like I couldn’t be happy without her. She’s an amazing companion and she loves me so much, she’s always stuck to me hip. But I know if I leave, he wouldn’t let me take her.

- I am seeking help from a therapist.

Not sure how I should proceed. I’m so torn. Pretty sad 

Note- he is 28M, I am 29F
You only live once and living in a relationship with someone that you don't enjoy being around is not the way to go.    He's an emotional and financial drain and you're far better off without him so you can work on healing yourself.
 Please leave. I’m so sorry— I understand he is going through brain damage and it may cause him to have immense mood swings and behavioural change but you do not deserve this right now. 

I hope he recovers fully.
Hey OP, I'm 34, and earlier this year, I had a stroke, which left me brain damaged. One of the symptoms I have to deal with is increased rage and anger. I'm super irritable all the time, and for a while, I was snappy as all get out. But after a few months of my closest relationships devolving and seeing the hurt on my husband and child's face when I got snippy and mean, I knew something had to change.

I started trying to be more mindful, and even if I slip up, I make sure I apologize and hold myself accountable. I'm still in the process of finding a therapist, but I've taken other steps to work on my anger; meditation, deep breathing, working out, being mindful of my attitude, etc. And things have gotten better. It's not perfect, but much much better. 

My point is that while symptoms aren't the fault of the afflicted, the attitude and the choice to not hold one's self accountable as a result of the symptoms is.

You don't need to stay. You can leave. I'd have understood if my husband left me and the bf you knew from before accident would understand if he was still the same. But he's not. And you don't have to force yourself to be loyal to this new version of him because he's not holding himself accountable, and you don't have to put up with that.

Good luck, OP. may your life get better 🙏

ETA: Thank you for the awards, kind souls. 🥰 I hope my story encourages others to seek healing and to always hold oneself accountable 🤗
You're very empathetic, but you deserve better. Leave him; he's not entitled to you. What you have already given him so far has been such an enormous gift that hopefully he'll appreciate in the future, but right now he's using you and will continue to if you let him.
It sounds really tough. I’ve been in a situation where I felt overwhelmed supporting someone, and it was hard to balance everything. It’s okay to feel sad about this. Take care of yourself.
Leave and take the dog. You can show you pay for all her necessities and vet bills and that's all that counts as they are considered property still unfortunately. Don't waste the rest of your life living like this. You deserve better.
You need to get out of that relationship asap. It doesn’t sound like he’s doing anything to help himself and it’s not fair that he’s putting it all on you. Continuing like this would be miserable for you and you deserve better.
The man you knew died in that accident. Leave the shell that's here now.
Leave and take the dog. If he’s in no state to take care of her, who could fault you, really? You need to take care of you too.
Leave. If he can play Pokémon, go and hang out with his friends then he can work and not treat you like shit. The fact that he didn't contact you when you were hospitalized kind of says it all. Don't feel guilty for leaving he's been using you as an emotional punching bag and ATM long enough.
People have walked out for far less than what you’re going through. You’re miserable, it won’t get better, and life is short. If you stay, what’s your end game, to have a family? That would be insane. You’re not married, he’s not your lifelong responsibility, there’s no upside to this relationship, and you’re obviously very unhappy. Mourn the past, make plans for your future, and move on. Be careful that he doesn’t snap when you tell him, though. I’d hate to see an escalation from a stressor like that.
Honey, it's not how people treat you, it's how you allow them to treat you.

You love him, you feel guilt for his situation, so you're going to stay with him like this for...what? The next 40 years?? God no.

He's a grown up, he'll learn to live on his own without you doing everything for him. 

"I've reached a point in my life where I cannot go on like this. I love you but I can't do this anymore. My mind is made up, and I wish you all the best." Done.
You’re not married. Don’t stay. Do you really want to do this for the rest of your life???
Also it’s not just him/not him. You are missing out on opportunities to find someone who IS a good long term partner every day that you stay with this guy. 
It’s tragic that he has brain damage. But he’s not your responsibility and he’s not a good partner. GTFO
It's time to go. At this point you are being completely taken advantage of. 

It's hard to make younger people understand that life is very short. But it really really is. You went above and beyond for this man. Don't waste anymore of your life for him. He doesn't vaguely appreciate how you stood by him.
Things happen and people change and you don’t need to feel obligated to stay with him. You should leave if he behaves that way. Even if it was brain injury related you don’t need to deal with it because it’s affecting your health and sanity. You deserve nice things too
I agree with everyone, I feel you can walk away knowing you’ve done everything you can to support him, don’t feel guilt. A brain injury doesn’t give him a right to treat you like that. He should be seeking help for himself. I work with lots of people with brain injuries so I know the behaviours can be difficult, but that doesn’t mean partners or families have to put up with this, and it sounds like he does he has some insight but choosing to do nothing. Oh and take the dog, 100%, I’m sure she’d love a pink collar. It will be hard, but worth it. Good luck and so sorry you’re going through this. You sound like a really good person.
You’ve outgrown him. One of the hardest parts of growing up is learning to let go with the things that no longer serve us. You’re fully capable of taking care of yourself. He is not which is probably another reason why you feel obligated to take care of him. It’s time for him to go back home to his parents so that he can learn how to be self sustaining adult while you continue on the path that you were already on.
Oh, this breaks my heart…. I have been in a similar situation - not an injury, but loss of a job turned my ex into a nasty person. Honestly, I wish I had left back then, instead of riding it out for another 5 years. Because once he started getting his life back in order, I was still left in the dust. Now I’m biased. 

Hopefully there is legitimate brain damage that can be FIXED, otherwise… You’re not married, you’re in your prime, and the years will escape you before you know it. You deserve to be loved like a woman. You deserve to be taken care of with an effort that matches your own. You deserve to be treated as more than someone’s ATM and emotional punching bag. Best wishes 💓
Leave bc why stay with someone you can’t stand and treats you like Shit! Help him apply for social security due to his brain injury, income problem solved.  Kick him out and let him go stay with those friends he likes so much or family. Keep the dog, he can’t take care of her anyway.
There is no reason to stay in a relationship where you are giving 100% and receiving nothing but contempt and abuse in return. Make a plan for you and your dog, don't tell him or have a conversation until you are far away and anticipate him attempting to manipulate you into coming back. He's not going to change. He honestly would be better off figuring out how to take care of himself again and he will certainly manage just fine without you. Do yourselves both a favor and end the relationship!
I know you love him and I empathize with how hard this situation is. So here is a loving way to think about it. 

Helping him was kind at the beginning, but now you are not doing him any favours. He thinks spending money irresponsibly is okay, and treating people poorly is okay, because you’re essentially enabling him. Also, when you express he is not meeting your needs, it just makes him feel worse. He does not have the capacity to support you because he cannot even support himself, so stop expecting him to. Support must come from a position of strength, and that applies to both of you.

The only way for this to get better is if he is willing to change himself, and you’ve done all you can to try and facilitate that. Except for one final thing. The best thing for him and for you is to leave so he is forced to reflect on his behaviour. Leave with love, tell him you believe in the good in him and don’t believe this is who he truly is, but be firm in saying that you’ve done all you can and this is his journey alone now. If you truly love him, understand that this is the only way he can find happiness too.
It's admirable that you've been there for him, but his problems shouldn't condemn the rest of your life. Call his parents, explain that you've paid your dues and that they're to come and collect him and his stuff.
Holy crap, you’ve been carrying way too much for way too long. You’ve gone above and beyond to support your boyfriend, and honestly, he’s treating you like garbage in return. The fact that he’s quick to anger, neglectful, and flat-out disrespectful—while you’re the one supporting him financially and emotionally—is a giant red flag.

Brain injury or not, it doesn’t excuse his behavior, especially the public outbursts, yelling, and lack of care for you. And let’s not even get into the fact that he ignored you while you were in the hospital—that’s just cruel.

You’re doing all the right things by seeking therapy, but let’s be real: this dude is draining you in every possible way, and it’s not getting better. He’s resistant to change, refuses to go to therapy, and openly admits to being a sociopath? That’s not something you should have to deal with.

Here’s the tough love: it sounds like you’re sacrificing your entire well-being to keep this relationship alive, and he’s doing nothing to meet you halfway. At this point, you need to prioritize yourself. You’ve been holding on because you’re a good person, but you deserve better. Leaving doesn’t make you the bad guy—it makes you someone who values their own worth.

And if he won’t let you take the dog? That’s a fight worth having, but don’t let it keep you stuck in a toxic situation. You deserve peace, and this guy isn’t offering it. Do what’s right for you.
Idk how to get across to you that you are wasting your life on this loser.  Don’t let him rob you of anymore of your life. 
I’ve been in similar situations , and at 43, I regret it so much. 
We only live once.  You sound like a great woman and because of this you’re  gonna attract both the good and the bad . 
This guy is an immature jerk and he’s taking you for granted.  People that act this way typically don’t change. Or at least not any time soon and nobody should have the  time to wait around for that. 
Trust me, you can do better.  
A loyal partner like you is hard to find.  You deserve better.
I'm glad you're in therapy, but more importantly, is he? I'm sure he did major PT recovering, but his cognitive issues require proper attention too. Is he working to get back to his old self, or is he content with this status quo where you carry all the weight and he can ignore you and behave however crappily he wants to? If he's making no effort to improve & you don't see things changing, I give you permission to leave & take the dog with you since you already care for her and are bonded. 

There are social services available for his care. It sounds like you've done all you can, and you're not obligated by marriage to give up the best years of your life & the chance of a future healthy relationship for someone who doesn't appreciate you and apparently is incapable of doing so. Sending hugs and nose kisses to your pup 💕
The questions you have to ask long term:
Can I live like this for the next 50 years?
If we get married and have children, will he be a good father?
Do I want my children to be around his little outbursts?
Will he eventually alienate friends and family with his behaviour?
What would you tell your best friend/ sister/ daughter if they were in the same situation?
Girl, putting yourself first is never the wrong move. You can always get your own dog.
He might have had a TBI based on the personality change. Girl, I'm sorry, but the guy you fell for died in that accident. Morn him, and move forward. It would be a waste of life for you to stay in this relationship. You clearly have so much to offer as a partner and you deserve to find your equal.
I can’t tell if this is rage bait or not. Regardless I hope you find the self respect to leave.
I was in a relationship for 6 years, lived together for 5.  I eventually left decided to chase happiness because life is short.  I lost my best friend and really only comfort I had during the fights my dog.  We spent countless nights on the couch together.  It’s been almost a year and I’m in a new relationship with an amazing girl.  Just recently rescued an amazing doggo.    But I’m still pretty fucked up, wake up crying some mornings about my old best friend and I’m still fucked up from the trauma, but it is better than that psychological prison.  Good luck our time is precious.
You did your part. Matter of fact, you did more than your part. You were there for him when he needed you... He hasn't done the same for you. From what you tell us, you have kept the end of your bargain (AND some).

As much as it may pain you to hear... It may be time to move on. From what you tell us, you deserve someone that will hold their end up in the relationship. Someone that will pay attention to you, care about you, make you smile, and love you. 

Maybe you're holding on longer since he had an accident and you do care for him and love him. But it doesn't sound like he cares to get better and do his part.

We don't know what he was like before the accident, but from what you say, it doesn't sound like it was much better than now. I think for a lot of us, it's hard to let go of something like this, we may continue to question: "Am I doing enough? Have I done enough? Maybe it'll get better. Just need more time-" etc etc. Three years is a good amount of time to know someone. Ask yourself this very important question: Can you continue down this road for the rest of your life? There is either a Yes or No answer.

Hope this helps.
You can end a relationship at any time for any reason.
Perhaps his erratic behaviour correlates to said brain injury but personally, i would leave. You stuck by him through a very hard time in his life and you’re wonderful for that. But that does not mean you have to stay forever with his continued behaviour. It’s unhealthy for your well-being. You know you deserve better than that.
I have a gay couple (still friends with the normal one) and one was struck by a vehicle on the side of the road.  The brain damage caused similar to what you’re describing.  He got more violent as he went on, doing drugs and being unsafe…eventually they had to break up because he just wasn’t safe to be around.  

Get out of it.  It’s not worth it.
Chronic pain and brain damage combined with depression equals...pretty much exactly how he is behaving. That being said, there is nothing that REQUIRES you to stick around for it. Tell him he either gets help and.improves his behavior or you.are out.
Pretty simple just leave.  Dudes an asshole now
Where is his family or any of his friends in all this? Why are you his only support system? It sounds like a terrible marriage, except you're not even married. Catastrophic brain damage like this and no therapy is something that means he may be like this forever (or get worse), and whether his personality has changed or he was always like this and now it's just worse than before, you don't matter to him in any way other than being a hindrance or supporting him in being a large and possibly dangerous child. I say dangerous because he seems unaware of himself and may do something however unintentional, that could harm you and then not care that you've been hurt. That's scary. There's no building a life or family with someone like him at this point and although it may seem like you're giving up on him to walk away, you need to have some compassion for yourself. This is completely one-sided and doesn't sound like it can improve with just your effort alone. I'm sorry things have turned out this way, and it sounds like you've done everything you can do to help someone who has no interest in helping himself to anything but more of your care, attention and money. It's unfortunate. But you hold all the power to get away.
Head injuries change people.

I have a friend that fell down stairs and busted his head open. He had to get a metal plate put in his head.  He is a completely different person than what he was before he hit his head.  His wive divorced him and he's not allowed to see his kid anymore.  My boyfriend was his best man at his wedding and says he's completely changed and so has everyone else in the friend circle that knows this person

He isn't going to change back. He needs therapy and you need to move on.
You don’t have a boyfriend you have an abusive parasite. You need to find a way out. Take the dog if you can.
While he’s gone for more than 6 hours, bolt.  Take everything that you’ve paid for, dog included, as you can prove you are the pets primary caregiver.  Disappear, block him, and start over.  You will find someone who appreciates you soon enough, and there will be a lot of good times, and the bad times will be easier because you’ll face them together.  Brain damage guy has years of recovery and self reflection ahead that he might never do.  Seriously, run for your life.  I know what it’s like to love someone so much, but know they aren’t ever going to rise to be the partner you want or need. There’s no way forward beyond a hard gtfo fast.
BREAK UP with the frickin’ guy.
Sound like your  suffering CareTaker fatigue. Set your boundaries stick to them. If he can't respect that get his doctor's to set him up with rehab.and him doesn't follow thru your done. But be prepared that he will make your life hell and tell you how selfish and cold you are. 

You can't help him if you don't take care of yourself. Make getting the Graves disease a priority. Getting it diagnosed is half the battle it can take several year to find the best medicine and diet for you.
HE IS UNGRATEFUL and full of HATE. Leave him quickly. Run. Run!
I'm going to tell you what I'd tell my little sister, leave him. I've read your comments and it seems like he wasn't great before the accident either. I believe that, even though he does have brain damage, he's using this as an excuse to treat you like trash. It seems like the brain damage just removed some social barriers, however that means he is truly like that without the filters. You have to ask yourself if you want to be with someone like that. It seems like you have a good heart but that can be taken advantage of by manipulative people. You've been with him a while, through thick and thin, and he treats you like this? Sometimes you have to be selfish, you have your entire life ahead of you. Keep your peace. Figure out a way to leave.
ya need to confront him and tell him things need to change or you will leave... he has to take serious steps to self improve and you need to put a deadline for this... if by that time you personally feel he hasnt made any serious attempts to improve you have to leave him... there is no point wasting years of ur life in misery for someone who is damaged when ya dont know if he ever will be the guy ya fell in love with... you deserve better...
He's not the same man anymore.
And yes, some of it can be blamed on the brain damage.
But not calling your partner/main-care-provider when they're in hospital ill?
Not even  a fcking phone call??
No.
Even if he struggles to remember, he can use that phone that's always in his hands to set a damn reminder.

Time to save yourself and walk away.
You've done so much for him. He can figure it out for himself. Especially with his attitude shown during the dog collar.
I’m kind of stuck similarly. At first this girl was really great and it had only been 4 months! I met her parents and her dad immediately grilled me with questions and was a total joy until he questioned my career. Fast forward to now and it’s been 7 months and I changed my career to get his approval, which I found was a mistake and am desperately trying to get my old job back… and she has moved in. She sleeps all day. That’s it. No job no money unless her parents send her something and I took this massive pay cut to appease her unreasonable dad. She kept this sob story going for a while. Her dad “kicked her out”. I am not able to afford both of our bills now and she can’t even listen to me talk about my day. It’s like I don’t want to be around her. I got her in school because I threatened to break up with her but I can’t exist if I don’t celebrate her now. Like after she moved in the entitlement skyrocketed. I get home and if I’m not leaping into her arms she character assassinates me for making her feel bad. “Wow that felt good.” If I ask why she left on the camera and where she went it’s disrespect. What the f@ck, sure I love the relationship and she’s super great, but I am conflicted. She has what I assume is genetic but a constant migraine almost. I’ve taken her to the ER like 20 times because she insists. Some days she wouldn’t eat and idk it just seemed convincing enough. She told me about going to the Mayo Clinic in Arizona and they couldn’t figure out what’s wrong. Her mom has something similar and always and I mean always has an ice pack on her head. She has had Botox next to her head to relieve pain… I just don’t want this for my life. She is super supportive if she has everything going well which is maybe two times a week at most but there is literally nothing charming about the bad overwhelmingly outweighing any and all good.
Dear OP, please don't further waste your money and emotional energy on this person. He once was your man, he no longer is. People change so much. Please leave ASAP before he puts a deeper dent on ur savings. 

He's just so much enjoying the love and money he's getting and taking it for granted and acting entitled. Maybe the way he's acting is a result of his brain damage, but you don't have to tolerate anything beyond your limit. 

Stay strong OP ❤️
There is only so much that can be blamed on brain damage. It might be that he is not as good a partner as you are, even without brain damage.
listen, i do understand your empathy, and love for him. but, let's be real you wouldn't wanna spend, or i wouldn't prefer spending next 30 years of my" life with somebody who can't walk with his" dog wearing a pink leash! it doesn't stop here, he yells at you, he's, even though i understand the brain damage thing but sister he got brains to play pokemon go but not for once think of you-? how they even seem to be in the basket— it's nunasance. 

speaking of who's gonna take care of him, perhaps his pokemon go and friends he hangs out w him. you are NOT his MOTHER, you are being treated like one. that too, of a kid who does nothing. feels nothing, does it look like to you he has little bit of empathy for you? no. 

i am not blaming him, perhaps in his head he's too sad to wake up and work. and he believes you are gonna leave him too. perhaps. but, that's not a physical brain damage condition, but mindset. it's wrong. 

please run. i hope he recovers soon, but you are not his mother but girlfriend, it's supposed to be like that.
I'm sorry that you're going through this. It sucks that this happened to him and it sucks that it changed him. But this still isn't a healthy relationship. If it were me, out of love for the person he used to be I would try to find some resources that could help him with his brain injury and mood regulation, give him the option to use them, and then walk away. Even if you don't try to find him resources, you've done more than enough. Unfortunately sometimes a brain injury can completely change a person and no amount of loving them will change them back.
Listen, people in your life may end up telling you should try to ‘make it work’. The problem is that it’s not up to you in this case to try to make things work, the problems are coming from his inability to make things work. It’s 100% on him, not you.

Aside from breaking up with him, there’s really only one thing you can do. Make your position clear on how things are not working for you anymore. Whether it be a product of his injuries or not, his behavior has caused you a great deal of pain. That being said, demand that he make an effort to fix the problems you’ve stated in this post, possibly including him seeing a psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrist to help him with the neurological side of his behavior. 

Also make it very clear you’re on the edge of just leaving, and that he needs to make a real effort and show change. He needs to know what’s on the line here if he’s going to care, because as he said, he might be sociopathic. For him to care at all he needs to be able to see the consequences a decision can have on himself. Him seeing a psychiatrist could help him with this and cause him to change this too, but for now if he isn’t on any sort of medication he will need that push.
Sounds like you need a change in scenery. Why keep yourself in an unhappy relationship. You helped him when he most needed it and we're by his side. Now it's time for you to be happy and live your life. You know what you need to do, you just need to do it.
If you can’t see yourself with this man for the rest of your life, leave him
Who cares about the sentiments? BREAK UP IMMEDIATELY. 
The brain damage may have caused a sudden change in behaviour, but it’s no excuse for anything. I was expecting him to be totally unaware of his own existence, but this is honestly worse
He sounds sooo horrible. Please please leave him, you do not owe him the rest of your your life to be lived out in misery because of guilt over his accident.
I’m sorry to hear what you’re going through. It seems like you’ve supported him a lot, but his behavior is unacceptable. You deserve respect and empathy, especially during difficult times. It’s great that you’re seeking help from a therapist. You need to think about your well-being and consider setting boundaries. It’s important that you don’t feel this way in your relationship. Take care of yourself; that’s not selfish, it’s necessary.
Get out, you will find happiness without him. I promise.
You need to get out with the dog . What if you become pregnant in 6he future, will your feelings have to change then . You have time on your hands it’s time for you both to leave .
I know it's really hard to accept, but you are not obligated to stay in this relationship. There's no reason. People fall out of love, and people change for various reasons. Unfortunately for him, the accident probably is the biggest reason for his personality change and that's likely never going to correct.  You deserve to find happiness, and shouldn't stay with him. Please leave before it gets bad bad
Why on earth would you put up with this shit?  Please. Walk. Away. And don't look back. Really
break up w him
I understand how tough and confusing this choice may be but I think you need to put yourself first in this . You only get one chance at this life thing you don’t want to waste your years with this man living so unhappily. It’s a shame he got brain damage but you cared for him when he needed you the most so now it’s time to put yourself first . It’s hard but you’ll have to leave him . About the dog j can’t help you there I’m sorry life sucks and you have to make decisions that are good for you .
I say this with kindness and experience, hun. 
*PLEASE CHOOSE YOU.*
If the worst happens to you (heaven forbid), he will find a replacement nurse and provider. You cannot replace you.

He has the ability to control his temper around others, he has the desire to get off his phone and spend time with others... just not for you. That is not a reflection of you but of the selfish person he has become, who is no longer the man you shared your life with.

Go get yourself a new puppy and a new start.

And please HOLD FIRM once you have left, as I guarantee he will do everything to get his meal ticket back.... if you go back, it will be worse because you dared to leave.
What if she showed him this post?
Girl run. I know you love that dog but either fight to keep her since he can't or just move on. Eventually he will have to give her up himself anyway cause he can't take care of anything and his just literally feeding off you. You won't ever be happy for years. I'm sorry. Been there done that. He would purposely try and get new animals and then abused them and I was the only one taking care of them. After dumping him my life got way better. Never again. You are about to be 30 years old and in a miserable relationship where you take care of someone so ungrateful. You are not meant to be with this person. Trust me the universe is FLINGING signs your way to get out of that relationship. You can take care of yourself and a new person will come down the way. I've seen it happen time and time again where they find who they are suppose to be with and they are so much more happier.
My God, sweetheart it sounds like he's just using you for your money and using his brain damage as an excuse if he can admit he is a sociopath then he is aware of his behaviour, you should think about where you see this relationship going, example- can you see yourself marrying this guy? Can you see yourself having children with this guy? If you say no, then you know what needs to be done. you're just delaying the inevitable. But I do wish you well and hope you find someone who sees and treat's your worth like you deserve ❤️
Ew, dump him. Bet the sex isn't even worth it either
Break up and take the dog 
I can give you some advice on the dog (if you break up with him but want to keep the dog) because I had a friend who moved out and took what was one of her best friends at the time family dog from him after living with him, taking care of the dog’s basic needs and the dog bills for YEARS.
Mom wasn’t in the pic and dad had moved out of the country.

Save every vet bill with your name on it. Save receipts for the food, the treats, the toys, the leash, EVERYTHING. 
Even though this family dog had been with my friend’s friend’s family for over a decade because she had the proof that SHE was paying for everything and SHE was doing the work, SHE ended up getting the dog in court. The dog was sickly and tragically died a few months later. My friend tried to tell her ex friend that dog was dying and again when the dog had passed and that ex friend who had attacked my friend for ‘stealing his dog’ and had been with “his dog” for over a decade didn’t even reach back out when my friend tried to let him know what was going on.

The courts (at least in my state) are more worried about whose name is on the bills for the pet and not who bought the pet and that’s how my friend got the dog in the end.
i am not going to mince words here: you’re staying with the memory of him. he is not the same person you once knew. the brain damage seems to have deeply effected his personality and it will be up to him on how he lets it affect his future. you feel tied to him because of who he was to you before the accident and right now he simply isn’t the same person.
It always amazes me the fact the good men don't find a good women,but, a bad garbage trash like this guy, bags this kind of angel.
It's possible this is just who he is. It's possible it was always in him and the brain damage activated it. It's also possible it can all be blamed on the brain damage. The question you need to ask yourself is if that matters. He doesn't want to get help it appears so do you want to live like this for the rest of your life? You did what you could supporting him.
Leave & take the dog. He cannot support her. 

TBIs are tragic but he's abusive & not working on getting better. 

After you're out of there and you have the dog secured, speak to a friend or family member of his that you trust, then break up with him. You don't owe him anything, & you've done right by him for years. Now it's time to take care of yourself & the future you deserve.
Respectfully, you have done enough. I understand that brain damage can rewrite a brain, but enough is enough. You sound like its starting to weigh very heavily on you, its always hard to end a relationship with someone that you love, but you have to love yourself too. And you deserve to be happy, not just “making it” while supporting someone who shows 0 appreciation towards you for literally being the sole reason he is financially stable and taken care of.
You should leave and marry the funny guy from work just an idea.
You don't owe him anything.
Please please leave and take your sweet dog. It will be extremely hard. He will beg and promise to change. He might even get very angry, so please have someone with you when you leave. It will be so hard to do, but happiness and peace is waiting for you on the other side. I'm rooting for you.
Stand up. Get the hell outta there. This man is never gonna change. You can try to see what you can do about the dog but if he did adopt her himself, then I don’t think you can do anything about it. I’d advise against staying just for the dog cause you’re gonna make yourself miserable regardless. And I don’t want to be that Redditor but I suspect your boyfriend is either having an affair or perhaps does he consume a lot of red pill content? Or like p0rn?
Leave his ass. He’s an ungrateful user and take the dog with you.
Girl… pls leave him😕u only live once and u shouldn’t be living it this way. Maybe you should try to talk to him tho. Tell him how you feel, have a serious conversation. If he still doesn’t listen then and continues with his ways leave him. If u choose not to leave him the screaming and arguing will probably turn more physical. Do what you think is best. You clearly have a big heart and care a lot about him. But if I was you I would leave him. Best of luck girl❤️
Sadly this kind of switch is decently common for those who’ve suffered serious brain damage. His switch got flipped and this is what he is now. I’ve never been a believer in just up and leaving your partner after a tragedy but at this point we’ve crossed well beyond that point. You’re well within your right to admit you can’t do this anymore because he’s no longer the man you fell for, and you aren’t wrong to do so. I’d recommend you leave and move with your life, as difficult as it may be to do so. All you’re doing is leaving yourself to be abused mentally for someone who’s no longer capable of loving you. I wish you all the best, and I’m sorry you have to go through this
Oh No... I am so sorry to hear this. You DESERVE waaaay better than the ABUSE he is inflicting on you. He abandoned you at the hospital, and verbally assaults you.

PLEASE break it off and start your journey toward healing and finding your true person. Sending you positive vibes.
Hand this little boy off to his mother and move on
30(m) Try to push him toward possibly seeking therapy or treatment of his own. I’m not a professional but it’s possible he may have developed a mood disorder. I begged my wife to seek help for her’s, she refused and 4 years later I’m signing divorce papers. He may try to say things like “I’m trying,” or “it’s the TBI,” don’t accept those answers. He needs treatment and there is no other alternative.
OP prob won't see this but I'll try. 

Unfortunately, the lasting effects of brain damage can cause a personality change that is permanent. Head trauma is very common in serial killers and violent offenders (not saying your BF is one, this is just a documented medical fact found in history). 

The odds are his behavioral changes will not get better without some sort of intervention. That being said, psych medications have been shown to help alleviate or at least control some impulsive aggression found in TBI (traumatic brain injury) patients. But you have to get him to a doctor and have him actually seek care before this is a possibility. 

If this is too much of a burden for you, you may just need to accept that the man you fell in love with is no longer the man you are with. You are still young and this will be a life long issue for him. Is this something you want to commit to? Is he a suitable partner to settle down with? Will your children be safe around him with these impulsive aggressive moments? You have to ask yourself these questions.

Ffs wait till this huge douchebag is out playing with his little friends or trying to run down a jiggly-puff like it’s an actual paying  job as most responsible adult men wld be doing instead and pack up YOUR dog and cut your losses. Gtfo of there and change your # . Do not ever for a second feel bad about never speaking to this flaming cunt ever again in your life. Don’t worry about him. If he’s an actual sociopath he won’t really care anyways other than to miss the way you have enabled his selfish bullshit for so long
This will be your reality until you lay in your coffin. Please leave.
People are either constructive in your life, or destructive. Once you figure out who is building in your life and who is tearing down, it gets pretty easy to leave. You deserve someone who cares enough about you (and himself) to be building.
Where’s his family? Call them up and tell them everything. Break your lease or whatever your housing situation is and sell off whatever is yours that you don’t want. Put everything that’s yours into self storage where he doesn’t know about so he can’t sabotage your personal property. 

Move far away and have his family pick him up and take care of him. It’s not so much the long term brain damage but he’s abusive to you and you need to get him into a situation that is better for him and get yourself scaping far away from a man that no longer loves you. If he ever did. You’re his caretaker and his prisoner? Stop enabling your own incarceration and take steps to move onto the next chapter of your life.
Get your name on the dogs microchip and keep track of your dog-related expenses. Leave and take the dog with you. Do not tell him where you are going.
Dude. Womp fuckin womp if he doesn’t have money because you leave. That’s not your responsibility both physically and emotionally at this point. You are worth so much more than this guy. And to be clear, it is REALLY hard to go through what you’re going through- you’re basically mourning the loss of the person that he used to be, while dealing with this weird alter ego at the same time. I think you know you should leave, which doesn’t make it any easier to do so, but the decision is pretty clear. I hope you find peace and safety 🌸
Okay, I couldn’t even read the whole thing. I too have Graves’ disease and can totally relate to the health issues you’ve been dealing with. It can totally be triggered by stress. This person is taking complete advantage of you. Send him back to his mommy or daddy or whoever will take him. You need to put yourself first.
Oh Sweetie (I am a 45 year old mom here), you are in a tough situation. He needs to be in therapy for his TBI and for adjusting to life again. My son has a TBI and after he was able to start walking and talking again, I found a TBI treatment center and reached out to them. They gave me information for his therapy for my area. Please please try and help him with that. And then find a support group of other loved ones dealing with patients with TBI’s. 

I will probably get a lot of crap for saying try to help him. But please try. TBI’s can be horrible and personality changes are awful! 

I am so happy you are getting therapy. I would suggest try setting up a savings account that he can’t access and start saving. If he refuses to get help then I would leave. But please try and get him help. My son wouldn’t be the man he is now if he didn’t get the help he did. 

Please updateme!
Before you waste any more time ask yourself, is this the life you want? Are you happy? Would you get married tomorrow without a doubt in your mind if that is the person you want to spend your life with? You have your answer, don’t drag your feet. Leave
Dump the motherfucker already.

Edit: you’ve been paying for the dog, take the dog.
I’m curious if he was like this before the brain injury. Calling himself a sociopath is crazy. Either way you can’t stay with him.
No pun intended, but this seems like a no-brainer situation...
Time to move on!
You have our permission to create a new and better life for yourself.
Tell him a jigsaw puzzle will help his brain damage. And then dump him. You don't need to be a punchbag just because he had a horrific accident
Leave. It will hurt for a few days but you save yourself years of heartache.
leave. take the dog. he doesn't deserve either of you
Head injuries can and do cause personality changes. It seems like this relation has run its course. He has time for everyone but you. At this point he’s using you because he doesn’t have to work. Take the dog and bounce. Have her microchip updated to reflect you as the owner if it doesn’t already. And I imagine all of the vet bills were done in your name too.
Dump his ass, you’ve done enough, let someone else deal with him.
Dog owner here. The vet knows you... so take her to the vet, get her chipped, and put your information on it. Then when you leave, take the dog with you, and call the police and inform them that the dog is chipped under your name, that she's your property, and that you did not steal her. Collect all the evidence you can that shows that YOU pay for this dogs wellbeing and that your partner doesn't doesn't have a job capable of meeting this dogs basic needs for food and vet appointments.


And when you leave, don't do it all at once. Start packing your bags now. Talk to a friend or family member who may be willing to start storing your things. Slowly but surely move some shit out with you. Bring an extra bag on your way to work. Have a friend come pick up some stuff in the middle of the night when he's sleeping. Be slow. Be cautions. And once it's all been packed up, and you're ready to go. Take the dog for a walk, and never come back. Block him on everything. Get a new number, and maybe even a new phone if you can.
I don't think it's kidnapping to take a dog...
First, let me say I am so very sorry that you are in this situation!  However, I am extremely happy to hear that you were seeking therapy and that you have the awareness to know that you deserve better in your life because you truly do! I am an animal, lover, and wholeheartedly understand you’re struggles with leaving without your dog. I do believe that you could take ownership of the dog because without an income, and with his mental instability and his acknowledging of being a sociopath, he isn’t fit to have the dog in his care!   
I am 60F, I’ve been married for 20 years and over the years my husband has had substance and alcohol issues. As we grow older his behavior has not improved, he gets more selfish and meaner with each passing year.  I can tell you it won’t get better. Your boyfriend’s behavior will not miraculously change! You’re still very young you have your own income what are you waiting for? Please do not have a child with this man child!  Yes, he was in a horrible accident, but that is no excuse for him to say he’s a sociopath!  Listen to him! listen to him he’s telling you who he is and what he is, you owe him nothing!  But, you do owe yourself something, you deserve to give yourself the best of life you possibly can and I assure you it’s not with this guy!  Please get out, please Take your dog and go, whatever happens to him is not your fault! Let his family take care of him. It’s not your responsibility, best of luck and I wish you all the happiness in the world! ❤️
This makes me sad. I am sorry someone is going through this
Well I can partially relate because i suffered swelling on brain in car accident sometimes I'm cranky but I have no help however I'd come no matter the distance if my girl was in hospital. I never stopped working though even with fractured breast plate. So I'm sorry if I'm blunt but don't spend your time unhappy in life trying to change or hope for change in someone if he loves u as it meant to be it happen but before it totally gets you in bad situation emotionally, financially amd mentally gotta stop doing for him end the relationship but not the friendship amd focus on you a relationship is a 2 way street and it's clear he has no care compassion or even thinks about others. He's not worth the time he has contracted the raccoon MOJO so if you feed a raccoon or squirrel they will always expect you to keep giving g them food an take care them an they won't learn to take care them selves. But as a man it pains me to say this but in today's society people oblivious to life an what what men an women created as possibly the needle in haystack for actual relationship but live your life for you an be happy an the right man will encourage you emotionally mentally and physically ans always be there to support u no matter what I hope this help you think about thos is only my opinion in the end only you can decide am know what is best for you to be happy an what your mind an heart wants
What they never tell anyone with a TBI - stroke, brain damage, physical trauma - when being released from the hospital is that they have most likely lost all ability to emotionally regulate themselves. The neglect is a little atypical, but all the flares of temper are almost universal to people who have experienced a brain injury, and doubly so when they become stressed. 

This is not your fault. And your boyfriend needs to relearn these skills. We learn them when we are small children, as a grown man he can relearn them again.  I know people who have done it, one of them is my close friend who had two strokes in his early 30s over a decade ago.  Brain damage is not an excuse he can do this. 

Gently encourage him to seek out therapy or other assistance.
I think other people said all that needs to be said already. I just want to mention the difference in describing how you love your boyfriend and how you love your dog. I think this answers everything pretty quickly
If it makes it easier for you—if the roles are reversed, men ALWAYS choose themselves and they don’t feel bad about it. he would have probably not stayed in the first place (check out men who leave their sick wives).
Definitely break up with him.
Why are you still there?
That's a crazy amount of dedication and service to someone to whom you are not even married. He needs to lean on other people in his life not just you. You have done more than enough to get him on his feet, and you need to start prioritizing yourself again.
Are his parents around!? Maybe he could go live with them while he gets himself sorted. And you can move on with your life.
Bestie leave
If you are the one who usually takes the dog to the vet, I would suggest that you change the information on the microchip, or put one with your information on it. And if you break up with your boyfriend, take her with you. It sounds cruel, but clearly he does not have the ability to take care of himself (much less another living being) and it would be the best thing for the dog.
That is a tough situation. Im sorry you are living within it. I was partially ejected from a car in a motor vehicle collision (went through the windshield, but then smashed onto the hood  and stayed for whatever mysterious physics reason). The head injury was more severe than I could recognize. For close to three years afterwards, my family and loved ones had to deal with a me that was not really "me". The whole thing was a fog that I waded through. I was unkind, aggressive,  and generally emotionally unstable.

This brings me to your situation. I broke up with my girlfriend at the time for no other reason that I can recall, but that I felt like I was hard to be around. I still think it was the right call. She moved on and is happy with a family. She deserved to not live the rest of her life remembering what I was during that time. It would have been weird otherwise.

It is perfectly acceptable to take a break, or want to take a break from this. If holding on to the pupper is a hill that can't be climbed, so be it. He may need a constant to get himself through (unless the anger spikes put it in danger). 

TLDR: Recovery form brain-damaging issues can last for a long time and may very well change a person permanently. You should feel no guilt about assessing the situation and making what decision is right for you. 

Hope you are well, OP. And puppers. And him.
Was your boyfriend always like this? Unfortunately, brain damage can cause a change in personality for the worse. It can make people abusive and violent when they weren't before. He also sounds depressed, and why would he not be. A fat embolism is so dangerous, it kills. 

That said? You've done your duty. As much shit as your boyfriend has gone through, it doesn't mean you have to stay and get verbally abused and neglected. Don't feel guilty. You supported him in a tough spot. Now it's time to cut the chord and find happiness
Dump him.
There are a lot of great comments here. Please take a note from them!
Leave him.
I’m so sorry for this situation and I hope you can find the strength to leave. I’m telling you from experience it’s probably just going to get worse. You don’t deserve to waste years in this situation. You might be able to legally register the dog under your name online/in person. I total understand not wanting to leave the dog either. If your boyfriend has family then they can step in and take care of him because you absolutely do NOT deserve to deal with all of this and be fully financially supportive. You are being taken advantage of. My mother went through the same situation and she is sadly still in it. Please get out while you can. 🖤
This is all so horrible, I'm so sorry.  You've already done so much, and he's shown truly how little he actually cares about you. What happens if something like he's experienced happens to you? You won't be able to count on him to try to help in any way he can. I'm sorry, but you need to make people aware of how poorly he's treating you and secretly make an exit plan to get your ducks in a row and reduce his chances of trying to screw you over. He's selfish, if he can hinder you to maintain this lifestyle and keep you, then he will. You need to get out of there.
Do not under any circumstances let this man talk to you like he don't have no damn sense. You are busting your ass working 50 hours a day to come home to be ignored. You're giving him money taking care of his dog making sure that he has everything he needs and he is acting like an ungrateful bastard. Do not let him treat you like that you are worthy you deserve better you can have better. Start getting your ducks in a row life is too short to be miserable and to despise somebody who you supposed to love but they are draining you emotionally and financially and you are getting resentful. It's time to go trust me on that one he's ungrateful and when you call him out on his BS he blames it on his brain damage that's just an excuse to be mean and nasty do not put up with that leave or tell him he has to leave
I think you need to know what do you want. You can evaluate if you are hopeful that he will be back to the person that you fell in love with or whether you can be with him for the rest of your life. If no to either of the questions, then as much as it hurts you or him it’s better to quickly leave before you get even more unhappy
To what extent can you reasonably expect this situation to change for the better in future? This will need to end. He won’t get better with you in his life to enable his inertia. You can care for him, but this isn’t love.
I remember how jarring it was to hear one of my professors in college say that she understands when people get divorced after their partners suffer certain types of brain damage. More specifically the types that lead to personality changes, impulsivity, anger issues etc. Years later I understand what she meant. I’m not sure what type of brain damage he sustained, but know that he may not ever be the same person he was before the accident. Take care of yourself.
He needs help and you can’t provide it. Tell him, he’s changed for the worst and you can’t spend the rest of your life living with someone who abuses you. Tell him you’ll give him x amount of time (no more than 6 months but probably 3) to seek help and demonstrate change. You don’t expect him to go 100% back to his old self but it’s also not ok to treat you like dirt and blame the injury.
Try to get the dog legally in your name (offer to “buy” her under some bullshit pretenses with paying for the vet being easier or something) then keep her when you kick him to the curb. Just because he has a tbi doesn’t mean you’re trapped with him forever.
You need to leave. You're empathetic and compassionate. He'll suck you dry until you don't recognise yourself or feel any sense of joy. Leave. No contact. Get your own puppy and build your own life. You're going to meet someone that's going to treat you like the queen you are. 
I'm speaking from experience.
what do you wanna hear? You listed things that are a deal breaker. You know what to do.
You're too kind, don't be a doormat, its easy to do when you have lots of empathy and selflessness. People will take advantage, and that's what he's doing. You seem very kind. There is someone for you that will treat you with the same empathy and selflessness that you give, but that person isnt and probably wont ever be him. Cut your losses and move on from this guy. Youll be happy you did. Sorry this has happened to you :(
Quietly get your affairs in order. Slowly move anything important into a storage unit or a trusted friend/family apt. Develop an exit strategy. You have become his wallet, prepare for a very ugly breakup. Figure out how to break your lease as your last step. Tell them you're in the middle of a possibly abusive breakup and need discretion. 

This will not be easy. Rally your support system and stay strong. There will be people telling you not to "throw away" 3 years. They don't know your experience. They don't know what he's become. Your recent medical diagnosis would be a great "excuse" for finally pulling the plug. This relationship is dead. It's time to move on. Good luck.
He may indeed be right that his personality changes are due to brain damage.  There's also probably traumatic stress from the accident. 

But you did your job supporting him. You're not married. If he's not going to seek help especially,  you need to break up. You can do it in as gracious way as possible,  otherwise you're choosing to take on this life. I feel sorry for your bf, but two people don't have to be wrecked by the accident.
You should break up with him. 

And I know that gets thrown around a lot but why the hell would you want to stay in a situation where someone is sponging off you and spending your bill money on whatever they like, without telling you. This person didn't even bother to call you when you were in hospital and embarrasses you in public in a very degrading way. 

This is not the same person you started dating, clearly, and it is perfectly fine to end it. 

You are not happy.   
You can be happy, but not with him.
Please leave. I understand it’s a difficult situation, but do you want to be stuck in the same situation 5-10 years down the road? You stuck with him for so long, as I understand 1.5 years since he left the hospital and he has no regard to your wellbeing, even is you ask for it. He’s not the same man you fell for. I have no idea how you imagine your future, but can you imagine having kids with him? Going on a vacation? Would you enjoy your life in any sense? The situation is draining you slowly. I have no idea how your country works but he’s that debilitated by the damage, I’m sure he can get some kind of disability check. He’s perfectly comfortable, he has no worries at all since you take care of everything and take any disrespect. About the dog… just take them. If he pursues anything in a legal way, you can prove you paid for everything and he can’t even provide for himself, let alone for another being, leaving the dog with him would be straight up animal abuse.
Run away, leave him, save yourself! Courage to you!
Leave him.
Best of luck with the therapist. Really hope it helps.
I think you need to have a serious talk with your boyfriend. You could text him a few hours before you get home saying, 'We need to talk when I get back.' Don't say anything else.

Start with, 'I know this is going to be awkward, but please hear me out.' Just explain how you feel. Tell him something has to change. Don't start blaming him because he'll get defensive and play the victim, based on what you've told us. Ask him if there's anything you're doing that bothers him and that might justify how he treats you sometimes.

Be firm and be honest.

Tell him he needs to get his life together and that you'll be there to support him (like you always did), that it doesn't have to change overnight but that he needs to make small improvements each day, and that of course you're willing to change anything that bothers him (if there's anything at all).

If this doesn't work out, I think you know what's next. Whatever you do, good luck.
Nope, leave so he can be miserable with whoever he stays with. Can’t bite the hand that feeds you, anddd you’re dating? After all you did for him? Brain damage doesn’t give him the right to treat you like this, it seems he’s in his right mind despite having damage to the brain. That poor dog. 🥺 He needs some self healing. Love yourself first.
Girl dump his ass
For your own sake, just leave, recover and leave the past behind.
You've done everything for him and what has it got you? Is he in therapy or rehabilitation for his brain damage? As it seems to have completely changed his personality or he's just so used to being on his ass looking at his phone for entertainment. 

Whatever it is laziness or the brain damage he's not taking responsibility for himself and you're enabling it. Time to withdraw and set up to leave because he doesn't seem to want to get better and you can't force him to, but you can control how you react to this abuse. Yes abuse, this man is now abusive towards you.
Why be with someone who wont take care of you like you took care of them?
DTMFA!  Your boyfriend has shown you who he really is.  Believe him and move on for your own sanity's sake.
You may need a “judge Judy” situation. Break up and sue for the dog.
You need to leave, but are you actually safe to do so? Given his aggression, he could possibly become violent. Speak to family and friends. If you decide to confront him, then you really need to have someone on standby to help.

As for the dog, ideally you could take her but legally it could be an issue if the dog is his.
I am so sorry.

I will be honest, I only needed to read a small amount, I'm going to return and I'll edit this if my mind changes.

Brain injuries, in my opinion, can make you a new person. You might be the same experiencing being, but everything about you can be altered. Your brain is where you truly live. Death or change there, is death or change to who you are.

I'm so sorry he's different now. But you did not fall in love with this man. It is normal to not feel the same about a person when you like the same things you always did, but the things you liked about them are all different now.

He likely has more recovering to do, and I am sure with therapy and medical help he will see improvements, but I have outright stated to my partner; if I get a brain injury that makes me unpleasant (sadly this is common because impulse control and emotional regulation is often affected) he should leave me, without guilt or remorse. I want him to be happy, and the idea that I would one day not care about that breaks my heart.

Edit: when it comes to the dog: dogs do not like being around volatile people, just like in humans, it causes stress and it's traumatising. Check the law where you live, pets are often considered property so he could sue you for the cost of the dog etc. theoretically, but not get it back. In my country if the dog isnt chipped, and you have it chipped in your name, there is very little anyone can do. Flee in secret, you don't know his new mind and he doesn't sound all that safe to be around)
Talk to his family and see if he can be institutionalised for the time being, so that you can move on with your life while he tries to ut himself in order so he can work again or get a disability pension or something
Who's name is on the vet account for the dog? If it's your name, it's your dog.
It sounds like he is using the accident as an excuse to act however he wants. You don't need that parasyte, anyone who actually cared about you would've done the same for you when you were in the hospital, and would be grateful for everything you do
Dump his ass. If he's treating you like shit all the time, then he doesn't respect you the way you deserve.
What does your therapist think you should do?
...so.... why are you with him?
I went through a very similar experience. I don’t know if brain damage was truly to blame in mine or your situation, but it honestly doesn’t matter. Your boyfriend is being abusive and you deserve so much better.
Whether or not he has brain damage, you don't need to stay in a relationship with someone whom you don't love.   
  
 His brain injury seems to have reduced his emotional control. The games and such might help, but he seems to have become accustomed to using it as an excuse for his behavior, instead of trying to regain that function.   
  
 You're not married. You stood by him during his recovery. You have waited for him to take the initiative in maintaining your relationship.  He seems not to have that as a priority.

You have fulfilled your responsibility to the relationship. Unless you want to live like this for the rest of your life, you should move on. 

The dog situation is tricky. My only advice there is that if he is truly a sociopath, you might need to see to the safety of the dog in the process of leaving.
He is blaming being an A/hole on an accident but that will only work for so long. This is who he is now. He’s obviously well enough to drive etc so he could look for work, instead he chooses to sponge off OP while gaming like a teenager and treating OP like a servant.

Leave. Take the dog. Tell him that you’ve been paying for everything for him and the dog for months and months anyway as well as looking after her. Life will be so much better without him dragging you down and spending the money you work hard for.
You have to leave him. There is no fixing this. He needs mental and physical therapy, and lots of it, which he doesn't seem willi to do. As long as he has you to take care of him, he probably never will bc he has no reason to grow up. Cut the ties.
You deserve respect and support in a relationship. Therapy can help you navigate your feelings, but consider your happiness and whether staying is truly healthy for you.
It sounds like he has suffered a traumatic brain injury and that can ultimately change how a person acts. Being quick to anger is very common. I’m sorry you’re going thru this. I know r/TBI might be helpful as well
I'd leave. And I'd take the dog with me. I'd take any documents showing that you've been its been caretaker for the last 3 years. If he wants it so badly, I'd make him fight for it in a civil court. I doubt he'd put in that much, and the police generally don't get involved in pet custody disputes. It sounds like he has little love for the dog or anything at this point--I'm not sure what that accident did to him, but he sounds like a changed person.
The only way he'll improve is with therapy.  If he's refusing to go to that then you only have 2 options,  suck it up or leave. 

All you have been doing so far is enabling his behaviour. I 100% know you were trying to go your best by him so I'm not having a dig at you.
Leave him and take the dog with you, he will be busy playing Pokémon Go anyway.
I can't tell you what's right for you, i can only tell you what would be right for me. He has parents, and there's financial assistance for people in his situation, he's an adult and he can sprt his own life out. You're not his slave.

It'd be so hard for me to say goodbye to a dog i loved that much, but he might need the dog more, especially after you left, so i think I'd say goodbye and leave them both.

I really wouldn't have the patience for therapy if i was already so miserable. I know change is hard, but once you get things sorted, you'll feel an incredible weight lifted off you, and you'll move on. You'll find someone better, and maybe even get a new dog once you're ready, but trust me, those short-lived moments and a great dog aren't worth the misery
It sounds like this change in your boyfriend is permanent, you aren’t married and really didn’t sign up for him being this way forever. Brain damage behavior changes can often be a permanent, or very long lasting. 

I would personally have a conversation with him in public or over the phone about his behavior and give him the ultimatum, shape up or ship out. I say do it in a safe place because it seems like he is prone to outbursts and major mood swings, I wouldn’t want to tell him we are breaking up only for him to go ballistic and harm you. 

 It’s possible he is riding on the coat tales of his injury to be lazy and not care about his behaviors, maybe not but it’s a possibility. I would be careful going forward.
If this was your HUSBAND, I would feel differently, but you two are simply dating. You don't owe him loyalty without the commitment.
You need to break up with him, it's hard but he's not the man you fell in love with and while brain damage is affecting his behaviour that's not a reason for you to put up with it.
You have become his mother not his girlfriend.

Your relationship is over. You both should move on.
leave him. life is way too short to stay in a relationship that makes you miserable.

the longer you stay, the more unhappy you'll be, and eventually you'll look back and deeply regret all the time you wasted.
I ain't reading allat but i can tell you break up. Next question.
You've had lots of advice about your relationship so I just want to pick up on you having Graves disease. I have it to and stress is the number 1 enemy to Gravescand can actually trigger the condition in susceptible people .It is not some minor condition and people can beavers ill with heart problems and lots of other complications. Being under this sort of pressure in your relationship will not help you and even if you are able to get your levels on an even keel then this stress would likely have you relapsing .Graves in itself causes anxiety so for your own health you really have to put your self and your welll being first .
For the dog— is your name or his on the paperwork? He may have bought her… with your own money… but there may be a way around it so you can legally take the dog with you.
You take the dog to the vet? So the appointments and payment are in your name? That's your dog.
Why do you love him cause he doesn’t love you. He needs you but is ungrateful, mean, and taking advantage of you. Leave with the dog. He’s not able to take care of it anyway. He’s a leech, draining you of $, emotional health, self esteem. You shouldn’t carry him thru life. Where’s your self worth?  You deserve better. Leave.
Didn’t even finish reading this to know you should leave his ass
You 2 are not married, You can leave. I know there’s guilt in leaving because of the brain injury but YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH. You don’t need to stay & keep getting abused by this man. & I would take the dog !
Leave then. Why are you with someone you hate? You want to start your family with him? You want him to be your childrens' mentor and role model? What do you have to gain by staying with him?
Leave him. Steal the dog.
When I had a traumatic head injury I had a massive concussion. One of the FIRST recommendations my doctor said to me during my physical healing, was to immediately do rounds of CBT, and when my abilities change, to consider intense psychotherapy. LONG TERM. I was the same age as your boyfriend. Brain injuries can alter your personality permanently if you DONT seek intensive help. 


I don't even remember who I was during healing- I was SO MAD, SO ANGRY! I broke things and said things, DID things I am ashamed of today. Everytime I vomited, I WANTED TO FIGHT! I wanted to sleep with strangers. I isolated myself because I HATED everyone. Thankfully I was living alone so I was responsible for my own messes and never hurt anyone.

Early emotional therapy and mood regulation is key and I NEEDED that before I broke another cup/mirror or got into another relationship. I HATED THERAPY. But it helped me. Did it for a solid year no breaks. Hated my therapists (but I didn't, if you get what I mean).

Now I'm back to normal, Im back to myself. I still am in therapy because that injury actually sparked a bipolar diagnosis in me (I mood tracked for months before getting a proper diagnosis). I can handle stresses, I can manage my emotions by talking it out, and IF it comes to a head (haha), my loving counselor helps me get back on my feet.

My point being is.... 

Your partner needs an ultimatum NOW about intensive therapy. He's let it go for so long it's become a critical must. If he denies it, save yourself and leave. He will not get better since he doesn't realize he has you as his punching bag. Maybe later on you two can reconcile, but as it stands, he needs to either ACCEPT he needs help NOW or LATER without you.
OP it’s so awful you’re in this scenario. You deserve to be loved and cherished and taken care of, as you want to do with another. It’s horrible that your partner is dealing with so much struggle, but you can’t fix that for them. You need to love yourself and move on, even if it’s hard and sad. Hard can still be the right thing.
Ummm...leave!!!!
Run. Run before a kids comes into play.
yea i would leave, you can’t be worried about him, you leaving will force him to shape up.
That's a ducked up situation. On the one hand you want to stay dutiful and loyal, but in the other dude is giving you nothing to work with..and on top of that it may not be 100 percent his fault. ..fuck!!!
Leave. This is too much for girlfriend rates & I certainly wouldn't marry an aggressive brain-damaged man. Does he have family? This is ridiculous that it's fallen onto you to support him.
As simply a girlfriend, you’ve gone above and beyond for this guy. Time to focus on yourself.He doesn’t get to call the shots on your life, he hasn’t earned the right.No way should you still be financially supporting him. If he is disabled, then he should be filing for disability. Move on.
Yeah run away as fast as you can and don’t look back as hard as it may be
TBI
It doesn't seem like you've stated whether he is open to a psychiatrist or consulting a neurologist. You've been putting up with this for over a year now. You and him need to accept that he's never going to be the same as he was before. But that doesn't mean he can't adapt or learn to manage these changes. The biggest thing is his willingness. 

If I were in your shoes, I would have a heart to heart. Tell him how much you love him. Tell him how much you want to stick by him. But tell him that you can't continue to carry him through recovery. He has to care enough to get better. Express the way he makes you feel and be sensitive but bluntly honest. And if he isn't receptive to that, then make it an ultimatum.
His situation is sad, but you’re not the one who caused the accident. All you’ve done is love and support him. If someone loved me that much, I would treat them like gold and never let go. Instead, he’s emotionally and financially abusing you. He’s a draining individual that doesn’t appear to care about you anymore. It’s hard to say if this is the brain damage, or he’s just angry at the world because he got injured so badly. Either way, you’re not happy anymore and you deserve better. You only live once. I know stuff like this is hard. I just ended an 8 year relationship last year because she was a big ball of negative energy. She didn’t appreciate anything I did and she didn’t help around the house either. It all became so draining. I  am so much happier now without her. I only mention my experience because your boyfriend sounds even worse. Please rip the bandaid and leave him. It will be hard at first, but just surround yourself with friends and family. Go out and have fun. You sound great and you deserve to be happy.
Break up and go for a holiday. Enjoy your life.
The moment you feel hate, please end it.
It hurt when I read this. Please getbout of this relationship. Save yourself! It will get worse!
Leave. Literally every reasonable person who read your story would agree you were an incredibly loyal partner, but don’t owe this person the rest of your life. Of course ending a long term relationship is hard, but again there is nothing to feel guilty about. You did not abandon him. It sounds like this individual is physiologically incapable of supporting you (it’s the truth even if it’s “not his fault”). Continue therapy, leave knowing you did everything within reason you could, and find happiness again.
It's time to move on luckily you're not married. It's probably not his fault but it's not something you have to keep either.
Don’t stay out of guilt or because you feel obligated. You’ve done more than most people would. Since he prone to outbursts, I’d have an escape plan, then let him know. Good luck!
You need to get out of that relationship. Do it for yourself. You deserve better. And you’ll find that your life will be so much better
Sorry.
Girl brain damage is nothing to take likely. My father had a stroke a few years ago. His personality changed and it never went back to before. Every aspect of his personality was accenturated. He also was home for a year after his stroke and only watched television. He yelled A LOT. And he was pretty selfish. He wasnt thankful at all about me and my mom and what we were doing to try to help him. It was awful. He made our lives miserable.

I am in the medical field now and know that brain damage can cause this type of personality shift. The doctors back then did not tell us, even though it would have helped a lot. 

OP if he is treating you badly… You dont have to stay. You gave it a year. Thats really nice. You tried.
You helped him and payed for him. He SHOULD be thankful. With or without brain damage. Its your life. 

My father eventually got a bit better. But then he left my mom for a younger woman „because he was unhappy with his life“.
To this day i would not want to live with him. Me and my mom stayed far too long. 
If you’re unhappy , and if he’s treating you badly my advice would be leave. People will judge you but thats gonna pass. And what the heck do they know.
You need to Grow some Balls & leave that ABUSIVE MAN!!!!! Always remember to LOVE YOURSELF FIRST!!!
Your relationship looks more like supporting your small child. Paying for whatever he wants, accepting mood swings, letting him use his phone constantly without set boundaries. He’s acting as if you’re his mother now. Nothing good will come out if this. Just let him go respectfully and move on with your life. The title of your post says everything. You deserve to be happy, but according to what you posted, at the moment you’re not. Only you can take that first step to make a change. He won’t act, because he’s comfortable where he is.
It could be that the part of the brain that is responsible for empathy has become damaged .. I know it sounds bizarre but it can certainly happen .. however, that’s not an excuse!!! So you really need to put boundaries in place now, he can’t treat you like that.. I would take a break and ask him to leave to his parents house or something since he is not working etc and then go from there
Sweetie this is a hard one. You're mourning the relationship and the person he used to be, because if anything there was brain damage and it could've changed his personality. 

If that's the case the person you once knew is dead, could come back years from now but the current person is putting you through a form of emotional and financial abuse. 

My advice is to honestly break it off, heal by yourself for a bit and mourn the person you lost. After you're done with that you could try to be friends or move on completely. 

Again brain damage accidents are rough, as they can change a person and how they react. Sometimes it can be too much especially if they aren't treating others right. He should undoubtedly seek therapy and assistance for this.
Break up
I.have a TBI.  No excuse for his behavior in my mind.  While I still may miss so m e things, or not remember,  I always first apologize and then try to make it up somehow.  Even when in the hospital,  after regaining full consciousness and awareness.   Poopoop on him.  That's sad and too bad.  Has he had therapy?  T he multiple same sort of message being sent my way g ot through to me and woke me up.  Now I try to pay attention the first time!.
It sounds to me like substance abuse issues. Pain pills if he's on them can cause wild mood swings. But if he's making you that miserable and he's not even trying to change it. Then you have your answer.
Time to go. This is the very unfortunate thing about brain damage, it is common for this behavior to result. If your partner is unwilling to seek therapy and be open to the fact that his symptoms are leaking into being an abusive partner, you can't move forward together. You get 1 life and 1 life only. At the end of it, only you will be there to look back on all of the choices you made and decide that you were satisfied with them. Will your future self say "yes" to spending the next 30-40+ years with this person?

This person will continue living. He will *have* to start taking care of himself. In some ways, your enabling behavior may be the 1 thing standing between him and resolving these issues. It's time to step aside and let nature take its course. 

I am so sorry this happened to you. It is devastating and I commend you for sticking around, that had to be so hard to do. But it is time to take care of you now, and nobody is going to come save you from yourself.
The brain damage probably caused self control and anger management systems to get futzed. It happened to someone I know who had a stroke.


He needs professional help which is difficult to get in our medical system without buckets of money.
Leave and take the dog with you. If he cannot support or take care of her and you can prove that you have the entire time, the dog should go with you. Sounds like the dog would be left in a bad situation.
You aren’t married, you didn’t promised to care for him in sickness and health. Leave and do NOT take the dog. That’s his dog and fighting for it will make things worse for you.
Why still with him tho?
He is not willing to do the work to make himself better. Is he doing therapy, taking a part time job reading books and attempting to learn new things? If not it is time to say goodbye. Tell him you are his partner and not his mommy and he will not get well until he is forced to and you have already spent enough time and energy on a deadbeat
It’s worth considering whether he can reasonably continue in a long term relationship that ideally is ordered toward marriage. He seems to have significant brain damage which is impairing his functioning and will have significant impacts on his ability to contribute to a marriage.

I say this as a person with mild brain damage: it is very hard to control emotions and prioritize tasks. And if you let nature take its course, it does not get any better. It requires serious intervention from medical professionals to make progress. Brain damage effectively shuts off decision making at times. While his situation is pitiable, I don’t know that you have any further responsibility here as you are not married.
“I hate my boyfriend” means your relationship is done. Just be done.
Well the accident wasn't your boyfriend's fault at all and it's absolutely amazing that you've been there for him to the degree that you have. However he's responsible for recovering afterwards. He needs to be active if he can and he also needs to address the depression and the trauma that he's gone through. You cannot do that for him, he has to do the work. But you don't have to give him your health and happiness at this point. He's an adult and he needs to figure out a support system for himself and implement that and begin healing. Or not, it's his choice. But you can't give from an empty well and it sounds like that's where you're almost at. He needs to contact his family or our social services.
Why the best girls always end up with the shittiest dudes
You don’t have to put up with that or deserve it. Leave him and maybe since he won’t be able to afford anything he will let you have the dog later or you can watch the pounds for her. 

You don’t get a lot of time on this Earth and spending it miserable isn’t the way to go.
I’m so sorry you are having to go through this. You sound like an amazingly caring person and the dog makes me the most sad for you. I don’t want to imply that you could ever replace her but here will be another doggos in your future. Keep your eyes forward because you know what you need to do for your own wellbeing or you wouldn’t have come here asking. I have faith that someone as generous and loving as you are will find happiness.
You don't owe him the rest of your life simply because he had an accident and you feel obligated to stay. You aren't obligated.

It does not sound like things are going to get better, or that he's working on improving. Time to go.
I got half way through this and couldn't finish it. If half of what you said was true then just leave him alone. At the end of the day you can only do so much. If it starts or is already tearing you apart it will only get worse. He's clearly not happy himself and no matter what you have done to help him (if all this is true) is not going to change anything. 

At some point you need to live your life and enjoy it. It's not being selfish. It's making sure you get what you deserve and not feel like a POS every time you wake up in the morning. 

This is life. Maybe we get reincarnated. Maybe not. Maybe we got heaven. Maybe not. So you better start living the life you want to live. A good and happy life is what most people want so embrace it.
Consider setting him up on disability and home health care.  And leave.  And take that beautiful baby boxer and get her a pink leash.  And you two walk into the sunset.
This is my advice.

You've done more for him than most families would do for their offspring. That is honorable of you and shows great character. He has suffered greatly, but less so from your efforts.

I was leaning towards staying together until reading his refusal to go to therapy. He is clearly comfortable and doesn't wish to improve the situation. His behaviors also seem to be trending towards abusive. If he is unable or unwilling to make changes, this relationship will continue to trend downward and, eventually, drag you down to a breaking point.

In this situation the best option would be to break things off with him. None of this is your fault when it comes to his decisions, you've done more than most. Continue to encourage therapy and give the relationship a clean break. Things could get ugly if he sees it coming.

I'd suggest you keep going to therapy on your own as well. This is a very traumatic situation that's going to take some time to heal.
Did he hit his head?  (I am only asking because my little sister's personality did a 180 when she got a concussion.)
What are you getting out of this relationship?

You give him money. You give him attention. You give him understanding. What do you get? 

You give him tons of benefit of the doubt. 

Which gives him lots of benefits

And gives you lots of doubt.

Get out
Having brain damage is no excuse for him to treat you like this at all. I’ve seen Dementia and Alzheimer’s patients with more grace, decorum and love than your boyfriend. 

Hopefully you make him an ex boyfriend soon. 

If you can prove that he isn’t looking after his dog properly and is neglecting it i’m sure you can apply legally for that dog to come with you when you leave
Leave his sorry ass. Date someone who would chairish  and admire you. Women stop putting up with neglectful and abusive asshats.
As someone who was in a bad wreck and got a traumatic brain injury, please leave this man. Brain damage is not an excuse to be a mean hateful person. My personality changed after my wreck. I had to go to tons of therapy to deal with it, how it changed me, relearning how to do things. And it was never an excuse to treat people poorly. You deserve better.
Forget about it girl you tried your best to take care of them. It is not appreciated. Leave that whack ass nigga. You don’t deserve someone like that. Girl, you deserve someone better. I would hate him too. I don’t care how brain damage or how mute and how sick you are and if you have cancer, etc that doesn’t excuse his behavior and the fact that he’s manipulating you fuck him
I understand you leaving him and this isn't directed at you. However it is directed at these commenter's. Usually when I read some annoying shit on here I just scroll by but the ignorance in this thread has actually got my blood boiling from the way people here talk about brain damage, most of yall have never had a loved one experience this and it shows apparently we need a psa about individuals with brain damage.
Bit late, but you're 29 and sound like a decent person. If he couldn't be bothered to drive 4 hours to see you, let alone call you, then he's probably not the one.


Also, if you need to let him keep the dog, it will be hard, but better than being trapped in a husk of a former relationship for a good majority of your 30's (or more)
Also, I think it could be worth seeing if you could take the dog, possibly with the assistance of the police. If you cite his anger issues and lack of self care, the law might take your side.


I can't imagine that the fact he paid money to buy the dog would outweigh the animal's wellbeing. If he refused to spend money on an electric bill,  he may well not pay for dog food / vet bills etc.


I'd consult a lawyer or someone similar first though. These are only my initial thoughts, and am definitely not a lawyer myself
you should prolly break up with him if you hate him
Get the dog registered in your name then leave.
It seems that if he can drive he can work at least part time. 

It is not your responsibility to take care of a BF who is neglectful or abusive. Much of his behavior might be because of brain injury or other might not. Honestly, it sounds like internet addiction. None of this means you are responsible for him.  

If you are in America and he has had a brain injury, he had a case manager at the hospital. They can probably still help you. Email that person. Tell them that you want to leave him and he needs housing and income.  You can leave before it falls into place.  

Does he have parents?
If you hate your boyfriend break up! It's that simple. You're still young do it now while it's easier don't just keep waiting.
It sounds like the brain damage ran deep. Brain injuries can be terrifying at times, both for the person with one & the ones who love them. 
 It sounds like you've done more than enough to back him. How much help from the medical side of life has he had since? Add into that mental health. It seems he ought to be assessed since that's vastly scary behaviour. Is it just you that he shouts at? 

 As for the relationship, I'll be blunt. I've learnt a lot over the years, in some terrible ways. Be honest with yourself & ask where you'll be in five years time- with him, or without him. Take your time, maybe keep anything you write down away from him, at work perhaps. Look at it that way. All honest pros & cons. It'll make it clearer. Don't make it what you wish or want could happen, just what you know will happen. 
 Then you'll have more of an idea of what to do next. In the meantime maybe talk to a dr about his behaviour.
There is nothing left for you in this relationship. You do not need to feel bad about leaving. Please heal yourself.
Bro, it’s time to leave. I had to do the same to some I loved immensely. But they were such a drain. It took a while to recover from the love but when you do, omg it will be come enlightening. 

You will find love again. This man is not worth his weight in gold. He’s become a cold black price of coal you need throw in the fire and let it burn away from you. 

Time to release, move on and start fresh.
Two words: Self Care. 

You don’t need to convince an internet full of strangers that you stood by him. Thank God, he’s recovering.  

But you need a life of happiness and fulfillment. Here it is:

YOU ARE ABSOLVED OF GUILT FOR WHAT HAPPENED.
I’m a big believer that if you really love somebody you will stay with them through sickness and health even without being married, but no one should feel obligated to stay through emotional abuse. It’s hard to hear but that’s what he is doing to you. It sucks what happened to your boyfriend 
and it sucks that he will likely never be the same, brain injuries can permanently affect someone’s personality and usually for the worse. Still, this is not your fault and you are not doing him any favors enabling his behavior anyways. You can get another dog you will love just as much but you can’t get back years wasted.
What do you mean “calling my boyfriend out of his name”. You said it also “he will also call me out of my name..”. Not sure what this expression means.
If you met him now you would not date him. Your loyalty is admirable but now I’d consider how things are now, how you weren’t supported during your health issues and how this “new normal “ is probably permanent. Really what you want to sign up for permanently?
Ever consider he night have developed a tolerance to pain meds? Explains everything if he's dealing with addiction on any level...
The truth is that person you knew is gone, consider him dead, he is just a shard of his former self. You need to remember the good memories not the bad ones, and now the bad outweighs the good.. you should have left the second that started happening, I knew someone in a similar situation, my best friend’s girl friend left him for someone else after he was in an accident(for someone else I knew in middle school who ironically tried to steal his other girlfriend at the time) my other friend went out of his way to tell her and her new boyfriend things ridiculing them, I don’t blame her, it’s just a cruel reminder of what was once good, sometimes relationships end in the most horrific way possible, you said you looked at him and didn’t recognize him, it sucks, I know the feeling. Now I’ve tried to move on and on occasion check to see how my bed ridden friend is doing, it puts me in a odd situation but the way I think about it is that the person I knew is dead I’m just here for his family. You need to move on.
Get rid. Move on.
You only live once. If he’s not appreciate of what you’ve done and what you do now, he doesn’t deserve you
Get out now. Your memory is not current reality.
Sounds like you are more worried about leaving the dog than leaving him. To me that's really a tell tale sign that you should leave the relationship, you already have one foot out the door... You've stuck around and gave it a good shot. It's not your fault. 

It might really hurt leaving the dog like that, as the dog is obviously innocent in this whole thing but what other choice is there? Steal the dog and run away??? I don't think that's really an option. But I also don't think you should stick around because you have such a strong connection to the dog and the dog has connection with you. It's a shitty situation, but it's one you need to leave so your own healing process can begin and you can find a loving relationship.

You could try couples counseling or something and tell him you are very close to leaving if he is unable to change, but it sounds like you have already given him ample opportunity again and again to show change and it hasn't come.
You're a great girlfriend and would be a great wife for the right guy for you.   Unfortunately your boyfriend will not change for the better.   You can't change him.  You need to figure out an exit plan and break up with him.   If you keep living with him long term , it will get worse for you.  Don't feel guilty about him.  He is not doing his part, and you can't fix him.  You need to take care of yourself and your health.   Good luck.
Do not let your love for the dog trap you into staying with someone who does not care for you. 


Whether he does not care for you because of damage is irrelevant. You aren't married. You took no oath to support him. You're free to leave knowing you have gone above and beyond the necessary here. 


Picture your life in 10 years- he will not change as long as he is comfortable, and you will still be stick being miserable. 
Load up your stuff and the pup and disappear into the sunset girl.
Time to cut the cord. You can't destroy your life to make his good. You won't ever be happy again. Pets eventually pass. Better to go your own way before it completely consumes you and ruins your life completely.  Our days are numbered on this planet and the window of happiness is shorter and shorter the older we get. It will hurt now but in 7 years when your dog passes and all you're left with is abuse all you will have left is remorse, pain and loneliness. Get through the pain now and live your life to the fullest. Don't destroy yourself for anyone or anything.
I went thru the same kinda shit. Just drop him girl and live a better life.
As the other comments have said, brain damage can seriously change someone’s mood, it really changed mine. But it’s better now, still not great tho. 

OP please leave, you have been there for him when he needed you the most, now you have done your job and it’s time to leave. 
This is not serving you at all
I grew up in a household with a father who was brain injured in a car accident. All I’m going to say is leave him. For your good and the good of any kids you might end up having in the future. What you are seeing is a result of the brain injury and it’s not going to get any better. You’re not married to him you have no obligation to stay with him. The man you fell in love with is NOT the same person he is now, it is an entirely different person. There will be no way to reason with him, no way for him to understand where you are coming from or have empathy. You do not want a life with him in the future. Trust me.
Run
You need to sit down with him, raise these concerns and provide an ultimatum, sort your shit or I’m out.  

I think he needs some self reflection and first and foremost a job. At this stage any type of employment will do even part-time work which he can build up to full time employment. That will at least save your money that you don’t have to spend on him. 

I would suggest counselling and set strong expectations with him yelling at you particularly in public will not be tolerated. If he is not prepared to make these changes, leave him.
You can forgive yourself if you break up with your bf. You essentially spent a year grieving his loss because he is truly not himself anymore. He died that day spiritually, and only his body is acting at the moment. Your bf before he died would not want to be remembered as an abusive jerk to the one he loved. You deserve to leave safely from this relationship
I think you could argue he can’t care for the dog. Nor would the dog be interested in him.
Oof I've been there. I look forward to the update where you are happily living for yourself. I once read a saying "you can tell how much a woman loves herself by the partner she chooses". I hope you and your therapist really build a sense of love and responsibility for your own happiness.
Think about what keeps you in this relationship. Is any of this good for you? It doesn't sound like you're getting anything from him, but grief and pain. His accident was not your fault, you don't need to be there for the aftermath. Take care of yourself, and be happy. 

I worked in a nursing home that had a resident who was in his 30's. He had brain damage from a military op back during Desert Storm. He was no longer able to care for his wife and family. As heart breaking as it was...they had to take him there for professional help. He had the tantrums of a child with the body of a grown man. I don't know what you're BF is dealing with...but it might be similar. It's not on you to be his caregiver. Let those with the training and resources (or family) take him. Good luck to you
Sounds like this one has run its course.
You're not married. You're not happy. 
Leave him and never look back. Life is far too short to be miserable. Let him wallow is self-pity alone.
You’re not his wife and you’re doing all these wifey duties. It’s time to let him go because you’ve done enough for him already and it sounds like he takes you for granted. Let his parents and friends take care of him and you go on with your life. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you.
Leave this abusive POS. He obviously doesn’t love or respect you. You’re still young, go find someone who values your company.
Leave him. Point blank period
This is a waste of your time and will end up being damaging to you in multiple ways. 
Sounds like you're more sad about breaking up with the dog rather than the guy so that's good.
Who's name is on the vet account? Steal the dog and leave.
It's quite possible that on top of the TBI he's also medically depressed. It honestly sounds like it. Why don't you stop giving him stuff and see how he changes towards you? He may need a gentle push to get back to "normal". If he doesn't take that well, or if he doesn't change, it's okay to walk away. You didn't vow to love him for a lifetime yet. I get that sounds harsh but you didn't and so it's okay to make sure you're taken care of (emotionally, physically and financially) and it sounds like a major drain to you right now. Doing nothing isn't okay for either of you though. You need some sort of forward momentum because quite honestly, he is stuck.
You hold all of the cards in this. I know he was injured but it’s okay to realize that a relationship no longer serves you and you need to leave. Sounds like it’s about that time.
Brain damage, while an incredible trauma, is no excuse to mistreat someone like this, especially for such an extended length of time, all while he has clearly regained the cognitive ability to function semi-normally otherwise. Brain damage and head trauma victims’ personalities can drastically change after their accidents, with being quick to anger presenting as a common symptom. However, this does not excuse him from taking responsibility for his actions toward you, or from at least seeking therapeutic or psychiatric help to manage his outbursts. While providing for him financially during his extended recovery was very generous of you, you owe him nothing and he has clearly become comfortable taking advantage of you facilitating his lifestyle. He’s a grown adult, and if he can’t provide for himself he will have to lean on his own family and friends and learn how to “adult” again so to speak, once you leave him (which I sincerely hope you do). He isn’t your burden or cross to bear, and you deserve to find a partner who values you enough to call you when you’re in the hospital for Christ sake. Don’t continue to waste your time, energy and funds on someone who has openly admitted to being a sociopath, head injury or not. You deserve so much more. 

If you do decide to end the relationship, I would plan a so-called “escape route” in advance, such as cutting him off from bank accounts, making sure your friends/family know what is going on in case you need immediate support, etc. I say this because his behavior sounds extremely verbally abusive, and when he realizes he’s being cut off, he could get violent. Make sure to protect yourself.
He doesn’t care about you!   
I would drive 8 +hour to visit my gf or my best friend in the hospital…
You can love someone and have empathy for their situation but that doesn’t mean you have to stay and suffer along with them. You have done everything you can and if the relationship is hurting you mentally and financially, it’s okay to let it go. 

Side note, is he getting anything from insurance for the accident? He should be entitled to damages and the lasting effect on his quality of life and relationships? If he is not able to work he should be able to get disability as well? If he can’t take care of himself/apartment he might also be able to get a care giver? You aren’t responsible for supporting him because of the accident.
LEAVE HIM. I cannot emphasize this enough. I was you once. LEAVE. HIM. He will NOT change. Life is too short to be with someone who treats you like this.
I get the feeling that you are just staying for a sense of duty. But I think your relationship died long ago. Please take care of yourself. First find a new place, move your stuff in small batches and then leave, to never look back. As for the dog, lets hope when he has zero money and support, he might surrender it to someone or maybe you. You took care of him for a year, now is your turn to take care of yourself and be happy.
Don't feel like you are a bad person if you dip out. Sounds like it was almost certainly the accident that changed his personality, but we don't have to be with people. It's your life, and as far as we can tell for certain we only get one. Don't waste your time. It's unfortunate what happened to him, but he sounds capable in most cases. Is the brain damage keeping him from getting a job? Not your problem. 

Live your life. Be happy. Sucks the dude is an asshole now, but he is not your responsibility.
Sounds like there may have been brain damage. You were his angel and did everything you could for him. Now, however, you are sacrificing your life, happiness, and peace of mind for no good reason. 
Time to move on. 
Contact Social Services in your town / county for a list if resources for him. 
Then pack up and go live your best life.
I would make your plans to leave. He isn’t contributing to your home life or your relationship. You are for too young to saddle yourself with him. His anger could escalate and he could harm you. I would find another place to live. Move most of you belongings and then let him know that this relationship is no longer working tor you. He will have to make other housing arrangements.  Take the dog. He has no job and therefore cannot care for her. Dont leave your forwarding address. 
Best of luck.
You are in a 1 sided relationship. You are putting everything into it and he is not contributing at all. Time to end it and move on. You will only resent him more as time goes by
Time to break up. This is not working. 
Why are you asking us strangers, when you *know* what to do? It seems people hear, and understand their inner voice; that compass telling them which direction to go. Why don’t they listen to the inner knowing?
A friends father was in a horrible auto accident and ended up in a coma for several weeks if I remember correctly, could be months, but I don’t think so. Anyway, his accident gave him some brain damage and it totally changed his personality. He went from fun loving husband and father to down right mean and nasty. My friend can’t go home without being accused of stealing something. He yells and screams at his wife, while she has made the determination to stay and care for him she had already invested 25-30 years in their marriage. You, on the other hand are not married and while you have been together for what I would consider a significant amount of time, you need to make yourself happy. In my own marriage I was very discontented and even though I wished to wander and do other things I had made a commitment before god and our entire extended families and our friends. It took me over 10 years to finally decide that it was never going to get better despite couples counseling and commitments to making things work. At the end of it all we would always just fall into this comfort zone which never addressed our core problems. It’s going to be a difficult decision to leave and also to stay. If you stay you should be committed to seeing this through no matter what, but he has no real incentive to be helpful and to find gainful employment. I get it that he has had trauma to the brain, but there are resources work shops who’s sole purpose of helping individuals like this get back some dignity. I get the sense that he sees this as a meal ticket while also having the personality changes and the great internet sucking on his soul like one of Azkaban’s own Dementors.
You have done your part. You do not need to make the rest of your life about this man. Please, leave and get counselling to deal with any unwarranted guilt and live a life worth living. You are not a bad person.
I have brain damage, your boyfriend is a c•ck sucking a••hole. “Oh brain damage is the reason I’m a c••t so you have to put up with it”, here mate, let me show you real brain damage. Let’s find a lovely hard and very solid brick to throw at his head
He’s gone the man you fell for died in the car that day, I’m sorry but the damage done to his brain has changed him into a completely different person
OMG LEAVE NOW!!!

Traumatic brain damage is very common among psychopathic killers. The name list is sooooo long. Prisons are full of criminals with TBI. It causes them lose impulse control and empathy which is the worst combo you can get. Granted, not everyone, who suffers head trauma/brain injury ends up like that, far from it. BUT HE'S CLEARLY DISPLAYING THE SIGNS.

GET OUT. 

Don't tell him anything prior, just pack up your things, the dog(for their safety), and leave. You are currently his piggybank and his lifeline, so he will 100% have a huge reaction to you leaving. 

SO DON'T TELL HIM, THAT'S DANGEROUS.

We can't know how bad he could get, but your situation is absolutely dangerous for you.
Time to say goodbye
Yeah it's time for him to go. You nursed him through his accident, things aren't good now, it's time to move on. You aren't obligated to put up with being unhappy for the rest of your life because he got hurt once.
Was a trauma nurse for many years and have seen the unfortunate change in patients personalities. They can be profound. Short tempered, rude, can get physical at times. Depending on area of brain damage, some go the other way, weepy, needy and need constant attention. These changes they experience aren’t their fault sometimes. I would let him know that you understand he has a TBI, but if he doesn’t get help you will no longer tolerate it. Call him on sh$t. You’re very young and don’t deserve to be miserable. Swipe the dog!!!!!
maybe there is a chance that the story has been exaggerated from her side so that she can come in terms with the truth (she is exhausted from financially helping him). or maybe not but on the off chance just try to be honest. its well documented that women leave men at a much higher rate when they’re jobless (but not the other way around). it’s okay if you find it unattractive but please don’t lie to yourself
He’s never going to change if you keep enabling him. If it were me, I’d come up with an exit plan ASAP and lay it straight to him. Nobody deserves to be miserable like that, I don’t care what the circumstances are. As for the dog, maybe try to work out an agreement with him. I mean hell, if he’s already spending your money anyways, I’m sure you’re somebody that would be open to flat out buying the dog from him. Being that he’s out of work with nowhere to go at that point, I’m sure he’d take whatever he could get.
Girl, LEAVEEEE!! Take the dog and LEAVVVEEEE!! Please do this for yourself. He clearly has no caring or feelings for you didn’t even call when you were in the hospital so that shit. You need to do what makes you happy you’re 29 years into this life, and you can either stay and be miserable. Because it’s not gonna get better. I can promise you that. Or you can go and make your life happy because at the end of the day that’s really all you got. I just left that was miserable after five years and I can’t tell you how relieved I am daily that I got out of that. It’s amazing. DO IT!!
Sad situation but people personalities can change from accidents and brain damage, your life must come first and it sounds like it's best to end the relationship. 

It sounds like your partner is vulnerable so I'd suggest making sure he has a support from family or local authorities as you go through this change so you both can live happy lives
Yea I would 🏃
This sounds awful. I hope you find a way to leave him because you deserve so much better.
That has to be an extremely rough situation.  I am sincerely sorry to hear how much this bothers you.

First of all, YOU ARE WORTHY.  You are deserving of love and respect and you are within you right to expect this from your partner.  You are not a bad girlfriend for wanting this.  You have also overextended yourself to the point it is affecting your own mental health.

My friend, people change.  What he experienced has really changed the person he is.  If he is unwilling to seek therapy for himself, that is a choice he has made for himself.  It isn't your responsibility to monitor this for him.

You are not a bad person if you need to separate yourself from the situation.  Yes, you will grieve over the loss of a relationship.  Yes, you are going to feel guilty for "abandoning" him.  However, if you choose not to take care of your needs, your resentment is going to continue to grow.  It won't be good for either of you.

You have some touch choices to make for yourself.  But only you can determine what you are going to do and what you are willing to put up with.  By continuing to care for him as you do and tend to his needs, you are enabling him to continue his behaviors, so why should he change?  He can treat you as badly as he wants and he knows you aren't going anywhere.  Only you have the ability to change that.

Please don't endanger yourself.  If things go poorly, when you make your decisions, solicit the support and help of friends and family to be present and available as needed.  Protect yourself at all costs.

Best of luck to you.
TBIs can cause drastic changes in behavior and personality. He may need to go back to the doctor and see if it's reversible through surgery or medication. If not, I'd leave him. It's unlikely to improve if doctors can't help. And even if it does, it'll probably take the better part of 20 years because of how slow the brain grows and changes.
Time to move on.
As much as you can start living and learning and loving. My heart hurts for you. You deserve better. Please do for you more🩷🩷🩷🩷⚡️⚡️⚡️
I spent nearly four years in an abusive relationship with a man I absolutely loathed.  He had been in a motorcycle accident and also had a TBI.  My mother constantly tried to make me feel sympathy for him, because "he couldn't help it, he had brain damage."  Maybe this was the reason he was such a dick, but maybe he was just simply a bad person.  No matter what the reason was, it did not make the abuse okay.  It did not get better with time, it got worse, and I got more stuck.  I planned my escape plan and got the eff out of there and never looked back.  

Please, OP, do the same before it gets worse.
It’s been a long time since my Biological Psychology studies and now work with children. However significant damage to the brain can change someones personality, brain damage can lead to long-term psychiatric disorders and make you a completely different person depending on the damage, injury area/what part of the brain has been affected. 

Cognitive impairment after severe injury is likely to include impaired speed of information processing, poor memory and executive problems. Personality change may include poor motivation, and a tendency to be self-centred and less aware of the needs of others. They may be described as lazy, thoughtless, aggressive, agitated and more.

I’m so sorry that you have to go through this, you sound like a very caring person. Depending on the type of injury i can’t make a guess on how his temperament will improve with treatment, but it depends how much you’re willing to stay and see if it does improve. 

Sending you lots of love
I'm sorry to hear your story I'm 36m
To me I think you need a break and see how things goes
You are an incredible partner. Man did not realize that women like you still existed. He's going to regret the things he has done to you later. Right now, he doesn't see it, but Karma will show him. 

Your happiness comes first, and you are unhappy, don't settle. Move on and heal up, and find someone who will appreciate everything you do for them 💯.
I have been in a very similar situation.And I have a good friend.Tell me that love doesn't hurt. Those were powerful words and they ring in my head like a bell but they were very true.  So that's my suggestion to you is to sit down and have an honest conversation with yourself and ask yourself.If this is something that I can live with for the rest of my life and if it's not you'll have to move on. It is difficult to hear and to accept but it is a true fact.  Your own self sanity is more important.
Go and be good to yourself.  I am having to swallow this bitter pill that I'm giving to you right now in my life, Love yourself.
oh honey you are not stuck there. he is not your responsibility. life is short.  do you really want to live like this??  break up and move on.  it's ok to do that.  your life is yours
This sounds like brain damage. I’d talk to a medical professional about the prognosis. 

You are not married to him, you don’t seem to share kids, and his unwillingness to work (may be inability to work) is an unexpected burden. 

His parents should take responsibility. They are his legal next of kin. They can consider being appointed as his legal guardians if the brain damage renders him unfit for employment. His problem with self regulation suggests that’s possible. They can and should arrange for his future. 

IF he isn’t make an effort to recover that he could and should be making, your departure from his life could be the wake up call he needs to make the effort. I personally can’t know if there’s a chance for those, but it will be the best thing for him if it is something he can do and he decides to do it. His life isn’t so great right now, living with himself as he is.

Good luck, whatever you decide.
Run.
Leave
It's not unusual that a brain damage makes people a different person. 

It's not an excuse, but the brain damage does explain the mood changes, excessive spending and everything else.

I don't imagine anyone would fault you, for breaking up. The guy you are with, is not the same you fell in love with.

You haven't had a whole life together, and you have your future ahead of you. Don't spend it with someone who isn't treating you right.
Is this really what you want for the rest of your life?
maybe i’m too young to be giving advice (18) but girl you NEED to get out of that relationship. he doesn’t seem stable and if he’s this aggressive around you for such little things, who’s to say what’ll happen if he gets really mad specifically when  you’re alone with him. you need to stay safe and look out for yourself before him. he’s blaming everything on his injuries and he thinks he can get away with anything. if you leave, i recommend take necessities obvi and valuable things with you to stay somewhere else like maybe something special to you AND definitely the dog. i wish you luck and please be safe.
Take your pooch and leave him.  You deserve happiness just as much as anyone else xxx
Ask him to go with you to relationship counselling to get help to sort all of this out and ask him how he came to the conclusion that he is a sociopath. It is a good idea for you to look up traits of a sociopath so that you can tell if he is one. If the counselling doesn't work leave him, or/and if he is a sociopath leave him and get yourself a dog. Staying for the dog won't be worth it.
TBIs can change a person drastically, especially those that damage the frontal lobe which helps regulate emotions and inhibit our behavior. You’re in a tough situation and this isn’t something therapy can fix for him. I’m sorry you’re going through this.
that man does not like you. leave asap
Brain damage or not? Brain damage is brain damage, in 2024 I think we can say this is a thing. If she doesn’t want to deal with it that’s ok but obviously the dude is not himself. Brain injuries can change personalities and cause outbursts and irritability. Making someone unrecognizable. Relationships are hard enough without a complete reset of who somebody is and how they react to the world.
Your post title really says it all.
Break up with him
As someone who is five years out from having my severe TBI, my best advice for you is to cut your losses now. He'll figure it out, you need to think about you. Especially,  if you want to get married and/or start a family. I acted the exact same way after my TBI that your bf is acting now. Unfortunately, it's taken me this entire time,  all 5+ years and counting,  to feel even a little bit like my old self. But ask me to go grocery shopping and I'll spend an entire afternoon trying my best and still coming out of the store with nothing but a seltzer water in my hand and a confused, exhausted look on my face- it's fucking awful. But it's not your problem,  OP, it's time to put yourself first and get out before wasting another precious day! It'll also allow him the time to figure out a "new normal" for himself. And if you feel guilty, think of it this way: it wouldn't be fair for him to have a partner that's going to compare who he is now with who he used to be. A break will give him the space to find a partner that knows and will grow to love the man he is now and it'll allow you the freedom to flourish. Good luck.
This is my throwaway account, but I want to post my take on your all’s situation.  
For a bit of my frame of reference I work with people with traumatic brain injuries “TBI” and behavioral disorders. 
It’s really challenging for them, across the board.  One of the hallmarks is that individuals with TBI tend to lose most of their ability to have impulse control.  I’ve seen many just absolutely blow a gasket over situations that most would consider to be an inconvenience.  And then needing a 30-45 minute conversation to help them come down from their heightened emotional state. 

Can’t advocate staying or leaving, but he will likely always struggle with these issues. One of my clients with a TBI calls it his “Cadillac Syndrome”.  *was hit by a Cadillac*.  He was just a normal dude and after his incident essentially became a liken to a special needs individual.  

He was blessed to have you in his corner and helping him through the worst of his recovery.  But he’s not that person anymore. 
There will be fragments of him left and he will have some memories of how he used to be and will live with knowing what’s he’s lost of himself.  

Staying with him will be an act of love and sacrifice, but not one that you have to make for yourself. 

In the note of your dog.  I see why you’d want to keep her.  Id like to propose that there’s also a possibility that him keeping the dog could be a boon for him, because his TBI has pretty much destroyed his ability to have a “normal” relationship for the remainder of his life.   And the dog could do a lot of good for him, psychologically speaking.  
Granted, if he isn’t good to the dog, hurting her, etc, obviously take her.

But his guy is going to be a shell of his former self. 
I know a lot of commentators are saying to screw the dudes feelings, and fair enough, but you’re going to be much more able and successful at moving on and having a brighter future, if you choose leaving.  He’s not going to have that same outlook, sadly.  

I wish you both the best, regardless.
Get away. He will run you into the ground and remind you what soil is - as he is clearly doing it already.
You've done the hard yards and were there for him when it mattered most. No one can say otherwise.

Simple fact now is he's a different person to who you fell for 3 years ago and you're basically being used and abused.

Zero shame or judgement for leaving that shitty situation. You've spent your time dedicating yourself to him. Now it's time to dedicate yourself to you.

You're young and seem successful. Go start enjoying life again and close this chapter.
Constantly treading on eggshells in your own home is no way to live. Honestly you will feel so free and alive when you leave just do it
That $230 might have gone to a "provider"  :-(
 I hope you get to keep the dog. As someone who stuck around for an ungrateful partner more than a handful of times in my 20s/30s... please leave, and continue to heal. 🙏🏻
Brain damage can cause these unexplained outbursts of anger and emotion. It might not be something you can fix. It may not change no matter how much awareness and growth you’ve experienced. You and all of us deserve better than this.
Like many others have said. You need to leave and absolutely take the dog with you
This is classic codependency. I understand what you feel and it won’t get any better. You both need help asap. Establish clear boundaries with money and either let him get on disability or working part time.
I understand that you love him, but he clearly doesn’t and he is taking you for granted. If You don’t leave him, he will never go back to work. He clearly got so comfortable and he knows you feel bad for him so he will keep blaming everything on his brain damage. Im begging you to leave him! You seem like a wonderful woman and you deserve better. I know its going to be hard, but you have to move on even if you are sad about leaving the dog. Trust me, if he loved you, he would have done anything to call you or drive to the hospital to see you. If he doesn’t care embarrassing you in public, then he doesn’t care about your feelings. You are 29, im sure you will find a better partner for you! If you leave him and he begs you to stay… dont feel bad for him. Men like him are manipulative and know how to win you back. If you keep caring for him, who is going to care for you?
Okay so the behavior change you mentioned? That's something I've seen a lot in comments about people with TBI.  Part of who he is is damaged now. Part of his brain doesn't work right anymore and honestly he needs a therapist as well. Brains a funny thing and maybe with proper help and treatment he could "re-wire" his brain a bit and possibly learn mechanisms to stop doing what he's doing now.

  
That said, you also have to look out for you and your well beings. If his yelling at you keeps on or if he lays hands on you in a harmful way. Fucking bail. Don't take this as a "It was a one time thing" you just up and fucking leave. You might love that dog with your heart and soul but your ass comes first. The BEST I could say is save up money equal or more than what he paid for the dog and when you decide to go... Buy her. 

  
Yes everything that has happened with him IS brain damage... But he should be working on countering it and trying to dial in... Not get lazy and check out. (Again the brain thing makes it hard) I've learned WAY to much how damage to the brain can change people, my dad had a stroke 10 years ago and it fucked some parts of his brain good.

  
There are some great people on Reddit, and some in here, you're never alone and if you need support feel free to reach out. You aren't alone nor should you be. Plenty of lady's here who I'm sure would love to give you a safe space to vent. I hope that whatever happens you take care of yourself. You deserve better treatment.
He has a TBI, expect his personality to change.
I feel like I am going threw the same thing I won’t give much detail but my bf always tells me he is gunna improve but isn’t I feel like I am and while he isn’t it’s dragging me down
You need to get out. The kindest thing you can do is stop enabling him. 

If he has trusted family, turn him over to them. He is not interested in getting better and has no incentive to do so.

See if his family will let you share custody of the dog.  (Or talk to him after he cools off a bit)


I don’t mean to be unkind, but staying for the dog is not good for anyone.
I would assume it’s a combo of the brain damage and just trauma of the accident. He is probably angry this happened to him and threw his life off rail. There are so many reasons, but that’s not an excuse for you to live your life being berated by an angry man. Get out now- you’ve done everything you could with him. I hope he gets the help he needs but I hope you find the happiness you deserve. Hugs 💜
Tbi’s can cause the anger. He may or may not get better but if he’s not actively trying to, I’d suggest leaving
Get him an MRI to check for traumatic brain injury. Lack of drive and emotional dysregulation are textbook symptoms. 

I had a parachute accident and was the same way for about 18 months.
My first husband, pronounced dead. Made it through the accident. Terrible after. Im going theough it again. 5 back surgeries later. He hit a ling horn cow. Please message me. Im going through divorce... Again. I hate this for you.
Break up!
You can empathize with someone and understand their disability while not being with him. It sounds like he truly does not care about you more than his own ego.
One thing we aren’t taught enough: you can break up with someone at any time, for any reason. And the reasons you have given are far beyond enough. His abusive behavior, public tantrums, and taking advantage of your financial support… whether he fully knows it or not, he is using you, and you deserve better. You’ve been positively saint-like in caring for him through his turmoils. Now that he can drive and do most life-things, you are well within your rights to go on happily without him. It will be painful, but in a few months you’ll feel so, so much better. Best wishes and hugs.

I was him. I had something similar happen and a woman that was the same as you (amazing) unfortunately I was stuck in depression from what had happened and I didn’t get it fixed or dealt with till it was way too late and she had moved on. She gave me way more time than I deserved that’s for sure. 

Unfortunately there isn’t anything you can do. It’s up to him to get help.

Personally I’d say go walk away, when I look back I held my wife back for so long with my shit. And I regret it everyday of my life. But I wouldn’t have begrudged her if she left earlier cause I was exactly like your partner, I couldn’t have imagined being her dealing with who I was. 

Good luck, it’s a shit position and you don’t deserve it. 

If you need anything else let me know…
Just leave him and take the dog he's not the same person he was so you can also blame the brain damage for changing him
Dump him. Move on. Find somebody worth your time & affection.
Unfortunately I've ruined my last relationship doing the same stuff. A traumatic brain injury causes alot of secondary issues. It doesn't make it your problem at all. But I'm sure it's very difficult to handle.  I had a bad accident a year ago . I struggle to control my emotions.  And Im a lot more violent. I'm considered by friends to be the nicest guy, but now I want to fight everyday. I'm not a fan of my new personality. But it happens. I had my skull split open and brain falling out. I hate being so quick to anger. Hate being mad at small things. But I can't stop it. I get so angry at things I've had to learn to step back and breathe. It's an uphill battle but winnable
Apart from everything else, if the dog isn’t chipped and u are paying all the expenses for it, take to vet and get a chip with just your info. Also paper trail, keep all vet records
He has literally said he's a sociopath and you're wondering if you should breakup? Girl.... bye. He's using his accident as an excuse to treat you like shit, you really need to move out and on.
I used to be in a similar situation. I would explain but im at work on my phone and its a novel of a story but to make it short, i am so much happier now that i left.

Also, my ex broke both legs and a wrist, maybe some ribs but i dont remember. He is heavily addicted to fentanyl now, i cant help but wonder if your bf has similar drug issues as a long term result of the accident and thats where your money went.
The fact that you’re both close age range and he’s this way is alarming to me, I can only imagine how my current person feels pushed away because of my horrible treatment sometimes bringing up the past but today she wants her space and I’m in a similar spot, looking for work and she’s the one working, she got to her interview only because I woke up to take her, then drove back because she forgot her wallet so both times I rushed for her and I think over time they just get comfortable, I’m hoping at her first paycheck aside from doing some tattoo stuff she wanted to do the plans for “us” she always said would come to fruition, in this scenario, I’m the guy doing the most while the other one is doing less, our age gap is a decade apart, 32(M) to (22F) but she’s been through so much to “know what she wants and doesn’t want”, I can only hope that not everyone has a stone heart, some grow resentful, I’m assuming after the accident he was pissed that he felt inoperable and basically put out of commission to daily life and seeing you should have been his wake up call, he got to comfortable with the love while holding hatred inside him, he’s gonna have to figure that out on his one or lose you, I would be horribly scared if I was in his shoes, some don’t deserve the things they have but we can only keep trying to be our best selves, the good people we are, this might just be words on a screen but it’s the truth.

My currently GFs mom said to her the last time we fought “love and hate are very close” but at which point and to what lengths are you willing to endure something that doesn’t see your value, your worth, your light. 

I can only offer light and a prayer that things improve, and keep that close to you and they shall, maybe not the same as before but always better, trust the flow.
So TBI are associated with personality changes. High temper, indifference, reduced cognitive functioning resulting in less empathy.

If you aren't in love with the man he is now, after the TBI, there's a strong likelihood you'll never be in love with the man he is tomorrow.

Don't waste your life hoping to see the man you feel in love with before the TBI. Unfortunately, he's gone.

I'm sorry. But you're not his mum, nor should you be.
Just leave.. who cares.. no kids.. just a person you had some good times with, but sounds like a burden now.

move on.. go be happy.. people are awesome, you'll find one soon.
life's too short to not have a good time.
I had a TBI  and for about a year my emotions were completely out of control. I switched Worker’s Comp. doctors because I wasn’t getting any help. Fortunately my longtime acupuncturist and nutritionist was also a Worker’s Comp. doctor. He put me on a anti-inflammatory diet and helped me by explaining how the TBI affected my emotions, etc. It helped me gain self-awareness of my emotions and over time I was able to control them better and now, I don’t have any problems with my emotions but in that first period I certainly was out of control and couldn’t understand what was going on.
Once someone's brain is damaged they can be a completely different person, he might not be the man yo fell in love with initially. 

Take care of yourself and leave, find happiness elsewhere. 

I hope he has support from someone else ie. Mother figure, but ultimately you can't waste your life mothering him.
Get out.

He is not the man you fell in love with, you tried everything you could think of.

He uses excuses and denies he has the problem, he sure as hell doesn't want to work on it.

There is nothing left for you to do.
Don’t worry your boyfriend is fucking three girls at once rn
You already know what to do. You don’t need the advice of the online community. You need courage to make the move.
Girl, you need to end it with him. This is really not a hard decision. He’s making you miserable and doesn’t care. You need to leave
Coming from someone who has only been in abusive relationships (single for 7 years now to heal), this is one of them. It’s probably not what you want to hear, because you deep down know this is the answer already. You can’t be with this person. This is not a deep seated personality trait coming out because of hard times, this is his true, uninhibited self coming out because he has the space and freedom. Get OUT and protect yourself!!

32 F
sounds like you wanted a boyfriend and ended up with a bad mannered child. dump him on his mother! if he has no parents to dump him onto leave him wherever you can, you said he has friends. you are an angel for sticking with him through his accident but at this point the title of this post is enough, and you really have no obligation to the hateful man. get away from him by any means necessary, and sadly, it will likely mean losing connection to the dog.
Unfortunately, if the brain damage is significant enough, he is essentially a different person, from the one you fell in love with.
Dated a person who was also draining -more like pity me than an angry person but still. Had a medical disorder and had other medical stuff going on so I got to play taxi to doc appts etc. Used to work at a bakery and when I’d leave at 5am, come back at 2pm and the dishes weren’t done the answer was ALWAYS “uh I was just about to do them”. Placed garbage beside the garbage and not inside, I eventually felt like his mom. I felt bad about the health stuff too but could not keep living that way. My only regret was not doing it sooner
My husband had brain cancer 4 years ago. He had surgery and proton radiation therapy. And there were changes in his behavior and personality. But he recognized it and listened when I told him about what I’d noticed. He took it upon himself to seek therapy. He never wanted to take anything out on me or our daughter. If your boyfriend isn’t willing to do the same, then he’s not the right man for you. TBI or not, he has to be willing to fight for your relationship. He is not doing that. Take the dog and leave. Or if it’s your place, kick him out. Either way, get away from him.
Hes useless , like old farts, just get rid of him and move on ,lifes too short
I don’t see why you’re hesitating to break up with him honestly. You’re not obligated to stay with him. If you hate him, break up with him. You said yourself the bad outweighs the good. That’s when you end it (try to take the dog though).
I used to work with a range of people with acquired brain injuries.

For a lot of their families and friends, they are NOT the same person.

He’s not the boyfriend you loved. He’s just not. 
It’s not his fault.  It’s not your fault.

But it’s not likely to get better for you.
No fat settlement?

Seems like a huge chunk of cash for such damages
it's not his fault he has a brain injury, but that doesn't change the fact that he's being a dick. it's unlikely that he will ever go back to normal after this. this is, in a way, a different person than the person you chose to date. i know it doesn't feel good, but if you're miserable then your only real option is to break up with him. i'm sorry you're going through this.
There's a lot to unpack here. First of all was the damage to his brain in the frontal cortex because that would explain a lotta what you're saying about his emotions & his fascination in Pokemon go. The frontal lobe is where our emotions & understanding come from. Damage to it can cause erratic behavior a sense of not caring along with many other problems. I'm sorry to hear this story. And you having to work so long & putting in all of your time into the relationship. I'm afraid you're going to have to look at this in a logical position even though he depends on you for everything. Does he have family to depend on
If you haven't already, I would suggest a long, heart to heart conversation with him about everything you just wrote here. If he doesn't understand where you're coming from and isn't willing to treat you better then you know what needs to be done. I'm sorry you're going through this.
You need to get out of this relationship. Toxic as all hell and doesn’t sound safe at all.
Find a way out for you and the dog. He isn't working and you pay all vet bills. She's your dog
End it!!!!
Break up with him. The reason for it is just like his constant phone use - brain damage.
Look, it's a toxic relationship, and he should man up and at least help out around the house. If he doesn't want to go to therapy, then it means he doesn't care about himself. Is he in a wheel chair by any chance?  I suggest you leave the relationship and take care of you. He doesn't care about you. Why should you invest in a relationship that's toxic? A relationship is a two way street.
First law of relationships: You can't fix him/her. :( 

If your leaving forces him to work on his own health and self-sufficiency, it might be for the best in the long run. And in any case, you don't deserve to be treated this way.
I think you deserve bettter and should move on, since it's clear that he isn't willing to change as well..
He is abusing you with the excuse of his accident. Please, leave him asap. This will not stop and will only increase. One day it is not going to be yelling but a violent attack.

You are not married and dont owe him anything. If any, you did him a favor. 

Talk to your family and friends  you are not alone
You sound like a very loyal and caring gf. It seems you’re doing your part and he isn’t doing his. Although what happened to him is awful and definitely not easy to go through, it doesn’t justify emotional abuse and neglect. You’ve already looked after him, now it’s time to look after your yourself.
Leave.
You can't stay with him because of what he went through. And he will take and take until you have nothing left. If a friend was going through this, what advice would you give?
LEAVE HIM. You keep downplaying your VERY valid feelings. Take the dog and don't look back. Please think about the dog being stuck with that miserable human and take her with you. You are young and deserve happiness! Do yourself a favor and future you will thank you. Sending you love, strength and healing!
Did nobody here take into considering the psychological aftermath of his behaviour now vs pre accident? If he’s had brain damage then maybe this whole thing just completely screwed his brain. Did he get therapy for any of this? That doesn’t disregard your feelings and how much it’s taking a toll on you, because honestly most people wouldn’t stick around so hats off for being so good in the first place.☝🏻
To him:

Hey, I understand what you’re going through. I’ve been there myself. When you suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it changes how your brain works, even though you may not feel it in the same way others notice it. It’s frustrating, right? You try to use your brain like you always did, but it just doesn’t work the same anymore. It can feel like the world is suddenly speaking a different language, and no matter how hard you try, people just don’t seem to understand you.

I know exactly what that feels like because I went through something very similar. As a child, I had a head injury that completely changed me, and I didn’t even realize how much it impacted my ability to explain things or be understood. Then, things got worse during my time in the military. Later, in 2012, I was hit by a Ford F-150 truck while walking across the street, and after that, everything just spiraled. I wasn’t all right before that, but it became much worse after. I kept trying to make people understand me, but no matter how right I might have been, it never came out the way I intended. Over time, I lost connections with people, family, and friends, because they couldn’t trust what I was saying.

It’s incredibly difficult when you know what you’re trying to say or do, but people around you just don’t see it the same way anymore. You’re probably feeling trapped inside your own mind right now, struggling with the way things used to be versus how they are now. It’s not your fault that things have changed, but I’m telling you from experience that you need to take control of this now, before it gets too late.

Do you want to lose everything? Do you want to lose your family? Do you want to lose your friends? Do you want to lose your girlfriend? Even in your community—do you want to lose everything? You will lose everything if you don’t take action. And then you’ll have to start all over. Trust me, that is not good. It is an uphill battle, and it’s not something you want to go through.

I waited too long. Even though I’ve improved and I’m more understandable now, it doesn’t matter. The people who knew me before still don’t trust me. They don’t believe what I say, even if it’s right, and they’ve already made up their minds about me. I had to leave and go to places where people didn’t know this side of me, just to be understood again. You don’t want that to happen to you. Don’t wait until your relationships—your family, your friends, your girlfriend—are all so distant that you can’t repair them anymore.

I’m telling you this because you have a chance to change things now. You don’t have to keep trying to do everything on your own. TBI requires therapy and medication. This is no joke—you can’t just wish it away or rely on anything else. Yes, prayer is nice, but you’re going to have to take medication for life. Don’t look for any other type of help—this requires real, medical intervention. Without it, you won’t be able to gain the control you need over your mind and your emotions.

Trust me, it’s worth it. You deserve to get back some control, and it will help you keep the people who care about you close.

Now, I also want to be honest with you. Your girlfriend is going through a lot too. She’s been strong for you, but if you don’t seek help, there’s a chance she may feel like she can’t stay. It’s not that she doesn’t care—it’s just that she’s hurting, and she may not be able to handle it anymore on her own. I know it’s hard to hear, but it’s important to understand that this isn’t just about you getting better, it’s also about protecting the people who care about you.

So take that step, man. Don’t wait until it’s too late. There are people out there who can help you, and there’s hope. But you’ve got to act now before you lose the people who love you most.

Thank you for helping him
A TBI has lasting effects and he may always be like this, or he could get better. You never know. Are you willing to put up with this for an indefinite amount of time or even forever? Sticking it out can be incredibly tough, I know firsthand bc my BIL has a TBI and his marriage is constantly on the rocks. It sounds like you're absolutely miserable and can't take it anymore. The circumstances really suck bc it's not his fault, but if it's damaging your mental health you gotta go. Take the dog too if you suspect he won't care for her properly. She doesn't deserve to be neglected by him.
Brain damage can partly change someone’s personality. Some of his neurons are fucked, as if he got lobotomized.

Ask him if he is willing to try a high dose of acid. A therapeutic dose is like 200-300ug. It could help/heal his brain. The brain is more active on acid and brain regions that normally do not communicate begin to communicate with one another.
Omg leave him. I didn’t even have to read the whole post. You’ve paid your dues by sticking with him during his recovery at the hospital and then some. He’s only going to get worse because he’s had a taste of “it’s not me it’s the brain damage” thing. You’re too young to put up with this crap.
Idk if the brain damage really just messed him up, especially when he wasn't quick to lose his temper before the accident.

Or he also just might be bitter about the accident and its easy to just hate everything around you in the "why did this have to happen to me" mindset.

I don't see this behaviour improving, it will only get worse. U should do what you need to for ur happiness
While you were a happy couple before the accident it doesn't mean you are required to be with him the rest of your life. He has changed, your feelings have changed. There's nothing to say you can't remain friends as you start separating your lives! Be supportive, but let him know romantically you are over. Help him find a job and a place he can afford to live. Staying with him at this point just appears that you are being a martyr! You "owe" him nothing except possibly being a friend during this time of transition! Good Luck!!!
That's a boy not a man
Send him to his parents and move. If you stay, he will return, maybe even apologize and continue the abuse. Don't wait for the physical, that's next. You are too fine of a young lady to go through your current situation. Take some time to yourself. Enjoy life, continue therapy and maybe adopt one or two rescue puppies from your local pound. It's a win win situation. You will be just fine🙂
It could be brain damage, depression or rage at the world. It doesn't matter.

Either he gets help with a doctor or a therapist or you are done.

And if you don't want to wait for that because you are already done then go. You owe him nothing more. You have done way more than enough.
Honestly if you've already tried talking with him and he's not willing to change then it's time to move on. Just because you love someone and spent years with them doesn't mean you have to stay. You deserve happiness too.
You dont own him anything.
You never did.
Go live your life. Find someone who truly wants to be with you or be single and happy◡̈ 
He would definitely be fine by himself, don’t feel sorry about that. 
There is only an amount of things that one can do for others and sometimes in life we, we need to be “selfish” Although taking care of yourself is not selfish.
Take it from someone who is 2-1/2 times your age...... RUN from this guy as fast as you can! You deserve FAR better. So, what he won't have any money. That is NOT your problem. He has found a sucker and free meal ticket, and YOU are it. I have known of several such relationships over the years and these losers NEVER change. He will end up sucking the life out of you and your bank accounts.  Bail while you are still young and able to do it. I'm very surprised you stuck with this guy as long as you have. Most women would have kicked him to the curb a long time ago.
This is just me… but I would get all the paperwork done so that the dog was legally mine… I would gather any vet bills I paid, receipts for pet care items, etc.  I would devise a plan… make sure I had a place to go and had some savings.  I would invest in some training where I was the only person taking the dog and I would get notarized paperwork, after presenting all these documents to an attorney, from a civil court.  Once all of my ducks were in a row, I would leave and not look back.  No one is allowed to abuse another person, no matter how hard they have had it.  That’s really sad that he won’t be able to afford his bills, but he is a grown man and that is his responsibility.  He can collect disability if he has damage from the accident.  I would seek legal advice or at least, alert the police if you think he has potential to be violent.  Also, posting here on Reddit is great for some loose guidance, but tell people you trust, and a counselor or therapist, that you suspect you may be being emotional or psychologically abused… perhaps unintentionally if he has brain damage but again… that doesn’t matter… still not ok.  I was a social worker for along time and judges always ask, “Did you tell anyone about the abuse?”  Our life is so precious… our time is so fleeting... How dare we spend one second of it living less fulfilled then we deserve?  I truly wish you the best of luck… this does not sound like an easy situation.  You and YOUR dog…. deserve a piece of the good life.
I hear you. Trust yourself and know you will make the best decision for you and your future. 

Ps I hope your graves has stabilised. I’ve been through that myself, and am here if you want to chat.
There comes a point where it doesn’t really matter *why* someone is an @sshole, it’s just matters that they are. That’s the plain truth of it. You can’t spend your life being abused by someone, no matter what the reason for their behaviour and abuse is. It’s still abuse. 

Leave. Take the dog and go. Cut ties, change your number, whatever. Go though. You have one life, do not spend it like this. And don’t leave the dog to suffer with someone who isn’t mentally, emotionally, or financially able to be responsible for her. I don’t give af who purchased her, her ongoing care was funded by you and the other party can’t properly care for her. Take her and get the eff out. Save yourself or go down with this ship.
Seems like you really did love him at one point but ever since he's gone a bit retarded it's hurting you way more than it should. Pack his bags and ask him to move out, give him a day to process it and yes for God's sake keep the dog with you I would not trust him with him.
Unfortunately this is common with a TBI. Depending on what parts of his brain were damaged it can lead to fundamental changes in personality as well as issues with impulse control and explosive anger. 
But the fact that his abusive behavior may be a symptom of his TBI doesn’t mean you are obligated (or should) stay with someone who mistreats you. 
Does he have any family close by? Are they aware of these changes? 
It sounds like it is beyond time to leave. Perhaps you can have a heart to heart with his parents or siblings so that there is a plan in place that keeps you safe as well as helping him in the transition. 
I’m so sorry. I had a close friend who had a major TBI. It’s so difficult to watch the person you love turn into someone else entirely. Give yourself the space and time to grieve.
You don't need to stay with him for any other reason than because you want to, but you're not obligated to him and you don't owe him anything. He'll use the accident and his brain damage to try to guilt you, and to further victimize himself. You don't need this! You have 10000% been there for him when he needed you the most when he was in the hospital. Now he's not. I can totally understand why you despise him. Hell, he pisses ME off just in reading this. Walk away for your own sanity and safety. He's not your responsibility. This is self-preservation mode you need to go into and get tf out. He's abusive, flat out. Get out because of that, at least.
DTMFA
99.99% of "should I break up" posts are such an obvious yes that it makes me furious. YES BREAK UP WITH HIM YOURE WASTING/RUINING YOUR LIFE FFS

PS. No matter what I think of the question, you didn't know the answer so you obviously did well in asking here🙂
Anger issues after a brain injury is very common and unfortunately there is little that can be done especially if the injured person is no willing or able to do the work to change, in some cases ADHD medication such as Adderall can help. I've been in some bad relationships and leaving was hard but I've never regretted it, my current spouse my Wife and I have been together for almost 12 years now and are very happy together, never would have happened if I had stayed in one of those bad relationships, if he refuses to do anything to help the relationship then Just leave, don't what if about it, don't worry about anything anyone might think, don't think about him just leave, and take the dog it's yours you pay for everything, do not overthink it just go and don't look back.
Just leave baby. You have one life and you should freaking live it🥺 Not feel trapped and alone.
At this point he’s not even just an emotional and financial drain, he’s emotionally and financially *abusing* her. Brain damage or not, this is unacceptable behavior. I’d be thanking the heavens that he’s just a boyfriend and not a husband, and then I’d be running for the hills. What she’s done for him has been more than enough. OP needs to focus on herself now.
Agreed. And take the dog. He may have bought her, and if he tries to say you stole her, tell him to take you to court. You’ve probably got plenty of evidence in your bank statements alone to prove you’ve provided the care and upkeep of her. I guarantee he won’t bother with it. 

And honestly, f*ck his feelings about it all. He can claim a TBI all he wants, but that’s no excuse for him to be an a**hole to you. You are in an abusive relationship OP. It’s time for your boyfriend to be an ex boyfriend and learn how to do things on his own. Plenty of people with disabilities of all kinds live independently and take care of themselves. If he is that bad off, he can get assistance. If he can’t get assistance, he can get a job.

If you’re worried about him ruining your reputation, don’t. It won’t matter at all. You’ll have the confidence knowing you did the right thing for yourself and YOUR dog and that is what matters.
And take the dog. He’s too disorganized and volatile to successfully follow any legal recourse he’d have to get it back, and you’re clearly the one taking care of it.
If I were OP,  I'd pay for him and a friend of his for a weekend trip. I'd tell him he needs a break to focus on himself. Then, while he is gone, I'd arrange movers to move my stuff out of their apartment, and I'd take the dog, too. OP doesn't take care of the dog. She does. I'd contact their landlord and get my name off the lease,  or wait for the weekend trip, near the end of their lease,  and move out. 

Either way, he is taking advantage of her. He should have been at least applying for disability due to his brain injury. Instead, he acts like an entitled asshole who yells at her and plays little kids games.
Brain damage not always but most often will permanently change the behavior of a person, being able to physically function 100% is being lucky with brain damage, being exactly the same ever again is near unheard of.
I would not bet on it tho. See him for who he is right know, not the person he would hopefully become.
Some types of traumatic brain injuries result in permanent personality shift. there is no treatment or therapy that will work.  Her boyfriend is actually showing classic traumatic brain injury behaviour shift. 

"Cognitive impairment after severe injury is likely to include impaired speed of information processing, poor memory and executive problems. **Personality change may include poor motivation, and a tendency to be self-centred and less aware of the needs of others. Patients may be described as lazy and thoughtless. Some become disinhibited and rude. Agitation and aggression can be very difficult to manage**."

if he is not seeing a neurologist or getting assessed for follow up treatment he should be. That being said you don't have to stay with him in fact you may find that nothing heals the damage from the brain injury and it is in fact permanent.  carers get burned out and you shouldn't feel guilty for leaving if you need to.
I have a friend who had two strokes back to back at your age and went through the same journey.  You will be better for it.  These are all the emotional regulation skills we learn as small children, but as an adult you will be consciously choosing how you want to act while you learn these things.  The person that you become will be breathtaking.
My mom had a stroke years before she died. She definitely became more aggressive where in the past she was pretty meek. Scary change.
My dad had a pretty bad stroke a few years back, he was acting exactly the same, always getting mad at the smallest things and insulting everyone all around him. I wouldn't have blamed my mum if she left him but she stayed. Even though we're all still pretty close and doing alright now, the way my dad acted and the hurtful things he said back then definitely left some scars for us. In the end, we're all just grateful that he's still here and that he's doing better now. 

It's your choice to stay or to leave him. It can be a lot to deal with things like this and it definitely will never be the same as before. Whatever you choose to do there's no right or wrong decisions. You gotta decide what's best for you too. Good luck OP, hope things will get better!
I've had over 10 strokes before turning 40. I do not like who I became. Everything makes me unreasonably angry. Numerous therapists but none have given me anything to regulate my mood. It doesn't help that I look young and I look good so I get a lot of "you seem great" well bitch I'm not
Proud of you 🤌
This hits so hard. My ex was so drastically different after he came back from one deployment. I know what happened and how he was acting was not his fault, but he was acting a lot like OPs BF with very mean actions and no accountability. I begged him to get therapy and follow up with his neurologists, but he didn’t have the push to do it until we broke up. I hate that we had to break up in order for him to get better, but that’s all I wanted for him - to get the help he needed. I’m glad to hear that accountability in how he treated me is still an active decision that he did not make, or was not ready to make. It absolutely killed me to leave him like that, but I was drowning in the process of trying to help him and needed to take care of myself first.
This , and there is no reason for him to seek treatment or try to improve since he’s getting all he needs from you.

Meanwhile, he sucking up all the resources and can’t even offer you comfort!
I feeling like I’ve been mourning the loss of him for the past year. It’s killing me
Agreed. OP, give him some $ to replace whatever he paid for the dog just to shut him up and run! You & the dog deserve a better life ♥️
He will probably fight you to the nail because why would he want to go back home when he can stay with you and live his life the way that he wants to without having to participate in the growth that is expected of him. Be firm with your boundaries and in a year you might be in a completely different place emotionally.
Not rage bait. I went through the exact same thing with my ex. A TBI will cause a person to change drastically. We were warned, but I didn’t expect the abuse and violence that would follow - assuming OP didn’t either. It’s incredibly hard to leave when the person you love most appears helpless, and they berate you and make you think this is the best you’ll ever get. What OP describes is a form of abuse. I hope OP finds it within herself to leave this slimy dude and start fresh.
I honestly don’t know what rage bait is, but I can assure you it’s genuine. But everyone is entitled to their own opinion
It’s definitely not. OP is my sister and this is all true 💔
I feel for you man. The same thing happened to me, I lost my best friend. and you want to know the last thing I said to him? Nothing… he asked me where I was going because I had to leave to take care of my girlfriend who was pregnant. I ignored him for the first  time in my life, I was in a bad mood. The very next night I lost him. I had one last good phone call with him though, I was on top of the mountain looking down on the city.. that was before the last time I saw him
I’m making an escape plan with my parents


I absolutely need to take my dog
[deleted]
He wouldn’t care
A lot of the times it seems like good people attract bad people. I’ve seen a lot of people comment on it how good men/ women don’t find each other and instead end up with pos people. I think it’s because imo genuinely good empathetic selfless people are much more rare.
Of course I see this, I appreciate this. 

I’m holding on to a dream, and living in a memory 

I’m trying to make a methodical escape plan with my dog 

If he finds out that I’m leaving with “his” dog, it’s over for me
Also if you weren't there he'd have to pay the bills somehow. He's taking advantage of you and your kind nature (you seem like a lovely person) 

Don't let him do it to you, take it from me. This is YOUR life.
He doesn't want to, she's already tried. It's literally in the post.
Even in a thread so dire, I truly hope that your cake day cake has just the right amount of frosting, good Redditor.
I had never heard this expression either! I googled it and found this:

‘To “call somebody out (of) their name” is an African-American expression meaning, basically, to call somebody by a name that isn’t theirs. Almost always, I think, its practical meaning is to call somebody by an insulting name or a racial epithet.’

So I guess an example would be to call someone a b*tch or dumbass, or something like that?
It’s not exaggerated unfortunately.
Nope it’s all true. I’m OP’s sister.
> Brain damage or not

That’s a pretty big thing to just entirely gloss over seeing as how we still don’t even fully understand it. We know that head injuries/brain tumors can completely change people practically overnight, like in the case of Charles Whitman who went from “normal guy” to “spree killer” due to a tiny brain tumor.

Not saying she should stay with him or condoning his behavior and personality change, but there’s a very real possibility that it’s not entirely his fault.
She could always go get the dog microchipped in her name... And update at the vet  that she has taken ownership of the dog. In my state, you can do the same at the county animal shelter -- it's a requirement in my state that all dogs be utd on rabies vaccines and they ask for the owners name when you submit the rabies vax information. 

That's what I did whenever I took ownership of a dog that was being severely neglected and starved. I literally just took her, went immediately to the emergency vet, they scanned and found no microchip in her. So when I made her an appointment at the regular vet, I brought the microchip kit with me. Then I took her rabies vax certificate to the county and registered her under my name.
I wonder if she's scared to just take the dog because he's probably at home most of the time. If it were me, I'd call the police, and tell them he stole the money for the electric bill. Hopefully two officers would accompany her as backup
“I’m takin the dogggg” -legally blonde.
This is best answer. You gave it your all. I predict things WILL NOT get better. The writing is on the wall. The missing $230 for the Electric bill spells it all out for me. 
Your in an abusive relationship.  I advise to leave and take the dog for your own solace. The puppy will help you heal. If he can't work, he can apply for total disability.  He is a taker and not a giver. Plan your exit. Life is short. You did your share.
Yeah, this is how I feel about it, too. This right here.
... pretty sure TBI is literally an excuse for acting like an asshole. Doesn't mean she (or anyone) has to continue to associate with him... but dude is sick. He \*may\* also be an asshole, but this is like arguing a badly healed broken leg isn't an excuse not to go for a jog -- it may actually make him incapable of controlling his emotions and impulses. 

Sucks..

But still, OP needs to be protective of her own needs.
I’m sure he does have TBI but you’re right it doesn’t mean that she needs to put up with the abuse even if he’s unaware of it or can’t help it
Yup. I have several TBI’s with the most recent being a 45 mph no helmet ATV crash (smart ik. Thank you patch of dirt that cushioned me) and man… my behavior and my sense of self was absolutely out of whack for years. I literally woke up a new person one day and it took me about 2-3 years (aka now) to finally begin to work with the damage and changes that have been done. I’m 100% more prone to anger and I’ve gone from super social and always making friends to not really being interested in my friends at all. It’s crazy but these things really do change you forever. I think OP should leave because from experience, it kinda fucked with all my existing relationships and friendships (and I do mean all)  as I’m a different person and am no longer the person who became friends with them and on top of that my behavior is not the same and it made some friends totally incompatible with me. This can happen with anyone over time, but the sharp and sudden changes in thought and behavior make it especially drastic for ppl with TBI’s and they cannot reverse it or fix it. Just a little side note because I think this is all interesting, I believe my last TBI may have fixed my depression lol. I haven’t been able to stay consistently sad like I used to be since then. it’s odd but welcome.
out of curiosity is it possible to have these kinds of symptoms without a severe head injury? instead maybe like an unfortunate small one or repeated small ones?
Damewhen is spot on 

OP, I know this feeling, and I’m so sorry you’re going through it. Holding onto the living ghost of him only exacerbates the pain
You can try giving him a chance by giving him an ultimatum: go make an appointment with a neurologist this week and seek help or I’m out. This way at least you’ll know you did everything you could
I really appreciate the comment mcfluff. I will try to suggest it. I know she has had bloodwork done in the past. If I need to pay for a personal trainer and a gym membership for her I don’t think I’ll feel good about it. It’s kind of a struggle at times and telling her she could do more to feel better never ends well; she snaps at me and “shuts down” sometimes literally shaking. I think it’s a good starting point though, get out of bed and walk the neighborhood every day.
My apologies, once a thread reaches 500+ or 700 something replies I figure some responses get lost in the haze of replies. I wish the best for you.
Tysm 😍😍😍
This is so helpful thanks.  Basically name calling.
It doesn’t matter if he has some form of brain damage or any other issue, she’s not obligated to stay in an unhappy or abusive situation. Just because someone else has a problems, even if it’s not entirely their fault, doesn’t mean she should have to sacrifice her well-being. It’s not her fault either, and no one should feel guilty for wanting to move on. Unless he can somehow change in a meaningful way, moving on is the only real solution. She deserves a chance at happiness, just like anyone else.
Whether or not it’s his fault is immaterial.  That’s why the earlier poster said brain damage or not.
I honestly completely agree with you one of my parents got frontal lobe damage and they went from being super parent to being super paranoid and would accuse me and my sibling of stealing and started getting verbally and physically abusive it’s crazy what can change you when it comes to the brain they even got short term memory loss from the damage
Woah, all of these hateful and selfish people just immediately disregarding the life altering event that changed this young man’s life forever. He needs help people. His brain is damaged. You know, the thing that controls your entire body and everything in it. 

It’s like driving a car, getting T-boned by a driver that ran a red light, having the car taken to the body shop to get worked on, towing it home to sit in the garage, and staring at it day after day hoping that the engine will just start running again. You have to take that thing to the mechanic to get the engine fixed. You don’t fix the engine, the car doesn’t run no matter what you do to the rest of it. This young man needs professional help to cope and get control over his damaged brain. But just like how some engines just can’t be fixed, same goes for the brain depending on the amount of damage sustained. 

It’s an unfair and unfortunate situation that OP and her BF have been put in. I don’t know where you stand with your beliefs however I believe that God does not lay upon us burdens that we may are not capable of handling. OP, there is an opportunity here for you to salvage your relationship and rebuild stronger than ever before. If you are willing to push a little more, I know of someone that can give you the exact direction to push in order to make it through this seemingly impossible situation. God, our Father. Prayer will be your torch in the night and further ahead you will find another light. A light that shines brighter the closer you become and guides you through these hard times. 

OP, my suggestion to you is this; sit down with your partner and communicate your desire to move towards a progressive future together. Be assertive but soft when suggesting him to seek professional help. Like I said before, I’m not sure your beliefs and how you view religion, but you could also suggest taking baby steps with prayer. When either of you are feeling low, find a moment to be alone and pray what you feel. Prayer is about connecting with God and giving him our burdens so that he may show us his wonders and love. I promise you OP that prayer, even if only you decide to do so, will make such a difference in the best of ways.

I will be praying for you and your partner so that you may be able to find healing, to find peace, and to find a strong relationship with God through it all. IF that is what you desire. If you are feeling that you want to separate yourself from the situation, do not feel invalidated or discouraged for doing so. You have been through so much physically, mentally, emotionally and yet you have been able to sustain not only yourself but the relationship. You’ve proven yourself to be a kind and admirable partner amongst many other things I’m sure. A true heart of gold imo. Being resentful of your partner may seem so harsh and maybe even outlandish which is why you’ve come to seek an honest opinion. But I assure you that MANY others and I too have felt the way you feel towards their partners and many more that have been on the receiving end of that resentment. Resentment stems from unsolved problems as I’m sure some have come to learn. In this particular situation, his brain damage along with severe injuries having altered his life. 

The bottom line here is that he does need help regardless of any other external factors. There are ways to help him from a distance if you decide you need to separate yourself from him.

- Contact his family and/or friends to ask that they be present in his recovery process.
- Schedule him an appointment to a mental health specialist that can help with his particular situation and encourage him to go. (You don’t need to do anything more than just scheduling the appointment. The rest is on him.) 
- Simply check up on him as often as you feel comfortable with and remind him of the help he can get to rebuild himself. 

Whatever you may choose OP I ask that you’d be sure to give yourself the time to think thoroughly over what it is you truly want to look back on and remember when you are 5, 10, 20 years older. Life can be full of regrets if we are not careful to listen to our hearts. A strong heart and a sound mind is like Yin-Yang. A strong heart and broken mind will be irrational and a broken heart but strong mind will be callous. I pray you find that balance for it will serve you well beyond your expectations. 

To all readers, I hope you too may find something of worth through everything I’ve shared and may be able to find it in your hearts to take your first steps towards a relationship with God or to continue on with yours if you have already begun but have set it aside. He hears us all and will answer if we call upon him. Life is so difficult alone so let us walk together with our Father and our brothers and our sisters.
i do not understand how everyone is completely missing the point of what you’re saying. i’m currently taking some mood changers for medicine for my autoimmune illness and my personality has drastically changed. there is already very little i can do to control outbursts and it is not nearly as serious. obviously she should leave him, i just don’t understand how everyone is completely missing the point that demonizing someone for getting in an accident is wrong.
Love this!! All good information!
I totally understand that. I was in an abusive relationship and the only way I was able to leave safely was because I had called 911 and requested an officer stand by while myself and two friends packed and loaded my things. My ex and his two friends were unpacking boxes that we had just packed and throwing them about and were standing in doorways. I didn’t know that was an option until that day, and over ten years later, I had blocked out that trauma and completely forgotten about that option until your comment.

If OP uses this as an option, I would suggest calling the non-emergency dispatch line rather than 911 and see if they can schedule a time where officers would be available. Mornings and afternoons around school zone monitoring times are not a good time to ask for. I was told this when I requested an officer stand by the following day when I went back to the house to get my larger pieces of furniture.
DUMB ASS!!!
I do want to add, he can and should be making an effort to compensate for the issues he’s having. While behavior changes are permanent it doesn’t mean that we lose all ability to manage our emotions. Eventually, just like I and others with TBI’s have, he’ll realize that he’s not acting as he should be and it’s up to him to do better or  risk losing most of his relationships. You do not need to stay or be there for this as it is his life, not yours.
The brain is truly fascinating! Thank you for sharing your experience!
Always possible! Your brain is delicate and takes a long time to heal, and tissue damage doesn’t always heal correctly. These can also be symptoms of much bigger problems, so if you have any concern, you should definitely see a physician.
Just wanted to add that it is possible to get a brain injury from non physical injuries too. Mine was from toxic mold exposure. Had special brain scans done and everything that showed the damage it did.
Yes you don't need to have a severe brain injury, this is why people are concerned about children playing full contact sports. Repeated lesser head injuries can result in long term problems. Similarly they have started examining victims of domestic violence for these kinds of symptoms as many suffer long term mental health issues they believe are linked to long term repeated trauma to the brain.
Absolutely. With or without the brain injury, she’s still going through emotional, verbal, and financial abuse. Why is it okay because it’s from brain damage?
I agree, she’s asked him to seek therapy and he won’t; it doesn’t sound like he is at all apologetic after he has these outbursts. She’s been patient and supportive and understanding for a year while he hasn’t even attempted to learn to adapt and deal with his new disability. He needs to take some ownership of getting better. He should be looking for occupational programs or rehab, or therapy to help him learn how to deal with his new issues. 

They aren’t married, and they haven’t taken any vows to stick together through sickness and health. She has supported him through the most significant part of his recovery and has really tried to make it work, but at the end of day she can’t force him to try to improve his situation. 

OP, you’ve been a great partner and have been going above and beyond but it’s time to move on. I really recommend you have someone with you when you tell him and ask him to pack up and leave. He’s been too unpredictable to be alone with him when giving him this news.

With the dog, offer to keep her for a period time while he gets settled somewhere else. Maybe his feelings will change and he’ll leave her with you, or if too much time passes you could go to court making a case that you’ve been the sole care taker for such a long time, he essentially “abandoned his property.” Of course it’s hard for us to think of pets as just property, but that is usually how the courts handle these cases. People only have so long they can leave a dog with someone else and expect it back.
Same with strokes, even really minor ones. Men who have a stroke almost always have a shorter fuse and just generally seem a little more childish afterwards
You also have no idea what the extent of his brain damage is so step down. Pushing religion a a solution is not helpful .
I seriously think these people have to be under 20. Not a diss against anyone under 20, but I don’t know how you can get past that point in life without realizing that a lot of people don’t have a choice in being an asshole at times. And some people can never realistically realize that’s how they appear. And truthfully, I can’t imagine a more painful existence. I’m not going to befriend a person like that lmao, but I certainly feel some sympathy for them. I’m all for pointing out “abuse” and “unacceptable behavior,” but people legit take it too far and straight up sound like legalistic Christians from 100 years ago. Just change out an old book for social media pop-psych buzz words.

Like, I really hope none of these people have parents who get Alzheimer’s in their later years. It’s obviously a different situation than the OP, but how little empathy they have for someone who can’t control what would be “abusive” or “unacceptable” behavior for a healthy person really makes me think they’d abandon an actually deep and familial relationship. 

Maybe I’m being harsh, but i think they’d probably have abandoned him a month into the hospital instead of sticking with him until realizing he’ll be a lifelong unapologetic asshole.
100% agree. I am reading these comments in absolute disbelief. How do these people not understand how severe brain damage is?? Haven't they heard of CTE? How about the footballer who killed his friend and then later on, himself? He left a note begging doctors to autopsy his brain because he KNEW something was severely wrong with him! this post is so fucking heart breaking. OP should not stay with him. But I am truly sad for her boyfriend. He is probably living in a mental hell. :(
Holy shit, someone with empathy for other people? On Reddit? Astounding.

Edit: Wishing you the best, friend.
I’m in same boat as you. I was on ssri’s for years and got switched to a med just approved in 2023. In a way it’s great, I’m not a zombie and my dose isn’t being adjusted constantly due to depressive episodes. I’m currently in one now but I can function. But it’s made me incredibly temperamental and recently we just made two major life changes(me leaving my job of 8 years in animal rescue that took advantage of my mental illness and buying a home/moving after being in our last home for a decade. Our new home is open floor plan which gives me extreme anxiety and I should have said no but I didn’t and obviously it’s too late and my husband is doing everything possible to help until we can afford to basically make a section into a room with fucking walls. I need walls. I can’t explain it. ) 

Turns out a lot of my sides effects are from my new medication. But I don’t want to go back to being a zombie. Thinking of going inpatient and working with my md & psychiatrist right now. It’s hell. I’ve seen so much improvement but I don’t like losing control of myself. I’m 35, not a teenager. 

Op shouldn’t have to stay with someone she’s miserable with at all. But with a tmi a lot of stuff changes. I mean damn even with medication it can. I’m having to work hard in therapy and don’t want to go back to just laying in bed when I’m finally active besides just doing animal rescue. But some of the stuff I even think now is so hateful that it startles me. And it gets targeted at people I love. 

I feel for both parties. A lot of peoples personalities will change completely with a tmi. But op also has to do what is best for her. I don’t want to encourage anyone to settle or stay because their partner had a life altering situation especially as they aren’t married or even long long term(me and my husband are at 12 years together in a few days and we had to go to counseling(my psychiatrist suggested we do it before things got bad because I was just…resentful even though I was a part of this too) 

I hope things get better for you. I understand. After an outburst I can’t bear to look at myself sometimes. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Feeling like you’re watching from afar afterwards and realizing what you’ve said or done is a very humbling experience. I wish you the best.
completely agreed. my dad is a tbi survivor. he’s a lovely person and sometimes he has mood swings, forgets things, or makes decisions that another person in his shoes wouldn’t make. that great big thing in our skulls that feels our feelings, holds our memories, and makes decisions is permanently injured.

it is not a “free pass” to behave abusively, as op’s boyfriend perhaps believes it is. it is something that *always* has to be taken into consideration when making *any* decisions involving him.
Anytime a man or woman is in that kinda bad situation I always tell them to request an officer to make sure they move out safely. Usually its women who need it but there's been a guy or two...

  
I'm glad you're, hopefully at least, in a better place now and safe.
My son called for a police intermediary when he'd had enough of his GF's abuse. She had told him what she'd done to her previous BF, ie, She was holding his keys hostage and after an hour of arguing, he snatched his keys out of her hand. She called 911 & claimed he assaulted her. He has a record now and she tells the story like it's some hilarious thing. 

He'd called me, finally sharing the reality of what he'd been going through, including mental, emotional and financial abuse. While she didn't officially live in his apartment, she had a key and some belongings. I told him to immediately change the locks and to let the leasing office know she was not allowed access.

When she started blowing up his phone, he told her he'd arrange to meet with her things and will have a police mediator. Thankfully, the officer that met them was a sergeant with a calm demeanor and lots of experience. He talked to both parties and actually called their mental health team to come to an assessment on her because she was losing her sh!t and he couldn't allow her to drive.

Lots of continued drama later, he's finally free.
Agreed. Refusing to go to therapy when you’ve had a TBI is just irresponsible. The boyfriend doesn’t see anything wrong with what he’s doing, and he’s probably staying with her because she’s a kind person who tolerated his mess for so long and he knows no one else will accept it unless they already cared about him. That’s his parent’s job. They can have him back, and I would encourage the parents to try and get a full refund, too.
Yeah, this is what really bothers me. I think you cant really blame him for the change in personality and the immense mood swings, as it is barely understandable for a person that doesnt deal with this kind of problems. As you have too imagine, this guy learned his whole life before the accident how to handle his emotions and his thoughts. He had like 26 years to get to know himself, how to regulate and get along with himself. And suddenly, from one moment to the other, he has to completely start from scratch. Thats really tough. But the fact that hes not even trying to make things better for himself, and therefore for everyone around him, is what i find the most concerning.
in so convinced theres something wrong with my brain but they just tell me its depression/anxiety combined with the impact of covid lockdown, they could totally be right but at this point it doesnt seem like i’ll find out until its too late lol
My sister’s boyfriend had brain damage, and the surgery didn’t go well. The piece of his skull that was removed put pressure on his brain, causing him to change drastically. He went from acting normally,to wearing dresses and throwing things, to becoming increasingly erratic. I’ve witnessed the changes firsthand, and I can understand how brain damage can affect a person’s behavior. As soon as I heard about OP bf brain damage, I could see where this was headed. Eventually, my sister left her boyfriend and thats after he tried to hit me over the head with a microwave and putting a knife to her neck after hearing voices.
In my experience at least, a lot of people don't understand.

I received my TBI when I was about 17 (34 now) and I still have lingering impacts from it. But because those don't present physically, people just make assumptions.

One time I was asking a temp agency about how accommodations work and the lady responded with "oh, I thought people with brain injuries were supposed to walk and talk funny?".

Needless to say, this happens a lot more than I'd like. Even in my current job I get told that I need to multitask faster and should just be able to memorize things, but I can't. 

On the more existential note, it is hellish. I spent *years* mourning the loss of  self, the loss of someone I can't remember. People would tell me that I was "so different" after the accident, but I couldn't remember who that person was. Who was he? Was he better than me? Was I a better person?

I was scared. Still am sometimes haha.
Thank you. I have gotten to a better place and I am in a very happy and healthy relationship now with a man who is protective and loves me. I still have some things that really do trigger quite a bit of emotion, but my current boyfriend is aware of everything and is so caring and patient with me. 

Even though it was an awful experience, ultimately it taught me to be unafraid of literally anything. I am far too confident for my own good sometimes, but I always stand up for what I believe in and I have gotten to a place where I am able to share my story with others in hopes of helping someone, anyone, leave before it’s too late. I have been a foster parent in recent years, and through that I realized how much need there is for education and support to help prevent these things from happening with young people who have sometimes never known a genuinely caring person. Once I am more settled in my career, I have plan for dedicating my life to helping abuse survivors and kids that have grown up in the system.
I’m so sorry. That is the worst when you don’t know WHEN it’s going to be too late, because often, it’s not a matter of if. 

Have you seen more than one physician about this? If you have a different healthcare network in your area that is an option, I would reach out to them for a second opinion if you haven’t already. 

Either way, if you need someone to talk to, my inbox is open to you. I would rather you reach out to me, a random on the internet that definitely cares way too much about people, than come close to doing something irreversible. I promise there are people out there who care. They can’t fix everything for you, but we can be an ear and help direct you to resources that you can explore for a better quality of life.
I’m sorry, that’s rough. 

The older I got the more I realized my brain wasn’t like other people’s. It was *so* frustrating. 

When I was in my late 20s I was diagnosed with ADHD. I hadn’t considered it because I had only heard of the stereotypical symptoms. It’s *very* common for women in particular to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety before finding out they have ADHD. 

I also had severely underestimated the effects of emotional abuse on the brain. By the end of my marriage I had developed a stutter and was forgetting to do super simple things like flushing the toilet. I seriously thought I had a brain tumour. 

Anyway, I hope you’re able to figure it out. I know how intensely frustrating it is to know *something* is going on, but not knowing what.
this list of symptoms is soooo common in mental health issues. i wouldn't jump straight to brain damage, but it's probably a good idea to do some research. maybe see a psychologist. do you know if you have adhd? are you in therapy/ taking medication for the depression & anxiety? i'm only asking because i spent YEARS thinking i was just broken before i considered mental health stuff.
Yes! Fuck yes! You are truely a beautiful soul! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I‘m 20 years old and I just found out my girlfriend lied about her age and is actually 17
Throw away account because I feel incredibly ashamed about this. 

I found out yesterday night that the girl I’ve been going out with for two months lied about her age. I’m completely devastated because this was my first good relationship. I was genuinely so happy and everything just fell apart. I feel like I’ve done something terrible. I can’t ask any advice from the people around me because I don’t want anyone to know. It’s legal to date a 17 year old where I live but it feels so wrong now that I know her real age. 

I thought she’s just a naturally very sweet and shy person but now I can’t stop thinking how that might have been because of her maturity level. This is my fourth relationship whereas it’s her second. I knew this and I was alright with it but that’s when I thought she’s 19. I already said I loved her and I don’t want to leave her because of this but it feels like it’s the right thing to do. 

When I was that age I was just a kid. She said I should just forget it and we can pretend like I never knew. I don’t know if that’s possible. I feel like a huge creep for even considering what to do, I just really cared about her and I was so happy with her. What in Gods name was going through her mind?

I feel shattered. What should I do? 

Edit: 

Thank you very sincerely to everyone who’s commented and given me advice. I haven’t told anyone in my personal life about this so I didn’t have anyone to talk to. It really means a lot. 

Since some people were asking:

She graduated Highschool and I had too when I was that age.

I do not face any legal issues as the age of consent in my country is 16. The issue is that I have to bring up the age of consent to begin with..
I'd be more worried about the lying then the actual age, relationships based in lies dont last.
If you've only been together for two months and she's already lying to you about something as serious as her being underaged, I don't see this relationship working out tbh. That speaks volumes about her character, I'm not saying she's a bad person, but she's definitely not mature enough for a relationship. I would just nip at the bud before this goes too far and stronger feelings are caught.

As for yourself, don't feel ashamed. You genuinely didn't know.
That’s a huge break in trust!! I’d take the high road because you’d be destroying yourself staying.
For one, the relationship was founded on a lie. If she is willing to lie about something as simple as her age then she'll easily lie about other things. It was founded on a lie and deception.

I'm always one to vouch for working things out but *this* is a massive red flag that cannot be avoided.

I dont care if its legal, get out. You fell in love with someone who outright used the art of deception to get with you. If you are torn up about it just end it and move on. I would 110% suggest saving proof of her pretending to be older or saying she is older just for your sake incase she tries to spread stuff to spite you.
Please ask for her ID to make sure she's actually 17 too!

The lying would be a deal breaker for me personally, but that will be up to you. Good luck 🤞
It all comes down to if you can get past this. In the long run three years ain't much but I also understand feeling weird about dating an 17 y.o. When does she turn 18? Will you feel better about it when she is 18? Again can you get past the fact that she really liked you and lied about her age because she thought the truth would run you off?
You're still basically just a kid lol, you don't need to be ashamed.
3 years is not a big deal.  If you like her, continue dating her.  My wife was 16 the first time we went on a date.  I was 19.  We are now 69/66.  We’ve been happily married for 46 years
You’re 20. She’s 17. I think this is a perfectly normal and completely acceptable age gap. But the fact that she lied to you is not great.
She lied to you for whatever reason, you couldn’t of known any better. However you are right there is a massive difference in maturity level. Stay away from her until she grows up and learns not to lie to people.
I'm going to be an outlier here. Make sure she understands the severity of the lie. Then if it makes you feel more comfortable to wait until she's an adult in however many months, then work something out to that effect. Don't ignore your feelings though, do that too much and you'll be a sad man.
If it's legal, don't sweat it. Address the lying, that's the real deal breaker. If From now on she agrees to never ever lie to you again, Go for it.
She was shy, insecure, worried who hasn't been there? 
Graveyards are full of plenty of age different relationships, that worked out.
Everyone is entitled to a second chance.
As others have said, the lying would be a HUGE red flag—and for me, would be a dealbreaker.
idk bro. Saw you say she’s 18 in two months. No one would bat an eye at an 18 and 20 year old dating. It’s not like you’re breaking the law. I get it’s weird she lied, but both of you are still young and kinda dumb because if it. Not an intelligence thing, we’re all dumb at that age.

if you can get over the lie, which is weird but not something so awful, i wouldnt sweat it. Just talk to her and see what the deal is.
How long have you two been together? Other than that I think any relationship built on lies is doomed and won't go far. Just get out now before it's too late.
That's a normal age gap
Devil’s advocate: who cares? She told a little white lie because she likes you bro. 3 years is nothing. If you like her, get over it.
If she's lying about something as big as her age, imagine what else she'll lie about. I'll leave her not even just because of the age but because she seems immature and dishonest. Although personally I would leave her just because of her age - the fact that she lied makes it worse.
Break it off. Why date a liar?
lol. 

“When I was that age I was just a kid”

OP, you’re 20. You’re still a kid
She lied. That’s pretty common for teenagers, the whole lack of maturity thing. Do you really wanna be telling yourself when you doubt her word in the future “yeah, but she was just a kid back then.” 3 years isn’t really an age gap once you get into your mid-late twenties, but a 17 year old and a 20 year old is different. She’s already proven herself untrustworthy, and you’re clearly bothered by her being so young. There are zero pros to staying in this relationship.
You're 20 and she is 17, who the hell cares. Nothing to see here, carry on.
Youre making a big deal out of nothing.
It hurts to be lied to. Talking about it in a serious way to establish a boundary about lying might help. 17 & 20 is fine in my book. I don't mind if my daughters date someone within 3 years of their age, and they're about that age group. As long as you're a decent guy, a couple years won't change a good relationship.
While I personally can't stand a liar. Young people do stupid shit. Did she lie to impress you? Did she lie because she knew you wouldn't date her? Here's my thoughts. Take them as you will. I think you should have a very open conversation about how serious lying is, and how it destroys trust. To move forward, she has to know this is not something you will tolerate at all in the future. I think you need to understand the reason and completely understand shes not even an adult. So if you like her, I think it's okay to show grace but also mark your boundaries. I wish you luck. I will also add I'm 42 and never met a person who didn't lie at least once even if it was small.
This dating range is not outside the acceptable range (said as someone who is pretty strongly against when it gets outside of what I think of as acceptable).

You also did not know so there's no reason for you to feel shame.

And honestly, the chances that a seventeen year old girl is as mature in many ways as a twenty year old boy are extremely high. She's smart certainly much more mature than you were at that age. 

If you gave not had sex yet, I would make sure to slow down with that, particularly if she's a virgin (not that virginity means a lot, but there is something to be said for an age difference with that).

This is not something that I would break up with her over (the lying about the age is actually the most concerning part of it, more than the age difference. I would have a long conversation about that).

Good luck
Once upon a time, I (22) was dating a girl (18) who was about to turn 19 a few months in. On our way to her bday dinner with her family she told me she was really turning 17. I was pissed. Freaked out. Had to google age of consent immediately. Turns out was legal. I was 5.5yrs older... we dated for 2 years. 38yo now, and honestly that was one of the best relationships ive been in. She was more mature than 30/40 somethings ive dated.
I think you’re overreacting here. She shouldn’t have lied, but a 3 year gap isn’t huge and lying about your age isn’t that big of a deal. I wouldn’t break up over it but I would be very sensitive to what other things she lies about. If lying is a way of life for her, it would be a deal breaker. In this instance, I’d wait and see if other things are good.
Keep dating with her who cares it's only a 3-year Gap
This is not a big deal dude. You two are still very young, people make mistakes all the time. Talk to her that you didn’t like the lie and forgive. Don’t list to these bunch of bitter people here, enjoy your relationship while it lasts and learn from it.
May I ask how you found out she was 17? Reddit loves to look for reasons why people should break up. Every relationship requires growth along the way. She's not necessarily a pathological liar.
If you truly want to be together, the age gap will shorten or diminish in the years ahead.  Time flys!
I met my wife when she was 16 and i was 18. We have been married 43 years.

Apart from her not telling the truth and you saying there are no problems in law i dont see the problem here?
If she lied because she truly wanted to be with you, then I'd be kind of honored. If she felt admitting that she was only 17 would be the difference in possibly finding her soul mate, then I guess I wouldn't blame her. As far as the age difference, we're talking about a few months, and it won't even matter in the end. Could she have told you the truth from the start? Yes. And had she told you from the start, would you have said no? If she felt you would have said no, she must have felt a small lie was worth the risk. You were worth the risk.
It's 3 years difference. And at your age she is already more mature than you lol.
Just go with it.   
  
If she felt embarrassed about being young then lying about her age is kindof understandable... and some 17 year olds are more mature than some 20 year olds.   
  
If it works out (and it could still be the best thing that ever happens to you) then a couple of years down the line a 3 year age difference will be nothing. 

For some reason humanity is going through this uber-judgemental phase about sex at the moment. We're in the midst of a new puritanism. Don't listen to the wall of fucking judgement that is the rest of this comment section.

Be gentle and understanding and if it works it works, and if it doesn't it doesn't.
Holy cow.   You are going way overboard.    What is the issue.   This is not an issue.
To be honest, I think that's a fairly common situation. Personally, if you really really love her, it might be worth staying with her. What do her parents / family think? Do they know about the situation? 



It also depends on the country / culture you're in. While the average twitter brigade might crucify you, I personally don't think 3 years is a crazy difference for your 2 ages.
When I was in Middle School all the really cute girls were dating guys in high school, and when I was in high school all the hot girls were dating guys in college. And in college? Girls dated whomever the fuck they wanted from college age guys to old Santa Claus looking motherfuckers. Obviously plenty of young girls date guys older than them. If you are attracted to a mature body that is fine it is when people are attracted to bodies that have not matured that there is a real problem. If your girlfriend is physically mature and I'm willing to bet over the age of consent then you shouldn't really feel weird at all and if you do that is just some head trip that you either placed on yourself or more than likely society has placed on you. The fact that you feel guilty at all means that you're actually a decent dude and as such should give yourself a break. You have done nothing wrong.
That happened to a friend of mine years ago. They are happily married with 2 kids lol
The age difference doesn't seem that much of a problem especially with her turning 18 in a couple months. The problem is lying about something from the get go. What else has she lied about or what will she lie about. Everyone makes mistakes but is this something you can forgive. Basically comes down to how you feel about it. Relationships aren't something simple there is so much nuance and so many things that make up a relationship that nobody else can tell you what to do. You have to look at the relationship as a whole, take into consideration what's happened and see if you can work through it or if you even want to work through it. I will say my wife's 2 years and and 2 months younger than me. We've known each other since we were kids. We dated in high school then right afterwards. We've been together for 27 years married for 23. I can't imagine what my life would be if we hadn't gotten married. Well I'd be dead but that's a different story. Basically I never felt like our age difference was a problem ever.
my wife is 7 years older than me. we meet at work when i was only twenty, been together for 39 years, married for 22 years , still happy and still in love.
It just barely fits on the informal “age gap” calculation.     As you both get older even that gap will mean nothing.  So it’s your call.  It’s justified to be angry, but maybe talk it out, first and find out why she did this.  It seems like you guys have a good thing going and so you shouldn’t rush to throw that away.  Take some time to think.
Bro acting like her being 17 somehow makes you into a groomer or pedophile. Like idk how can u date someone and sound so chronically online at the same time. The only red flag thing she did was lie any lies are typically things u shouldnt avoid as u wont know what else she could lie about. "When i was 17 i still was a kid" my man u are still a kid especially considering u asking for advice on reddit instead of deciding about this situation on your own...
She is of age where you live and you are only three  years older.  You don’t need to feel ashamed about that.  She’s telling you the truth about her age now if you love her you’re allowed to forgive her.  If you can forgive her for lying let her know how it made you feel and let her know you won’t accept any more lying.  Real love is hard to find my friend, if you think that’s what you have think really hard before you do anything
Lol you're 20 yrs old. You're STILL a kid. And honestly a 3 yr gap isn't that big of a deal. You're only hung up that because she's technically a minor but guess what? When you're 23 and she's 20 would that still be so awful to you? How about when you're 21 and she's 18?
\>40 dude here. 

You're both young. If you feel like you'll never get past this, tell her, break up, and move on. 

Then again...you're both young. You're both learning. And there's nothing that says you must break up right now. Obviously there's a trust issue. So communicate like adults and figure it out. 

She's either worth the effort or she isn't. Only you can make that decision.
Eh let me add a positive perspective, Reddit likes to be a mob (first ask her for her id to actually confirm she’s 17 because you are riding on a fine line my friend). 

I’ve been in a healthy relationship for nine years so I can give a more grounded opinion.

She lied to you, probably because she liked you and felt you wouldn’t go out with her if she didn’t lie. It’s clear she didn’t like lying to you and it felt wrong for her, because she had an obvious tell that something was wrong when you brought it up.

This can be something to learn from for the two of you, and work on making each other know you two could tell each other anything. Also share this thread with her, don’t hide anything yourself. If you like her and are okay with the age gap this really isn’t a reason to break up imo, that’s quite extreme. She didn’t trust you with that information, and now you can use that mistake as a way to build trust into a relationship.
Dude. At 20 years old, there's nothing wrong dating a17 year old. Get over yourself

All these people acting like this lie is a big deal sound like losers. She has some level of immaturity, which you do too at 20. Learn to pick and choose your battles
Just shut up and enjoy the relationship.  You think two years is really going to make a huge difference?  AND, she wasn't really lying to YOU.   She was lying to the world around her, and you just happened into it.  You're so much more mature?  You told her you loved her within two months.  Deal with it.  Enjoy yourself.
Dude, lol, omg, im dying while reading this. Yeah, she lied and thats a big no no in a relationship but seriously, if you are only 20, she's probably more mature than you.
I mean seriously, as a man, especially when you are under 25, most gris are a decade ahead of where you are emotionally. 



Lol, the fact that you even posted this shows how immature you are.  Grow a pair, think for your self, you are also just a kid, a very immature kid. I can guarantee she is more mature now than you will be in 5 years from now.


You didn't do anything wrong, yeah, she lied but what ever man.
First, the big issue is lying. And really, I would suggest you internalize why you feel this weird about dating someone two years younger than you. Even three years is not that big of a deal at the age you're at, and when you get older, three years is really not going to make a difference at all
don't listen to online advice as the first thing you do
You're 20 and she's 17, what's the problem? Who cares. That isn't a crazy age gap. You are both still kids. The lying is something though. You don't have a lot of worldly experience at your age either. You are both children.
You're 20 and say "when I was that age" ... uh, three years ago? The age "difference" is not a big deal but the lying about her age could be. However, it doesn't seem like she meant any harm though. You say you care for the young woman so why not put it behind you and see where the relationship goes. You're both so young, enjoy life.
Calm down lad! You aren’t going to appear on a TV show anytime soon. Time to have words though. And work out what happens from there.
I’m curious to know her response when you found out. Was she crying, scared to lose you, felt bad for lying, etc? Or was she straight up defensive, acting like it wasn’t a big deal and can’t understand why you’re upset? 

If the first, I feel she’d be scared enough to never lie to you about anything again and truly, deeply cares for you. I’d speak to her parents and make sure they understand what happened and let your gf know you need some time to yourself to regroup or figure out what you want to do, like others said decide if she’s worth it. 

If the second, then she really doesn’t think it’s a big deal and would lie again if needed. I’d let her parents know the situation and be done.

Just my opinion, thinking on how/why I would’ve done the same as her and what would happen if my bf found out and was upset. If I really cared about him and could see a future together, I’d be a blubbering mess 🤷🏻‍♀️ If you’ve seen her lying to other ppl or not care about others feelings then eh, probably not worth it. Best of luck to you!
She probably was worried you wouldn't date her if you knew her real age (obviously). Honestly tho 20 is also still a teenager imo.
3 year difference is nothing. She might not have been more mature at 19. Depends on the person. Tell her, "you lied to me about your age, which was immature and shows immaturity. It's a huge red flag. I need to know I can trust you moving forward. I like you, so one part of me wants to make this work, but the other part is telling me to run. What would you do if I had lied to you?" 

Ultimately, you're both young, so if you split up you can feel better and even possibly get back together at some other time. and remember the logic dictates that every single relationship will fail until you find 'the one'.
People are a bit harsh on the comments tbh, especially since you really loved this girl. but I might just be naive, who knows. Did she confess or did you find out? Sometimes we lie not thinking about the consequences, to get what we want. Then we are in too deep and afraid to admit the truth. She sae you, she liked you. You asked how old she was she got nervous and lied. Then you actually got close and it became a real relationship. At that point she's didn't want to hurt you or was embarrassed to tell you the truth and that she lied. Once she found out you knew, Did she show any remorse? Has she expressed feeling bad for lying or does she think it's not a big deal. Her reaction to you finding out is more important in my humble opinion. Also did she actually lie about her age or just concealed the truth. Either way, good luck 
Brother, 17 and 19 is like no difference at all. She lied because she was insecure about it. People here want people in their teenage years and early 20s to be super mature and stuff so they will blame her for lying, don’t listen to them. Just talk with her.
I'd be more worried about thinking you know what love is if you're throwing it around 60 days into a relationship lol. You lust and enjoy the company of this person, not love them lok
This entire post calls your maturity level into question. You're acting like you're 30 years older than her when it's only 3 years. You're talking as though you have a vast amount more life experience than her. It's not like you were at university when she was born. You were still at an age most people would consider a baby. Perhaps she picked up on your irrational insecurity. Most people thought I was between 20 and 22 when I was 15 because of how I carried myself. Age is a relative factor and doesn't reflect maturity accurately. If you believed she was older when she said she was, then your reaction of questioning her maturity now is ridiculous and reflects poorly on you. 

The falsehood is the only potential issue here. You need to address that. If you're hung up on the slight age gap, you need to look at yourself and evaluate your own maturity.
You don’t need to feel bad about it. You did nothing wrong. Age is something designated by law and you didn’t know it. So just move on like nothing happened. Next time be more careful. That’s common among teenage girls to be able to date with adult boys.
Age of consent is 16 in your place and you love her, just 3 years appart, chill enjoy your relationship, forgive her.
Everyone here isn’t wrong, the relationship was founded on a lie and that’s a red flag….but she’s 17. Are we surprised the 17 year old isn’t emotionally more mature? I’m not saying it’s right but cut the kid some slack. Also, you’re 20 my guy, to me (33) you’re a kid too.

Talk it out, explain how uncool what she did was and go from there. If she makes a habit of not telling the truth welllllll obviously then you know what you have to do. But for now, some grace is needed I think.
Look you love her she's a sweet girl get over the age difference so she fibbed about her age if you really love her and you believe she's a sweet girl this could be the one you won't know if you break up with her and it is legal don't feel bad get over it and get on with your life
My memaw lied about her age to my pawpaw in the 50s and he didn’t find out until after they were engaged and pregnant. They were married for 55 years. My pawpaw was pissed for about a week and got over it. I know times were different back then but I think if it’s legal where you’re at you just need to have an open conversation about trust and honesty and then move forward.
It’s 3 years if it’s legal it’s not really an issue when you are in your 30s that 3 years will be nothing… the lying that parts not cool but have a conversation with her about it
Honestly the age isn’t the biggest problem. The lying is, bc three years ist that much when you get a couple years older, but lying even starting a relationship? C’mon now
Girls mature emotionally a lot faster than guys. She's probably more mature than you. If it's legal, I don't see anything wrong with it. You just sound like you're looking for an excuse to blow it up.
When you were that age you were just a kid? Bro, you are 20. You are still a kid yourself. Get over yourself. It’s 3 years. Don’t act like you are this super mature person. There is no difference with that age level. If you loved her before, you should still love her if it’s legal where you are. If you make it and you are 27 and she is 24 who the hells cares.
Get over it and get on with it. You're a lucky man.
It's only 3 years, the age is fine
The lying on the other hand.. that's definitely a problem.
Get over yourself. Not such a big deal. If you care for her give her a break on this. She was right in thinking you would not have dated her if she’d told you the truth. The relationship is what matters not your strict notions of propriety.
Would you feel the same was if she was 18? It’s just 1 year apart. If it’s legal it’s not a big deal. Not sure why she would lie about it though
I understand being upset that she lied about her age. When will she be 18? You spoke of her maturity level and you are maturity level at that age you do understand that girls are much more mature than guys at that same age. The male brain isn't even fully developed until between the age of 25 and 28 but I will tell you that most women will agree most men ain't even grown to their 35 to 40 if you love her and it's legal where you're at like you say her age 17 and you 20 she's actually more mature than you and if it feels like real love to both of you I don't think you should walk away just my opinion.
Don’t worry, you’re still just a kid too
It's not that uncommon. Legal age is 16 here, and nobody thinks twice about a 17 yo and 20 yo. That's not a massive age difference. I'd say it's probably more in your head than an actual issue.
As for lying to you to begin with, that's the bigger issue, and that's what I'd be more concerned about.
OP, it's not objectively wrong the stay, the age gap here isn't a big deal. I'll get downvoted here by people who have internet brain but that's the truth.

BUT, I think leaving is something you should strongly consider, personally. This is someone who has lied to you about her age do you trust her to not lie to you about other stuff? That's a question that's up to you to answer, but you should be asking it of yourself.
I wouldn’t put to much emphasis on her lying about her age, it’s not an uncommon thing to lie about and it’s not like she’s 15.

You have 2 options either to date a 17 year old who will be 18 soon that you like or don’t.


Your young the odds of this lasting long term are slim

If you enjoy each other then stick with it
I would dip - the risk of messing around with a minor isn't worth it. Plus, she lied about a pretty fundamental thing so the chances she'll lie about other things are pretty high. 

I would maybe reconsider when she turns 18 and is an adult - if you still have interest in eachother, go crazy then but until then, its not a viable option imo.
Maybe I'm just old, but this is on par for the course for teens. If you were 10 years older and the girl is lying, then that says something. A lot of people are saying she put you in a bad spot, but if you've only been going out for 2 months, that means she's been close to 18 the whole time. Nowhere near 16.
If you truly love her, I would let it slide!
True love is rare, if she treats you good and there are no other issues, give her about her chance. 
She lied yes, only so she could be with you, it is kind of romantic seeing how it is legal. 
You two are nearly the same age as you age it is barely notable a few years age difference. 
Knowing what I know now never let a true love slip away. This is just my humble opinion! 
Good luck and take a breath, don’t talk to your day either that sounds more childish than any thing else I’ve read here.
Call the police.
You’re fucked.
I am in my mid twenties currently but when I was a teenager I would lie about my age because I was so lonely and could only connect with people older than me. These were friendships mind you, but I created a persona so I could have friendships with people in their 20s and even 30s, I enjoyed their more intellectual thinking, enjoyment of arts and museums vs drinking and clubbing. 

I would agree that her lying is not the best sign, but I am sure we have all lied once. So I would investigate why she felt the need to lie? You need to let her know that lying has taken away your capacity to consent to the relationship, and it doesnt look good on you either if the age of consent on her behalf comes into question at some point. 
Your age gap really isnt a lot in the grand scheme of life, but with the age of consent etc and how life changes between 17-21 it can feel like a huge maturity gap. 

Perhaps take a step back, understand her motives, and then take some time apart to think about it. Maybe you could be together a few years down the line if the connection remains. But if you are uncomfortable with her age, then it is reasonable to let her know and end the romantic relationship for now.
I know what people are saying but hear me out. 

Its a really really easy lie to say, and then you cant take it back. The moment you try the relationship will be damaged. I can guarantee by the fact she told you instead of giving some other excuse she felt guilty about it and wanted a way to come clean for a while. And while it is manipulative, its also true. If you are happy together, youd not be if she hadnt made that split second decision she could later not take back
It ends up being less about the age gap and more about the lying.
You’re fucking 20 mate, you’re just a kid yourself. I can understand being upset about the lying, but don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. If she makes you happy, and you make her happy then ride it out.
Age is just a number my friend... unless it's illegal. Then you just go to jail.
She manipulated you into dating her. Not a great start to a relationship if you want to be able to trust her.
It sounds like you’ve already got one foot out the door… trust your instincts
Block her and move on, your of age she isn’t end of story. Don’t mess up your life for a teen. 
Nah it’s cringe. Even if it’s technically legal it’s a really bad look. I’d break up with her.
That age difference doesn't bother me too much

Her lying is a red flag. 

What else hasn't she told you? Age is a huge lie. Especially when it's got potential to land you in trouble. 

She thought of herself first while lying to you. 

Beware moving forward. You're young, I'd end things and try somewhere else
Sorry, but you’re going to have to end it. It’s the right thing to do.
Its three years for goodness sake, not thirty. If shes nearly 18 and you're only just 20 its less than that.  I really don't think you have anything to feel bad about.  You admitted the relationship was good and you were 'so happy' - that says a lot.  You said you loved her even. That has to be worth something.  Maturity levels are very personal and can vary incredibly from person to person. It appears to me you didnt doubt her 'maturity' before so it can't be that obvious.

The lying is obviously not good. I understand you feel upset that she lied to you but havent we all done similar once? She obviously really liked you and really wanted to be with you so she told what I think is a pretty innocuous lie.  Its fine from a legal point of view as shes 'of age'  and most sensible people wouldnt have a huge problem with a small age difference like that. If she'd been underage it would be an entirely different matter.  Make your decision based on how YOU feel - don't do anything to please or placate other people.

Obviously you have to do what feels right for you but think hard before you throw away what looked to be a happy, loving relationship because she  did something stupid.  Personally I think if we're all honest we've all done something similar to put ourselves in a better situation and I can't condemn her for it.  It was wrong but it wasnt earth shattering and now its out in the open you could make renewed promises to each other never to lie and move on.

Waiting for the downvotes because...no-one in Reddit believes in second chances.
3 years in nothing.
WhY? Perfectly normal. 17 year old girls are two years ahead mentally vs boys so ok.

Legality of sex depends where, UK 100% legal as in most countries. USA is rather prudish.
That's a normal age gap, I don't get why you would be so ashamed about it. The problem here is the lie. You should end it because of the lack of trust, not because of the age gap. You dodged a bullet
3 year age gap isn't a huge deal, especially with her being the legal age of consent.

Like others mentioned, the lying from the beginning of the relationship seems to be the bigger issue from a 3rd party perspective.
When I was 17 I was in uni for a couple of months so
You need to talk to her. To me it sounds like she lied cause probably she really liked you and thought if she told you her real age you would've not been interested in dating her. 
She's only 17, I know a lie is still a lie but we've all made so many mistakes at that age..
I mean 20 and 17 is not a big difference.. that being said, why would she lie about that for 2 months? That would be my major distrust
If this is the best relationship you've ever had, then ask you're self can u look past this lie? A 3 year age gap isn't that bad. If you were 20 and 23, it would be the same age, and no one would say anything. Ultimately, do what your heart says as that is what will make you the happiest
I’m not endorsing or defending her behavior, but . . . my wife’s sister was 15 when she met her now-husband, and he was 26. She told him she was 20, and they started dating. She didn’t tell him the truth until she was 18. They stayed together and got married, they’ve been married 13 years, have three kids together, and seem happy.
They’ve been dating for 2 months.
That is a blink.

They are 20 and 17.
They’re both still kids. 

I see no issue with this at all. She lied about her age to a guy she just met, then came clean when things started getting serious. 

My only concern is a 20yo guy saying he “knows he’s in love” after 2 months with a girl who he didn’t know well enough to figure out she’s 17. 
This is silly kid stuff.
Sounds like an ex gf to me
" I think it's best we go our separate ways. The fact that you lied about your age is a massive deal breaker to me. I wish you all the best. Take care."
That’s really not a big age difference. And she is of legal age of consent as you mentioned. But the lying thing is definitely a deal breaker. Just break up with her because she probably lied about other stuff.
Wow, she lied about her age. That is a massive break in trust! I wonder what else she has/will lie about in the relationship.
"It’s legal to date a 17 year old where I live"

I didn't know that a dating relationship was even something you could have a law on the books for. Like how do you legally separate a friendship from dating in legal terms?
If she can so easily lie and manipulate you about her age…what else will she lie and manipulate you into doing?
you sir are just a kid as well. young adult if you want me to be nice. 

  
but i agree with a comment in here that said you should be more worried about her lying overall. Small lies eventually turn into bigger ones and lying about your age is probably the pettiest one.

  
I don't think you should feel ashamed though. you can't control someone else's actions
if you don't know what went through her mind, just ask her. I assume she lied because if she told you the truth, you probably would not progress in the relationship. If you were 25 and she was 22, would it matter?
How old did she say she was?
Shit how can trust she's not 15 or 16 you can't tell by looking at someone
The age isn't a huge deal, three years is not something to fret over. I'd be more concerned that your relationship has started with lies at its base. What else has she or will she lie about? 

Serious talk time OP, and cut and run if it doesn't go well.
You'll be alright
Listen to fucking young / perfect by Tyler the creator
I wouldn’t care about the age gap. 3 yrs isn’t a big deal. If you’re feeling ick just don’t sleep together. Hell putting sex off until you’re much further into the relationship is a good thing in my mind.
I would be more concerned about how easily she lied to get what she wanted and instead of being remorseful, she doubled down and actually asked you to pretend that you found out about her lie. 

That's not a good sign at all. I would stop dating her if I were you. You've only been going out for 2 months.
Your girlfriend lied to you not only about her age, but about being an adult. A relationship that begins with a lie doesn't seem likely to succeed. Even if no laws have been broken, you've already says you feel creepy with having a relationship with a minor and you feel ashamed.

No matter what you feel about her, or the "her" you thought you knew, if I were in your shoes this revelation would be the immediate end of the relationship. Simply pretending nothing happened isn't going to do you any favors. I'm sorry you found yourself in this situation, but, at the same time, you can't control the behavior of others.
Meh
Tbh 17 and 20 is fine. It's pushing the limit *barely* given that she's presumably in highschool and you're in college, but I wouldn't really consider that a problem.

The bigger deal is she lied.
Bro 17-20 no one outside of people online care about this, maybe if she was still in highschool but other than that what are you talking about like bro you’re 20 what in the last 24 months has made you so much more of an adult?

That aside she lied to you and really only told you the truth b/c you caught her it’s wasn’t much a willing confession.
So if you can get past that it’s on you but it’s more than reasonable to break up over that.
You’re 20. You’re still just a kid dude. I doubt anything wild or mind blowing actually happened to you in the last 3 years that has somehow made you more mature. You said “I love you” after two months. Two months is a fart in the wind. You aren’t as old as you think you are. Pretty soon years are going to run past you and you aren’t going to know how the fuck you’re sitting where you are.
 
It’s a 3 year age gap. You aren’t a “huge creep” and were effectively looking for someone in your age range. 
 
I would be concerned with the lying. A serious and adult conversation should be had about that.  Probably good reason to call it done right now regardless. Request a legal ID and confirm her age with someone close to her at a minimum. If you legitimately seeing this playing out for the long haul (I have no idea how you could after only 2 months) then take it very very slow, have public dates, get to know each other without “physical” interaction. Let her reach 18 and for whatever reason you’ll magically feel better about it.
 
It doesn’t sound like you are breaking any laws, you aren’t hurting anyone. Only you get to decide how you deal with the dishonesty.
card her next time
Watch "Animal House"
The fact that your relationship started with a lie should be the biggest issue here. That must shake everything up for you big time and I'm sorry that happened to you. It's hard to lose what feels like a great relationship but you have to remember, she lied so easily about her age, which is a huge thing to lie about, what other lies has she told you already and what more would you have to look forward to. There will be some amazing relationships you might miss out by being willing to look past this lie
It's easy to be happy when the other person is a liar.  I've heard it lots. "It was the perfect relationship! Then I found out he is married and has 3 kids". It was fun because he was having a blast and lied constantly and ALWAYS told you what you wanted to hear. She was fun because she was getting away with something that she knew was wrong.  Don't let people play you.
The issue isn’t her age. Is her lying about her age.
if this is already causing you to question things, it’s probably a sign that moving on is the best choice, even if it sucks right now. you deserve someone who respects you enough to be upfront, especially about something this big. better to walk away now than let things get more complicated down the line.

you’re not a creep for feeling torn—you’re just dealing with the fallout of her decision, and honestly, it sounds like you’re handling it pretty maturely.
well goodluck...
First, you’re chillin man. You cannot beat yourself up over a lie someone else told you, not your fault at all. Personally I would break up. It’s pretty clear you’re uncomfortable with the lie and age difference and it makes you feel bad now. On top of that, if she lied about something that serious, what else could be a lie? Better to be with someone who will be real with you and honest. Of course you do you, just my thoughts.
 I personally think you are over reacting but if it makes you feel that bad then it does. Go with what your gut tells you to do
Ok but it’s legal?? If you like her stick with her but the lying shit is more of a personality trait for her not you. Don’t beat yourself up but definitely check that ID because if it’s legal and she still lied, it could still be a lie. :)
saying you love her 2 months in is crazy work
Satire
This happened to me. Meet a girl while traveling over the summer, she said she was 19 (I was 20). 3 years later we were able to date for real and she mentioned being excited for her 21st birthday... We were mid hookup when I did the math in my head and almost had a heart attack. Thankfully no laws were broken (she'd been 18 rather than 19) but I was freaked out for a little while
The age difference is not a concern. Concealing her age and lying about it is what bothers me. Look, 17 is immature, so maybe she was simply thinking you'd split if you knew her true age. I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker, but the caution signs are flashing.
If you love her, I'd continue...   (Assuming there's no other red flags)

That age lying could be a lot more innocent than you may think. What were her intentions for lying her age?  She lied because she really liked you and knew you wouldn't date her if she was 17, is that so bad?   People lie for many things and some are good some are bad..  the intention is everything...
*Trust broken.*
girls mature earlier. dont worry about it too much. I'm 18 and whenever i look at boys my age it fills me with disgust to see how much of naive children they are I personally wouldnt date any man under 23
Honestly, the age gap isn't *that* big, in the grand scheme of things. So if the relationship is really that good, then I wouldn't necessarily let the age thing be a deterrent. There's not usually a big difference in mental maturity between a 17 year old and a 20 year old. Not to mention, according to one of your other comments, she'll be 18 in a couple of months.

The real issue here is the fact that she lied to you. If she'd lie about this, who knows what else she'd be willing to lie about.
Break up with her cause you’re gonna be 21 soon and a 17 year old isn’t able to go out and do the same things
I mean first of all, confirm that she is in fact 17. if she is it's not a huge age difference between you two. Especially if you're a young 20 and she's an older 17. her body is already mature at that point, if you like her continue to date her. But make sure she's not in fact 15 or some shit
I've had this EXACT SITUATION. Luckily it's not illegal so don't worry. But I would leave. I tried to make it work and she cheated more times than I've been on a date in my life
You didn't do anything wrong.   She lied .learn the lesson   Move on.  Let it go. There are lots of liars in the world.
This is my story exactly.  

When I started dating my husband, I was less than 2 months shy of turning 18. He was 22. We met in college, as I was dual enrolled, so he thought I was older. He was going to be moving away the next summer so we knew it wasn't going to be a long term thing. 

On our first date, we were in line for a club that was checking IDs. He must have seen the look on my face and asked if I'd forgotten my ID. I was on the spot, panicked, and said I did. Later that night, at a different loud bar, he asked my age, so I rounded up as I'd already said the reason I couldn't get into the club was forgetting my ID.

Things moved quickly and we knew we really liked each other. I confessed my age a few weeks later. He always said he would have never asked me out if he knew I was 17. He actually misheard me at the loud bar and thought I said 19 instead of 18 so he was pretty shocked. Still, at that point, my 18 birthday was maybe a month away.

A 5 year age gap is decent when you're that age, not so much in your 40s anymore.
Your relationship probably won't work out if she's already lying about her age in order to date you. And you're only 20. If at 17, 3 years ago, you were just a kid. Sorry but I laughed at that one. You're still a kid. Anyway, if her lying is a deal breaker, let her know.
This was your first good relationship… but… it’s been only 2 months. Relax. Move on. It takes way longer than 2 months to be sure if a relationship is really good, 100% of the time (not bad though, bad may be way before the 2 months mark). You’re not loving, you’re just attached.
If she lied to you because she knew you'd never date her otherwise, imagine what other lies she'll tell you out of the knowledge that you'd react negatively, or not in her favor, down the line. Leave before you end up in a relationship of lies for the sake of her getting what she wants.
I was 17 when a 21 year old guy started dating me. He knew my age. It kind of messed me up for a long time because he kind of imprinted on me because I thought he was so mature and cool. I think back and remember how I felt at the time (special, cool, smart, mature). But also know how the side effects lingered.

Anyway. Hearing your concern about your age gap feels really healing for me. I wish the 21 year old had either loved me and treated me accordingly instead of playing me, or had the grace to leave me alone.
I was in that situation I was the one faking my age, I did it because I knew I didn’t have a chance w her even do I was just 2 y younger but didn’t even have any bad intensions, what love makes a person do. (We have a kid together now 6 years after)
It's up to you. It's legal, but she is a liar.
You’re 30 now but we’re just “a kid” 3 years ago? You’re still a kid.
You are a good person to recognize this. Continue to be one, much love
Oh my goodness, for the first time in all of humanity, a 17-year-old lied about her age. She's basically Hitler. Send her to prison for life.
Did she lie to you about her age or did you assume she was over 18?
1. If she lied about her age, and you are 2 months into the relationship,  maybe take a step back. Sure the age of consent may be legal, but it's still a lie.
Discuss this with her.
2. If you assumed...that's on you

This is still a fresh relationship and with all relationships, you need to communicate with eachother
While the age is a huge factor... the lying is enough. Maybe she really liked you and wanted to be accepted by you? Either way, lying in general is not good. If she lies now, its most likely she'll lie about more things.  
And are your age where you haven't experienced enough of life to be able to handle a mass of sh1t, you need to move on.  
Take this as a learning experience. Learn, and just move on. Though, do be careful about her possibly lying to the authorities if you piss her off.   
Best of luck OP.
My wife is 4 years older than me. It's amazing how things shift in regards to she after both people are over 18 :). 

That said, I'm sorry this has happened and that you're dealing with this. I'm also sorry you don't feel like you've got anyone in your circle that you can talk to about it. 

You've done nothing wrong. You sadly were lied to. But you've done nothing wrong. 

I'd like to say maybe she'll learn from this. But honestly, I'm not sure that would happen and not sure it's worth the risk to your life and trust in others.
Can’t have a healthy relationship built off of lies and false personas. 
this happened to me. i was 24 he was 17 (i thought/was told that he was 20 and he looked it too). we met online but i did end up moving to the state he lived. suddenly he was coming up with excuses as to why we couldn’t meet. that went on for a few months before i finally did some sleuthing and found his mom’s facebook where i learned his real age. i confronted him and he just like, froze and blocked me on everything (even spotify lol) he had been keeping up this lie for years (we were together for 1 year but best friends before that) i ended up telling his mom and then i treated it like every other breakup, even though it was far from a typical one. i screamed, i listened to angry breakup music, i confided in mutual friends, i found his alt account on twitter and exposed him under every single tweet before i got blocked, i got a therapist to process how traumatizing it all was (i have OCD and when i was a teen it made me terrified i was a pediphile despite not being attracted to children. i haven’t had an intrusive thought like that in years but was scared this would bring it up since we had been sexual over facetime and such. luckily it didn’t. as soon as i figured out he was 17, i lost all attraction), i forgave myself, i mourned the person i lost who never really existed. and then i moved on.

just wanted to share my story to let you know you’re not alone. but like others have said, if she’s lying about something as serious as her AGE, she doesn’t give a fuck about you and is almost certainly lying about other things too (my ex lied about his socioeconomic status, his mom surviving DV, a history of addiction, a DEAD EX GF WHO NEVER EXISTED, And so much more) save urself the headache.
Why would she lie if it's legal? And you guys aren't even this far apart, it's 3 year. In my opinion the biggest mistake was dating someone younger instead of a milf.
This happened to me. I was dating a girl and didn't tell me she was 16. Trust broken right away.
European women here - I don’t see what the big deal is?! Girls (especially teenagers) lie about their age ALL THE TIME and about other stuff too (getting out of trouble etc.) she probably figured you would be upset and leave her that’s why she lied. And the age difference is minimal so why would you be ashamed? She is above the age of consent so I say: get over it and enjoy your time, you are too young to be this serious and self-conscious!
That’s a pretty serious thing to be lying about. Personally I’ve be devastated about the fact I’d been lied to about something like age. You have only been together for 2 months so I reckon just break it off while it’s still new. Don’t get roped into more lies and deception.
I’m gonna make an extremely unpopular opinion.

That lie was unforgivable, yes… but if I looked at facts alone like people aren’t imperfect creatures, I’d be the first to cast the stone… but imperfect emotional humans that we are; the fact that you were special enough to her that she felt the need to lie in order to guarantee a place in your heart is understandable.

So I have a really important question for you.

Is she your friend ?

It might sound like a really stupid question but ask yourself this. If she was your friend, not your girlfriend, but like an actual friend, like one of the bros… could you forgive your friend for lying about something like their age ? Would you lose your mate over something like that ? Would you punch your bro over something like that ? Can you say you’ve never lied when you were 17 ?

If this is a girl that you only have a romantic attraction to and you don’t have common interests or common goals, you only talk about kinky or romantic stuff and you’re in a honeymoon phase of your relationship, then that lie would be an absolute dealbreaker.

But if this girl means a lot to you as a friend, as more than just a friend but a Good Friend, maybe even a BEST FRIEND… then would you overlook that lie in order to stay friends ?

I don’t know what sort of culture it is where you live my friend… but I believe the right thing to do is to do right by her, then about what you want, then worry about the opinions of others as a last priority.

If this girl is trying to rush into a relationship and you don’t have the self control to rein it in, then it’s time to call it off.

I am making some heavy assumptions here like you will only do the sleeping together deed once you are engaged and married… and that you’ll be in this courtship for at least another 6 months to determine whether you truly are meant for each other… but assuming that is the case and everything is above board, then I don’t see why you cannot continue this relationship.
Using the common rule of creepiness: 20 / 2 + 7 = 17. You're okay, just.

But she lied. That is a concern.
You’re both kids. Give it a rest.
Dump her and delete this. You really need advice? That's worrying.
Far less concerned about the age gap in this specific instance (especially because you didn't know and it's only three years) and far more concerned about the lying. The maturity levels between a 20 year old and a 17 year old probably feel huge to you, but to us geezers, I promise it's not that big and it doesn't make you a creep (especially because again, you didn't know and it wouldn't necessarily be as obvious as you're thinking). I'm only mentioning it because it sounds like you're taking this on your own shoulders, but you didn't do anything wrong here. It's cold comfort and easier said than it is to take to heart, but you don't need to feel ashamed when you had bad information to begin with.

But the lying...that IS bad. That is a sign of a lack of maturity - not one you could have predicted, and certainly not one limited to underage folks. But it should be a deal-breaker, IMHO, especially when it's about something like her age. You have a right to know when someone you're interested in is younger than you're comfortable with, and the fact she lied is a breach of trust (and arguably means that you weren't even in a position to give informed consent to anything you may or may not have done). 

There are other mature girls in your age group out there who will respect you enough not to lie to you and are just as sweet as this one was. Find one of them, and block this girl's number and socials.
You couldn’t tell how old she was by what she did every day, her job, etc.
dont break up with her please. i know this is the only comment saying that, but from a normal human being's a GIRL'S perspective, I would say dont break up with her. Yeah, she lied about her age, but the age gap isnt even big. You should throw away your relationship just because of a little lie. I understand people saying that lying in relationships is bad, but if she ACTUALLY does something bad later on, then you can break up with her. But i honestly dont see a point of breaking up with her because you didn't do anything wrong, and she just wanted to date you so much to the point where she felt the need to cover up her age with a lie. If the girl goes that far for you it means she lieks you. You also seemed to have a good relationship with her. PLUS- MOST IMPORTANT THING- GIRL'S MATURTITY LEVELS ARE 2 YEARS AHEAD THAN BOYS!!! So what I mean is that if a girl is 17, her mental age is usually 19 (since girls start puberty around 2 years earlier than boys, they are psychologically proven to be more mature. that's why boys would always laugh at balls jokes while girls wouldn't in middle school).
dude you need to break up. and yet based on your replies it feels like you wont.
You’re 20.  You’re still a kid now.
You should not worry about it much.   
She was extremly scared that you would refuse her, if she is to  young. You didn't, turned out very fine, when she said she was a little bit older.   
Half a year or a full year later, its nothing to worry about anymore.
Yea bro, if she would lie about that, she will lie about other things too. If I was you, I move on. It’s not worth it and plus you never know what a person will do if she is mad.
Stay single. Not a single human being on this entire planet can be trusted. Never ever open up to anyone ever again unless you want to get fucked over.
Lots of issues here. But you can start maturely saying while age is just a number to a point, you would want to ensure she has her "teenage years" and the two of you can see if you are both interested in a relationship when she turns 19. Heck, watch sound of music if you need. 

It's a short and long time. Tbh you probably aren't going to get back together. But separate the immaturity (lying) from the person. And don't discount your own judgment of her initially or blame yourself for what others corre try note as manipulation. 

Why? First, this gently let's her down and if some warnings about not handling this well are correct, it doesn't put a target on you. 

Second, she is a person. As are you and you indicated you do care for her. Keep the door open. My gosh look at Hollywood with 70 yo dating 20 yo. Eek. Not endorsing. 

But, you said it's legal. Others right point out it's deceitful. But if she were older? Would you have the same concern? If she said 19 when she was 22? I am not giving lies a pass, but depending how the age started and when it came up, you can care about her. 

Pause. She is young. Now. But you might meet 30 yo later who are less mature. 

I'm not suggesting you lie to her either. If you are not willing to consider resuming a relationship in two or so years potentially, don't promise. But in the small world, never say never, why not have an open mind. Just not now.
I get it, but you know what. If you were 50 married to a 47 year old, would you have an issue with it?  
You like her personality, and the way she behaves, maybe she is just sweet and shy rather than immature. I’ve known some pretty immature 30 year olds.
My advice?  If the relationship is working for you both, then stick with it.
The lying however, is not ok.  You can’t build a relationship if the foundation isn’t rock solid.  You need to talk to her about the lie.  Maybe she felt she had to, because she liked you and specifically didn’t want you to have the ick
You’re feeling now.  But if you want it to work, she needs to build that trust back up.
It’s three years and you like eachother.  In ten years that will seem like nothing. And you’re just a kid yourself at 20, you just don’t realize that. If it’s not illegal, see what happens.
I don’t think it’s something to end things over.  Just make sure she thinks she is gonna lose u over it and make a hard line and then give her one more chance.
End things with her...before she cheats on you , and when caught says she didn't tell you because you'll leave her. Better do it now at its early stage before you go in too deep.
Well your still just a kid u ain't nothing but 20 that what 3 years that ain't nothing now u would of said 14 or something that be different
Even at your age, the 3 year difference isn't huge in my opinion, especially because that would put the average people of your respective ages and genders on a closer maturity level in many respects. Obviously though, that isn't the case in your situation. I dated a 24 year old when I was 17, but I was honest about my age. I didn't realize until about 10 years later how disgusting it was that he was okay with that, and even worse that my parents were, too. But if he had been 20 instead of 24, I wouldn't be as bothered by it. 

However, since she lied about her age, she's probably not mature enough to be dating anyone yet, of any age. And if you brush it off as a silly but forgivable mistake, it won't teach her anything. She will learn that she can get away with lying to her partner, and the lies will get worse. Facing the consequences of it the (hopefully) first time will give her much more of a chance to learn that lying to her partner about anything is wrong, and save her having to go through years of miserable relationships built around lies. Breaking up with her isn't just doing what's best for you in this situation, it's doing what's best for her, too.
The age gap is tiny. Many advanced countries you can have sex at 15 or 16.

I wouldn't be worried about age but definitely confront her and see what her explanation is.

Only you can determine what to do.
This sounds sketch man. I would be worried about the lying, plus she may not even be 17 if she's lying about her age already!
If I find out someone is lying about something fundamental we’re done. Honesty is THE FOUNDATION to a good relationship. I’m not being dramatic, I just know how it’s gonna play out. The only way she will learn and change is if you break up with her
I know someone that this actually happened to. She lied about her age but then did turn 18 like a month later where she then told the truth... Relationship turned out to be a nightmare. Starting a relationship with a lie is a huge red flag, what else would she lie about in the future? To me lying is a bit nono. You have to be able to trust your partner.
Can you get councilimg? The age difference isn't much the lack of honesty can be. I was 24 and my now wife was 19 now 67 and 62 still together.
2 months in and you're already saying you love her? DAMN boy that's so soon 🤣
I don’t agree that lying is 100% disqualifying. It’s a problem, but Context matters.

If you still like each other, then I would try to talk about it openly as possible.  This will determine whether or not a relationship can be salvaged.

Figure out what’s legal, and the course correct as necessary.  Tell each other how you feel, and Why.

I also notice that To Leave someone who did something bad is also to abandon the good parts of them.

Good luck
Tbh, I’d be more worried about the lie than the actual age. I get your embarrassment, but to no fault of your own. At just 2 months in, I’d run. 🏃
With these I wonder what the liar's end game was. Like, if you never found out and the relationship flourished, was she just going to try and lie to you forever? Hardly tenable.


Anyway, I agree with the comments that the lying is a bigger issue than the age difference. Could well be a deal breaker, but I don't know her and I do think there's something to be said for second chances, but only you can judge whether she, and the relationship, possibly merit that. Good luck, anyway. 
Of course you feel this way. She lied about something very serious, which has gotten a lot of people jailed and in massive trouble.
I know lots of people are saying ditch her. That being said though. 3 years isn't that much and is legal where you are. She lied because she liked you, which is not great. Anecdotally though, I do know one or two couples who when they started dating one of them lied about their age and they have now been married for like 30 years.
That happened to me when I was younger. You’ll forget about it. I did until just now.
Let me be crystal clear here - this isn't just about age, this is about deception. This young woman deliberately misled you about something incredibly important, and that's not okay. Not even close to okay.

First, let me acknowledge your integrity here. The fact that you're wrestling with this morally, despite it being technically legal where you live, shows strong character. That matters. A lot of guys might try to justify continuing the relationship, but you're putting principles above personal feelings.

Now, to address this whole "let's pretend you never knew" suggestion - absolutely not. That's completely unacceptable. She's asking you to compromise your values and conscience to enable her deception. Red flags everywhere.

Look, I know you care about her. I know this hurts. But she violated your trust in a fundamental way that affects the entire foundation of your relationship. She took away your ability to make an informed choice about who you were dating.

My advice? End it. Clean break. Yes, it's going to be painful, but continuing this relationship means:
1. Compromising your values
2. Accepting dishonesty as acceptable behavior
3. Potentially putting yourself at risk legally and socially

You're 20 years old. You have so much life ahead of you. Don't let this deception trap you in a situation that goes against your conscience.

Remember guys, trust isn't just a nice-to-have in relationships - it's absolutely essential. Don't let anyone convince you to compromise on that.
She’s gonna lie about this you can’t trust her.
17 and 20 isn’t a big deal bud. The real issue is her lying.
Welcome to Mexico lol
So dramatic.  You're a guy. For you to actually comment on maturity level is laughable. She's been "mature" enough for you to fall in love with her thus far... Also, comparing number of relationships is zero reflection of anything. At 20, having 4 relationships just means you're not having any long-lasting, significant ones. 

I think it's a non-issue and you making it an issue may show YOUR lack of maturity.... Age 17 for almost all girls, are at or likely above the level of a 20 year old male.
You only dated her for 2 months and you already said you love her. I don’t mean to speak for you but in my relationships I didn’t love them after only 2 months, it’s a whole process and it’s not just “I like being around you so I love you” it’s deeper than that. Definitely take the time to reflect on your relationship
I was two days shy of 16 when I started dating my husband, and he had been 19 for four months. The first time he saw me I was doing a keg stand but I put the wrong part of the tap in my mouth and my hair was also down so the keg just kind of soaked my entire head. We've been together for 10 years now.

I'd be more concerned about the lying. If you're going to continue the relationship you have to start fresh, no bullshit.
The age doesn't matter but the fact that she lied does! She's not a good person if she can lie like that. And it was not a good relationship if she could lie like that.
A little different because me and my partner were both adults at the time we got together, however he was hanging around a group 3-4 years older than he was.. I never asked him how old he was because it didn’t seem necessary (he also had a full beard and looks older than I do) alas, when we eventually hooked up I asked him his age… he was only 20!! And I was 25 turning 26. It was a hard thing for me to process, but I found my soul mate we have been together 6 years now and have a 3 year old. 17-20 isn’t a huge age gap and as you get older a 3 year age gap is nothing! I would suggest having a conversation about the lying and do what feels best for you.
Man same thing happened to me in my early 20s. I’m a pretty honest person and took what she told me at face value when I did find out she was 17 a bunch of other lies came up as well ended that real quick.
If she lied about her age once, she might have lied about it again. Especially after reading that it took some pressing from you to get the truth. Either way, a relationship built on lies will never last.
I don't think you have any reason to feel ashamed unless you knowingly took advantage of her somehow. Now that you know her real age, you just have to be a bit more careful not to stun her growth as a person.
Aww, hugs OP. If you two are meant to be, you'll meet her again in the right time.
frankly she is not a trustworthy person and she has manipulated you, which for something this significant is enough to indicate that she lie to you about more things later because she “knew that you wouldnt do (thing) if you knew.” for me this would be a relationship ender. im also 20, and even if the age of consent here was 16, i would not want to date a 17 year old, or even an 18 year old. i wish you the best
When does she turn 18?  Is it going to be that big of a difference when you are 23 and she's 20??
Its your country and cultures ethics in play. Are you happy? Don't worry about what others think especially in other countries that do not have the same laws. What do you feel deep down inside? Did she tell you her age or did you later find out about it?
The lying's not good. But another way of looking at it is: she's just a kid, still.  She lied to get what she wanted, and didn't think twice.  As in, "It'll be okay, right?"

She may get over this as she matures -- many do -- but I'd look at the maturity level more than anything.  Manipulative or not, maybe she's just not ready for a real relationship.
So what?... people lie.. especially young and unexperienced people.. she's got a lot of growing up to do... don't hold it against her, that's how that growth turns into toxic growth..

Positive reinforcement is more powerful than projecting negativity... your perception can shape reality..  

If you treat a dog like it will bite you, it will likely bite, because of the way you treat it... but treat a dog that would bite you with kindness and respect and positivity and you'll have yourself a best friend.


Figure out what you want and don't try to dictate what she should or shouldn't do and when she does something you don't agree with, understand that there's likely a good reason that she did what she did... maybe she lied out of fear, maybe inferiority, maybe lust, maybe it doesn't fuckin matter... when she's cheating on you then you've got a problem...  she lied to be with you.... let it go... or your problems might become actual problems....
Advice? Wtf are you expecting here? Block her on everything and NEVER speak to her again. Gtf outta here.
🙏🙏🙏
Her body count is going to be pretty high too.
Ppl saying her lying is a big red flag???? Bro she’s a child. Like what ? Of course she lied huh
Just to be safe, go date someone closer to your age. If you must, you can ask for IDs.
Sorry man that’s rough, that would be a scary situation for sure. She does she turn 18? Not that it will help with the trust issues but maybe you’ll feel less of a creep if it’s soon. I wouldn’t know what to do in your situation except breakup.
And this is why I took girls on first dates to a bar setting,  let a bouncer/bartender confirm for me she's at least 21.
Hey man, this actually happened to me.
I promise you it's just one of many lies to come, get out of dodge asap
it’s only been 2 months, take the L and go
If you're actually happy in the relationship otherthan this one thing ,  forgive her and see where the relationship goes.
At 17 she's emotionally immature and will be going through many changes over the next 5 years.  She's been LYING to you about her age.  Even if the age of consent is 16 that's still an issue.

I deal with the police a lot and once was told by an officer who REALLY  wanted to arrest a guy who was a total scum bag but couldn't because while he was a scum bag he hadn't technically broken the law. 

What is morally right is not always LEGAL and what's LEGAL is not what is morally right. 

I think of you're here asking strangers on the internet you know a 20 year old man should be with a woman closer to his own age
My parents have an 8 year age gap and they are still together, (19-27) a friend set them up and lied about their ages to each other, they didn’t realize until months into their relationship. Married almost 35 years. I think 3 years is fine you both seem compatible and you’re honestly closer in age than not 
17-20 is a bit but once it’s 18-21 it’s a shrug for sure lol
Nobody would give a shit if the genders were reversed
The ages of 16-20 are a struggle in terms of relationships because you walk a fine line... I did this once. My friend and I went to a party with some older guys and girls 20-24, and I was 17 (she told everyone we were 19). I ended up meeting a guy that was 23, and we hit it off incredibly well. I hung out with him solo a few times (nothing had happened), but when I knew it was going to move in that direction, I had to "man up" and tell him.. i did not ask to see him again, and he appreciated me telling him. I also didn't offer to continue talking to him because though I was not the one that ultimately lied to him, i was not forth coming, and I would not want to put that kind of pressure on him.  Good luck to you! For those of you that said "being in HS should have been the first clue", I was 17, graduated, sharing an apartment with a friend, while working a fulltime bartending job in WI. I was also driving a sports car that I had paid for myself. Look out for some of those thrifty 17 yr olds 😂
For the record, women mature quicker than men(assuming ur male). So at 17 she would be as mature as you are now, if not more mature in some ways. Of course this isn’t always the case. As someone who dated a man much older than me(27) when I was 18, age really shouldn’t be a deciding factor in a relationship, heck we’re still together and he’s the love of my life. And being honest it was REALLY hard and REALLY WEIRD at first: he felt like a cradle robber, I felt sleazy for going after a guy so much older, but having been more mature than ppl his age and ppl my age it worked out really well. Honestly she lied and that’s pretty bad considering she should’ve clarified right before you guys became official, but at the same time she was probably so head over heels that she made a bad decision. Ppl make mistakes, it’s only human, but it’s ultimately up to you to decide whether to forgive her. Everyone in the comments saying you should instantly drop her bc she lied are all hypocrites, we’ve all been there, we’ve all made choices we regret. Granted yall have only been together for 2 months, IMO that’s not a big loss, you could move on and end up finding someone even better. All up to you to decide how much you care about her and/if ur willing to give it another shot bc of that. Hope this helped :)

(PS before y’all try and twist my story into something gross, I pursued my BF, not the other way around, we had so much in common since I’d been raised old school, I don’t even have friends my age bc we don’t get along or have the same priorities)
Maybe I'd forgive for age part once but the fact she lied would be heart shattering deal breaker. Coz while I understand that she can't change her age and didn't wanna miss dating u but it's always gonna prick that she lied about such a simple thing (esp when age matters to u when saying people) and might lie to you again as per her convience (and if there r more things she might have lied about)
So what?  You're both practically kids.  Those saying she lied about this, what else would she lie about?...she's a kid and did it to date someone she liked. It's a white lie.  

But don't fret, at your age, the relationship probably isn't forever material either way.  Enjoy it or dont...  You'll both get over it.
it’s just 3 years when you get older 3 years means nothing
Also you could just decide to stay friends and explore dating again when she a little older, get to know eachother more honestly as friends first.
Dude... 3 years difference is NOTHING. There are FOURTEEN years between my wife and I. Enjoy your relationship. It sounds kinda sweet. Please don't get hung up on age. Go take her out for an ice cream
lmao you made a big mistake asking reddit, redditors are infamous for advising people to break up over the dumbest stuff

wife forgot to wash the dishes? it means she's a lazy ass that doesn't care about contributing to the marriage and you should break up now!!!! 

in all seriousness, she's 17, and her intentions were probably not out of malice, everyone makes dumb mistakes at that age, you should see if you can get past the fact that she lied about her age, and talk to her about it and see if she feels remorseful.
Manipulative at such a young age. A shame.
You didn't notice she was going to highschool?
17 and 20 are pretty much the same age. There are MUCH MUCH worse lies my guy.
Well I think you should tell her parents. Like, you could say that your daughter is  lying about her age. Cause if you're honest with everything, you won't be exposed as a pedo
if I didn't read someone claiming that dating an 18 year old is "pedophilic" if you're 30 just the other day, this post would have been the dumbest shit I had read all week
i'm 19 and was in a similar position with my ex boyfriend a couple weeks ago. faced no legal consequences but the maturity was certainly lacking
Don't feel ashamed about the age itself. 17 and 20 is ok, not necessarily ideal but definitely not in creepy weirdo territory, it's acceptable. General rule is half your age plus seven, which is 17. What should be more important here is the fact she lied about it.
She's only 3 years different than you.
Depends on how you met her. U meet a girl during a highschool event then it's safe to assume she is not 20
Leave her.
The lying is more of a concern than the age tbh.
Big red flag if she’s lying to you about something like that.
I had someone tell me they were 24 only to find out they were 22.. I was 32 it really messed me up as I was already struggling with 24. 

So I get it's not really about legalities.. 17 seems suspiciously just over 16 tho.. I'd ask to see a passport or birth certificate at that point.
If they'll lie about little stuff they'll lie about big stuff
Relax buddy. She's probably more mature than you.
Right now 17-20 seems massive but in 3 years it won't seem so bad 20-23 doesn't sound as bad.
In 10 years the 3 year age gap will seem even smaller  being 20 is a difficult age to date because of that legal adult vs not legal adult age gap is so tight
The age gap is nothing.  What matters is how she reacted when you caught her in a lie.  Did she apologize or shrug it off?  If she apologized, did it seem genuine?

People make mistakes, and it’s not always a black and white indication of their character.  Remorse, however, is
I do not think you are in legal danger because she is over the age of 16. In a couple of years, a three year difference is nothing.
If for you the problem is her age, just wait a few months and she'll magically be mature enough for you (?) You do realize you're not that much more "mature" than her.

The problem isn't the age difference, since there basically is none, its her lying to you. Only 2 months and already lying is a big red flag.
Dude, I'm going to give a different answer. There's nothing to be ashamed about.

Why did she lie? Because she knew her age would creep you out. Your post proves that.

Don't let the internet guilt trip you. If the law says 16, you really have nothing to worry about. A 3 year gap really is nothing.

People used to get married at 16 and start families. This entire thing about being a child until your 18th birthday is a relatively modern thing.
Well there's a second option stop , breath and say ok let's chill on all the over 18 stuff , and wait , or run away and never know
Josh Giddey on a burner?
Lying is a deal breaker
But There's nearly no difference between a 17-year-old and a 20-year-old maturity. Wise, you're still kids.
You are boned
You didn’t do anything wrong, the fact you feel this way now proves you’re a good person who wants to do the right thing. You were operating on the information you had at the time. I do think you should break up though, solid relationships are built on trust. You’re both still so young, you’ll have plenty of other opportunities. And maybe when you’re both older you’ll meet again, who knows. But now is not the right time for this relationship- all the best!
My mom told my dad (who was 25 at the time) that she was 20, when she was really 17. They were together for 32 years before he passed. Obviously that was more normal in the 70s, but 17 to 20 is not really a weird age gap. 

Just make sure she lied to you only because she likes you lol. If she’s a pathological liar, that’s probably a problem
You're going to prison.  Federal anal prison.
If you do love her, forgive the white lie, it really doesn’t change who she is and came from a place of insecurity. Otherwise nothing to be ashamed of. Get back to having a great relationship and continue having fun together. Best of luck.
It’s true that she lied and it sucks… but you must remember that she’s still a kid. Actually, you both are. Your prefrontal cortex isn’t fully developed until about 24. She’s only three years younger than you and she will mature. Most people agree that girls also tend to mature faster than guys. I’m sure you guys will meet in the middle in regard to maturity level pretty soon. It’s important that you lay your boundaries and communicate that she can’t be lying to you. If I were you, I’d personally give her another chance. In my country, it’s socially acceptable to be with someone 5 years younger/older than someone as long as they’re of age. My older sister graduated early at 17 and got a boyfriend who was five years (at least) older than her. They were together for fourteen years, but throughout the relationship, she was always more mature than him and he cheated on her and she ultimately left him. My grandpa lied about his age to my grandma. About a whole decade difference in age (he was younger). She found out, but was in love with him. If she didn’t stay, my mom wouldn’t be here and neither would I. I could understand you wanting to drop her now. It’s a personal choice. If I was really interested in someone though and things were going really well, I would feel the same way as you if this situation occurred, but I’d consider giving them another chance. Another offense and I’d say goodbye.
"Then I may as well tell you that I'm actually 35."
Suuuuure.
She most likely lied about it since she’s into you and didn’t want to miss out. But still talk it out though.
I laughed when I read the "Just a kid" part.
I am so so sorry you have to go through this, dude. I can't even think of the most amazing advice tbh. I'd break it off and distance myself so so sooooo far from this girl.
17 is pretty much an adult
It's only 3 years difference.
She lied to you about something that she should have known would be fundamentally important to you. Lying to get you to date her is manipulative.

I think if I were in your shoes, I would break up with her. First of all, to lie that way means she doesn't even have the maturity level of a normal 17 year-old. For another, a lot of men would be creeped out by this even in places where it is perfectly legal. Either one could be a deal-breaker.
Break it off and document everything about her lying!
man, i get why you’re feeling torn and uneasy—finding out someone lied about something as big as their age can really shake things up. even though it’s technically legal where you live, it’s still a big deal because that gap in maturity can start to feel significant, especially now that you know she’s 17. it’s understandable to feel conflicted because you clearly care about her, but at the same time, this lie puts you in a difficult spot.

if you’re uncomfortable continuing, trust that instinct. relationships thrive on trust and honesty, and starting with a big lie like this can make it hard to rebuild that foundation. you’re not a creep for feeling mixed emotions here; you were honest about who you are, and she wasn’t. 

whether you decide to talk this out with her or take a step back, it’s okay to prioritize your comfort and peace of mind here. moving forward, staying true to what feels right for you is what matters.
Bang a couple more times and then move on. You're too young to worry about this sort of crap. Serious relationships are for old people.
you've only been dating 2 months you cannot love this girl you lust after her thats not real love you can't develop a real connection that fast 2 she manipulated you into thinking she was older do yourself a favor and leave her
In this life you will find that love and happiness are really hard to find. 

When you think that you have something that could be special, give it a chance.  

Talk with her.  Ask for her feelings and thoughts.  Truly listen to what she has to say. 

If you cannot get over her behaviour, then that is what is.  Love is fragile at the start and can be killed easily.  That doesn’t mean that it didn’t or doesn’t have the ability to grow into something special.   I’d suggest though that she’s been frightened of your response and that is the cause of the lie.  I don’t think that you should be so quick to judge and I think that conversation is the best way forward.  It’s really tough, but if you can both talk openly, you may have found someone that will stand by you through thick and thin.
She is a Potential trouble maker. Dont do anything all of a sudden, gradually cut her off
The exact thing happened to me but I was 19 she said she was 20 and I only found out she was 17 the day before her 18th birthday. Worked out fine tho, still together a year later
Remember that at that age girls are generally much more mature than boys of a similar age. I suspect it was just a little white lie that got out of control but I don’t see it as a deal breaker. In reality in several years time you’ll be chasing younger woman anyway as most men tend to do. Seriously though if you like this girl then don’t worry
I think the best thing to do is break up with her. Especially if you’re uncomfortable with dating a 17 year old. It would be a bit awkward to explain to others when you’re both older and have been together for a few years. As others said, she shouldn’t lie to you.
It's legit a 3 year age difference it isn't a big deal
Ugh  wauw, freaking hate them bitches who bring others in problems like that. 

I think is really fckt up that she lied to you in the first place, please don't take that to lightly. If she allready lied about her freaking age, what will be next? Take care of yourself. i'm sorry she put you in a possition like that.
Straight to prison you go young man. 🔒👨‍⚖️
Oh boy. I honestly disagree with a lot of these comments, but I will explain. Forget the age thing. It's not illegal, you're not a perv for subconsciously liking a 17 yr old, and there's literally NOTHING wrong with a 3 year age gap (despite what Gen Z loovvess to push). In my area at least, 17 and 20 is completely appropriate. However, the lying is the part you should be concerned about. I did a similar thing to my partner about 10 yrs ago (he was 14 and I was 11 but said I was 13). We had a very surface, middle school relationship. But as the years went on, I went to a different school, we saw different people, blah blah blah. We found each other again when I was almost 18 and he was almost 20. It's now been 5 years and we've worked through every problem that we thought would be our downfall. I guess my point is, if you're so hurt that you have to ask other people if It's okay to stay, maybe you already know the answer. You either already made up your mind and will love her despite her mistake, or this really pushed you over the edge and and you need the right comment to be your motivation. Do what will make you happy. Not what Reddit warriors think is right.
Honestly the age difference really isn't a big deal, but of you feel dome way bout it then that's that.
i feel that the main issue here is here dishonesty.
It's legal and it's only 3 years difference, women mature quicker than men so chances are you two aren't that far apart in maturity levels.

You're already two months in and you like each other, the age difference wouldn't be my concern rather that they lied. At the same time she's young, mistakes happen, she was probably afraid of missing out on an opportunity with you if she was honest.
If you f#cked her, id be more worried about her parents finding out and pressing charges. The sex offender list will follow you the rest of your life
Serious lie. That could had landed you in jail 🚔
Honestly besides the age gap (which imo is wrong since she is still 17. Sure in the long run it isn’t that big but when you’re under 20 I feel like smaller age gaps matter more since you are a developing teenager), if she’s lied about BASIC facts about herself it’s a terrible foundation for a relationship and just shows her immaturity.
I was going through therapy at a stage and had a massive disagreement with my therapist. 

I was disgusted at how women lie about their interests, hobbies, and other things to get with s man they're interested in. 

Apparently, it's quite normal that this happens, and over the many years after, I've learned this is actually a thing. 

What you've got to decide is how important that truth is to you. 3 years is serially not a lot in consideration. 

She sounds like she is into you and did what she could do to make it happen.  She finds you attractive enough to risk losing just to be with you right now.  That says something. 

Personally,  it sounds like you two have a good thing going, and if life teaches you anything, it's not to let the good things pass you by.
Ask her why, I’m sure it’s something dumb.

That age gap is fine.
I wouldn't fret about this too much. You said it's legally cool where you live, so you just have a girl who lied because she liked you. That's not so bad.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) Fuck hypermentalized ppl
Hate to break it to you... but at 20, you as well are still just a kid. The difference in life experience between 17 and 20 is a bit oversized as she hasn't really experienced the post-secondary world yet, but frankly, she's not that far behind you. Your brains don't stop developing until your 25, and for a lot of people, it's during that mid to late 20s period that you really discover who you are as a person. 

Go easy on yourself... it's not a big deal that she's 17. It is however a pretty big problem that she lied to you, and that's what you're going to need to work through one way or another.
That's a normal age gab you are not that old compared to her please 😂 she probably lied to make sure you accept dating her I don't see the big deal people are making in the comments. Ask for her ID to confirm and relief
I hooked up with a girl from work on my 21st birthday when she was 17.

Now we’re in our 30s, married with two kids, a dog, and we just bought our dream house.
Sometimes people lie to get their foot in the door. Just about every guy below 6" adds some extra inches in their online dating profile. 

Sometimes people lie to avoid inconvenient truths. Do you really believe you're better in bed than all your wife's/GF's ex-partners just because she told you so? It's possible, but statistically most couples cannot have that luxury. 

But yeah, people who lie arbitrarily, should be avoided.
Make sure she’s actually 17 lol. When people lie they usually tell another lie 👍🏼
OP, this sounds harsh but given the gravity of the lie in your case (huge), and your age…id say its the right thing to end the relationship…for yourself. You deserve not to be 1. put at risk and 2. manipulated and made to feel unsafe by the person you date. She's already lied about such a large issue…i know it sounds like you're giving up a lot and im sorry this will come off as flip but…

YOU'RE 20! YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF YOU! PLEASE DO NOT SETTLE FOR SOMEONE WHO DOES THIS, SO EARLY IN YOUR LIFE
In two years it won’t matter and you are only three years apart. Both of you are still young and growing. Lastly, life’s too short if you really like her don’t waste time on worrying about what time will take care of. If it’s really that much of a deal breaker, I would have concerns for you finding anyone. 

I’m someone who likes my men older and my women younger. I mean by ten years, will go twenty. I’m currently at an age where that’s not an issue and I’m too old to fuss about small things like that.
Going to jail
Dude, wtf, chill out. So what if she's 17? You're only 20. Girls mature faster than boys, so you're probably perfect for each other anyhow.
im actually dating someone younger than me while he lied about being 17 lol, it ends up being well. if you love them for who they are i guess age doesn't matter IF YOU CAN CONSENT!!
Personally, I genuinely don't know what the problem with the age gap is. A 20 year old dating a 17 year old is fine, it's not lime she's 13. I've known happily married couples with bigger age gaps.who also started dating around that age. The *real* problem is that she lied about her age to begin with. That to me is what should make you not necessarily worry but like... why the lie?
Your fine. You said it yourself, it's a decent relationship. So long as you behave and respect each other it's all g. You are 20,you too are still a child
Walk away.    If it's legal, you don't have to worry about the age, only about the lying.   That can't be tolerated.    Dump her immediately
I mean, the lying is the bigger deal. 17 may be past the age of consent in your state and you're not that much older than her, so legally you're likely in the clear. Morally, as well. You also had good faith intentions, so it's not like you're a pervert.

The greater concern is she lied about something major to you from the very start and that's a huge no no. Like, for a 2 month old relationship? Deal breaker. It's also super manipulative, which is a mega red flag.

Cut your losses. There are plenty of fish in the sea. This one ain't the one.
I don’t think you were ever in legal trouble because you are only 3 years older and she is over 16.  That leaves can she be trusted to tell the truth going forward?  None of us can guess that better than you being there.  🤷‍♀️  she now has 1 🚩  what you decide to do about that is in your heart.
Dude you make it sound like she is a girl and you are a grown up man - you are 20, you're just as immature and subject to idiocy as she is, it's not like there is much age gap. I wouldn't give it a second thought. If you have a connection just enjoy it.
Even if the age wasn't an issue- it absolutely is, but if it weren't- the lying would be a dealbreaker too.
Chill bro
Too be fair bro, you should have known because of circumstances. She would have been in college and recently left school. Your a 20 year old man. There much have been signs, didn’t you meet her family or friends. This sounds like a cope
No need to worry, it’s legal and it’s only 3 years. Plus she lied so there’s that.
When I was 18, I met a girl who was 15. We ended up having 2 kids together. I felt really conscious about the age difference. It nearly split us up. The law here is 16. Yet I still felt like a criminal. In the end though, no victim, no crime. With this age difference it's next to irrelevant.
She’s 17 and you are 20. Just slow things down for a minute and take a breath. First, it’s legal, and you are fine. Second, you are both kids and need give each other some understanding.

I’ve been with my wife a long, long time. Leaving my then girlfriend because she lied to me when we were young would have denied me the best wife I could have ever hoped for.

Like I did, you need to have a conversation stressing the importance of honesty and forgiveness, because lord knows you’ll fuck up one day and need her forgiveness for something stupid too.

Treat her like you’d like to be treated and remind her when she doesn’t live up to that standard.
I wrote a whole thing about how to break up with her without going to jail and then I reread your post and saw you have no legal issues so I’m rewriting my opinion. 

It’s messed up she lied to you about something big like her age. That being said, it’s not illegal to be with her and there’s really not a mental difference between 17 and 20. My wife and I are 2 and a half years age difference and we have no issues. The biggest concern is the lie, do you think it’s something you would be able to move on from? That will answer your question as to what to do next.
Just enjoy it. 17?? Absolutely smash that.
Yeah no you need to let her go. Lying already at this age and trying to manipulate you? That ain't gonna go well in long term
The "half your age plus seven" rule is a general guideline for determining if someone is too young to date.


>I do not face any legal issues as the age of consent in my country is 16. The issue is that I have to bring up the age of consent to begin with..

After you are both adults won't mater till time of retirement. Do you keep working till she can retire.
As a 17 y. o. girl myself I'm not sure about the age problem, since everyone has different takes on it.

But the definite problem for me here is that she lied to you, knowing that you wouldn't make the same choice if you knew the truth. She deceived you, and because of that you made a decision you're now not comfortable with. That is immediately YIKES.

Maybe she will grow out of lying like this, maybe not. But she made you wildly uncomfortable and it's not ok.

I wish you all the best.
A 3 year gap is okay, there's nothing wrong with it
I would stay with her
You're under the Romeo and Juliet clause I think. Just be cool. Take things easy. Chill. Hang out. You'll be old farts both soon.
On old times this was usual. It’s always a good thing to have an age gap anyway. Just go for it
If the age still makes the relationship legal, then my worry would be the lying. If she’s gonna lie right from the off about something like her age, then she’s gonna lie about other stuff as well
I would be pissed that she lied, not that she’s 17. I mean you said I was a kid at 17, now you’re 20. Thats just 3 years different, girls are way ahead of boys. I’m 24 (f) i’m still a kid tho. 

I don’t know if i would still have this relationship when it’s based on a lie. There are more fish in the sea that don’t lie.
Non negotiable as the relationship is built on a lie. The foundation is gone. Whether you wish to rebuild it anew and set new boundaries, or end it, is upto you.
Break up with her before you get arrested buddy. It ain't worth it.
“when I was that age I was just a kid”- it’s not a rule but women are often more mature in younger age than men. For example my boyfriend (at the time he was 20/21) had before me 3 years younger gf or even 4 (i cant remember).. but they got along. And if it is okay in your country and you got along really well I don’t think that is a problem. But I understand your concerns. And 3 years are not that big age gap.. 30 yrs would be.. And you said she has work so I really think she is not immature.


but as someone wrote in comments, mby I would be more concerned because of lying. But on the other hand I understand her in some way.. I think she liked you and she was scared that you wouldn’t try it out with her if she is that young (which is true, from what you wrote..) so she lied and told to herself she’ll tell you after some time. 

sometimes you must listen to your heart and sometimes to your head. It’s up to you what you’ll choose. either way good luck!
It’s understandable to feel shattered after learning about her real age. Even if it’s legal, it’s important to consider the maturity dynamics in the relationship.

Having an open conversation about how you feel might help, but it’s also okay if you decide it’s best to step back. Prioritize your feelings and boundaries your happiness matters too
1. She lied to you about a thing this important that's a crimson flag

2. If you don't care, just don't have sex for a year. Grooming is much harder to prove
Yeah don’t put up with that ki
RUN DUDE RUN❗️❗️❗️ If she lied about something like that, she's not trustworthy at all!! If you continue your relationship with her. And if it ends on bad terms, she might turn around and tell people you were 20, and she was 17 when you guys started dating and ruined your reputation and made it out like you're a creep !!!!!!!! THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE THAN HER FEELINGS F@CK HER, but idk her, tho so who's knows
Mate, in 10 years time this will not be an issue.  Put your heart first, carry on and love.

This is Reddit, they will tell you to roast her on the stake, put her away in prison for life etc.... it really doesn't matter if you love.
Ok here are a view points on this topic. 

Yes 17 is not at all fully developed mental wise but neither is 20 (you are also still a kid, thus coming from a 33 y/o) 
The main issue with age gaps in that age range is that the older can easily manipulate, groom and take advantage of the younger person.
From what you posted this seems not to be the case at all from your side. 


So overall this is not that significant a difference, neither absolute nore percentage wise. 

The bigger issue is that she lied about it, ruining/damaging the trust in the relationship
3 years is not much, even at a young age like 20. So you should not feel ashamed, you were deceived anyway.
The lying is a bigger issue.
DUMP HER
The age difference is fine but the lying is a big problem.
I agree with everyone's advice here 
Once a liar, always a liar. 
They always have a reason, a justification. 

I can never lie for myself, I crack up laughing. 
I can lie to protect others however, little "white lies" because makes it easier for that person who would be close to me. 
Does anyone know why they are called "little white lies"
17 / 20 isn’t an issue at all, lying about her age is though.
The age gap is nothing it's 3 years. When you're 43 and she's 40.np one is gonna say a thing. The lying is an issue, and the lying about her age *would* be an issue if she was under the age of consent. All you have to do now is decide if you like her enough to forgive her and then just get on with your lives. When I was 17 I was going out with a guy who was 21 and we were together for almost 5 years. No one batted an eyelid about the age, they just didn't like the fact he was an absolute bellend.

Don't worry about it, jsut figure out the trust side of things and if you believe she's genuinely sorry and didn't mean to deceive you in a malicious way then just put it down to a lapse in judgement and move on. If it's a good relationship otherwise then it'd be a shame to throw it away =)
When I was a teenager, many of the girls my age dated older guys. The lying is poor judgement though. You've not done anything wrong. If you work well together, see how it goes.
It sounds like you know how you feel about her & in reality, there are three years between; it isn't like it's 20 years.

It sounds like you should have a conversation about honesty, understand why she lied (I assume it was her wanting to avert these feelings) & see if you can find a way forward.

I appreciate it's a shocking revelation but if you love & respect each other, age is a number & you guys can fund a way through.

Good luck.
Do you still want to be with her and you're uncomfortable with the age gap and her lying? Talk to her about it, ask her for some proof that she is actually 17. 

2 months to hold on to this lie isn't a long time and it seems like it was very obvious something was wrong when you tried to talk to her about her birthday. 

Because it doesn't seem like she's actually comfortable lying and because she's turning 18 in January, I would try to repair this. It seems like the other parts of your relationship are probably genuine and let's be really honest, your relationship, like many at your ages, probably won't last anyway.
Hey Diddy. This won’t hold up in court.
Yo I’m just saying if she can lie about her age which is a really big thing because it’s a fundamental fact about herself that she’s withheld, would she be the type to trap you with a child in the future? She sounds dangerous in her actions, I am a woman and I say you need to put an end to this
This is not that big of a deal she lied so what sh*t happens
Ghost her after you have evidence of her admitting she lied about her age. Do not trust her and whatever she says.
Your story reminds me of an old friend. She met a guy at a concert, he was 25 or 26 and she said she was 19, but she was really 16. He didn’t know it for 2 years. She said she was living at home and going to college but really she was still in high school. She was my coworker when we were in our early 30s and she had been with him for about 15 years and they were married. Sad ending to the story, she died from cancer at 38. But he was her one true  love and they had a very happy life and marriage, despite her big, huge 2-year lie. She was such a character, I miss her.
While it’s not a good thing she lied about her age it’s more common than not and if it was on introduction it could have just been nerves and then too nervous to actually say look I’m actually 17.   I was 21 and met a “19” year old woman. We hit it off I asked once how old she was and didn’t think of it again until it creeped up to her birthday and she come out and said “I know it might be a shock but it’s my 18th” 

It was the one and only lie that she was caught out on which leads me to believe she just never lied about anything of importance if at all. 

If everything else about the relationship in your eyes is perfect it would be worth forgiving if you could see yourself being able to look past it. Have a convo about trust and for her confess to any other lies she may have told and say if you catch her in another lie you’ll be done
It’s a normal age gap. The real concern is that she lied to begin with.
Bro there is no discernable difference between 20 and 17, and people caring about this age gap are cringe.

That aside, it is a problem that she lied, and that should be the focus.
The lie says she's immature and/or manipulative. I'd move on either way. You need someone nearer your own age to grow with. At your age, that kind of age gap is not good and trust has been broken. I personally cannot imagine lying about my age at any point in my life (my first proper boyfriend was much older than me and I was just over the age of consent and at no point did I feel the need to lie). Huge red flag.
I don't see any problem here. Unless the problem is lying...
It doesn't realy matter. In 5 years you are 25 and she is 22.
My gf is 23 and i'm 28. We are together now for 3 Years and I  love her more than ever.
It's not a bad lie. You wouldn't get her a Chance. So be lucky she lied for you. 
But make sure you can trust her in the real questions.
Who hasn’t had someone tell an untruth where age is concerned. I never believe anyone’s age on apps like Tinder. 
The OP is a sweet decent person and you are right to be concerned, it shows how you are as a person.
If you connect how you suggest then have a chat, crack on and enjoy yourself, if you can’t be good be careful as they say
I don't see a huge problem in the age difference. Where I live this would even be legal.
The bigger problem is her lying about her age, but then again your hysteric reaction here totally explains why she would have lied.   
I generally would say: If you love this girl, then chill. But you two need to have a serious talk about honesty going forward.
She lied because she wanted you. And the age gap is perfectly fine. Keep her and enjoy the love.
I don't think that age difference or her actual age are a huge issue.  It's not good that she lied about it but that may be mostly due to her immaturity.

If you both feel good about the relationship and can resolve the honesty issue, maybe it's worth continuing.
To play devils advocate to all the people saying she lied already she is bad. Though I agree relationships need to be based on trust let us just offer some empathy

Love is very powerful, and judging by this post her assumption that he wouldn't date her otherwise was correct. So she did anything she could to realise her love. It might not be right, but it is at least understandable.

Second she is 17. We online all have years of experience that help rationalise things and say. Relationships can't be built on lies, that's a red flag etc. But she hasn't, she can't be expected to act like a responsible adult because she isn't one. Also she did come clean after 2 months which is in the grand scheme of things not too long. 

Basically what I'm saying is although what she did is clearly very wrong, I think she is due making some mistakes in her life and the question should simply be: OP do you love her and can you reconcile going out with a girl who is 17. By that I mean openly and happily, if you can't end it. If not maybe give her the benefit of the doubt love makes us all do crazy things.
Dude, I’d leave her if I was you but it’s your damn decision and it wouldn’t be entirely wrong if you stayed. I think this is a super complex situation and there’s many different possible paths you can take from here.
I hate how these frikin losers on Reddit phrase their sentences as if they know the objective moral truth and have authority over your life.
Age of consent = ok
Age gap = ok

She lied, not you.
She lied to be with you.

No problem at all, keep your good relationship and be happy!
Break up with her right away. She is way better off without you. You deserve to be alone.
The age isn’t really a problem. The lying is.
Dude in 20 or so years you can still date a 17 year old girl.  Stop worrying about it if you’re both being a happy couple, three years is a car lease.  Stop trying to be unhappy
If the relationship is worth it and she’s realising she messed up, you might be able to reboot it on a sounder basis. Needn’t be a dealbreaker.
17 to 20 is fuck all. The lie is the problem.
You like her. She likes you. It's legal. Stop being so melodramatic.
lying isn't a good look but honestly i'd look at her motives here. if she lied because she was afraid you wouldn't be interested otherwise, it can be called selfish and childish and manipulative, sure - but at the same time, you did end up liking her, so there obviously was a certain "bias" she wanted to overcome and give herself a chance. she made a lie about something she can't change in herself but her age isn't in itself harmful or hurtful. it's different than lying about your relationship status for example. it can be irritating to be dismissed because of your age, so i kinda have to admit i feel for her.

3 years is not that much especially if she's going to be 18 in a few months.
Rough one, I don't think the age is the problem here. The problem is that she manipulated you because she thought you wouldn't date her if she told the truth, which shows a clear willingness to lie if she thinks it'll benefit her. 

To be completely honest, the choice is yours. 
Do you want to leave her over this? Which if you do, would be completely fair. 
Or do you still want to give the relationship a chance? If you do, you have to make it extremely clear that the next time she lies about something like this, the relationship will be over. 
Up to you brother. Go with your gut.
Good luck.

Also, make sure you check her ID. Just to be sure.
The age gap is really not a problem and will only get smaller as you age. Need to talk about lying though.
Leave her now before you prolong it. The longer your wait the harder it will be
I would try and take it easy on her, she made a mistake and got stuck in it. My first girlfriend did this. But she was a year younger than she said. She didn't have a stable life before me and moved into my parents home for a bit. 

As she had all her possessions, that included her baby photo album. I asked to look through it and she panicked and ran away. Came back 10 minutes later to let me see, and all the dates, written in blue ink, had been crossed out and rewritten a tear later, in black ink.

Personally it was weird, but didn't bother me much. I think, being AuDHD it transpired, I didn't know HOW to let it bother me..? Sounds like you have a lot more self esteem / self worth though.

If you like her, let it go. She likes you and w months isn't that long to have kept a lie, white, grey or otherwise.
I wonder why she would lie and say she was 17 when legal consent is 16. Who knows how old she really is?
Lies cannot be fixed. The issue isnt her age, the issue is the lie.
It happened to me. I was 18 and she was 15.
Only found out when I went to her 18th birthday party which had 16 balloons everywhere.
Mate all she has to do to have you arrested and permanently placed on the sex offenders register is send you a single photograph, even if you never wanted or consented to receiving that photo they WILL be able to convict you of being in possession of child pornography, just fucking run out of whatever shit show you've gotten yourself into a hope to fuck that the person who LIED TO GET WITH YOU isn't vindictive in any way.

Just because she's old enough to consent doesn't mean she can't get you arrested for commiting sexual crimes against a child, just keep that in mind.
According to some, the age gap calculation would say this:  (Your Age/2) + 7 = 17. 

The problem is the lying. Relationships are built on trust. She started out with a lie which means the foundation of the relationship will crumble.
Man’s got Josh giddy’d

Edit nvm you’re and idiot , thinking about looking this down, tbh it’s not so much the legal issues but the social issues that will come from this will be enormous and what happens when/if she gets mad at you and throws some shit out that pll will for sure believe

All I’m saying is seen people do worse for less outta spite
I really can’t argue with that. It’s a massive break in my trust. She said she knew I wouldn’t have dated her otherwise so she lied to me which seems really manipulative.
Thank you for saying that. It really means a lot this feels terrible.
OP, listen to this! You did nothing wrong, she is the one who lied to you.
She's 17, and that's legally not underage where the guy lives, much like most of the world. ..

The lying is the issue
Thank you for your comment. I agree with everything you’ve said. I do have some proof of her saying that but I doubt she’d do anything to get back at me. She’s not a bad person, she just did something very very silly by doing this… I’ll still be safe and save it though.
This. Maybe she’s 16 and admitting to the minimum legal age to hide that, already lied once
Yep, if she declines absolutely GTFO.
She turns 18 in January. The way I found out was that we were talking about her birthday. I told her she’s going to be turning into an old lady soon when she turns 20 and she had a weird reaction so I kept asking her until she came clean. 

And I don’t know if I should try to get past this. I really still have feelings for her but if she’s willing to do this to me then it doesn’t look good for the future.
Yeah, I see nothing wrong with 17 and 20, especially when the older one wasn’t specifically targeting high school girls. The lying though is an issue.
I can't tell if people became really uptight about these things in the past few years or if it's just reddit.

Finally a reasonable voice

Maybe she hasn't had good luck with guys her age and was looking for someone a little more mature. In relative terms obvs.

In that regard, especially if she genuinely likes OP a lot, it can be potentially considered something of a white lie. The question is, has she lied about anything else? 

There needs to be a serious conversation about trust.

Ethically, by "the Golden Rule" you are fine:  half your age and add 7 for lowest appropriate age of a prospective partner.

I am not repeat not saying that this is an ideal situation in terms of the lie, but everyone rushing to condemn the girl automatically are being exceptionally severe. This kind of thing happens all the time at this age, and if there are no legal issues then OP should just be honest (and be careful).
>Don't ignore your feelings though, do that too much and you'll be a sad man.

Word
This is the most down to earth comment and easy-going approach, everyone else is making such a big deal on the subject of “broken trust”, while we are talking about just an insecure 17 yo who doesn’t know any better.
Totally agree with this. We were all idiots when we were dating at that age. If it’s a good relationship then it’s seems like something worth working through. Besides I can almost guarantee that it’s not gonna be a forever relationship. They often feel like it but rarely are at that age. So enjoy the experience and growth together while you can. Seems like a silly thing to toss the whole relationship out for.
We met three months ago and have been going out for two. And I really can’t argue with that sadly.
Not for retarded americans
Hahaha maybe but definitely less than I was before
OP definitely isn't fully grown but he's no kid
I said the exact same thing when we were having a conversation about this. A 17 and 20 year old case is a whole different story. It’s literally point in case. as you’ve said this is something a 17 year old would do. I did dumb things too at that age.
it clearly goes against his morals it’s kinda easier said than done for someone to just “carry on” with something like that
Reading your comments, the fact she knew you wouldn't date her if you knew her age is less negative (compared to lying for other reasons, not overall good of course. Still a problem).

But I'll reiterate, as a high school teacher, girls are nearly always more mature. Biologically there's truth in, but societally as well, we teach girls (force girls?) to become more mature. There are different types of maturity do it's not an all or nothing thing, but the chances you're as mature as she is, is very high. I will say it depends some on your birthday too. You said she turns 18 in January, when is your birthday? If you just turned 20 then definitely no problem. If you're going to turn 21 before she turns 18, that's getting a little further. Either way I probably would see where this goes. The chances a relationship goes the distance at this age is low anyway. And so is there that much harm in letting it go a little longer? And if it does go the distance to would you really want to end it over an age difference that really isn't a problem, or her wanting to date you so much that she lied so you would ignore the age difference?

People here are overharsh. I would give it a chance
I think you should try and have an honest conversation with her. Tell her how hurt you feel by what she did and see how she responds. 
Only reasonable response I've read. Never get advice from Reddit.
I’ve never lied about my age.
I think OP is using “date” as a euphemism for “have sex with” in terms of what is legal.
In that case it would not matter. And yes she lied because she said she knew I wouldn’t have dated her otherwise. 17 and 20 feels like there’s such a big gap in maturity (not that I’m a very mature person myself or anything but definitely more than what I was at that age)
She said something that wasn't true so you would act in a way you wouldn't have if you knew the truth. It *is* manipulative.
Protect yourself from false allegations and back up data/evidence because kids can be stupid and lash out when hurt.
If she could lie to you about something as important as age, imagine what else she can lie about.
Sounds like a girl who wouldn’t tell you about other things because it’s gonna “hurt your feelings”
A break in trust that you will never, ever be able to fix. 

Delete her number and move on.

Also, the number of relationships that one has had shows ZERO INFORMATION on how good/bad they are at dating.
Tbh 17-20 is not that much of an age gap. Lying definitely is an issue tho.
It is manipulative and she started the relationship on a huge lie. That's not okay and would set a very negative precedent for the rest of the relationship.
If you decide to break up based on your feelings, use that as the reason rather than her age. This way, she can learn that it’s not okay to hide things, like her age. Even if it’s not true, expressing it vaguely allows her to interpret it in her own way. You might say something like, “I’m breaking up with you because you broke my trust and lied to me. A relationship built on lies is not okay, and I’m not sure if I can trust you at all after this.”
My roommate in college had a major baby face. He was 22 years old and finishing up his degree. He was extremely smart and spoke a couple of languages. This guy was a double major. He met an extremely smart girl who we also thought looked young but so did he so they both just looked like teenagers. give date for a while and he asks her father permission to marry her when they go to visit. he says yes. He proposes a couple weeks later. Instead of saying yes she says that she is actually 17 and can't get married yet. He loses his mind. The whole family was in on it and knew she lied about her age. 

She skipped a couple of grades so we were all shocked that she was that young and going to school with us. She was over at our apartment all the time and she lived on campus in the dorms. He took some time and realized that he was more upset about the lie than anything else. They had been on several dates by the time he asked how old she was. she knew he was the one and didn't want to scare him off by telling him her real age. He waited until she was 18 and they got married right after her birthday. The state would have allowed them to get married sooner, he just needed to get both parents to be present and sign off on it. While her parents were 100% on board, he was not ok with that. They got married and have 5 kids. They have been married for almost 20 years. He told me he is glad they waited and he is glad he didn't turn and run. He did have to get over the dishonesty but he knows why she did it and he is glad that she did because he wouldn't have continued that relationship if he had found out early on.
That would make me wonder if there's anything else she has lied or will lie about in the future due to the exact same logic. e.g. in future if she lies to you or hides something because she was scared you would dump her if you found out.

If it were me, trust would be gone and I would feel very deceived. Trust being my most important thing, it would turn me off her/the relationship completely.
yeah, bud, the age difference is not such a big deal and you could be patient and wait another year.  But her lying and manipulating you is a big red flag. sure she may have had innocent intentions this time.  but she has proven to you how successfully she can deceive you.  The foundation of any meaningful relationship is trust.  You can do better.
Not saying it is true or not, nor that it's necessarily an excuse, but another way to look at this is that she really, really likes you and wanted to date you. 

As someone else said, the age difference itself isn't a big thing because it's only 3 years, though I get that at 17 & and 20, that's a good % of your respective lifetimes. In the scheme of things, though, it's pretty close to nothing of consequence.

Talk to her.

Minor edit for sense.
Do not listen to this person the lying is also an issue, but if her parents decided they wanted to do something about it, they legally could, and you would be in big trouble. Either way dump this girl.
I know you're probably feeling tons of negative emotions but truly the only logical thing to do imo is to move on and focus on healing. And, again, this was not your fault. You trusted her.
I’m sorry you’re going through this. The only silver lining is that you found out so soon. You can break it off and move forward no harm no foul. You’ll get through this OP
Look, she's put you in a tough position. You can be honest and tell her that - "I feel betrayed about you being only 17. I'm young, but you're still younger"

If you really enjoy her company, stop all the sexual stuff, and be 'friends' for a while. If it survives this, for a year so, re-evaluate.

2 years isn't much when you're 30, not anything when you're 40.

But 20? 2 years is a LOT. (yes I know it's 3 but I'm assuming rounding).
One of my friends thought the same thing and after they broke up his ex became very vindictive.

But its always better to be safe than sorry
You never know how someone will act once you break things off with them. Make sure you back up everything that shows you did nothing wrong with her.

She's already shown you she has no problem with lying to get what she wants.
Unfortunately I must agree with the original commenter, people don’t need to be inherently bad but some still do crazy stuff under a lot of emotion, especially after being rejected and with not much dating experience. Even I did some stupid stuff when I was this age—I’d never try to ruin someone’s life or anything but definitely had stupid ideas or said hurtful things even though I was otherwise very shy and sweet. It’s been only two months, you don’t really know her.
16 is the minimum legal age in most places lol it’s just weird, which is the whole point of this post. My grandparents were 17 and 32 when they got together. Weird af but they were together until my grandpa died in his late 60’s of cancer. For context though, my grandma is a literal genius (it’s a genetic thing) and nobody ever questioned her decision making. No need for lies when you’re a mature adult. She’s old enough to get tattoos in most places, she can make permanent decisions including being honest towards older men that she’s younger.
OP if you're going to try to get past this I would ask for ID to verify she's actually 17 tbh....
Genuine question, is she in high school? Did she act like she was a 19 year old in high school or what?
Dude the relationship isn’t built on lies. She lied about her age but your relationship isn’t built on that. It’s built on your experiences together. I really don’t think this is as big of a deal as others are making it out to be. Is a 33 year old with a 30 year old weird? Not even close. She’s 18 in like 2 months. I think it seems silly to overthink this if you guys have a good relationship otherwise.
She is 17, you are 20. 2 very young people. We all have been there, we all did some stupid things and lying is one of the lightest ones.


Nobody should be crucified on their first mistake, especially that young.


I say, talk to her, learn why she lied. See If she is remorseful in anyway. No? Then yeah, move on.
OP isn’t American. But I get you. It always surprised me how high the U.S. sets the bar.
20 year olds are also prone to doing dumb things. Like considering staying in this type of situation. I stayed with someone who had proven to be manipulative at your age too, it's the only regret of my life. 

Anyway you did nothing wrong morally and luckily not legally. Things could have been worse. Hope the next relationship is great. You're still super young don't sweat it.
I've never done drugs.
Including having any sexual interaction with. Even kissing or potentially holding hands if done in a romantic sense can be theoretically illegal.
This. She put you in legal danger by lying. Sweet people don't do that.
Exactly my thought, people who lie about age and end up abandoned because of that, can retaliate with lies and slander.
[removed]
As in; If he breaks up with her, wish her well, hope for the best and prepare for the worst. GL OP.
She's 17.  I wouldn't judge her as a person for lying about her age.  It's not pathologic, she's fucking 17 and that's pretty normal.
In the US that is a huge problem. 17 is a minor. Had their relationship involved photos or more he could be a potential sex offender. Run my guy...run.
I suppose that's part of the question how did the age thing come up i could see a scenario where they had been dating for a while and perhaps the OP saying somthing like I could never date some one who was X years younger than me and so the girl in a moment of panic lied about her age and then got stuck in the lie.   Still not great for the relationship though then it's down to how long between the lie and the truth.
If she is above the age of consent, what could they do? (Legally, I mean, as opposed to frontier justice.)
She's 17, that's above the age of consent. Her parents can bump their gums as much as they want.

I'd be worried bout the lies personally
She told me she was 19 in person and over text. And she has graduated Highschool same as myself at that age. Currently she’s working
Huh?????? If the foundation of the relationship was built on a lie that's a pretty big fucking "mistake".
It's easy to know why she lied to him. She obviously fancied him and was worried if she told him her real age, he wouldn't have been interested.
Omg a measured approach, hell hath frozen over 
what legal danger. age of consent in OPs jurisdiction is 16.

if anyone is in legal danger it's the GF. obtaining sex through lies is illegal in most jurisdictions, and she admitted she lied because she knew he wouldn't have gone out with her.
Op states multiple times that’s it’s legal, I beg Reddit actually read posts before commenting
First of all age of consent isn't always 18. Second of all being in a romantic relationship isn't technically illegal. Third of all many countries allow a certain age gap, for example in Canada as long as the two people's age gap is within 5 years it's fine.
Unless she claims that they shared photos between eachothother, it's still classed (and prosecuted as) child pornography if she's under the age of 18, even if op doesn't want/ consent to receive those images she'd still be able to get him charged with possession VERY easily.
Is she 17?  I mean she says so, but she already lied about her age once.
A minor, but still above the age of consent in most jurisdictions (usually 16). Pictures would still be problematic though.
I think it depends on where ur from!! Here in Germany, the age of consent is 14, but a adult can only date a minor with the minors parents consent. If u have sex at 20 with a 15 y/o u can get charged (I mean, as u should, thats weird as fuck) even tho theyre above the age of consent
I would be more worried if they exchanged pictures. At least in my state it doesn’t matter the age of consent, if you’re under 18 that’s possession of child porn and indecent exposure to a minor. I remember two high school seniors (17&18) got in legal trouble for it years ago when one set of parents got salty
Keep them texts. But yeah, steer clear of this. You can't lie about basic facts about yourself in a relationship...
It’s about seeing how they explain and whether they’re remorseful, not the actual answer which is obvious. 
Exactly this. Honestly kudos to OP for being so concerned about it, it show's he's actually a really good person to not want to take advantage of someone young. Luckily, he can't get into legal trouble since the age of consent is 16, but it's still such a bummer to find out that someone you truly liked lied about something so stupid (and something that could get other people his age in trouble if he was somewhere that the legal age was older than 16). She could have avoided all this by telling the truth, letting him know she very much likes him and his company, but as she's 17, she knows he may not be interested in seriously dating *at this time*. They could have just been casual friends and seen where things went as they aged, although, I know a lot of people would see that as "grooming", but I feel like a 3 year age gap may not fully qualify as grooming since they're both out in the working world already. Also, who knows when she'll be 18, yanno? If she just waited till then to actively pursue him, he probably wouldn't have been as concerned with the age gap, especially as people at the ages of 18 and 20 commonly date in college or such.

Either way, good luck OP! It's a tough situation, but if you *do* choose to stay together, at least it's not like she's five or more years younger than you. Also, it's *very* obvious you weren't actively trying to groom a minor, especially since she lied to you about her age and all, so you're not a bad guy or anything.
Has a woman ever been charged with this?
How does OP know she could be 15.
I mean...not a risk I'd be willing to take. Just my opinion though.
Age of consent if for teens sleeping together and that awkward phase where one turns 18 while the other is still 16/17, it doesn’t cover adults knowingly dating children - obviously OP didn’t know so this his situation is different
"...unable to quell mere rumours, or destroy mere photographs, I am withdrawing my candidacy."
In the post he states that it's legal where he lives
It's probably also not accurate that he can't get in trouble, all it takes is ONE photo sent by her that someone could see as sexual (even if there is nothing at all sexual about it) and then OP is on the hook for possession of CP, since explicit content cannot legally be shared of anyone under the age of 18 and since 'explicit' is incredibly subjective.
It’s just funny to me how she could be a few days away from 18 and then everyone would be like “yup! She’s ready to date now!”
Its still bad she lied about her age, remember a common thing people do in relationships is share nudes, if he'd asked her or if she'd sent any he could have been in serious legal trouble as she's under 18 and it would still qualify as cp. It's one of the reasons having age of consent under 18 is just a bad law it can lead to confusing situations like this where some things are legal and some aren't.
i believe there have been prosecutions for rape through fraud but I don't recall details. i think the rapist/fraudsters were men and the lies were more significant than an age gap.
If you mean in a legal sense, this a misconception. In most states, it is 16, or, 16 unless the older is in a position of authority.
Not where I live. Age of consent is age of consent. When I was 16 my ‘boyfriend’ was 32. Yes, he absolutely groomed me but there was nothing anyone close to me could legally do as he wasn’t breaking the law 🤷‍♀️
Call me weird but i think we should give a class on what explicit means to a jury, or the american people. Everyone seems to need flashcards nowadays. Mfs can't describe the difference of communism and fascism, once you ask its immediately a trump this or kamala that.
My wife said something that terrifies me. 
My wife said something that terrifies me.

For backstory and context, when my wife and I first got together, she admitted she had no desire to have children due to 2 previous miscarriages in her last marriage. 4 years and a wedding later she came to me with the desire to be a mom. A few months later and she was pregnant. He was a happy healthy boy and everything seemed great at first. I slotted right into being a dad and he's my little ray of sunshine. 

My wife developed terrible PPD exacerbated by pumping anxiety. During a few arguments caused by her being overstimulated, she's admitted to me that she feels no emotional attachment to him and that he's just a child living in our home. She's been going to therapy and things seemed like they were getting better. Don't get me wrong, she's an amazing mother, always makes sure he's well cared for and has everything he needs or wants. But it's obvious she doesn't feel connected to him. Today, after a few particularly stressful days where he's been very needy and crying constantly (due to teething) she texted me while I was at work. It read "He's pushing me to the edge. This morning I just wanted to put him in a hot car and walk away. I'm ripping my hair out and I'm in the middle of a mental breakdown, I just can't do the crying anymore." I immediately made sure he was safe with my mom and arranged for her to watch him overnight. I talked with her more and it seems like this is just an out of the blue manic episode. I'm just terrified of what happens if she has another and she acts on those feelings. I don't know what to do here and it's killing me inside. 
This is way above reddit's paygrade and needs expert advice. The two of you need to have an emergency appointment with her therapist and figure out the next steps.

I totally understand feeling overwhelmed here, but you do not want to put your trust in some random redditor who may give poor advice and agitate the issue further. Please reach out to the pros.
As someone who previously experienced post partum psychosis your wife needs medical intervention now.

I had my first child and was fine but after my second I felt I never bonded with him and started doing strange things like get up in the middle of the night to make sure the toilet lids were closed. Then one day I just had the thought to put the kids in the car and drive off a bridge. 

Once I clipped the kids in their car seats I called the urgent care clinic and they immediately went into action with physical support (social worker) and medical support (gp, meds and therapy). 

Take the baby off your wife's hands and get her into a GP asap.
She needs to see a doctor asap, is she on meds? If she is they need to look at adjusting the dose and if not she needs to consider starting them

PPD and PPP can be really scary, I hope you have a support network for yourself whilst she gets the help she needs
You CANNOT leave her alone to care for the baby right now. Take FMLA or get your Mom or someone to stay stay with the baby. This is an extremely serious emergency situation. She needs psychiatric care immediately. She is having thoughts of killing your child. 

Under no circumstances should she be left alone with the baby. If has has a psychiatrist reach out to them for emergency assistance, or take her to the ER.
For what it’s worth, I had severe PPD after my first child was born. I regularly fantasized about dying, him dying, everyone dying. It was a long hard slog. It did eventually get better but it was an all hands on deck situation. It’ll feel like you lost your wife but she’s there and you’ll find her again. I hope you find the help you both need.
She needs psychiatric help asap. I don’t think I’d leave your kid with her alone for the time being. PPD is scary.
Maybe stop rating naked women and scouting for dirty penpals on Reddit and instead support your wife with the childcare
Emergency appointment to a psych! Like NOW. I’m so sorry this is happening, PPD is scary for both parties. You got this, I promise!!
I did EMDR for trauma after my pregnancy and it was completely life changing. It is well known but not offered as often as I think it could be.
I had PPD and PPP, it’s horrendous and terrifying. I had the crisis team out and a lot of intervention with medication and therapists and I came out the otherside. It took a year for me to recover and the guilt 10 years later is still there. But I love my children so so much and can’t imagine that other version of me now. I hope this helps and you all get the help you need 🙏🏻
This is how my daughter was. She required inpatient care on a floor specifically for women suffering from PPD. She actually developed PPP - Post Partum Psychosis. It was very scary. She was on meds for at least 2 years. Call her OB to get her on meds asap.
First, you did the right thing making sure your kid was with another adult. Second, take a deep breath and try to relax for a moment. Things could have gone horribly wrong and they didn't. I would see if your mom would be okay taking her grandchild a couple days a week to give your wife a break. If not, see about hiring some extra help. Not ideal obviously but clearly your wife needs extra assistance with caring for your son right now. I would encourage your wife to share this development with her therapist. Even if it's just an "oppsie" of sorts, I would want this to be addressed to make sure it's not more than that. Recovery isn't linear so it might just be a short step backwards, but don't take that chance. It also might be a good idea to ask your wife how she felt moments before her breaking point. Was there a lead up for her? Could she feel it coming or was it truly just completely unpredictable? You've done everything right so far and this is obviously a hard situation so I commend you on your efforts. Some women need a lot more support after birth (understandably) and oftentimes in ways they didn't before. It's an adjustment for everyone involved
I'm a nurse and lactation consultant. Please feel free to privately message me anytime for proof of credentials, and any questions. I think your wife may need inpatient care. I cannot diagnose anything I'm just throwing it out there that this therapy right now isn't working. You may potentially need to take over full time care of the child until he gets a little older.
Okay. So

1. You are not the first nor will you be the last family in this position. PPD is a nightmare, and the epidemics that happen after are scary for everyone involved, but knowing you aren’t alone is step one to feeling better 

2. Recognizing that your wife isn’t a bad mom and isn’t some crazy maniac might seem like the bare minimum, but the fact of the matter is many partners would find it easy to write this off as female hysteria , and I want to appreciate you for being willing to do what it takes and recognize the situation for what it is.

3. It’s time to talk to a therapist and psychiatrist. Getting through this phase is definitely possible, but it might require some work and even maybe medication. They will be able to best help you through it.
She needs help ASAP and she doesn’t need to be alone with the baby again until she gets that help. Not for a moment. I know you trust her and you think she’d never hurt her/yalls baby, but she’s not herself at all and doesn’t have control of herself or her emotions.
Keep baby safe with your mom. Get home ASAP. Get help. And take a second to recognize that your wife was conscious enough to tell you how overwhelmed and done she was. Many women with severe PPD would’ve just put the baby in the car. This is good. She cares enough about the baby’s well being to tell you that. Even if she doesn’t love it as her own, she cared enough to do that.
I'm confused how you think this is out of the blue...? She went through one of the most life altering things a woman can do. It literally changes us in every single way. And sometimes that means between the massive upheaval of our entire being and then having to care for a kid, that we may need a lot of extra support. It's time to get your wife help. Get her to a doctor asap.
She’s trying to avoid harming your baby by communicating this to you. Please zoom out and at the very least acknowledge that- she’s not being cruel or plotting something in secrecy; she’s including you into the foreign and horrible thoughts entering her mind. This is her asking for help!
Your wife needs a break and needs additional therapy. Find someone to care for the child if you’re not there and allow her to continue increased therapy until she is ready to come back. Even then it sounds like she is going to need help with a care giver so she isn’t so overwhelmed. 
She didn’t want kids, got pregnant quickly after changing her mind. She went through pregnancy, delivered a baby and now is caring for the child most of the time alone. It’s a huge adjustment. What she said and the context screams she needs a break. Give her one and be on her healing timeline. It’s best for everyone. And most importantly, be supportive.
The baby needs to not be near her right now. She needs help. You need to contact a doctor.
Please get her professional help at once. Her OB dr should be able to refer her to a good mental health specialist! This is not something to mess around with.
It is surprisingly normal for mothers of babies to have sudden thoughts of harming their baby.  Its actually the brain establishing what they would NOT do and recognising what a baby needs protection
from - so a sort of "another person could do this so I need to be aware of that".  The important thing is that there is no way they'd actually do it.  They are a kind of 'intrusive thought'.

Also, being only human, such thoughts can occur when pushed to the limit.  That is more risky but mostly its just thoughts where in reality the parents is excellent and completely safe..

With post natal depression, however, such thoughts can be far more frequent and the person can become more confused and less inhibited so you absolutely MUST go to a physician about this.

Your wife is not a bad person.  She is suffering and things cannot carry on as they have been.  You all need expert advice and support.
Um how about you step in as full time dad for a while and let wife go off baby duty. You’re capable.
She needs to be admitted. I'm not saying this out of spite, I'm saying this as somebody who has witnessed multiple news events of moms who developed PPP (post-partum psychosis) while dealing with PPD.

For example: the woman who killed her three children then jumped out of a window to kill herself, who instead became paralyzed.

 Things like this happen when you miss key signs of mental illness. I'm not saying she is a bad mother; but when thoughts like this are occurring, it's good she's verbalizing it instead of acting upon it. This is a cry for help. Therapy might not be enough. She might need the help of medication to solve a chemical imbalance.
1.Shr needs to be on anti-depressants  yesterday. 2. She cannot be alone with your child period. Either take family leave or hire a nanny 3. Its worth actually going through the emergency room to the psych ward. That will get her properly medicated.   I cannot stress enough that she cannot, under any circumstances, be alone with the baby. Not taking medication is a non-starter for you to stay with her. She is in danger and tbere is chance your child is as well.
I don't think you should travel for business at the moment if you can stay close to home I would.
Bro is there a way to give her a break mabe u can help little bit with the kid. I am not a violent person and I had a serious moment were I pictured tossing my kid when he was 2. I got up walked away for about 10 min and was good.
Late reply is late, but my guy you should be home as of yesterday.  It's time for you to step up and be the husband you swore to be when you made those wedding vows.  Your wife texted you that she's thinking of killing the son that the two of you made and you're trying to get home. You needed to stop in the middle of what you were and work on getting home the fastest way you can. Change a flight,  rent a car, whatever you have to do. 

Forget work and all that other jazz because what good is it if you lose them. They need to be at the top of your priority list and you need to take sometime off and care for them yourself because they desperately need you right now.
She needs medical help immediately. Don’t
Look down on medical help, but also be a supportive husband for her. Times like these shes needs you. PPD is different for all woman, there are even some woman that never experience PPD. But in the end there are many mothers ending the life of their children due to PPD. 

My therapist once told me “if you can think of it and say it out loud you are more likely to act in it”
I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're dealing with a difficult situation, and it's important to address it openly and honestly. Try to have a calm and candid conversation with your wife about what she said and how it made you feel. Communication is key in any relationship, and understanding each other's perspectives can help you navigate through this. If the issue feels too overwhelming to handle on your own, consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe space for both of you to express your feelings and work through any underlying issues. Remember, you're not alone, and reaching out for support is a sign of strength.
Aambfta got it correct, this is not a Reddit conversation. Postpartum psychosis and postpartum depression are both very serious and very real. This isn’t some thing that you’re going to solve. This is some thing that needs medication and regular therapy and intervention. I would advise not leaving your wife alone with the baby. With the right treatment things will get better.

Please, please do not make your wife feel bad. She is literally having a chemical imbalance. Both of those things are very normal after pregnancy. Do not make her feel guilty on top of all of what she’s feeling. Comfort her. Let her know that you’re there for her. And that you guys are together. Do not leave her alone with the baby. 
You both need to get to an emergency room ASAP. And never leave her alone with baby. If she harms him because she's warned you and you posted this you Both could be convicted of manslaughter/felony negligence.
I can't even imagine how scary that is to read, that she told you she has those thoughts about harming y'all's child. 

Make sure she doesn't regret sharing those feelings with you because telling you about it is literally her asking for help, she know she doesn't want to hurt him and telling you is her pressure valve. She's doing that to protect him and she might feel ashamed of the feelings.

So judgement is out of the question, and you sound like you wouldn't do that. Have you asked her what she thinks is the best way to protect him? Talked about every option with her? Everything should be on the table. Are both of your parents included in the conversation? 

I'd want to make sure that there's a plan in place with specific things y'all can do if she gets those feelings again.
She sounds like she’s going through postpartum psychosis and needs to go to the ER IMMEDIATELY. She’ll need to see a psychiatrist and a therapist who specializes in perinatal mental health for follow up.

Honestly I would maybe have her go to the hospital for a little bit. PPD is so serious and mothers have done some pretty cruel things to their newborns because of it… since you can sometimes develop psychosis.

There’s nothing wrong with a stay at the hospital until she feels a bit better. They can connect her to a psychiatrist asap and do therapy there while making sure she has time to rest and relax and just let her feelings be present without any harm or triggers. The best part is help is around her 24/7 and it’s sooo much easier & accessible than making appointments. They may also recommend her some medication to help her through this time period.

I’m sorry you’re going through this, OP.
She will be able to heal if you take on the childcare duties.
I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It can be really unsettling when something your partner says causes you concern. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about what she said and why it’s troubling you. Express your feelings calmly and try to understand her perspective as well. Communication is crucial in any relationship, and addressing these concerns together can often help clarify things and strengthen your connection. If the situation feels overwhelming, seeking couples counseling might also provide additional support and guidance.
Agree with all the posts saying to get professional help but wanted to add please don't blame your wife. PPD is awful and she likely feels awful for having these feelings already. 

It's scarily common and massively under treated because the mums feel like failures I'm glad she trusted you enough to admit how she was feeling. She doesn't just need medical help, she needs your support and reassurance.
She needs a doc appt ASAP
Damn bro I have no advice to offer but I wish you and your family the best. 1-833-852-6262 (1-833-TLC-MAMA) is the number for National Maternal Mental Health Hotline
This is how tragic incidents start. Get your wife some help, and see if you can take some time off to be home with the little guy.
ER , start the help she needs
Do not for a second allow her to be alone with the baby. She is not herself, literally. The chemicals in her brain are firing all wrong. It’s like someone pulled out all the cables of the circuit board and just left them dangling. No emotion is being processed or transmitted correctly. 

Take immediate FMLA leave and try to have your mom or other family Member with her at ALL times. There are many cases when this turned into a nightmare. I don’t want to scare you but if you feel the need to learn about some of the most horrendous cases of this kind of situation.. lol at the case of Lindsay Clancy. 

Good luck and I wish your wife recovery and rest. Sending your family good thoughts.
This very well could be PPP: Post partum psychosis. At least if it seems she is trying to act on these things. It's much rarer than PPD, but it happens. She needs some low-level meds and to be talking to an expert. It also sounds like she's just exhausted. Seems she needs some help and a break from the baby. Make sure she can at least get a little break in every day or every other day, get a shower, take a nap, and let her bounce back a bit bc babies are exhausting. And then maybe a longer break like once a week to let her go and like grocery shop out vent to friends or whatever she really desperately needs.
Also, I don't mean to sound critical of you since you don't immediately seem the type to slack off and do nothing at home, but are you taking the baby from her when you get home so that she can have some of these breaks? It's important to share the workload. I know you're out of town on a business trip, but having friends and relatives who can drop by periodically can save lives. Even if she wasn't experiencing these thoughts, the levels of exhaustion can lead to some parents accidentally doing stupid or dangerous things.
You need to have her seek mental health intervention immediately. It is not uncommon to have these feelings. The key is to realize that what she told you is what a cry for help looks like. She won’t say, “I think I should see a professional.” This is the in sickness and in health thing you vowed to support her through. If it makes you feel better, my sister went through the same. Had urges to step in front of a truck. Once the baby was 1 her hormones stabilized and she immediately bonded. It’s not too late. It will be okay. Hormones can do a number on the brain.
She need to be “in house” intensive therapy for her PPD. periodically visiting a therapist isn’t doing the trick. My sister in law went through this, it was scary for her and us, after a month in away with constant therapy she came back a new woman and was able to connect with her daughter. It was a tough road but they have a great relationship today
Seek professional help and don’t leave that baby with her alone
She needs rest and a nanny for the kid.
sounds like her ppd turned into post partum psychosis! She needs help immediately or she might harm your child and maybe herself, too. She needs treatment NOW! Go to the ER with her.
She needs immediate inpatient psychiatric care without delay. She is homicidal and a danger to everyone around her. Now is not the time to play Russian Roulette with you or the baby’s life. Do not underestimate her. Mental illness that goes unchecked can be incredibly dangerous. Ask her if she wants to go inpatient. See if she will go voluntarily. If not, have her committed. Either way she needs to go now.
She needs immediate help. It is great that she is telling you these things, it means that she is still at a point that part of her realizes how 'crazy' it feels and sounds. If she doesn't get help, those things will sound more logical to her and get dangerous. Remember that she cannot control this at all and is just as scared, moreso, than you. You might have to make the difficult decision to have her do inpatient treatment. I really can't, and nor should anyone else, give advice that isn't primarily just getting her help ASAP, and possibly having her committed or do inpatient treatments. The harder you come after it the better it will get and faster.
Clearly the therapist alone is not working for your wife and her ppd. Psychiatrist may be needed at this point. The rhetoric about hurting the baby is terrible but not an uncommon thought when expericing these feelings. You made sure the kid was safe and mom got a break. Now make sure she sees a new psychologist and psychiatrist 
Is she being treated for her ppd? She needs meds
This is not uncommon for people with ppd.

She needs a break. Leave him with your mom for the weekend if u can. She's not sleeping, has stupid pressure to pump (which is a full time job) and looking after a kid that's constantly crying. Give her some time away

She's *telling* u shs needs a break
This is normal.

Motherhood is the worst and best thing that can happen to a person.

The chemicals in one’s brain from PPD can cause hallucinations.

Normal people can develop shaking syndrome. Do you know what that is? You want to shake the baby. You love the baby. But you’d shake it to make it stop crying. It’s a reflex.

She needs time away from the baby and better supports in place. She’ll need more support as a mother during this time, just as some people need more support while they’re running a marathon than other people. Everyone is built differently. The fact she’s sharing this with you means everything. She trusts you. You have to be the strong one for a while.
I STRONGLY suggest she gets a 4 day get away to a hotel room to sleep and pamper herself. A reset. You can get one yourself in a few months. Get grandparents involved.

My friend’s husband had something similar. Continuous crying led him to attempted suicide. Parenthood is tough. I’m glad she’s talking to you about it.
Also; make sure to tell her she did the right thing by telling you and not doing anything, and make sure she knows it. Sometimes that bit right there is the most important part. I’ve seen situations where the only reason someone didn’t unalive themself was because of the support but not criticism they got the last time they felt close to doing it. Definitely make sure to go to a doctor like everyone else is saying though. And if they are saying or doing something that doesn’t seem right, speak up and get a new one. This is serious and you want people that will see it and treat it that way, but with support and not criticism.
Under no circumstances is she allowed to be alone with the baby right now or for the foreseeable future. 

That is NOT the kind of thing a mother says after a rough day.  She needs an emergency trip to the doctor (not a therapist), your child needs to be supervised when with her, and you need to start getting your affairs in order in case a divorce winds up needing to happen (you probably won’t need to go this route as PPD doesn’t last forever, but when someone admits to fantasizing about murdering your baby, it’s best to have an exit strategy in mind.)

 Good luck to you. I hope your wife is able to find a treatment plan that works for her and that she is able to be the best mother she is capable of being, but more importantly I hope that you and your baby are safe and well. 
She might become an amazing mother and might be during some moments, but overal she’s currently not. She’s a mother who for a moment considered letting your son die in a car and who has no real emotional connection to him. 

He needs to be in childcare asap (or you need to be working from home). She needs a break most likely, but most importantly he needs to be safe when his dad is not around. 

Kiddo’s safety first, while she’s working on her metal health. 
Holy shit. I am so sorry. I wish we had advice that could help you, but this is definitely something for the professionals. Keep kicking ass, dude. You're gonna be a fantastic father. Hang in there.
OP

Your priorities should be as follows:

Make she your son is somewhere safe with someone to care for him.

Get your wife to see a doctor. She needs help.

Do not put your wife in charge of caring for your son until after she is better.
This is probably not even your wife's thoughts is the sad part. sounds like post partum psychosis or depression. I got it EXTREMELY bad, I didn't want to hurt my baby, but more so myself. All the hate of the situation I was in I pushed on top of myself, I didn't sleep for days, and over worked myself because of it. 
She needs to be watched alone too, she needs to be sent to the mental hospital. It doesnt just make you snap at your baby, or yourself, but also other people. 
Shes someone that may not know what she's doing you have to keep this in mind and think of both her and the baby. Don't abandoned your wife and be scared of her, she needs someone to care for her. Baby is safe, now worry about your wife.
A friend’s mother developed pretty severe PPD, and I remember her telling us (years later) that she had dreams of things like putting her baby in the hot oven. Thankfully nothing ever happened, but professional help is the only answer here. 
Additionally, this says absolutely nothing of her character or her maternal capacity. I am sure she hates to say and feel these things. Everyone in this situation would be well served by you taking a break from work, if possible. Family therapy could be beneficial, not an immediate need, but down the line. Sadly, as you seem to know, she cannot be trusted alone with your child right now. I am so sorry you all are going through this. I hope you can quickly find the right help for your family.
Brother,

Get her to the doctor ASAP and get her on treatment for PPD. Have her follow up with a psychiatrist, ok? I did that for my wife in a similar situation, and it really helped.
This is truly heartbreaking. Post partum depression  is very scary not only for the spouse but also for the person who's going through it. Is she on meds? The therapist needs to be aware of this so she can assist her with any resources etc. 

I can imagine your son is absolutely beautiful. They want  to connect so badly with their parents. All the gooing and  da da das. They are amazing. 

Please reach out to professionals to help your family through this.
Please take her to the ED to get emergent help. They have psychiatry and can get her started on meds or adjust meds if needed. Her call to you is a literal cry for help. At least she has the insight right now to call you when it gets super bad like this, but there may not be a next time if you do not act now. Pls take her to the ED now or even call an ambulance to get her the help she needs before it’s too late.
Your wife's text indicates she's in a serious mental health crisis. It’s crucial to get her immediate professional help and support. Make sure she’s seen by a mental health specialist as soon as possible and consider involving a counselor or therapist who can help address her PPD and any related issues. Ensure you keep communication open and supportive, and consider reaching out to friends or family for additional support during this time.
Ahe needs a full psych eval, diagnosis and treatment.
My daughter had colic there were nights I had to close the door to just cry myself. She needs more help than she is getting.
If she is not on depression medication or anti anxiety medication she needs to be ASAP.
Her hormones are completely out of wack and the medication helps bring her back to a normal functioning person. It doesn't have to be forever, just to get her out of that hopelessness feeling and over the edge.
You both need to be present in therapy cuz she might not be telling the therapist all the details, so you need to fill in  and ensure they have the whole picture. 
Best of luck but if you have a family member willing to help out during the day that would greatly help her. The PPD can take a negative turn quickly. My sister had it really bad and didn't take meds she ended up being diagnosed with BiPolar disorder after. But because of how unstable she was post partum I was with her almost everyday until her husband came home because she would say comments like that. She would tell me she wanted to drop them off and leave them somewhere.
She needs the ER right now. She needs medication and not just therapy. 

She needs to be 100% honest with them. They WILL NOT judge her, they will help her.

This is serious AF and something She can't get through alone. Pregnancy and delivery are no joke with crazy hormones. This is more common than you think.
Not feeling connected to the child, while not super common, isn't unheard of or atypical. It happens. Some (not all) mothers experience an immediate feeling of closeness and devotion as soon as the child is in their arms, but sometimes it takes a minute. It doesn't mean she's failing as a mother, isn't cut out for it, or any other concerns she or you may have. The feelings of love and care develop over time the same way it would when a stranger turns into a friend. So that in and of itself isn't necessarily a red flag.

That being said, she's having a severe post-partum mental health crisis. This isn't just PPD. That line of thinking and her reaction to a stressful but normal situation is not typical. I had a friend who similarly had a severe PP episode where they did not trust themself to be alone with their children because they would think about murdering the children. Their partner had to quit their job and stay home 100% of the time because of how severe it got. I think your wife needs in-patient treatment, or to be seeing her therapist several times a week. And probably a psych med adjustment. I'm really sorry you're both going through this. I really hope she gets the support she needs to work through this, and I hope you find the strength to support her while she does so.
 Don’t panic. Mothering to hard and taxing. You give up your own self for this demanding human who just takes. The days seem endless.  
My bro has 2 nannies for 3 kids. A housekeeper 1x week, a cook 5x a week.  I ridiculed him saying plenty if people raise kids w no nannies or outside help. She also goes for massages and yoga retreats.  His explanation was that since he works alot, and not always or willing to pick up slack like cleaning, cooking, any help he can pay for alleviates the wife’s stress.  Also he told me, she cant handle 3 kids and mothering.  They love their kids. 
And after visiting them for 2 weeks, I can see, my SIL, mentally cannot handle it all. They had kids late and had enjoyed a free life of travel snd vacations. So the solution was for my bro to do whatever he can afford to raise a happy family and sane wife.  
Now I know not everyone can afford these luxuries. But u said you have a mom. My bro didn’t have mom or MIL available ( out of country). Perhaps u can schedule daily breaks. Even a few hours help and Im speaking from experience.  Schedule weekly time for her to get out by herself. Schedule date nights. Get a teen to help out for a few hours like cleaning etc 
This wont be forever but do what you can to relieve her mental stress.  If she’s nursing, which is best but gives her no break , then better to do formula then for her to start thinking of abandoning or hurting baby   Ive wanted to run away too when baby seems to leech your own life.  Get her help.
Does anyone happen to know wha the wife should do with herself until he gets home while the baby is with his mom ? Should she go to the hospital herself now or have a friend stay with her at home or is she okay by herself just until he gets there?
You tell her how much you appreciate her communicating such difficult thoughts and feelings. Supporting her and being a safe place for her so that whenever she’s having those thoughts she knows she can tell you without fear of shame. It really demonstrates that you have been a safe person for her that she would express those things to you. So many women with PPD have similar thoughts and feelings but don’t have anyone they feel like they can be completely honest with who won’t make them feel judged and ashamed, so they keep them to themselves and aren’t able to get the support and communicate the red flags before acting on them. There needs to be a no shame or judgment zone so you can take action accordingly. This is absolutely not a reflection of her! Every single person has intrusive thoughts, but depending on certain factors some circumstances make these intrusive thoughts dangerously believable and actionable to the person suffering from them. Validate her struggle that you know this is not reflecting her or who she is as a person or mother, and is only due to instability between hormones and neurotransmitters and the brain/thoughts trying to make sense out of a flood of fears, changing and unmet needs, intrusive thoughts, a huge life change, etc. Everything in her brain is trying to adjust and the more emotional support she has the more resilient she will be. But the most important thing is that she feels safe sharing the deepest and darkest thoughts and feelings so you can ensure the safety of your family. You can’t protect what you aren’t aware of so thank her profusely for telling you!!!
Hi, she needs to be admitted to a mental health facility right now. There is very real evidence that she is having homicidal thoughts. This is a symptom of the PPD and has brought many loving, reasonable moms to do unrepairable damage. She needs to be hospitalized and should never be alone with her children until she is healed from this. This is a medical emergency.
Check her into a behavioral hospital ASAP
What you should do is get someone who came watch your son while you help your wife get the help she needs. Speak to professionals not just a therapist but also a doctor. The most important thing is your son’s safety. Do what you have to to make sure he is safe.
Updateme
She needs inpatient psychiatric medical care ASAP. She is sick and needs medical attention.
Is she a SAHM? You need to get the baby in daycare ASAP and get your wife in front of a doctor. She is mentally unwell and is not safe to parent right now.
She needs specialised therapy. PPD can be extremely severe and should not be managed at home. This is a moment to get professional help and work out as a team how you can reconfigure your family life to best support you all.
Hi! Something we’re taught in social work is to have a written down plan for crisis management with simple steps. When somebody is in distress, they struggle to think clearly. (An example of a clear thought might be “I am tired and overwhelmed, I should ask my mother in law if she can watch the baby for the afternoon so I can nap.”) If she is in distress, a simple thought like that might be difficult, so you have to have it planned out and written down ahead of time, when she is in a space to think straight. Then tape it to the mirror or somewhere accessible, so in a time of distress, she can enact the plan without needing to think straight. 

Example of a plan (This is a generic but effective crisis management tool, but I am no parenting/ppd expert, so the specifics will of course vary depending on what you need/what might help. The main thing is to have clear, easy to follow steps that you’ve discussed with relevant parties ahead of time):


“When starting to feel overwhelmed: 
1. Call MIL and ask to babysit
2. Text husband “overwhelmed” so he is aware
3. Set baby down in playpen and take five minutes to breathe and eat something. 

When feeling unsafe around baby: 
1. Shut baby in his room and go to the other side of the house. A crying baby is still a safe baby. Leave if necessary. 
2. Text MIL “Can you come watch the baby for an hour, urgently” 
3. Text husband “not coping”
4. Take medication in top drawer (pink bottle, 1 pill) 
5. If unable to contact husband or MIL, knock on [neighbor]’s door for help.”

That’s just an example off the top of my head, but you get it: Clear instructions. Assume that in times of distress, she will be incapable of coming up with a rational plan, and take that pressure off by discussing it beforehand. Also, a verbal plan is not good enough, it needs to be written down so she doesn’t have to try to remember anything.
Try to get FMLA from work to spend a few weeks taking care of your child. Your wife probably needs a break, babies are exhausting.
Alright, first of all you need experts in the medical field to lead you guys into what to do from now on. Second point, I would never ever again leave her alone with the baby before her PPD is solved, you need a stay in nanny to care for the baby and help your wife have relaxing quiet time for herself that she can use to heal. Right now the baby is in danger, she's not herself and you're probably going crazy worrying about both of them so you all need a break from this awful situation.
Be extremely careful yet optimistic. Treat your wife as if she were unable to make correct safety choices. Do not give her the option to hurt your son. Time will tell if she was just frustrated or actually being truthful. Good luck and take zero chances while still giving your wife love
First of GET PROFESSIONAL HELP


All I can say you can do right now is be supportive, don’t judge
DONT WAIT FOR A THERAPIST APPOINTMENT TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL NOW  she needs to be properly assessed and sounds like for your sons safety and hers she might need a hospital stay. 
Have you used your paternity leave? 
Is your mom able to step in for a while?  you mentioned your moms going to have him overnight but it's not like it's safe to just drop him back to her in the morning 
You need to hightail it to a specialist who deals with post partum depression. And don’t leave the baby alone with her until the doc gives the go ahead.
This is ppd it’s post partum mania she needs therapy more often 100%
There is a reason why people say to not leave women with PPP or PPD with their children. You know about this. Get her help ASAP. If it continues, she may never love or feel connected to your son. Hell, she may even harm him if they stay together.

EDIT: Go home and support your wife. Take leave from work if possible, keep your child away for a short time, and reevaluate with her. She needs a break and for someone to help her, not her husband being at work 24/7.
cheating on her in porn reddits probably doesn't help
Research a few psych wards to make sure they’re good and take her to get admitted immediately. Please. She needs help.
She needs to go to the hospital.
She should be hospitalized immediately,  no?
This is a 911 call. Seriously.
you are gross as fuck and I hope your wife finds better tbh. Commenting on other women's nudes while she goes through all of this.
The baby is your first priority. He needs to spend every night until your return with trusted family. Is there someone who can come stay with your wife until you return?
Get her to a doctor asap. Dont leave her with the baby until she’s been treated.

Emergency psych hold. Do it now.
 She can’t be trusted to take care of the baby. Help her by making sure she keeps going to therapy so that she can slowly improve her mental health, but right now she can’t be alone with him.
Definitely get to a therapist asap and please don’t leave the baby alone with her right now. She needs help and support. But please also protect your baby.
Dude! Severe PPD can manifest itself in homicidal/suicidal actions. Don’t let your child become a statistic. Get her some serious mental health treatment like yesterday. In the meantime DO NOT leave her alone with your child! I pray that she becomes mentally healthy and you and your son stay safe and healthy.
Well for starters, never leave your child alone with her. She's clearly in need of major professional help and counseling. I would even consider arranging for her to stay at a rehab. She's not only a danger to your child, but to herself as well. All parents get stressed. It's totally normal. No one says they want to harm their child unless theres something radically wrong. Get her to see someone and possibly spend some time getting help in an institution.
Keep talking to her. Keep going to therapy. Can you go together? Can mum help out more? Does she get a break from routine? Seeing friends? Seeing family? If not can it be increased? Do you have any paid holiday? Is she getting enough sleep and drinking enough water? Is she on medication? If yes could the side effects be exacerbating the problem? If no, is it a route to be explored? It could really help.

Ppd is so fucking hard. I have been there.
I have 2 girls and my youngest is about to turn three and honestly the amount of times I have been so touched out, burnt out, stressed and overwhelmed - you wouldn't believe!

It could be Worth getting your wife on some positive social media mum groups to talk about things as well or just scroll and see that these feelings are not as unusual as you might think. I like being on the mum space. 

I feel like the positive thing here is that she is being open with you and telling you about the intrusive thoughts. Generally, like with $u!c!d3, people don't tend to be open about thoughts they intend to act upon but like I said above - continue to get her help, support, rest and she will hopefully be okay.

Also it's normal to not feel bonded after a traumatic birth, unexpected pregnancy, previous miscarriages setting you up for continued disappointment. It sounds like unhealed trauma and possibly ptsd in my nonprofessionally-educated, experienced opinion. She needs to know that she is not alone and these feelings are completely normal! I felt guilty for years after having my firdt because I didn't get that instant love and connection every one talked about. It develops over time, especially when you get through the crying and sleepless nights ❤️
Kids more important than work take some leave time before you don’t have a kid anymore.
I would contact her doctor, who will probably contact child services and they can help her get what she needs. 

You need to get serious help for her before the hot car scenario becomes a reality. I know that's hard to hear, but it's true.
Yikes. You did good to make sure that your son was safe. This sounds like a recipe for a bathtub drowning. I agree with other redditors saying you need to schedule an emergency therapist meeting. Maybe even a brief mental hospital stay so she can get medicated. She definitely meets the "threat to self or others" criteria. Best of luck to you
She has PPD really bad and she needs to see a doctor
Some women go off the deep end
Especially around teething..being colicky.. lack of sleep...but she sounds overwhelmed
But when she gets upset and worn out just call your mom to go over and give her some space to be by herself and relax and calm down 
The first six months is so very hard
And on your days off make sure she goes out on one day to go shopping for awhile or somewhere where she can just relax and get alone time
Or relax and read or take a hot bath while you watch your child
Talk with your mom about spending comes time during the day with her to help out
If you are out of town on work it's extremely hard on her being alone
Sounds like she needs to see her therapist or a doctor and fast! If she seems to be a danger to herself or others (like your son) you could also try to take her to the ER for mental health reasons. I also really hate to say this but, if it gets worse or is already too bad to handle, she may be able to be admitted into an inpatient mental health facility. Just a heads up though, a lot of Mental hospitals aren’t that great and end up leading to more issues for many people, and others not. If the Mental health hospital the path that you want to take, please be wise with choosing the right one for her. If not, she should see her therapist or her doctor immediately. 
Wishing you, your wife, and your son the best. 🫶🏼❤️
This is more common than you would like to believe. It’s the PPD. She probably need meds Pls take her to the doctor now! If it gets worse, she needs to go to a rhospital.  Her body is all messed up. I’m very sorry. Pls be patient.
I think your wife needs more intense therapy. She may need some inpatient time maybe her meds need to be changed. Maybe she needs a new therapist. 

Your responsibility right now is to never leave her alone with that baby. 

She reached out to you this time. She may not reach out next time. She may not give you enough time after reaching out next time to ensure that child safety. 

Either Get that woman or get that baby out of your house. This is a major crisis situation and you need to act accordingly.
She needs therapy and medication. Recently it’s been recognized that some women become unsettled  after having a child.
Get home. Send somebody to the house if you can't get there quickly. Get her and your baby safe, and get her straight to the doctor. She isn't well. This isn't her fault, but you do need to take it seriously. If the first doctor is no good, take her to another. And another. PPD is nothing to mess with. I'm really sorry for all of you,  but if it helps at all, my sister got about as bad as it can get after her first baby, but she got better with treatment and later therapy and it didn't return after her subsequent pregnancies.
Definitely need professional help. I hope you’re both ok and everything works out
Mom here, I’ve been where she is and turns out I had ppd and ppa.  Combine that with a lack of sleep,… terrible combo.  Book her a massage and help her find a good therapist and psychiatrist.  You guys will get through this and she will get better but she needs professional help.
Take a week off and take the baby, get her help now.
Put the child in daycare and have her go back to work with adults. A lot of people don't understand how my numbingly boring it is to be a stay-at-home mom. If you're dealing with other mental issues like PPD, staying at home alone all day with no one to talk to is not going to help. You drop the baby off at daycare at the way to work and pick the baby up on the way home and that way she's never dealing with the child by herself.
This sounds like the wife in Shutter Island
I’ll be honest. I had severe PPD also. I didn’t get the help that I should’ve. I was extremely stressed and sad and was over the edge also my child is different so it was harder for me to process that. At first I had no attachment it took some time. Then after a few months it got worse and I made a plan to kill myself but my sister talked me out of it. At one point I called my mom and my sister and told them I wanted to choke my child cause I felt like I was losing my mind with her and they talked me out of it. I should’ve got help but I didn’t however I will say that changed a lot. I haven’t felt like that since and I think it takes a lot of time and processing. My child is truly everything to me and I think PPD definitely takes time to get out of. I know everyone else is saying take her to a dr and I agree I should’ve went but was scared. However it is the best decision and just continue to be as supportive and there for her as much as possible. I’m sorry you both are going through this but you both will get through this together
That might be still part of PPD. She needs to have meeting with psychiatrist ASAP. Honestly, feelings that she have are maybe not common but can happen to women with PPD.
This is called postpartum mania. Have her committed immediately. This is not normal and it will get worse if she doesn't get the help she needs. Praying for you all.
This is actually really common and many women have talked about experiencing the very same thing, no emotional attachment. 

Don’t worry about her being crazy or losing it. Worry about her getting help. She’s going through a grieving process after pregnancy ended and needs to tap out of parenting responsibilities until she feels better. 

I know it’s all fresh and you probably aren’t ready to take on the main toll of parenting right now, but that’s what parenting is like. Sometimes you have to do more than you think you can. 

Treat this as her finding out her parents died or that she found out she’s terminally ill. And take it seriously. Listen to her and support her. 

Google it and read up on it. 

Eventually with some help it will all be fine
So you go to Reddit for advice instead of a professional? 
seek help. my husband and i went through this(and still are) and it has been very rough but getting the help she needs and you guys need is crucial to support your mental health and marriage.
Get help. Psychiatrist. Please
As a mom who had little patience- I can tell you that this is absolutely not normal. Please seek professional help immediately.
You are a single father until she feels like the mother of that child
I’m not a doctor, but I’m a cps worker and see this a lot in my job. This sounds like post-partum depression/psychosis that is only increasing. She needs to go to the hospital, therapy alone isn’t going to resolve this. She will find this to be dramatic but it needs to happen if she wants to be around your guys’ son. These thoughts she’s having aren’t normal. It’s typical for parents to feel overwhelmed, disconnected, etc at times but making statements like she did after repeatedly saying she feels no connection to him is super concerning. These are honestly how these horror stories of a mom killing her children start. 

Also, she should not be alone with your son at all right now. She needs evaluated asap.
Hang in there dad, Post partum Depression is serious. I’ve been through it once and it’s dark, really dark. It’s not because we want to behave this way but our minds controls us instead of vice versa. It can take months, even years so please try not to plan for another baby because she needs to find herself again. I’m sure that you are a great spouse and that you can help her. Please help her and take her to see a doctor, try to be patient and understanding and help her with the baby. I’m sure once the baby starts to be a bit more independent, she will find herself again and she will connect with her child. It just takes time. Wish you the best
Dont ask reddit, ask doctors, she needs meds, therapy and you need some kind of help in your home, that would take care of the baby, she obviously cant right now 😅👉
She did the right thing by telling you and making sure baby is safe. 

You did the right thing by making sure baby is safe.

She needs to see an actual doctor about the PPD to help get it under control. The disconnect from the baby can be due to that.

When my eldest was teething, crying and just being… evil… I wanted to throw her out the window. I mean - I didn’t. I put her in her cot and walked away for 5 minutes. Doesn’t mean I don’t love her; doesn’t mean your wife doesn’t love your child.

Finally when this is all settled; don’t hold it against her. She told you and made sure baby was safe.
Let your mother take care of the baby for the time being.  
Do NOT leave him alone with your wife.

He's not even my baby and I'm worried sick about him :( ..

I hope your wife gets all the help she needs 'cause after all, your baby needs her love just as much as he needs yours
If she doesn’t get help immediately, something very very bad could happen to both her and your son. This is much worse than PPD and is extremely dangerous. Please get her help
This is very serious if you can take a leave of absence from work and get both of you into a therapy appointment ASAP she also needs to talk to her family doctor right away. 

Good luck i’m sorry you guys are struggling 💕 hope things get better soon
psych ward
Just giving birth doesn’t necessarily mean that you instantly start feeling love towards the newborn. Love is something that comes with time and spending nice time together. Judging from what you shared it looks to me that your wife sees your son as just a duty or a chore. Do they go out to have fun together? Probably that should help them appreciate each other. I am not saying to avoid therapist, but I think doing that would fell to her as if things are forcing her to love her kid. They just need to spend time together and eventually your wife to realise how much they have in common. You know, being able to relate to something makes us feel attached to it. 

And for the therapist - she probably developed some fear from the two failures you mentioned. Her problem is there, not with your healthy boy
Please get your wife to the hospital for an emergency psych evaluation. PPD is serious and dangerous if untreated.
R
Updateme
I’m so sorry 😢 I know someone who went thru this, she had terrible PPD.To the point her sister suggested staying with her while someone watched the baby til she calmed down. One day, randomly she said it’s like she “woke up Fine & feeling totally normal again “ I hope that will be the case with your wife. Sounds like something you should talk to the Dr about tho, & that for now I would def have someone watch the baby often to take some stress off her.. best of luck ❣️
Just buy formula instead of going to a psychiatrist. She'll seriously improve in no time. If my advice fails; then go to the psychiatrist. 

Breastfeeding is a bitch; it fucks up anyone's mental health. Breastfeeding is the best way to feed a child; but formula is a close second. It's not like he's going to grow dumb for eating formula; and he already had the immunological boost from breastfeeding for a while it seems. 

People just insist and make you feel guilty for not breastfeeding; but nothing really happens; and not doing it can really make miracles for a woman's life sometimes.
You don’t know what to do?
Get your child to secured short term accomodation and forward the texts to the authorities so your child can get safety and your wife can help.

I understand this is overwhelming and anxiety inducing but so these things first and you can analyse the rest later.

I wish you the best. Please remember, as farfetched as this soundsthere is a positive in that you got a red flag before any irreversible damage was done to your child.
Be the best father you can be. As for her it seems she came into the relationship with some heavy traumatic baggage from the childhood or past experiences specifically associated with the role of motherhood. This can be worked out with professional help - hypnotists, therapists, psychologists. When she hears child crying it triggers these traumas reflecting her own self crying inside about unresolved emotional issues and insecurities from the past.
OP, if there was ever a time to reach out to a friend, relatives or any caring trusted person- it’s now. I assure you they will be happy to help drive your wife, stay with her and keep you updated. Call.
HAS ANYONE DONE A WELFARE CHECK HERE PLEASE?
g-eazy on repeat all day everyday baby know am sayin
Protect that baby
She needs to get her meds right.
It seems like you need to take time off work to care for your son and wife. The way she's feeling is normal post partum, it'll go away in time, until then you need to be there for her as much as you can. If taking a few months off isn't in the cards then at least ask for lowered hours so you can be there for them more often.

And get babysitters at least once every week or two to give her a break so she doesn't break.
Get your child out of her hands. 

Get to a therapist

Arrange for a nanny to come. 

So NOT trust her alone with your child.
She's lost all her nutrients, she needs to take her prenatals to help PPD. Also get her out of the house and some fresh air. As disturbing as those sound a lot of ppd sufferers have weird and disturbing thoughts like that. She definitely needs a break when she gets like that so good thing your mom is willing to help. Most women won't act on it but if she has any other mental health issues definitely take her to see a psychiatrist so she can get some meds if needed or advise.
You should have refused to get her pregnant bro not everyone is fit for having kids! You saw the signs but did it anyways…. I feel sorry for your kid but not for you! 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
Good lord. This is the reason I don’t want kids I’m terrified I would experience the same thoughts. (Autistic meltdowns make me very very aggressive and leads to me being cruel when I don’t want to be. We are working on it and I’ve gotten A LOT better but I still fear losing that control over my thoughts like that) please get her a good team of professionals and the help she needs
Please Please read the ANDREA YATES, who in 2002, Houston Tx (where I live), drowned her 5 kids due to Post Partum Depression. We must never say "we would never."  Help your wife. She reached out to you. The ball is in.your court. You contact the Doctor asap.
My girlfriend is a psychologist, and this is something she's studied. Some mothers after birth will have the urge to even kill their child. It's a post Pardon depression. A lot of mothers that go through this have to be separated from their children. They are reunited when the situation is better or she is fit to be "motherly". This could even take up to 10 years. I recommend you talk to  professional help for the safety of everyone both physical and mental
I thought I was on r/nosleep
First, she is not to be alone with the baby. Second, she may need intensive therapy, and protentional medication. Her lacking an emotional connection is not the major concern at the moment, I have a friend diagnosed with sociopathic tendencies, and while she doesn't have an attachment to her child, she does not neglect or harm him. She doesn't let him know she doesn't love him and is a good mother by most standards. Pick your battles, and her emotional standing could not only be PPD but a form of PTSD as well due to the previous loses. Plus, even while doing everything right, there may be backslides or outright failures. Looking at her environment may also be a good idea. How much help is she getting, how much downtime, how are the other relationships in her life going. She is aware enough to reach out for assistance when she hit a limit, which is a good thing. Discussing what were the triggers, what was their order of impact. Was it the being needy or the sound of him crying that affected her more? I'm autistic from a large family with a lot of babies and while the crying wasn't pleasant, the touching was worse. So, checking out sensory input could help as wall. Also, when a woman has a child and suffers these sorts of things afterwards it becomes a "get better so you can be a better mother" and her as an individual gets erased from the equation. Yes, safety of the child is most important, but she matters as well, so adding "get better so you are feeling better" should also be important. As for today's incident, determining if it was an "out of the blue manic episode" or the climax to a building storm that you weren't privy to or that went unnoticed. Without more detail I am unable to assist in a more defined way, but this is what I advise.
She’s going to be okay, and so will you and the baby, but you need to get her help. Leave the baby with your mom, plan a doctors appointment for her to discuss this, and arrange for serious therapy. She needs a break, too. Talk to her about how she’s feeling and let her know that you’re here to support her and love her, and that she’s a good mom for opening up to you and letting you know that she needs a break.
Yes to seeing a psych ASAP. Please please get her to stop pumping. My PPD was closely linked to this (please research D-MER) It's not for everyone. Once we allowed formula (and was on medication for PPD) I was a different person and mom.
Definitely get her into a dr asap!! I had SEVERE PPD after having my first, and second, but for my son I just held it in until I felt like your wife. In my situation, my husband was the one I wanted to kill and I couldn’t understand why. I was always upfront and honest with him and he knew it wasn’t me but rather the whole hormones and upset of my day to day life. I did get help and it stopped everything. With the second I immediately got on medication for it and it was amazing. 


Her life has likely been flipped upside down. You’re out of town for work, meaning she’s probably struggling with day to day things like take a shower and feeling like a human and not a babies servant. Lack of sleep can be awful. I never wanted to ask for help because everyone continually told me I was doing everything wrong and I’d just rather not have help than deal with that. Sounds like your family is close by, so I would suggest talking to your mom about being careful about offering any unsolicited advice for a little while. I remember that setting me off so badly even with strangers. 

If she’s thought about harming the baby, and now has related that to you, she’s on the last step which would be to act on it. I’d seriously be looking into getting her into a dr NOW. I don’t care where you are, you need to get home. I had a friend get institutionalized for less than what your wife has said to you. She hated him for it initially, but it was what she needed. 

Moral of everyone’s comments - get home and get her medical help NOW and make sure she has someone to help when you’re gone.
Seeing a therapist is great I’m surprised the therapist hasn’t referred her to a dr for medication. I’m in an anxiety and depression group and there are many women in it that don’t feel that connection and once they truly got the help they needed it made a world of difference. I would suggest seeing a psychiatrist asap let them know what’s going on so she can get an urgent appointment. She has love for your son or she wouldn’t be doing the things she is. And she’s being open and honest with you so help her get to a dr. You are doing amazing
Is this like sm natural? Never heard about PPD that’s terrifying
Be very very careful with this. If she doesn’t get a release and learn to deal with her feelings and heal from the depression or medicate it, you may run the risk of some serious danger. Listen to her when she speaks. For a mother to say something like that about her own child….. something is not right. Take it very very seriously. So sorry you’re going through this.
She needs professional help. Feeling disconnected from your child is part of pdd. Her expressing this to you is her asking for help, so help her before it's too late. You have to ask yourself what's more important to you right now your wife's life or a flight home, you can always earn more money but you can't ever get back time. 

Get help for yourself, educate yourself so you know what to look for and when she needs to be taken and sectioned. Because right now she needs to be. She fears she is a danger to her child and she needs help, support, love and grace, and equally importantly medical  intervention.
There have been mothers who have said these things and were not properly addressed. Read the newspapers to find out what happened to their children. She may need inpatient care immediately.
She needs a doctor. Not therapy at this point…
Are you helping with the child at all or is she mainly responsible with taking care of the child?

I take care of my kids Thursday-saturday. My girl does Monday through Wednesday. 
Sundays we do it together. Every now and then we get a baby sitter on tuesdays.

If she's all alone with the kid non stop it's kind of a hellish situation for any human.
Your story is very helpful 
TY
Your wife needs a psychiatrist and a therapist NOW!! And she cannot be trusted around your child.
I'm glad she your wife, though it's hard to handle is honest with you.  Do what you have to to protect yourself and your son. Believe that her admitting what she's going through with you is her your wife asking to be in this family with you.
If I can help in one way only, I hope it's this. 
Having a baby is not always a magical bond at first for all mothers. 
I would never want my kids to know, but they also were "just a baby I took care of" for years. 
Yes, they were cute but that full "mama bear" kind of love didnt come till much later when they had personalities. 

Feeling like it made me a bad mom or some callous monster was actually worse than when caring for them was hard.
Ehh she needs therapy. Also who's idea was it to have kids lol cause imo. She didn't want kids. So if it's you who wanted kids. You can't be surprised that a person who doesn't want kids. Acts like she doesn't want her kid lmao. 

But If it's not that. Then therapy. And maybe a long talk. Honestly I don't even know why you came to reddit. This is a job for a licensed professional. And maybe come to terms with the fact your wife doesn't want/can't handle the child and prepare for the future.
This is a really big deal and requires intervention beyond Reddit. You need to seek professional help for her even if that means it’s temporarily uncomfortable for everyone. And you have to move out with your son for now. His wellbeing is first. She cannot be alone with him. Sorry you are going through. One day at a time - nothing has to be forever- but immediate action is needed.
I agree with the first redditor to respond - this is above my everything. 

One outside thought. 
Your wife was aware enough to text you something that couldn’t be taken back, that could be taken terribly wrong if circumstantial events were to happen, but she still got that message out to you in a way that can never be misconstrued. 

**Good for her** She outwitted the PPP trying to take over her own thoughts.   She won a crucial battle in her life.
I would call her OB/Ped ASAP. This seems to be escalating. Please seek help immediately even if she is hesitant! Good luck, OP!
Sounds like the PPD turned into PPP
I think she needs to talk to her therapist with you present and it may be good for your mother to watch him a couple of days if possible give her a break and schedule a appointment with the therapist asap. No one on Reddit can answer your question even though it seems to be more of a statement
Sound like post parturition psychosis. Please get her help
Give the woman some time to herself and hire a nanny or someone to take care of the baby for a while.
Lemme guess, she said “I do”?
Do not leave her and baby alone until things are better
Don't let her be alone with the baby for a second! She is letting you know she needs help right away. I heard of a man whose wife had post partum psychosis and he just went to pick up pizza and she killed the baby.  Sorry to be so blunt, but this is serious. She is not a bad person, but is not mentally well right now.
I’ve struggled with issues like this after birthing and its terrifying. I had severe anxiety, depression, and paranoia from sleep deprivation. Taking care of a new baby (who sounds colicky) and dealing with crying 24-7, no sleep, and hormones going haywire, contributes to all of this. What she is experiencing is likely a result of the hormones from birthing but also breastfeeding. Breastfeeding hormones are the same hormones that are dominant in pregnancy, which double each day during pregnancy and is back to 0 within 48 hours of birthing. 

My situation is similar to most who have struggled with psychosis, they had no help, no breaks, no support. You sound supportive. I was very self aware when I went through this, but that made it more scary to me. I contacted my OBGYN, who is not really trained to deal with things like this, and they sent me to the ER. From there I spent a week in-unit locally in my town, getting on anxiety meds, attending group therapy, and journaling. They knocked me out with Benadryl to wind down my paranoia and anxiety from not sleeping. Every noise I heard, I would rocket launch myself out of the bed thinking something was wrong when I was asleep. Get her to a therapist immediately, her OB can help with a referral. It sounds like she definitely needs to get on medication to straighten her mind back out, and she needs some rest. 

Hire help. Hire someone to come clean the house. Someone to sit with her during the day for a few hours, or even a night nurse to handle overnight care until everyone is more in a mentally stable position.
TL;DR please
First of all do not feel bad for her at all. Just because someone has a mental issue that puts others in danger doesn’t mean it’s justified. Take her to a professional asap because Reddit is too unqualified for this, and keep an eye on your kid 24/7. Wish you the best
You need immediate, full time, in-home care for your child and medical supervision/intervention for your wife. She’s having murder fantasies…. She needs help and she’s begging for it. Act now before tragedy.
I would fully evaluate why you used this phrase “ During a few arguments caused by her being overstimulated”

So, overstimulation doesn’t cause arguments. Also, if the mother of my child had PPD, one would think you wouldn’t stand there and argue with her - especially knowing her condition is already vulnerable and she’s struggling. 

Why is she alone with the baby if she has PPD? How come your mom wasn’t over there helping her? She was alone with a screaming infant FOR HOURS with PPD depression and there was no one helping?! There’s some disconnect in the narrative. Frankly, it sounds like you want to go back to “the way it was” and she is stuck with an infant and getting zero resources - from you or your mom. 
If she's not already in therapy, she needs to be. PPD can last for very extended periods of time and can require medical intervention to ensure everyone's safety. 

If she is already in treatment, make sure she has ample support and people that she can call if it becomes too much. It might even be worth having relatives that each take a day with her to help when you aren't home, just to ease the weight of it all.
I developed it in the mountains away from family after the birth of our second son I called my Dr & prayed My husband helped me have the time I needed for myself without him or the kids Professional help is best Good Luck to you both
Don't leave her with your kid. This is one of those things you might have to split up over and do not give her custody of the kid
I don’t want to jump to any crazy assumptions. yes she may have been having a really hard day, but saying you want to kill your child is something a mother shouldnt feel. I think you should encourage her to seek medical help for the sake of yalls family. there have been many situations where mothers have a bad case of PPD and lash out. https://youtu.be/xr9Gmmj0c9g?si=bIQwGFT7L7LBssP-

this is a recent story i had heard that i wanted to share and there are many more that can be found when researching this delicate topic 
What a tough situation to be in!  I remember with an infant having this weird impulse to throw it across the room.  It shocked me.  Sleep deprivation and being physically taxed from childbirth can do crazy things with you.  We are wired to bond to love babies to counteract things like that.  


 Just a few suggestions, based on your wife having PPD and struggling to bond:  The book The Diet Cure goes into detail about supplements and diet that can balance neurotransmitters.  It's cheap on thriftbooks.   


 Acupuncture is great for helping our bodies get back into balance and heal after childbirth ( which has a mental aspect).  Often, acupuncturists are trained chinese herbalists as well.   Acupuncture has changed my life, I can't recommend it enough.  All acupuncturists are different, so try more than one if needed!  


Take her to see a functional medicine doctor!  After my first childbirth my methylation pathway was messed up and I didnt know it.  Years later I took large B12 doses (methylcobalamin) and my depression immediately lifted.  But for B12 to work correctly, other vitamins and minerals are essential too, and a functional medecine doctor can work to identify critical deficiencies, that are likely to be worstened after childbirth.


 In China, some people follow a diet protocol after giving birth that's meant to restore depleted nutrients.  Moms of newborns should rest a ton and eat warming, nutritious foods, and likely she didn't get that.  It's probably not too late to make sure she is eating well and getting rest/time away from baby.


 Is switching to being an at home dad and letting her go to work a possibility in your situation? 


 The book How We Love is based on attachment theory - it might not help your wife, but could help you and her avoid parenting pitfalls since attachment seems to be an issue.


If you have safety concerns, maybe bring it up in therapy together.  A therapist might be able to give you advice about signs for when there's a real risk and action needs to be taken.  Therapists are not all the same - feel free to tey more than one therapist!
My assumption is that she had a bonding problem with her own mother or her mother with she. She has been through some sort of trauma in the past I’m sure of it. Whatever the case, lots and lots of therapy is indicated along with potentially some sort of RX, but in the meantime how to keep your baby safe. I don’t have the answers except now that the DHHS knows it right? I’m sure they have taken over by now. This is sad. I’m so sorry for you and your wife and especially for your baby.  I will keep you in prayer as I do all babies and children in the world each day and families who are suffering like this. 
Absolutely speak to a professional as soon as you possibly can, the both of you. I sincerely hope everything works out. Best of luck!
I feel for you ,what a gut wrenching situation for you.first off I'm no where near qualified to tell you how to handle that situation but I do strongly believe this needs to be brought up with a therapist A.S.A.P. this is not a situation for crossing your fingers and hoping for the best.She needs help and I hope see knows this also.theres just to much at stake .my God give you both the strength to overcome these trying times for your family.
she should have been getting help with therapy and stuff since day one.
hey how is everything going on op?
Read a couple of the comments and agreed, way above reddits pay grade. You have to consult someone because no amount of money is worth your child’s life. Wishing the best for you and your family
She needs a Dr, potential inpatient care and meds, this ain’t just a therapist issue. Please don’t let her and your child become an unfortunate statistic whereby one loses their life and the other ends up imprisoned.
I would say that your wife can no longer be around your child without somebody with her until she gets either the proper help or she's no longer in the picture. I would seriously consider biting the bullet and really looking at your finances to put him in daycare moving forward. That's not a bucket of Joy either, but it's better than having your kid put in 120° car to be cooked alive. I can't believe she actually would say that I would have thrown up if I heard that.
Dude I’m a father and that shit IS A WARNING!! Are you really going to risk your beautiful Sons life? The things she’s saying ARE NOT NORMAL!! If she harmed him you’d never forgive yourself
Put her into a mental hospital and have them evaluate her. She literally spoke about her desire to murder her own child. While she may not have acted, this shit isn't normal. You are right to worry.
[removed]
Have you tried to stop talking to her and just LISTENING to her?

By the way, look into Solution Focused Therapy, you will love it, and it will help you ;-)
Bro I'm starting to wonder if YOU'RE safe.
S manic episode is not a day… it generally lasts longer.  Seek professional help for her and be honest with providers.
Oh, she's gonna need big time heavy help there, because the problem isn't having those feelings(though working to NOT have them is a necessrity) but that slight chance that-as you said-she might act on them.

Imagine if her superego doesn't do it's job and she goes full id?

She'll probably need to spend some time far away, in a clinic or something, with people that can actually help her deal with whatever it is she has.
/r/regretfulparents says hi
Immediately call a hospital and get a psychiatrist involved. I hate to say it but your baby is not safe with your wife right now. If she refuses to engage in treatment, immediately filed protection order and divorce. 

Unless you're okay with her killing your son, that is.
Take her to the ER and have her put on a 72 hour psych hold.
She definitely shouldn't be having another kid 💀💀💀
Nah man I'd just divorce her and get the custody of my child, like WDYM having thoughts of KILLING YOUR OWN KID!? She has some serious issues that even medication might not cure. Who knows one day she wakes up and decides to kill your kid? I can't leave my kids with someone like that. You might wanna give her another chance but remember you're putting your kids lives at risk. One more mental breakdown and you might lose your kid forever.
Leave that crazy and take your child with you , I would mention that in court . Please forget about therapy or psychiatric visits , she is going to hurt the child if you leave him around her
Dont ever let her be alone with that child again. Thats some bullshit you must protect your baby boy at all costs even if its from your own wife.
Thank you, I know that ultimately, that's what's needed but I'm out of town right now, trying to get back home.
This is outstanding advice. If I can add that you need to be a safe space for her, let her feel that she can vent to you, but not condone it. The worst case scenario is that she doesn’t feel she can confide in you and then goes and does something tragic
We had to Baker Act my cousin because she was neglecting her son and one day left him in the crib crying, went outside and instead of coming back in the house, she went for a drive and then left him alone for hours. The neighbor called my aunt because they kept hearing the baby crying but didn't see my cousin's car and when they knocked no on¹!8⁰e answered so they became concerned. My cousin was gone for over 4 hours and wouldnt say where she was. Had the neighbor not called my aunt, who knows.
100 per cent this!!

This is DEFINITELY a situation best left to the professionals.  Good luck and my thoughts are with the OP and his family at this time.
@OP, don’t let fear interfere with the right decision. Therapy may be hard, but if a healthy family comes of it, its worth
You guys are getting paid?
Not a therapist, a psychologist. WAY different
Therapist might do a welfare check on the baby to make sure he can even continue living there. That's a wild thing to say
That’s very brave of you to share this story, both of you.
Thank you for sharing. I struggle with mental illness without having kids and it’s why I won’t have them. But there’s nothing shameful about realizing you need help and things are out of your control and then seeking that help. I’m very proud of you for realizing you were past the point of brushing it off and sought out that help and sharing your story helps normalize it for those that suffer and want to seek help
Thank you for being real enough to share this. PPD is no joke and I wish you and your family the absolute best!
Thank you for sharing; your story reminds me of stories you hear of mothers suddenly killing their young children. The media always demonizes the mothers (tbf understandably) but I'm sure it's rarely occurred to people that the reason could be something like sudden mental illness, and that demonizing such situations is far more damaging than good.
A GP? A general practitioner? No. She needs a psychiatrist.
He's with my mother for right now until I can arrange for something less temporary
He's with my mother until I'm able to get home.
Louder before he tries to run away from it
There’s also a comment where he claims to work in EMS? If he is actually in healthcare, he’d know what to do in this situation / how to get his wife proper care. The comment he made does suggest he has a history of not believing patients though, so it’s possible he has similarly downplayed his wife’s condition in the past if he actually does work in EMS.
EMDR isn’t a good idea in all situations. What comes to mind is sexual trauma
Thank you, this helps. I'm just at a loss with how this happened. I'm not able to have a face to face conversation with her until tomorrow but I appreciate the support
💯
She has one already that specializes in PPD. She goes bi-weekly and I thought things had been going well... she's made so many strides
Was looking for a comment like this. She is overwhelmed and needs a break, she clearly needs professional help as well but the most immediate thing that can happen is that he can and should step in as the primary baby caretaker.
Thank you. Because clearly she’s over the edge. I have much more to say but everyone here is just trying to appease him as if he’s the one in danger. The mother and the child are.
Yeah understandable but that’s the second step. The first is getting home and getting his wife immediate medical intervention and possibly an inpatient stay.

Right now isn’t about his schedule it’s about making sure his wife and son are safe.
When she is better, you can try family therapy. There are ways to bond if she gets to a place she wants to, otherwise you need to get full custody

I don't get paternity leave with my job unfortunately
And whatever you do please try to reassure her that these feelings are not something to feel guilty about and that she just needs help. She’s undergoing a LOT of stress
What? Did u mean the mom and kid need to spend more time? Because that's the opposite of the solution
Yes, this hapoens aLOT in the news.  In my city, a woman jumped off the roof of a hotel due to post-pardum depression.  Her husband was boo-hooing about being busy with work.  There were so many warning signs and he didn’t believe her. Another lady smothered her baby to death. I hope OP takes this seriously.
I have our child the majority of the time. I work 24 hours on shift, 48 off. The only time she has him is the 2 nights a week where I'm on shift. I or my mother has him the rest of the time. We have no other resources for childcare as she is adamant that she does not want a stranger to come in our home or send him to daycare
You are jumping to assumptions.  A woman who gets proper treatment for PPD can end up having healthy relationships with their child.  There is no need to take custody from the mother in a legal sense.  Until she gets psychological intervention, she needs to only be allowed supervised visits.  Other women on this thread shared their stories. They didn’t lose legal custody of their child and have healthy relationships with their children now.
She went through a 52hr labor with multiple issues and at one point they told us he wouldn't survive.
This is terrible and incorrect. you really shouldn't be advising these things (which aren't even right in the first place) if you are not OPs doctor or therapist
We've been having once a week sessions where each of us has time to air out our feelings without interjection or judgements. This isn't something that's ever come up from her.
That would destroy any trust she has in me and in this state text messages don't count as proof.
It's better to keep your mouth shut sometimes. Especially if you have no idea what you're talking about, like you right now. If you're a man, I hope you don't have a woman you're planning to have a child with, considering your dangerous attitude. 

Literally almost all comments here explain exactly what happened, there's plenty of information online about PPD/PPP, yet you just chose to ignore all that and be a d*ck. Wow.
She needs to see a Dr., not a therapist NOW. Her PPD could turn in post partum psychosis. She needs medication, not just therapy. Can you two afford a helper?
Edit: I was agreeing with the comment that this is above Reddit’s pay grade. Do NOT entrust your son’s life to the advice of internet strangers. This is an urgent emergency medical issue. Your wife’s life could also be at risk, especially as postpartum psychosis may be involved. (Homicidal ideation often overlaps with suicidal ideation.) I really hope you get her into the hospital, but if you can’t/don’t, please do NOT leave her alone tonight!

Original:
I absolutely agree with the comment above! Please, please, PLEASE take this seriously. This sounds like it could be postpartum psychosis. It doesn’t mean your wife is a bad person or bad mom… She just needs help! Please don’t leave your son alone with her until this has been resolved. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.
This is a reason to go to the Emergency Room. 

Do not wait for the therapist. Especially since it's a weekend. 

She needs to go directly to the ER and be honest with them. This is more than PPD and is likely PPP (post partum psychosis) which is treatable. 

But do not wait. The horror stories of people harming/killing their babies while in the throes of PPP are numerous.
best of luck, I hope everyone remains safe.
Please call her OB/GYN and tell them what's going on. Or call the pediatrician. This is a medical emergency and she needs to be evaluated. She can't help it, it's not her fault, but she needs a break and the care of her doctors ASAP. 

Be safe hurrying home.
I would also like to pile on this point to help hammer it home. Stay safe!
'This morning I just wanted to put him in a hot car and walk away.' is for sure the line where YOU have to act because it's no longer safe. I'm not even going to try and add any other advice because you need doctors and therapist to tell you where to go from here. I'm sorry for you, thankfully your mom is close enough to help until you can get back.
Unless you are in another country and the flight is literally 24 hours you are not taking this seriously enough. 

This is a "hey office, I have a family emergency I'm leaving right now" situation. Then you walk into the airport and buy the first ticket home. 

If you are a super important big shot, you maybe take an hour or two to prep your number 2 to take over the work then leave. 

Don't post on Reddit, don't collect karma, go straight home.
Exactly what the person above stated. You did the right thing, but if you live in an area with a mental health hotline, call them the next time. They may have a Mobile Crisis Unit who will come out and assess whether or not she needs to be hospitalized. (I cannot emphasize enough: DO NOT CALL THE POLICE. They are not equipped to handle mental health crises.) Based on what you have stated, she probably needs to be hospitalized. She also probably needs BOTH therapy and medications which means she may not be able to breastfeed anymore. This is not something you can continue to address on your own. You need a long term plan that respects your wife, your child and you. If I were a service provider, I would recommend considering hospitalization even though she is no longer a threat. They can get her medications stabilized before she is released. You can also look to see if there are any PPD groups she can attend in addition to the individual therapy.
I hope you e made it home safely by now, as others have said that's enough absolute emergency. She needs you home and helping
Have someone take her to the ER if you can. She needs help now
You don’t have to be in town. Contact the therapist by phone. Arrange an Uber for transportation to the appointment or maybe your mom could drive her?
She needs a dr now op!!!
Honey the only advice is to get her to the doctors like yesterday
Not good enough, call an ambulance  for her ask your mom to take her to hospital.
Call her OB immediately to see if they can convince her to check herself in to the hospital. Otherwise, call 911.
Get your child to safety first...maybe your parents can help you here while the wife works on this current situation she's immersed within? Ask them asap. 

I'd start looking at some serious therapies for her. I'd even consider psilocybin therapies for something like this.  Holy hell. Bonne chance mon ami
I hope you are helping your wife with your son and not leaving it all the work for her  
I have heard better help sucks but I would look for online therapy just to maybe get some professional advice now, and then see in a person therapist when you get home.

The first start is often the therapist. There is a relationship there which means the person has the ability to be heard and be involved in their treatment plan which improves their odds of seeking and going through with treatment. Therapists do deal with this and know how to handle this-they develop plans with the patients to get them the help they need with a wider team of medical professionals and even make referrals. They also assist family members in handling the situation appropriately for the best outcomes. Its a great place to get first steps from someone who can adequately assess the mental state of a person, and often they have a better picture as they know the patient before and can notice more subtle changes that a new professional may miss. 

It’s by no means a permanent solution, and no therapist worth their salt would try to be the only resource in a case like this.
Are you okay? So your solution is for the mom to not get help and potentially harm herself or the baby? Therapists usually do not do this unless absolutely necessary.
Thankyou. If anything I try to spread awareness that it's a serious issue that can happen to anyone post partum.
Thanks friend, I totally understand your choice to be child free. 
I think I'm lucky because I'm a registered nurse so in that moment I realised, hey not a good thing to do ask for help, but many others wouldn't have that. 

Also I'm now happy with my 2 babes and a mildly well functional adult.
If it’s any help - I’m an ex CPS worker. 

This is the type of situation we would become involved in and what we would do is to create a safety plan, which is exactly what you’ve done. We would canvass safe people who are able to help and either have them care for the baby for the interim or to agree to stay with mom and baby and supervise them until Mom gets the help she needs.

I’m also not saying what’s been said is “ok” by any means but it is “normal” in the context of PPD and PPA for mothers to say and think awful things due to their mental state and feeling overwhelmed. I really hope your wife is able to get the help she needs. 

Also for what it’s worth if I was a CPS worker involved in this scenario I would be calling you and telling you you need to take some time off and be at home - I read your comments saying you’re trying to get home from being out of town, just wanted to reinforce that this is absolutely a scenario where you should take time off to be at home for support if at all possible.
What about your wife?
I completely agree. Sounds like a sus guy.
Generally EMDR is only done after the patient develops a good base of coping mechanisms through regular talk therapy. And it absolutely can be used to treat sexual trauma, as long as those precautions are in place. But it’s not for everybody, and like most types of therapy it’s very common for things to get worse before they get better.
Interesting. I'm definitely not a therapist, but I have a good friend who used it to process child and adult sexual assault trauma. It took her from trauma blackouts with significant lost time to no more blackouts. It was done slowly over three years, but for her, it worked really well.
I’m currently doing EMDR for trauma that has nothing to do with anything sexual. It’s been extremely effective and life changing
It’s actually more common than you’d expect, except nobody really talks about it. PPD and PPP can cause extreme emotional changes which require intensive therapy and most likely medical support to overcome. Please don’t think that your wife is a bad person, or is failing at motherhood. Her body and brain chemicals have just been through something that is massively traumatizing, and now she is dealing with lack of sleep, high amounts of physical and mentally stress, and taking care of a PERSON who has no personality yet and cries all the time. Your wife is dealing with a serious mental health issue, but she is still the person you love. She needs support, she needs treatment, she needs to know that is OK to not be ok. With proper treatment she can get better. 

And once your child grows a bit and starts developing a personality, there’s an extremely good chance that one day it will just click for her and she will love him. But that can’t be forced, it needs to happen naturally.
Nothing “happened” per se but a mental break that’s fairly common. What happened was giving birth and essentially a hormonal equivalent to being on 300 birth control pills to zero in a couple days, coupled with pre-existing mental health conditions, sudden enormous anxiety and pressure of parenthood, and a ton of nutrients having been and being pulled from her body. She’s also going through this *alone* 

You need to get home, now- and you need to not leave her alone with the baby until the post partum psychosis has passed. This is non-negotiable. If you absolutely have to go on work trips then baby needs to be with your mother the entire time and she can’t be left with the baby unsupervised with you gone. 

Please bear in mind this is not her, and this will pass with medication and time. It happened to my best friend and it took a few months and then one day like magic she literally just snapped out of it- granted she had shaved her head, taken their baby, and moved several states away declaring she was a lesbian. I’ll never forget the phone call when she came out of it. She thought she had ruined her entire life. She didn’t. They’re now an incredibly happy family and she had another baby and had a full plan and went on medication as soon as the baby was born. She couldn’t nurse but it never happened again. 

You can not leave right now. And that’s okay. Even if you leave, she can not take the baby from your mother and have baby unsupervised. It’s that serious. You guys are gonna be fine and she’s gonna love that baby so much when she’s herself again. She’ll snap from this to being a protective mama tiger.
PPD can cause a lot of sudden mental changes, even when in recovery. Intrusive thoughts are common and often very intense. It's a very good sign your wife told you about it before anything terrible happened. She may need more intensive intervention for the time being but that's hard to say before she's able to talk about the situation with the therapist. Good luck and don't forget to take care of yourself too
I have been through a similar situation.  Get professional help immediately.  For both of you. If needed a 2-3 week stay at a facility will do amazing things for your mental and physical well-being.
Therapy can't help this. 

Her brain chemistry is fucked up. She needs way more medical help than bi weekly therapy. 

Emergency Room. Immediately.
I’m so sorry. It honestly will probably resolve, but I cannot imagine how hard this is for you both.
You’re out of town. You have no credibility. This is on you alone.
When it's to the point she said what she said to you it means it is time for emergency room!  As in they admit her for treatment for a week or so and help her!  Not just therapy.  We all know what leaving a baby in a hot car does.  It kills them.  She admitted to thinking about murdering!  That is er level time dude!  She needs at least some temporary meds and help until she feels herself again!
It's a roller coaster bro. You just have to decide if you have the mental and emotional strength to stay on the ride.  Traditional wedding vows are "in sickness and in health". It sounds like she is sick. it won't  be easy, but, it may be worth it.
Most women who have dealt with PPD say that once it lifts they will bond to the child just fine without extra help. Of course... sometimes it never happens, but then the cause is seldom ppd.
Until you can get a treatment plan that works, I would highly suggest a limit of 2-3 hours solo, especially with a new mom with PPD. If teething/fussy - zero alone time until the PPD starts to lift. Go on FMLA if you need too for the first few months to support her. Do you go to her psychiatrist appointments? Are you in couples counseling? Have you engaged a doula service to help with night time care and any resources to keep up with household duties? I would definitely share that information with her treatment team. It sounds very much like she’s isolated. I would highly recommend an individual therapist for both of you and a competent couples counselor to work through the stressors. 
Too bad about what your wife wants at this point.  She has experienced extreme psychosis and fantasizes about harming (or killing) your son.  Get her into treatment asap whether she likes it or not.  Find someone who can help you on a more permanent basis whether she likes it or not. STEP UP SIR, no excuses now!
I perhaps should of elaborated my granddaughters birth too. She was 11 weeks premature and my daughter was very poorly post birth too.

A very testing time and the days where she actually said I can't bond with her, I feel nothing were shocking to hear but it really did pass before baby was around 2.

Grand daughter is 13 now and they are like best mates peas in a pod
I think the comment you're responding to is meant to reassure OP, not telling him to be casual about this but to share that it can absolutely be a phase. That isn't to say she doesn't need psychiatric help, but that with help, it will get better. That's how I interpreted it, anyway.
I apologise to you fbta, if you think I've caused any upset or distress and I assure you I only sought to let op that he isn't alone and this has happened to others and it has passed. I know first hand.
I did however send a pm to op and offer a full and heart felt apologie for any offence you feel I may of caused.

I appreciate your honest opinion.

Ty.
This could be because of the shame and guilt associated. A mother should instantly love her child society tells us. But it’s not always the case especially when mental illness is involved. If it is what she is suffering from, then it is potentially life threatening and I would urgently try to get help for her and also protect your child.
Are you sure you are not just hearing what she says, you are actually listening to her?

And not interrupting and validating her thoughts?
Proof of what? This isn't a police investigation. The doctors will take the texts seriously. They want to help her before she does something.

If she is telling you these things then she isctrusting you to help her. Worry about your feelings later. Get her to the hospital
If you don't love your wife enough to get her the help that she needs then do you really love her?

Who cares if your wife is mad at you? You do realize the alternative is a dead child and/or wife, correct? 

Your post history says you work EMS. You should know better. Get your wife the help she needs or don't you dare come here looking for sympathy during the funeral
Your wife is in desperate need of immediate psychiatric attention. She is in a state of psychosis and your child is not safe in her care.  If you try to get a routine appointment with a psychiatrist, it may be weeks before she can be seen.  This is an emergency.  Take her to the ER.
That is unfortunate, and I'm sorry you both have to endure ppd both from her perspective and yours. There is some good advice that has been offered so far. It's overwhelming to think there are so many resources out that it should be an easy decision,  but is it ethical? we all know when we have to make the right decision even if it is the hardest we should anyway(moral compass). Emotional is the issue it can distort facts with being in denial. I understand that you would not want to go so harsh and contact cps on your wife and she think you betrayed her or ruined trust that she is not able to work through this without some serious choices that need to be made, but some decisions no matter what will be invetiable right? Your son needs you to be the logical parent and make a decision that will not jeopardize his safety. whether or not this is a severe case or not, or it is so severe, will be a conversation with you and  your wife along with professionals that have all of your family best interest in mind. Not every doctor is a great one, but there are amazing physicians out there. You have to base your decision on what is factual leading you without denial of what she said may or may not be a real threat either way its a serious one, and the likelihood of not doing anything could lead to some outcome that will be regretful. What are the facts so far. If she is home with him during the day, is she caring for herself too after the baby? I'm talking basic hygiene. Was she able to at least take a shower bath and get some sleep or eat? Is she isolated all the time with the baby or  any company over to not feel so alone? Is the house a little dirty, or is depression looking like it hit every inch of the house? There are some examples of someone mentality that could suggest your next move whe. You speak to a doctor. Are you able to take time off and be honest with your supervisor as far as options like.fmla which would be the best as far as taking a good amount of time off to dedicate to getting your wife the help she needs and doing research on how to deal with this as your wife is dealing with the ppd. Finding support in any way besides your mom alone. [Takes a village] in which is true. Developing a plan that works in the best interest of the child only. I say that because he does not have a say so in this clearly which is why if a hard choice has to be made it is because based on the ppd symptoms an as evidence you have seen will be only on you unfortunately because your wife is not capable to do it alone for your child. you.know this because of the statement of harming her child eliminates the possibility that she couldn't make a healthy decision instead of calling for medical help at that time and chose go call you and relay her frustration and stated she wanted to cause harm. without being in her right mind, she couldn't call you and say I really need help,  I'm scared for our son, and I need to get help now and check myself in a hospital.  Unless she said that or anything close, then you know now if you need to make a decision it's because your son needs you to be the logical one that comes from a loving place and needed to happen whether your wife is able to see that now or later. Best luck to you and your family, OP.  You can get through this!
Yeah some ppl should not have internet ^^
Appart from medical help, maybe she needs someone to help her take care of him more.
I second this she needs medication and therapy to gain control of these feelings . It’s nothing like going thru post partum
This OP this! This is not something that talk therapy or CBT or mindfulness ot any of that stuff can fix. (No hate on these techniques but this is so dangerously beyond that). She needs medical attention asap.
Yes.  Sounds like pyschosis.
I agree! Psychosis could be an issue and she needs expert care.
ADDITIONALLY could you hire a Doula for the next 6months? A woman who would come care for both mother and baby? 
It would be better imho if it were a professional and not your mother - which could trigger personal issues between your two very special women.
I keep having flashbacks to that woman who sawed her infant's arms off with a steak knife. Fuck. Yeah, skip the therapist, call whoever you can to keep her away from your son until he's safe.
THIS! Postpartum psychosis is more common than people think 1-2 out of every 1000 mothers who give birth develop it. There is help for her out there, ensure you find it.
Thank you so much for not demonizing a person with mental health issues and urging for her to get help
You forgot the bit he’s out of town, the exact scenario you read about, she is obviously not coping and the husband goes out of town …
When I first read his post, I instantly thought of Lindsay Clancy, the Registered Nurse who was charged with murdering her 3 young children. She seems like a genuinely good person who was failed by the mental health community when she needed help the most! As a society, we need to do better to prevent such tragedies from happening again!
100% should be treated as a medical emergency.
OBGYN will tell her to go to the emergency room. i see this all the time at work unfortunately.
Most places have an emergency petition that he can call. Really, if he can convince her to go voluntarily, that is better. But she needs to go to the ER immediately.
This is a good point. The OB/GYN can quickly assess her and facilitate her going to the hospital. Hopefully, this will allow for the OP get home and meet them there.
Honestly my thoughts exactly because OP posted this in 2 subreddits. Benefit of the doubt is that OP wants more advice? But there clearly a crisis going on at home and it feels very suspicious that he isn’t rushing home, called his mother to deal with it. Fair enough maybe OP is busy at work/far trip/ no idea … but what did it take to escalate to this point? It reads like mom wasn’t getting the support she needed this entire time.
Love how it’s about him Having help with the baby while she’s incapacitated ….. but he left an overwhelmed mum on her own, but yeah, let’s get some child care assistance for him till she’s fixed
Better help would be harmful in this situation. It’s way, way above their pay grade and this is an emergency.
Yeah okay. The level of education and training was my point the entire time. A therapist has very little training compared to a psychologist. One is a doctor trained to deal with life threatening thoughts and behaviors while one has training that varies so greatly that the training could be anywhere from a few week program to a few years. The qualification of a therapist to be the lead for an issue this great isn't there.
Can I ask what you said when you called the urgent care clinic? I know those calls can be something someone might want to do but are too scared to explain what’s going on. Thanks for sharing by the way, so glad you were able to get support and make it out of that
Just chiming in to share my experience when I had PPD. My son didn't sleep, an average night looked like him needing to be rocked to sleep and then held for around 20 minutes until he was in a deep sleep. I had to move his so slowly and gently when transferring him to his crib or he'd wake up and I'd have to start all over again. Even when everything went to plan and I got him in his crib he'd wake again within max two hours, often less. This went on for 14 months, so to say I was sleep deprived is an understatement and it resulted in me feeling a lot of very negative thoughts about him. I had thoughts of shaking him, throwing him into the wall, driving us both into oncoming traffic. I didn't want to do any of these things but the thoughts still creeped in, especially when he was crying nonstop. I was beyond terrified to tell anyone at the time and thank god I was able to suffer through it until he started sleeping better, he's two now and I have the best relationship with him but I still feel so guilty when I think back at how I used to speak to him in those moments and I wish for his sake I had reached out for help. It's a relief to hear that CPS works with the Mom in these situations rather than just jumping to remove the child, that was the fear that kept me silent.
Did you see the part where she is fantasizing about killing him? I think she needs a break from being a single mom (dad says he is away at work), then a psych eval and possible meds or med adjustment. IANAD, this just seems like common sense.

Edit: yes, now I got it, wasn’t crystal clear.
Oh! That is really interesting! My friend had done about 10 years of therapy (off and on, mostly off) prior to EMDR.
do you think it can be helpful for social anxiety or feeling bad emotions that makes you uncomfortable such as being envy?
My mom told me she went through this. She said, looking back, she thought it was brought on by the changing hormones and my dad often being gone traveling for work - so she was home alone with a new baby and a toddler. She said one day she was carrying me down the stairs and she was just so exhausted she heard a voice telling her, "Throw the baby down the stairs". She said she kind of snapped back after a second and was so scared by what was happening that she sat on the stairs and scooted down while holding me, because she didn't trust herself. 

She was able to get help (meds) and my grandma moved in to help fill in because my dad was away on business pretty often and my mom was alone and exhausted.
Absolutely this too. Therapy is good and helpful, but with warped brain chemistry its about as useful as someone screaming swimming instructions at you from the shore when you are already drowning.    Most people will drown unless given a flotation device in that situation. Meds are the floatation device.
What?? It’s carrying their child that’s caused her mental state to be what it is and you reply as if he should consider whether he wants to stay or not? Why would that even be something that one would consider?!
Are you for real right now? His wife admitted to wanting to harm their child after struggling with PPD and OC downplayed the severity of the situation, even calling it "a magical time" and you think it's reassuring? There is nothing reassuring about their comment, even if it was intended that way. The reality of the situation is that babies die far more often than they should because of people doing the exact same thing and telling the struggling family "it will pass, it will pass" from the boat while they're drowning. Come on now.

Aside from that, they're not even spouting off correct information.

Intent doesn't equal impact. I didn't even question their intent, I questioned the bullshit they were spewing and how they were not qualified to theorize on this as they aren't in OP's wife's medical care team and have no idea what's really going on.
Lmao this is so weird
i'm sorry WHAT??? do you have a source on this??? i believe you; i am just morbidly curious....
No they don't! That number is off.
🥹
He might have had to go out of town for work and if he didn't he wouldn't have a job anymore and then that creates even more problems. He is asking for help be nice.
This made me sad too. Wife obviously has PPD, has admitted she doesn’t feel attached. Not the best time to go out of town, really!

Because things like this happen. It’s crazy how many people just think “oh it couldn’t happen to me!” despite the obvious warning signs.
Did you miss the part where the baby is with his mother?
There's always gotta be that one "it's always the man's fault" goblin in the comments...
But they need to know all the same. I'd still call, even on my way to ER.
Oh 100% she never got the support.

Imagine having a newborn, PPD, and your husband is happy to travel and only calls his Mom if you threaten to kill the baby? The dude is upset his wife isn't functioning as promised, in no way is he prioritizing his family. If he actually cared he would be taking a leave from work.
I mean... he's still having to work - or try to - while this is going on. The help is for both of them, not just him. Everybody is doing the best they can with what they know and have at this point as I see it.
Most typical reddit argumenter i've seen this week
When they invent teleportation let me know!
I think you’re missing the point that she’s getting  help to start from someone she already trusts, not that she’s ONLY getting help from them. I’m not arguing about the difference of training between therapists and psychiatrists.
Oh sorry I just understood your question, I just said I'm a post partum woman with a 3 month old and 2 year old and I'm thinking of hurting us all and I need help, and gave the address. Everyone was so kind and understanding.
Of course, I'm located in Australia and there are urgent care clinics in larger towns that are for people who need urgent care but not severe enough to go to the emergency department. Not sure we're Ur located but hope that helps!
Sleep deprivation can wreck someone's mind into thinking the most hideous things, it's not your fault and you were very strong for being able to take it on until the end. I wish there'd be more normalized help for parents, especially for moms who just gave birth to the baby, that way you could have asked for help way sooner and not have gone "almost crazy" during that time with all the guilty and self blame you still feel right now
OP needs to go home and support his wife. If she’s suffering from PPD and has already expressed thoughts of harming her own child, I wouldn’t want for things to get worse and for her to want to harm herself too. This is a family emergency and OP needs to get his butt home now and take FMLA and get his wife urgent help while his child stays with a trusted adult outside of the household.
They’re asking if someone is with their wife, or if she’s by herself. A lot of times when someone has these feelings about their babies, they also have them about themselves. If for no other reason than they feel guilty for the thoughts they’re having about the baby. So she absolutely shouldn’t be left alone to sit in her thoughts either. She needs a lot of support rn from all angles.
The question was asking about the wife, as in, is your wife being helped while you figure out how to get home. Is she safe for the time being.
I’m not a doctor or anything, but that’s how my therapist explained it to me when she mentioned it as part of my long term treatment plan for SA related PTSD. But I’m in one of those “off” phases myself right now so I can’t say if it’s actually effective, I didn’t get that far.
I do! It helps you understand what caused you to have social anxiety, which helps you control it better. I just finished my sessions for trauma and my next sessions are going to help with my insecurities/jealousy issues
It's very common, much more than people realize. I'm glad your mom was able to get the assistance she needed
I think they were revering to the time they are currently in it seem like where their children are grown and the able have turned in their situation and it is the father who is feeling detached from the teen children that are constantly breaking things in the house the father probably has to fix. Yes it is a bit of a joke about a different situation and a serious one but I think they were just trying to help. 😊 some people cope with things by using a dark humor about it…
https://www.9news.com/article/news/woman-accused-of-cutting-off-babys-arms-wanted-to-give-the-baby-to-god/73-344573750
Yeah, there’s also another mom who went into Post partum psychosis and stabbed her infant baby in the kitchen and wasn’t even aware what happened… it’s on YouTube and Facebook it’s really fucked up. She wasn’t even supposed to be around the baby because of her mental health issues, but her mom was there and thought she was well enough to see the baby…
What are the numbers then?
Here you go: https://www.mghp3.org/post/new-research-identifying-the-pathophysiology-of-postpartum-psychosis
“Man should quit his job and help!” Is a take.
Pretty sure most people don't go out of town for funsies leaving their family at home. It's usually work.

Yeah he needs to be home and help, but he didn't know the situation was so bad until she told him. Depending where he is, leaving instantly may not even be possible.
Nope, didn’t miss that at all, he only sorted help after she was about to snap, I also love the bit where he blames arguments on her being ‘overstimulated’….
She still needs help and he still needs to be home with his family in this difficult time.
Right ?? How tf did someone manage to put blame on the husband holy
yes, they do, but they can’t do anything immediate and they may have to just leave a message with a triage department that won’t respond for 6+ hours.
What does a low grade online therapy site with kids straight out of college and zero experts have to do with teleportation? She’s not even in the mindset to get herself the help she needs right now. He needs to take her to the hospital, not send her through an annoying condescending website with happy pictures and quizzes and a different therapist every week because they pay them so little. Better help is bad, cerebral was so bad people died and they had multiple class action lawsuits. (that cerebral lost)
She’s already in therapy. She needs professional inpatient care.
I didn't miss the point I just don't agree with you.
I’m so glad you called them. ❤️
Thank you, I appreciate your kind words. To give some credit, I live in the UK and my health visitor was so kind and helpful anytime I did reach out but I was so genuinely terrified to tell her the whole situation because I thought they'd take him from me but in hindsight (and with the power of good sleep again) I know that's not what would have happened. I sincerely hope OP's wife gets the support she needs, it's not a nice experience to have to go through.
This makes sense, I agree.
I got it.
Okay and? How does this address OPs issue? How does this change the fact that their answer was a bunch of bullshit? How does their downplaying of the situation help? Kinda seems like some of y'all do not understand the severity of the situation OP is in and when it's appropriate to chime in with their dark humour and jokes.

So beyond bizarre.
I wish I didn't read the comment about the arms. Did not read the article, still sorry I read the comment. And even more sorry to my soul that that happened
That poor baby 💔 imagine the pain
That’s the impression I got. We’re taught to trust healthcare professionals. Before he left, he likely felt reassured enough by their “progress reports” to safely leave town. Also, we don’t know their situation. Traveling may be a required part of his work.
That may be her own words for why they're arguing. I've told my husband the same - I get overstimulated with certain things going on. A baby crying could overstimulate anyone...but she could also be neurodivergent.

You seem to be looking at this in the least charitable way possible to OP, but I don't think there is enough context to assume he is uncaring or should just know how to handle this situation. People need to vent. You don't intervene every time someone expresses frustration or helplessness. It's not always clear where the line is.
But bills don’t pay themselves, if he comes home no one is working
As I said better help is pretty bad
I must have been lucky actually finding a real therapist with 20+ years of experience on BetterHelp when I used it.
I mean you ain’t helping either lol
The thing you said you were mad about was explained to you so you go on some other rant… you just mad honey
The genuine cases of insanity can still (even for heavy true crime consumers) hit really hard because it's like a nightmare that anyone would do that, but you're awake, and it's real.

That's why there are so many people making sure OP knows he's not overreacting and he needs to act ASAP to help.
I can’t see where I am making any assumptions! All comes from his post, I’m sure he’s a great hubby and dedicated father when she’s not overstimulated and he is not away for work
He should be able to take some leave time from his job. 


Or, he can stay at work and end up with a dead baby. Let's ask Andrea Yates if she thinks her husband's shift were more important than his family.
Your therapist with 20 years of experience makes 20-38 dollars an hour when they could be making over a hundred? And let’s not pretend she’s helping the less fortunate. It’s 60-100$ a week for better help. 

Either they’re not a great therapist, or they don’t have 20 years of experience and clientele. No experienced therapist would willingly work for $30 average an hour for a company with hundreds of millions in profit when they could be making a decent wage.
I don't use them anymore, but I was paying them $300/month and seeing her 2-3 times. I thought she was getting better pay than that.
No, that's why it's an online company and not a real clinical practice.

You pay $300/month for server fees, corporate profit, youtuber ads, and to pay the wages of every therapist on the site, majority of whom aren't adequately trained or experienced.

I'm sure her profile saying she has 20 years experience got her more patients and made people trust her, but it very likely isn't true, or is exaggerated like she got her degree 20 years ago and sporadically practiced.
https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/s/DoZAgQuE48

Here’s a Reddit post about working for better help.
My(28m) sister(24) told me something very disturbing
She's a police officer. I visited her at her apartment and found her having beer with some friends. They were all laughing and when I asked them what it's all about, my sister told me she hooked up with my best friend(28m). This came as a huge shock since he is devoted to his girlfriend(28).

I asked her how it happened and she said she threatened to plant drugs at his place and frame him as a drug dealer if he didn't have sex with her. So he did.

The next day, I talked to her when she was sober and she confirmed that she did do that stuff. It's just completely stumped me and now I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to process this information. How? What do I do?

UPDATE : After reading some suggestions, I texted my sister to try to gather some evidence. She claimed she did it because she is in love with my friend. I will try to see what I can do next to get her to say more over texts.
She didn’t have sex with him, she raped him via the threat of blackmail which is coercion. Since she's in the police, there's basically absolutely no point reporting her without any solid evidence. If she's willing to admit it in person, maybe she's dumb enough to be caught over text? Or see if it's legal where you are to record conversations. Ask her about it as though you think it's gossip, see how much she spills. Once you've acquired the necessary evidence and admittance of guilt, go to your friend and turn it over to him to see what he wants to do with it, if anything, and leave it up to him whether he wants to go through the justice system.
Your sister's a psycho and needs to be stopped. If she's doing this shit to your friends, just what is she doing to citizens everyday while she's at work. 

Try to tape her talking about what she did, and then report her.
That’s rape
Your sister raped your friend. Not only that, but she used her power as a police officer to do so, which makes the whole thing even more disturbing. 

Normally, I would say that you should follow your friend's lead on whether to report, but given what occurred, I think you need to regardless. I know it may be hard to wrap your head around, but your sister is dangerous. If she can do this to your friend, then she'll do it to other people. People who are extremely vulnerable will be at risk with her having a police badge.
Your sister is a criminal, she’s a public threat, like wtf?! Dude, I know it’s family but you gotta do what you have to do.
As if the rape weren’t bad enough, I wonder how many innocent people she’s planted drugs on?? This is nauseating. What a POS.
Your sister coerced a man via blackmail to fuck her....

Your sister is a rapist with a badge and should be fired.
That's rape. She raped him. She's fucking disgusting.
That’s rape.
ACAB, I guess
Sounds like police behavior to me (many of them) what’s to be surprised about? I’m sure your sis has also kicked a few people for “resisting” before too
Omg that is terrifying and why I don’t trust anyone not even officers. Report report report.
I wanna know how many other people she's done this to. Because he is not the first. She raped him, blackmailed him, and got what she wanted using her "power or authority". 

You need to report her. Talk to your friend and tell him you know, and that you'll be there for him. This is not okay!
Yeah, this is horrific. This is what we think of the absolute worst police officers doing. And I am even more dismayed because it’s a woman I just expect more overall unfortunately.

Besides from breaking her code of ethics as a police officer and other criminal acts, this was also sexual abuse.

This behavior is on the narcissistic/sociopathic spectrum. 

Now that you are involved, get some legal advice from a criminal lawyer (free consultation,) because now… You know know about the crime and legally it’s your responsibility to report it. Failure to report a criminal offense is also a felony from what I understand.

Keeping quiet is the worst thing you can do. Not only will it tear down overtime, but think about what it’s doing to your best friend.

I would definitely get some legal advice. This is important. Your sister kind of sounds dangerous to be honest.

Tread carefully and be careful. Watch your back with her.
She raped him. She used her position of power (cop) over him (general public) to blackmail/coerce him into sex/rape him. Disgusting.
How is a 24 y/o allowed to become a police officer anyway? Their brains aren't even fully developed. 
You need to get her confession. Either by text or record her talking about it on your phone (before you do that look up UK laws around single party consent for recordings - make sure that’s something that would hold up in court). If you take this to the police without any evidence, they won’t take it seriously. She is one of their own. And I know she is your sister so I’m sure this is very disturbing for you - but she is a threat to society. If she’s done this to your best friend, you can be damn sure she’s done it to other people. 

You need to report her. Think of all of the people she has/and will hurt in the future. And this isn’t like stealing a little extra cash from evidence - it’s RAPE. Please do the right thing and turn her in. But get her to admit it to you again, optimally over messaging… 

Good speed. This is a tough situation.
What the fuck is wrong with your sister?? I'm so sorry, OP
Your sister is the reason we don't trust cops
Can you convince your friend to make a report? If he makes one and puts you in as a witness then surely something will have to be investigated. Something needs to be done or else she will do something again, whether it be threats, false accusations or rape. Girls corrupt. I would also try and attempt for written or verbal admittance to the crime, if verbal make sure they confirm their identity too by using their name when talking to them
Belongs in jail for such criminal activity
Please tell me you recorded this and brought it to her chief?
Ask your friend if that’s how it happened
This is why acab and FTP. She’s a psycho and I hope she gets what she deserves.
Even the ones you're related to, ACAB.
Cool story by the way, I don't believe it for a second.
ACAB
And that's why we say : ACAB
Cop being a cop lol dont matter the sex. Horrible
Please stop her. She’s a threat and harmful to the people around her.
She probably sets people up on the daily...
This saddens me: One person using their position or authority over another to coerce the desired behavior in others.  It's sick regardless of gender.
This is disgusting. She used threats and coercive behaviour to exploit sexual favours. 

Gather all the information you can and go directly to the police. Ideally, her direct manager took. 

And go see your bestie, he was sexually assaulted and she's laughing it up, he will need you.
I agree, this is rape, its so wrong, that poor guy. 

That poor girlfriend of his too. She need to find out. I'm surprised no one has really mentioned her and how this also impacts their relationship.
Your sister is a rapist and a corrupt cop. Do right by your friend and the other people she will harm. She doesnt seem remorseful, she will abuse her power again.
I'm sorry your sister is a crooked cop.
Wonder who else she's done that, too. Fuking disgusting. Your sister is a trash human being.

Report her when you have all the evidence.
Have you talked to your friend? He was raped. And sadly, society isn't always understanding towards male rape victims. I'm scared he will internalize this and blame himself. Are you in a position to be open to him and support him?

Your sister is disgusting, and it's scary to me that she's so open about it. And that no one in her life so far has called her out, her friends are disgusting too. You're a good dude :)
Personally I would report her to her supervisor. As much as it hurts. But that is a crime she committed. it is not right as a police officer. She is whatever call a dirty cop. And no one wants those type on the police force. It’s shameful
Your sister raped him
Your sister used her power as a cop to rape your best friend. I’m sorry but you need to get her to admit that again on camera and report it, becuase she is a monster.
The glaring fact is that she is not FIT to be a police office. To have this kind of mindset is horrifying as fuck.
Help and support the friend with what he wants to do with reporting or not etc. Put safety measures in place with sister and then avoid her.
I have a sister who is a cop too and if she told me something like that I don't think I could ever see her in a positive light again I probably couldn't bring myself to talk to her anymore. I can understand if you don't want to tell everyone that your little sister is a rapist and possibly send her prison for it so no judgemnt from me either way ( not that the judgment of a stranger on the internet matters).
But the truth of the matter is she's a rapist. If someone else had done that, threatened to frame someone and have them sent to prison if they didn't have sex with them (especially if it was a guy threatening a girl) im sure she would be arresting them with enthusiasm. The fact that she's a cop and the victim was a guy doesn't make it not rape. IT just means he's certainly not going to admit to anyone he was raped, and even if he did, nothing would happen because she's a cop. 
I can empathize but I can't really offer any advice. 
And the fact she was laughing with her friends about it later is fucking crazy. Like she either doesn't even realize what she did is rape, or doesn't care. Since she works in law enforcement though, I'd say she likely knows what it was she did.
I feel so bad for that guy!!! She raped him.
This seems like something you have to talk with your best friend with as well as get a voice recording of your sister admitting it. Don't go to the police before you get permission from your friend because as guys and as his best friend there is close to no evidence they can get from him as well as that she can flip the script and say they had a affair and was just scared of his gf finding out and leaving him. You need to know whether or not your friend calculated that sleeping with her once was inconsequential as opposed to heading to jail. Prevent your sister from ever being in the same room as him. 

some guys love their gf but they desperately don't want their image to change so unless he's tells you he wants to report you might do more harm then good.
Is your sister also a rape victim or is she just butt-assed ugly.To threaten to ruin someone’s life unless they fuck you is something another rape victim bent on revenge on all men would do. She may have joined the force with getting justice in mind. If she’s not attractive, she may have realized that she needs to force what she can’t get a volunteer for. I would turn the table on her and get her confession on tape and then use it to make her get help or else.

Let her walk in the shoes she makes other people wear. If she kills you, at least you don’t have to worry about keeping her rapey ways a secret and devolving into an accomplice. 

Touch base with your friend first and make sure you’re not being played here.

I would silently separate myself from her too. Especially if she’s not a victim and is just butt-assed ugly and a power tripped sociopath. Don’t let her tell you things. What you don’t know will keep you safe.

Don’t tell your folks anything until they’re on their deathbeds but probably not there either. They’ll find out on their departure flight or shortly thereafter.

Remember that karma has a hard on to right the wrongs of lies and it always starts with the liar.
Report her.
You should talk to ur friend and get his side of the story as well
oh my god i hope your friend is okay. your sister is a piss poor excuse of human, you’re doing the right thing trying to gather evidence to report her
You need to report her asap. She’s using her power as a police officer to literally rape people, and also… who guarantees she won’t do it again to someone else because “she’s in love with them”???
You should talk to your friend and his girlfriend you should also go to IAD and tell them about it because your sister is no longer a cop she is a sex offender
reminds me of how i still feel about my eldest sister, who baby-trapped a man and eventually left him for a man who promised marriage, yet who refuses to get off her high horse whenever speaking about anybody else's life.

disgusting, pious behavior. as if our sister being overweight is anybody's business when she broke a family she FORCED into existence.
Report her. She’s a rapist yuck
That poor guy. 

Your sister deserves prison, like any other rapist. 

How scary that she is part of the police force! I hope everybody has the courage to bring this all to light and justice is served.

Please do what is right.
Maybe ask your friend privately if this is true. 

Imagine if roles were reversed and she was a man doing this to a woman. The outrage. 

She’s a scumbag. That’s rape and abuse of power.
Everyone gave good advice. Find a good lawyer if you can gather enough evidence. Never trust a cop. They will protect their sleazy, predatory, rapist friends at the drop of a hat. 

Stay safe, OP. I hope you and your friend will be okay, and I'm sorry you have the misfortune to being from the same gene pool as your sister. The best thing you can do is just keeping him safe and if possible, once you get evidence to help your case, tell your folks and other people you trust to not narc to your sister.
RAPE!! SHE RAPED YO BOII
Yo sister dirty dirty. Ewwww!
She raped him dog
Dude. 
That wasn't sex that was rape. Via blackmail which is coercion.

You need to not only tell him that, you need to record her saying it or get her to confirm it in text. 
Then you need to have him press charges. 

Your sister is a vile disgusting rapist. 

If you don't do something you will be just as bad as her.
I am sorry if that hurts you but I am BEYOND SICK AND TIRED of CRIMINAL cops getting away with abusing the system and people NOT getting justice at the hands of these vile disgusting excuses for human beings. 

I am TIRED of people NOT standing up to these vile disgusting abusers.

How many other people is she actively hurting with her CRIMINAL behavior?
That's really disturbing. That's rape. You need to talk to your friend asap and report her.
There’s a state of federal law enforcement agency ready and willing to address this misconduct - do your research Mf fnd put who
People like this make me sick. Thats why we humans invented bullets. Take this comment as a grain of salt. But if that were me and my friend. She would be in for a hell whole of a life haha. Shes also not to bright.l for a cop. Must have been not what you know but who you blow. Shes trash.
Sounds insanely far fetched.
She raped him and she will do it again. Go talk to your friend and tell him you know what happened and you want to help him report the crime so she doesn’t try to rape him again.
Pretty sure that’s a felony and constitutional violation. Think long and hard about your next steps. I’m not saying you should protect her just because she’s your sister, but this may take months or years to resolve. One of two things will happen, there will be an internal investigation and she’ll get fired/resign or the FBI gets involved.
Did you speak to your best friend? What did he say about this whole thing? Like everyone else said…that’s rape + blackmail. I’d like to know what he says happened.
wow thats rape
All y'all idiots believing this is well... Idiotic 😂😂 I've seen this post or very VERY similar atleast 7 times 😂😂 gullible cunts
I think we all appreciate it's your sister, and you are probably 50/50 on doing anything about it. But you deserve to know your sister threatened and coerced this man into sex. Under the law, it is definitely 100% rape.

If it was a male officer doing it to a woman, we would all be screaming our heads off. Your sister in her position of power is a threat to the general public.
Call Internal Affairs and have a talk with them. This is deeply disturbing.

Your sister the cop engaged in extortion and rape.

I am so sorry. This must have been devastating and sickening to hear.
Your sister is a bonafide rapist
This is absolutely appalling and disgusting. Report her anonymously to not your police force but whoever is above the precinct (she'll have lots of buddies who may cover it up) Get any evidence you can and have your friend press charges for rape by a police officer. Coercion is rape.
thats fucked
Gather info, report her, talk to your best friend and show support
ACAB 🐽
Your sister raped your friend, get her to admit it, act cool about it so you can have evidence of it, and give the evidence to your friend.
i wouldnt touch this with a 10ft pole. have your bestfriend contact a lawyer and have them work this out and gather evidence on their side. if you must be called upon to testify then do it but please dont put yourself in harms way.
dont forget to take screenshots and back up to cloud/dropbox/email whatever if she makes you delete the messages and screenshots
You need to report your sister to the police. For being a rapist. Delay much longer and you could be considered an accomplice after the fact
your sister is a rapist. report her and see if your friend would be compliant to report as well.
Sex by coercion/manipulation/blackmail is RAPE.
The end
Your sister is a piece of shit. She needs to be reported for being in the position she’s in.
Big ups to you for coming forward and seeking advice for this situation. I know it must be difficult considering your sister is involved. Given her role in society, my opinion is that you should take things in the direction in which you plan. You're going to feel guilt at some point; it's inevitable. But you're not the one who performed those actions, someone else did; the fact that it's your sister doesn't change that. I wish you the best moving forward, man!
Wear a wire and see if you can get her to bring it up again
Tell her to give you a certain amount of money per month to keep your mouth shut. You don’t really want to ruin her life do you?
Just illustrating one more reason why cops suck. Obviously, the culture surrounding police officers is that they are above the law. It's gross and dangerous. Best of luck navigating this mess. I hope you address the issue and not be part of the problem by sweeping it under the rug. Accountability starts small in the overall big picture.
Get her confess again mic up now you blackmail your sister
Many of the answers here- while justified- could lead you down a road of becoming a target of the police- her friends. Be VERY careful!

I suggest that you have your friend report it. Provide all proof that you have to him, if you can get her to admit it over text, even better. 

If your friend doesn’t want to report it with your support, if you report it your friend may not support it. Then everyone will target you. 

Your sister is a rapist. Mentioning what she’s done over a family meal may make her realize how wrong she is, but again- be careful.
That's not sex, that's r@pe! You need to go see your best friend and support him because who else has she done this to?! The fact she's opening laughing with friends tells me she has a list of men she has raped and the control has gone to her head! She's an evil person, I know it's hard as she's your sister and you never expected this but do the right thing. Get your best friend into therapy, my fiance was repeatedly r@ped by his ex she tried to unalive him, would beat him and scream until he'd do it, he was terrified of her and they had a child together so she'd use him as a threat. He has CPTSD and still wakes up with nightmares of reliving those moments, he has been in different therapy and still waiting for more he was abused for 10 years by her. Please support your friend. Not to mention how many innocent people are in jail because of her then again getting r@ped by inmates! You have to help save those people! This isn't okay.
The fact that she has a friend group that can laugh about this with her. Do they say “Hail Hydra” at the start of all get togethers? This sounds like the plot to a disturbing movie
Wow, that’s a really intense situation. It’s understandable that you’re feeling stumped and unsure of what to do. It sounds like your sister’s actions were incredibly serious and harmful. You might want to consider talking to your friend about what happened and see how he wants to handle it. It could also be important to seek legal advice or involve authorities to ensure that this situation is addressed properly. This is definitely not something to take lightly.
It’s only a matter of time before you become the target... You've received a lot of advice, use it and document every single conversation. Things could turn against you at any moment, and you could find yourself in big trouble in an instant. Good luck, and on behalf of everyone, thank you for not letting such a sick mind roam free!
Yeah she should be fired. Doesn’t deserve to be a police officer
Obviously pursue this in whatever legal route you can… if it doesn’t go anywhere legally AND you have your friends consent, I’d honestly take this to the news so they can draw attention to it. Again, you need your friends permission to release this publicly. If he agrees I’d blow it up if it’s not handled by the police/courts. If you do have to take it public, before you do so get statements from your phone provider that show those texts are from xxx number. It would hopefully force the DA to charge. Not an officer or lawyer so take my advice with a grain of salt… what I can say with absolute certainty is your sister is evil
wtf is wrong with her? And for her to actually admit to a fucking crime while being a cop is crazy
my nigga your sister needs to go to jail that's crazy... since she's your sister I'd try to do some sort of intervention first and see how she reacts before reporting her
Wow isn’t that misuse of authority !!  Also threats and coercion ?  She needs to be reported and kicked out of the force
Not sure where you live BUT you could provide the info you have to Internal Affairs and let them look into it. They would keep it confidential and try to talk to the people involved. Though your friends may figure out who talked to them
Also, talk to your friend and let them know that you’re there for them if they want to talk. And that you believe they did nothing wrong, this is all your sister’s fault.
This is probably one of the most fucked up things I've read in awhile.
I don’t know who else needs to hear this since OP already found out the hard way: ACAB includes your sweet little sister even before you know it for a fact.
The police are the good guys! 😱
I’m also disturbed. Very disturbed.
This reminds me of a law and order svu episode where carisi's sisters brother is forced to have sex with his parole officer when she threatens to violate his drug tests by make them positive for drugs if he doesn't sleep with her. 


THIS IS RAPE , HE HAD BEEN RAPED AND HE IS SCARED. GO TO THE POLICE AND REPORT HER. HE CAN DO IT BECAUSE SHE HAD HIS HANDS TIED. BUT YOU CAN.
Man I wish a 28 year old female cop would blackmail me for sex.
Great cop.  NOT
I agree with other comments. 

And I think she thinks it's funny because a woman raping a man is considered less "serious" than the other way round, but it's definitely not. This is rape with blackmail.

Please, keep up updates on how it goes.
Your sister should not, let me repeat this, should NOT NOW OR EVER be in a position of power, because, clearly, she's abusing it. What else has she done, I'm wondering now? Report her as soon as you get enough evidence against her. What a fucking low individual. It wouldn't surprise me if she's fitted up poor souls, just because she can. Good luck love. I bet you're devastated upon discovering this. I feel for you, I truly do, but I know you'll do the right and moral thing. I'm so sorry that you've learned this. You must be in turmoil.
That's rape she needs to be held accountable
How cop of her
All cats are beautiful......
Nothing to add, much said by others already. Only curious if she always had weird behaviour already. 

This is horrible. 

Oh and: did you yell your friend you will help him? He must feel terrible. He should know he is not alone and you will back up for him if his girl finds out. He willbe so stressed knowing he cheated unvoluntary. Next to the rape feelings.
That's enough internet for today. That is disturbing as hell. This world sucks ass.
What she did is coercion and abuse of power and SA.
Not only would I 1000% report her to Her department, I would send it all in an email to her department lead and CC, the mayor and any other public official that you can find their information for online. That’s pretty much the only way to make sure that the police department doesn’t cover this up to protect their own… Because let’s be real, they do that all the time. If your sister doesn’t lose her job, I would take this to the press as well. I understand that it’s confusing because she’s your sister.… But this is the kind of thing you disowned family over.
You do know the right thing to do. You even contemplating or second thinking what to do shows your true heart.
damn bro ur sisters a rapist
Get your friend to go to the state police and file a rape report AND tell them that he is willing to do a polygraph and want her to do one also.
your sister is a pig rapist, and you need to continue gathering evidence to report her. doubt anything’ll actually happen from it, but hopefully she actually faces consequences for her inhumanity
You really have to get the premise of how this came about. Was she joking when she said  this to your best friend? Did he know this? Maybe he wanted to have sex with her. I mean, get the details before you go and try to report your sister and ruin her livelihood (i.e. life)…nice living brother…wow
Update is all after you decide how you’re going to handle this situation. I’m curious to know the outcome. Good luck!
Such a fake story to spread more “acab” BS on this echo chamber 🙄 can only imagine why the bot who made this post got perma banned.
forgive me if i misuse this word but is that not rape …?
Jesus Christ
This is the second post I've seen in 10 minutes where a lady cop was blackmailing a guy to bang her or else she'd send the law after him.....feels fake man. Like almost exactly the same scenarios.
What state
Holy shit man I’m sorry for you and your friend. SubscribeMe!
She will ABSOLUTELY do this again when they are married. She LOVES the power she has over people, even people she claims she “loves.” Not a safe person. I’m so sorry for you that you (and now your sister and her boyfriend) are caught up in her web of betrayal. Expect more of the same. BTW her coworkers may have laughed, but I’ll bet many secretly thought what she did horrible and realize she is not a trustworthy person. 
You're already doing the right thing, so I just want to add a THANK YOU, for having morals and ethics.  She is an absolute danger, with or without a shield.
Remindme! One month
damn what does your friend look like? i gotta take some notes from him!!!
Bull sh # t
Our family policy has always been "If you commit a crime, we will turn you in, so you'll realize it's time to stop and change."
Bro, on that alone she could be automatically convinced for at least 4 very serious crimes; Extortion or Blackmail, Sexual Assault or Coercion, Abuse of Power/Authority, Falsifying Evidence, False Imprisonment or Kidnapping. Not to mention the others they'll be trying her for
wtf?! Your sister is like, maybe even is, a rapist.
Go to the police station and report her immediately. That is wrong on so many levels.
You need to report her, he destroyed her life because of that. I would go to the guy and if he can report her to Internal affairs you can get her off the force. I would record her and have her talk about it. Frankly it is what male cops have done to women all along. Our police needs to be reformed.....
Talk to the friend and offer to help him tell his girlfriend if he’s open to it. He was raped and it’s not his fault. It may help him to know that you’re aware because he’s probably scared no one would believe him.
In my nice opinion 
Report this to the crime stoppers 
And remain anonymously 
If you see ,hear something say something 
Don't turn your head with denial not to
Report   this  means 
 your conscience is vile!
She just admitted to rape. I'm sorry you have such a shitty family member, but good on you for being ready to report her. I bet she's done more than this, and worse. See what you can get through text before you go to report her. And check in with your friend as to how he's doing and whether he'd like to help in the report; this will likely explode his life.
Your sister used her position of power to rape your friend. She should spend the next 20 years in jail. Reporting her to the police won't do shit because the thin blue line.
Ask her again and record it. We do not need police like this. Do it before she does something worse
Talk to your friend and maybe his gf let them know that he was raped and it's not his fault, tell them how you found out, you and your friend NEED to go to the station and talk to an officer or someone of higher ranking than your sister and report her and have charges pressed against her.

You'll likely be harassed and get a lot of shit from her shit friends so keep cameras around your home and a record of these interactions and have your friend do the same
ACAB
That's disgusting of her. Abusing her power and raping a man that clearly didn't want her and is in a happy relationship. What does she even expect out of this? Did she think he would just up and leave his relationship for her after forcing herself on him. And how can she love someone if she would plant fucking drugs on him. She needs mental help and her badge taken.
Tell your sister she's a fucking worthless piece of shit. Not sure I'd ever look at someone like that without disgust
Sorry dude, your sister belongs in jail, she’s literally a criminal. The last thing she needs is a badge and a gun. This will be tough but this is your chance to get another bad cop off the beat before she gets more false convictions or even kills someone.
Gather as much evidence as possible, then try to go straight to the DA, or the FBI.
I truly am shocked and feel completely horrible for your best friend! I can only imagine the guilt and shit he feels. Especially since he never brought it up to you. Your sister is mentally not a good person and needs help because she thinks what she did was ok and normal because she randomly loves him.(Her friends are all POS for not questioning her and laughing also)I'm also sorry that you now have to deal with this and hope you have time one on one with your best bud to discuss everything and find the best way to proceed. ✌️❤️💪
I'd love to hear an up date later on if possible!
Well, first off...you're going to need to talk to your friend, tell him what you've been told, and get his side. She MIGHT just be bullshitting to impress. You don't want to do anything until you've gotten both sides.

Once you've squared away that he was not a willing participant, and that he is willing to testify as much, you need to take the evidence you have now, and any additional evidence you can get, and go to her commanding officer. He needs to swear out a complaint. They can advise you both on the proper steps to take to continue to gather evidence against her that will stick. Make sure you are willing to do this, because she's going to get busted out of the force and probably go to jail.

But this person should NOT be carrying a badge. Sorry this has gotten dumped on you.
Get her arrested, maybe leak it to the news
Maybe it's a joke and. Both are messing with you
She needs to answer for this. I don’t know where you are in the world but she could easily lose her job, and she deserves to. 

Please do the right thing and report her
She must be reported for rape!  ..and fired from the police!

Record her.
[removed]
Call the police
Leave it alone
Stay out of it is my advice. She’s your sister and unless you plan to go NC for the rest of eternity… is it OK? Absolutely not. It’s criminal. But this is for him to report...meanwhile,nanny cams for everyone in your circle in case she does start planting stuff. She sounds NUTS.
This is the time to MYOB & just move on. The words sister & sex in the same sentence is wrong.
It's rape fantasy...if your friend didn't want to go along with it, those circumstances wouldn't have coerced him.


Stop listening to all the betas and women here...it was weird but consentual.


Id be more worried about how you're planning to tell the girlfriend he cheated.
My suggestion is to mind your business and stay out of it! She didn't make your friend do anything that he didn't want to do.  And why would you go by anybody's suggestion to try to set your sister up to get more evidence that she did whatever? Who are you going to show it to? Can't possibly be your friend your friend knows what he did! I think your issue is more so that you feel some type of way because she slept with your friend, she's your sister he's your best friend you have an issue with that - why would you want to gather evidence against your sister? To get her in trouble? What's the purpose of gaining evidence? Who are you going to show the evidence to? What is the end game? Be realistic, if your friend didn't want to have sex with her your friend wouldn't have had sex with her regardless. 
Are we certain the best friend didn’t consent to a cop-related kink?
I agree with this post. If you get evidence of it or a confession via text you should absolutely report her. Otherwise her being a cop with the shown lack of concern for the rules could be very dangerous. She probably has friends in the department who can harass you if not herself. 

So if you can get evidence report her. If you can't just go no contact with her and be there for your friend.
I just texted her about this. She sent a few messages claiming she only did it because she is in love with him. Will try to gather as much as I can.
Definitely rape
Talk to her about it in person and record her confession
She’s a rapist and a corrupt police officer. Can’t think of a worse combination. 

OP, you have to be smart about this. And be careful. Ranty is right about the gossip approach. I also want to add that you should act non-judgemental, curious, laugh along with her (she seems to think it’s funny), and inquire about her “love” for him. She’s gonna want to talk about that *a lot.* (That’s typical behaviour whether you’re a regular person in love or a rapist who **thinks** they’re in love. I’m getting sick just writing this, but that’s what happens when you try to put yourself in the mind of a fucked up person.) I’m trying to imagine her mindset and vulnerabilities. She’s clearly obsessed with him, so if you’re able to stomach it, try getting her to vent about your friend. Her unrequited feelings for him are her weak spot.

Basically, you need to butter her up. Put on an Oscar winning performance—this could be the only piece of evidence you get. There’s a bit of pressure here but think of how much you’d be helping your friend.

Of course, I don’t know the laws about recording people in your state. You may not even be able to record a confession. Still, even if recording is off the table, I recommend to maintain the act. I believe she’ll slip up and do something stupid (which we want) if you maintain a friendly, non-judgemental vibe. If I were in your shoes, I’d be confused, worried, and full of rage—so I know it’s hard to play nice. But you get more bees with honey.

Edit: Fwiw, I was able to record a confession from a rapist a few years ago by using this technique. It works really well.
I know it's supposed to be up to the victim if they want to pursue charges but this is kind of bigger than that. It's a rogue police officer and if we don't do something she's gonna repeatedly do more and more.
It’s legal in NY.
There is a point. Wanna know what cops fear? IA. report like that would have them on her case no matter what.

Edited to correct a typo.
Very well said. This post best be satire. 😫
This. Exactly This.
Absolutely and if she said this in front of anyone else then they're actually witnesses to her statements. Just unethical and malicious crap. 🤬
[deleted]
>Try to tape her talking about what she did

Depending on which state/country OP is in this could be incredibly illegal to record her without consent. If he is in a place where it is illegal without consent, then it will not be admissible in court if OP has to take it that far. 

**TLDR** Judge and Jury will have to throw out evidence that was illegally obtained (Unless that place allows recording without consent)

**If you people are gonna say stuff like this, then you need to include that it matters where OP is located and that some places don't allow it.**
ACAB always everywhere!
I texted her about this and she claimed she only did it to him because she is in love with him. I will still try to gather more evidence though.
They’ll just move her to another county this shit is crazy

Edit: OP don’t ask her too directly while getting evidence make it seem casual or she may get you whacked
He's a man why you calling him girl
You already know!
It's hard but you have to go to the friend first. The first thing police are known for is defending their own.
To....The police that the sister is a part of, known as a group of people who protect their own? I'd first try to get her to admit on recording or text or something.
Police are a gang of thugs. Their job is to assault or kill anyone who dares oppose their fellow gang members or the rich and powerful. Lack of mental capacity, lack of empathy, it's a benefit, not a downside.
Why do you think it's made up? I trust nothing on Reddit, so I have my hesitations on this one, too.
This post is painfully fake I can’t believe how many people are falling for it. Must be a lot of young naive people on Reddit I guess.
Yeah I’m really bummed out I had to scroll this far to see anyone casting doubt.

This is cartoonishly villainous. If this was a plot line on The Wire it would not be very realistic.

I love how in all of these types of stories our gallant OP will somehow overhear the villain twirling their moustache and laughing about their evil scheme.

Then they’ll have absolutely no idea what to do when the solution is very straightforward. 

I hope the comments are just buying into the fiction because it’s more fun. Redditors often laugh at their boomer family members for believing obviously fake news on Facebook, but comment on absolute BS like this with genuine sincerity.
There is no way a cop would do this and then pubically admit to it

She is. She forced him to have sex. Blackmailed him
Nope. Get an attorney first. This can blow up badly and victim treated like a liar when they question him and then scare him with jail for “ making a false police report”.  It happens to women. It will definitely happen to him.
Victim blaming is so gross.

Edit to add - this is literally nearly the worst advice on this post.
No don’t do this!!!!! They need to get an attorney. And then do exactly as the attorney says to go after her. Having an attorney will protect him from other cops.
A victim is not to blame when someone in power manipulates them into having sex by force. Her statement was either you get a drug felony or we have sex. That is NOT free will, that’s forceable rape
Guess victim blaming happens to men too… disgusting.
I'll add the caveat that him reporting it himself will likely be useless, and potentially puts OP at risk of his sister's wrath, if OP's friend doesn't want to make the report. It should ultimately be his decision since it happened to him, I just think OP should try to gather evidence to turn over to his friend, as his sister is more likely to slip up around OP. The police won't care if the victim themselves is an adult and doesn't want to press charges. It can also be extremely upsetting and stressful to make such a report, so his friend deserves the opportunity to think about if he even wants to put himself through that. 


Yes - if this is a genuine situation then this police officer poses a very real threat, but ultimately reporting in this instance has to be the victim's choice, not a third party.
This. Your friend needs to move from the jurisdiction the lady works if u decides to take legal action.
The department is going to try to cover it up, its occultic. Take it to a lawyer not the cops
Have a recorder with you wire tap that bitch.
OP be very careful. If your sister is evil enough to rape someone under threat of decades in prison, think about what she could do to _you_.

Do the right thing, but plan your strategy carefully.
I recommend posting this in r/LegalAdvice so you can ensure you're doing everything to the letter of the law.
Your sister raped that guy. She’s an awful human being and she will do it again, now that she realizes she can. And her friends laughing about shows they are no better than her. Absolutely disgusting!

Victims hear that rhetoric all the time, and I don't disagree, but having reported an instance of rape myself, I kind of wish I'd never bothered. I had evidence, had an admission, the police did nothing. So imagine how much worse it'll be when one of their own is under the microscope. They'll do everything they can to declare her innocent, whatever mind games they have to play. I was told in court by the defence's solicitor that I was "trying to ruin a young man's life" (my rapist) and was "upset that he only wanted a physical relationship". It is not at all the empowering, validating experience that one would hope. So it should be his choice.
I didn't have to report. My rapist turned himself in. You'd think that's the ideal situation, but it was still a terrifying and traumatic experience for me because, even with a confession, they *still* tried to force me to share responsibility. I can only imagine how hard it is on those who didn't have a remorseful rapist. The only responsibility a victim has is to themself. Demanding victims to further put themselves at risk is monstrous.
It’s not fishy, cops openly murder, rape, and assault people every day and face no consequences. There are countless examples of pigs talking about and bragging about shit like this to each other if you just google it for 5min.
I agree. I feel like if the best friend really didn’t want to have sex with her he would not have. Perhaps she jokingly said it to the best friend and he knew that. I mean, we don’t have any of the details about the circumstances that put these two people in connection without her brother either. How did the whole thing even come to be.
Another caveat is that, even if it’s illegal in a state, read all of the terms for that.

Generally, conversations that are 1) in public places 2) in places where outside parties can hear at all (the back of a secluded restaurant is still public and there’s no assumption of privacy) will override the no recording. You may not be able to record her in her home or office, depending on state laws (single-party consent aka you, double party consent aka both people recorded or more) etc.
In this case, I don't think it matters whether it's legal or not. When you've got a rogue cop on the loose, it would just give the authorities a kickstart for an investigation.  

What's the alternative, to let her carry on until she seriously harms someone?
Do you feel comfortable telling your friend that you know what happened and that you know she coerced him? When men are assaulted, it's not uncommon for them to feel too embarrassed to tell anyone, especially when the perpetrator is a woman.

A statement from him would be useful but beyond that, it's important that he has support. He might not be ready to go into details with you, which is fine, but him knowing that you've got his back will help a lot.
Have you asked her how she would feel if the roles were reversed? As in, if she was forced to have sex with a police officer under threat of having false evidence planted on her?
It’s still rape even if she loves him. Her love doesn’t make her any less dangerous.
Couldn't your friend she did this to have some evidence as well that could be used against her? Just a thought. I also would think if you want to bring these things to light and see that she's properly punished your friend is going to have to be on that same page as he is the victim. If he doesn't corroborate with his side of the story that could put an end to it. Then you're left with the aftermath of your sister knowing you tried to get her in trouble. 

I only say this because getting her to admit to what she did fully and completely to the point that you can use it against her is unlikely. She could catch on to your intentions.
I’m sure many rapists think they ‘love’ or have some kind of relationship with their victim. Doesn’t make it OK in the slightest. Sounds like you are looking for a reason to exonerate your sister. No, pal. This is who your sister is. And she will make more victims unless and until she is stopped.
At least she’ll be away from OP’s friends and family
What?!😭😭😭
Thanks, I changed it, my mistake.😭😭😭👍
That's the least of OPs worries rn lmao
Probably because the villain is a cop and most redditors will take any chance they can to say “cop bad” IMO
This would be national news if it were true lol
Okay this, good point.
No, blatant idiocy is literally so gross. There's .04% chance that this dude's friend is a victim of anything. It's way more likely that homeboy is having an affair with OP's sister, and that sis saying "fuck me, or I'll plant drugs on you" wasn't a literal threat, but a playful way to initiate sex. OP heard something not meant for him, and is likely in denial of it. The fact that you don't get that shows how young and naive you are.

But. On the off chance that OP's sister made an actual threat to extort sex, that's a disgusting abuse of power, it's a 2nd degree sex offense, and she should go to jail. The only thing OP could do at that point is encourage his friend to report it to her supervisor, because there's literally nothing else he can do because it doesn't involve him.
You’re missing a key fact: I’m not aware of any testimony from the victim. I only read admission from the supposed rapist.

Innocent until proven guilty… there is a contrast between blame and determining blame.
OP is a 28m
I also agree with this. They know much better about how to report this and keep it from blowing back on you than we would. I bet you could also get a lot of them or find an organization to do it pro bono because no one likes when a cop abuses their authority especially in a way so disgusting as this.
After speaking with the lawyer and making sure they are okay with it, I would suggest going straight to the media. She won't be able to do a fucking thing without everybody seeing her if she tries to go after OP or the victim unless she's really that unhinged and just straight up fucking stupid. She is absolutely open for some serious consequences over this shit. What a fucking POS idiot. Sorry OP your sister is a really nasty fucking b!tch.🤬
Unfortunately not legal in most places
That sub is mostly cops, and I wouldn't trust anything they say.
It is in NY
I wish I never bothered reporting the one I did, too. It just created more layers of trauma with the police who didn't want to believe me nor do anything because they "can only tell him to realign his moral compass". I had to demand they document my injuries. They talked me out of a rape kit. It was all sorts of terrible compounded on the already terrible thing that happened to me. So, when I was date raped by someone else years later, I didn't do anything because I was already so defeated. I saw no light at the end of the tunnel, no validating experience people hope for. I lost all of my 20s to my trauma. It absolutely should always be the survivor's choice. 10 years after my worst rape and I'm only finally seeing some light in life after so, so much therapy and medicine. All the love to OP's friend and anyone else reading this. It may suck now but it's gonna be ok cuz we have each other and I'm sending virtual hugs to all 🫂🤗
I'm just telling op they need to get cx to admit this on tape and report it to the authorities and the public so that his sister can be dealt with accordingly.
A New York cop just got ten WEEKENDS in jail for raping a 13 year old girl. This is when he’s been convicted and everyone knows and is admitting he did it! M-F he can live his life free at home with his family, and on Saturdays and Sundays he has to check himself into jail for just 10 weekends. That little girls life will never be the same, and his social calendar is just slightly messed up for a little while.
>I don't think it matters whether it's legal or not

It matters because if she's taken to court, the evidence OP tried so hard to risk getting will be tossed the f out. You don't seem to understand that **no matter how damning a piece of evidence is, if it was obtained illegally by the standards of where OP lives, it will be tossed in the garbage. Real or not real.**

**This will make it** ***easier*** **for the girl to escape accountability.**

You are going to get OP and his friend in trouble if he listens to this advice without checking if its legal for him to obtain evidence in this manner or not.
Can't argue with stupid, also, I'm 45 and far from naive. Good luck with..... idk life i guess
Oops thank you
OMG this explains so much...
Cue /r/reallegaladvice... @ /u/RantyMcThrowaway /u/WhiskeyToenailRobin
Ohhh, gotcha.
I’m terribly sorry you went through such horrifying ordeals. I’m glad to hear you’re doing better now, and you’re very sweet for that encouraging message at the end of your comment. I wish you well
This does not even makes sense! Weirdest and WEAKEST sentence I HAVE EVER HEARD!
Cool, thank you!
Thank you 💓 wishing you all the best 🍀
Oh yeah the weekender inmate 🙄 oh no you have to spend weekends in jail like you're fking grounded. I knew a dude who had to do this, real piece of sht. Couldn't believe that was an actual punishment.
I genuinely cannot stand my husband anymore because he cut down a tree
I (35m) and my husband (35m) have been married for years and have never faced a big issue like this one where neither one of us knows what the solution for it is.

To explain briefly,when my grandparents moved to my town they built their house and planted a tree in their yard which grew over the years.

My grandparents loved that tree so much because it felt like it grew alongside their family in a way,they always took good care of it especially my grandpa who nicknamed it 'Sally'.

My whole family including me have numerous pictures with that tree,some of us playing under it and others of my grandparents standing proudly next to it,it might seem silly but that tree genuinely meant a lot to all of us because we all played under it,we all sat under it and talked together,it just held a lot of memories.

My grandparents have sadly passed away from covid but I was fortunate enough to inherit their house,it's not a big fancy house by any means and I didn't care about that however my husband did.

He likes house renovations and wanted to do a whole makeover to the house since it was too old style for him,I didn't mind and told him he could do whatever he wanted to the house,he could paint it bright blue for all I cared.

What I didn't expect is to come back home from my work trip to find the tree gone,he cut off the whole tree because he wanted to start renovating the backyard for it to be more modern,to say i lost my shit would be an understatement and we had a massive argument about it.

He argued that I told him he could do whatever he wanted to the house so I couldn't back out now that he did something I didn't like but I find his argument invalid because I said the 'house' as in the structure not the tree and he should've known I wouldn't have wanted him to cut it down.

I know this is not the biggest issue ever but I am genuinely heartbroken over this,it wasn't just a tree to me or my family and now whenever I look outside I just see an empty space where it should've been,I tried to get over it but I still feel resentment towards him which I don't like.

I don't know how to fix this or how to get my point across for him,I don't want our relationship to fail because of a family tree but I am also deeply hurt that he didn't consider mine or my family's feelings at all.

Should I just let it go?or do I talk to him about it again even though I feel like it is useless since the tree is gone?I don't know,I just want help in how to get over this.
I...don't understand why the first thing your husband would do is cut down a tree that has so much obvious significance to you and your family?
I mean the most important part here is- did he know the importance of this tree to you? 

If so, then I wonder why would he deem it so important to cut down something that you love so much. It’s your families home, is he not considering any of the history there? 

Unfortunately, you can’t take it back. You could plant a new one in its place maybe and regrow the tradition with the next generation of your family.

I absolutely love trees and get mad any time someone cuts down a perfectly fine one just for cosmetic reasons. Especially if it’s mature. It’s not like trees grow 20ft a year lol
I think part of the problem of not being able to move forward is that he did not apologise or acknowledge your feelings. Even if he misinterpreted what you said he should have apologised for causing you hurt as it was not intentional.
As far as "fixing it" goes, I don't know if this will work, but I figured it might be worth mentioning. 

A beloved tree in my community was significantly split by a storm a while back, and instead of getting rid of it, they installed heavy duty metal stilts to stand it back up. I don't know if this would work for you if the tree is already completely severed from the roots. My other suggestion would be to make furniture out of it - that way the tree isn't gone entirely, and you can pack up and take it with you if you guys decide to move.

Unless you have absolutely zero cares about architecture and interior design, including colors, patterns, shapes, etc, I would sit down with your husband and see what his plans are. If you two have never renovated or altered a living space together you may be surprised by what you discover you don't like (speaking from experience). 

Above all, I am so sorry you're experiencing this loss. Once upon a time my grandpa cut the three lowest hanging branches off of our prized magnolia tree (they were huge branches and were great for kids to play on since they were so low to the ground, also you're not supposed to trim magnolia trees so that their leaves can stay mostly self-contained). He thought he was doing us a favor, but we were devastated. I remember how torn I was, and I can't imagine how much worse it would have been if he cut down the entire tree.
Ooof that sucks, I get how you can be attached to a trees.  I once had neighbor cut down some of my trees to improve their view, I have never been so mad in my life.

The said did your husband understand your attachment to this tree?  If he legitimately did not know it was special, I can see how your permission to whatever to house could misunderstood to include the yard.
Just because you said he can do what he wants, does not mean that he can do whatever without communicating with you about it first.
Have a memorial service for the tree.

I know it sounds crazy, but you are grieving the loss of a life, one that hosted a lot of memories for your family.  So giving it its due and grieving its loss together with other family members might actually help you.

Then plant a new tree in the same ceremony.  Say some words about what you hope the new tree will bring to your family and to your relationship with your husband.

And by the way, I feel the pain.  I’ve only lived in my home for four years and due to a miscommunication, a large, beautiful beach of this glorious apple tree was cut off.  I cried so damn hard.  And felt so silly.  Except it is a living thing, it made my life better during the pandemic, and it was beautiful.  That deserves honor and recognition.

Edit to say the tree planting might have to wait until spring, because, well, winter.
Just as a side note, if y’all put family money in renovating the house, he could have claim to it in a divorce and force a sale. 

It may be time to pause him doing “whatever he wants” as you consult a lawyer and make sure the house stays in your family.  
I'm less concerned about him cutting the tree than I am of his reaction to your confronting him about it. His dismissal of your feelings is a huge red flag to me.
I know quite a bit about plants, and I'm hoping this can help. Is the stump ground or ripped out? If not there may be hope for the tree to come back, trees often do what is called 'suckering' where they send up shoots from the roots. If it is, then try and see if the tree dropped any seeds, luckily its the time of year for that, and plant the seeds. 

I do think you're totally justified in whatever you feel towards your husband. That tree sounded like it was genuinely part of your family, and he killed them (possibly intentionally).
i know how you feel but have no idea what to do with that. you just inherited a tree that you not only had a connection with, but your damn grandparents planted. not many can say the same. id be absolutely devastated & wouldnt be sure if i could ever forgive my partner. 

did your husband fully know about the trees background, & how much it meant to you, beforehand?
He must have known how much it meant to you and your family history. He didn’t care
Wow this is heartbreaking I'm shocked by the amount of people glossing over it. I'm not sure I would get over something like this especially because he should know you better and even if you said do anything I always go through plans with my partner we aren't even married I'm so sorry for you if you're wanting to continue you're going to have to lay down more respect and maybe now make plans for a comforting scenic tree backyard re-planted you deserve a cozy home not just a sterile empty backyard full of missed memories I wish you luck and I'm so sorry. 
Damn…that’s really cold. I don’t think I could forgive that. Honestly. It’s not just about the tree. It’s about a blatant desire to hurt you and your family. Waiting periods for firearms are a good idea.
Myself as a plant person, I would be absolutely devastated and livid.
this man is cruel... how is finding a tree that's in all your family photos as important, silly? it ain't. expect more of his crap in the future. 

RIP Sally

ps. make a bat from the lumber and hit him with it.
First of all, your husband is a dumb dumb and you have every right to be upset. Second of all, I wonder if y’all could make something out of the tree? Like save a piece of its bark and frame it, or make some nice rocking chairs, coasters, a table, or some kind of keepsake so that you can always have the tree with you.
There are two possibilities here: 1) your husband had no idea that the tree was important to you, and he thought he was making your home better in some way, and, 2) your husband knew how you felt about the tree, but he didn’t like it, so he made an end-run around you and cut it down while you were out of town. 

If it’s the first, then it really sucks for both of you, and the inability to have an adult conversation and resolve the feelings surrounding the incident is a much bigger problem than the tree. The fact that you’ve never faced a big issue with him before suggests that maybe this is the correct explanation. 

If it’s the second one, then it really sucks for you, and your husband’s disregard for you and what’s important to you is a much bigger problem than the tree. 

Either way, something needs to be addressed here.  It may be that your husband is an inconsiderate asshat. Or it may be that your emotional maturity is so low that you’d blow up a marriage of years over a plant.
Idk I am a very literal person. If someone says "house," guess what I will think they are referring to? To a house. 

I don't know your husband but this kinda sounds like intentional misunderstanding 

You have to ask yourself if that's the first time it ever happened or did you both had situations where he conveniently misunderstood something that by incredible coincidence you would've not let happen if you knew what was going to happen?
I would be so pissed. Idk if I could ever forgive him. Personally. That’s hard. And so deep. This would especially be hard if he was unable to understand. Idk. Really not a good sign. My heart breaks for you and you’re totally valid. That’s honestly unbelievable.
You’ve been married for years and he’s somehow oblivious to the significance of this tree to your family? 

He either doesn’t give a shit enough about you to know this was important to you or he knew but put his stupid vision for a home makeover before you and your family. Considering that he did it while you were away, I’d put my money on the latter. 

I don’t have any advice because personally, i can’t fathom why someone would do that and I don’t think I could ever look at that person the same.
You need to communicate your feelings very specifically. 

Obviously, whats done is done. The tree is gone, and Im so sorry you’ve lost such a sentimental thing.

It seems clear that your husband probably would not have done it if he had known it was off limits. Its a tragedy of sorts. It never occurred to you to mention it. And never occurred to you that he would cut it. Yet… he also cant read your mind. You did say… “do whatever you want”. 

At this point, it seems the biggest thing between you two is that he isn’t validating how heartbroken you are. And thats understandable because his defenses are up. He knows he hurt you, but its hard to admit it when he knows he didnt do it on purpose.

You need to forgive him, and you also need to explain that he needs to validate how heartbroken broken you are. It just might take your act of forgiveness for him to really kneel down and validate how you feel. He is very likely crushed inside. He is probably beating himself up more than you can imagine.

Remember, successful marriage is the goal. You love this man. And he loves you. You both just need to do the hard thing right now. Forgive him for doing something he didnt mean to do. And offer him a secure space in which to apologize fully and *properly*. 

Women tend to have the high ground in emotional vulnerability. We learn it from a younger age. We learn to understand our emotions better than men on average. You may need to just guide him to this one, eventhough it hurts.
This is tragedy... i am sorry for your lost. 

Did he said he is sorry or did he just argue? He should be sorry as hell and at least planted new tree as your new family tree. It will never be the same but after few years you could have feel better as the tree will get bigger. 

If I would have been in your skin I would lost my s*it. And from now on, as this is your house, every step he want to do should be firstly debated with you.
Thats really shity of him. He should have talked to you about it before doing it. I dont care if you told him he could do whatever he should still be running things by you before changing anything.
I would feel like you do too. And I don’t know if I would get over it. Am very sorry. Take some time to mourn. Maybe go for a lot of walks. Stay with your feelings and see how it goes.
The only thing I would suggest is that you demand that a new tree is planted in its place. One that can grow with your family. That assumes you can get over the feelings of resentment. Which may be difficult. I would lose my shit if anyone were to cut down one of my trees without speaking to me, at the very least, first.
As someone who is extremely pro-tree, that would infuriate me.
Angry over the tree is one thing and understandable. Can't stand him over the tree is another. There is clearly a communication issue as a root cause here. To you, "house" was literally the structure. To him "house" was the whole property. You both should take responsibility for the miscommunication. You for not being clearer on what house meant to you, and him for ignoring the trees' importance. That is assuming he knew of the importance, having been married to you for years and living in the house. No apology is necessary, just acknowledgement a miscommunication occurred, and you will need time to process what happened. 

Perhaps there are other issues, and this is just the final straw.
I think the most important thing is if he knew about the significance or not. If he didnt then its not really his fault and its not something he can blamed for. If he did then he has willfully destroyed something you loved and you have a right to be mad at him. Either way you can both agree that something has to be done to continue the tradition and to pay respects to it by maybe making use of the wood to create something or planting another tree or hell maybe 2 trees instead or something like that. You have to take a step back and a deep breath and really consider if your husband knew what this meant to you and then go from there.
Not a direct answer, buy maybe some hope..

Electric company came and made us cut a tree down because it was under the electric lines (tree was there first)  we didn't like it but it had to go.

In return the roots grew about 6 more trees around it 

This may happen for you, if you watch in that area and see some sprouts block them off and let them grow.  It's a way to keep a piece of that memory alive.

Best wishes
You said to him “he should’ve known” 
There lies your biggest mistake, people are not mind readers.
Get over it and ask him to plant a new tree in place of the one he cut down because our earth is now missing a tree.
It’s crazy that he thought home Reno meant he could cut down a decades old tree. 

But now it’s no longer about the tree, but his refusal to see how his actions have affected you. It maybe been an honest miscommunication, in which case he should be apologizing profusely not getting upset with you. 
He asked about the house, nor the tree. Why would he start with the yard atcthis time of year. His wording was deliberate. He knew you would be angry, but thought you couldn't do anything about it. 


I would make him replace the tree with like kind and quality. It is possible move big trees. 

He must really hate you for some reason.

Edited to add misding text
At this point in your marriage I feel he should know better, should understand the sentimental value of this tree. You can never get that living heirloom back. I’d be livid. I’m not sure I could forgive this honestly. It’s the only living connection to that time and those people, and your childhood.
Not sure why you are calling this a silly idiot but that's not going to help you move through your emotions no matter what they are. One, it's clearly not silly, unless you don't trust your body and you think you have silly emotions.... Which you don't. Two, regardless of this particular trees history, chopping a tree down without permission of anyone near it including other owners is weird behaviour. It's almost like he did it because you weren't there and didn't have the guts to ask you because you would say no.  So then you aren't just dealing with historical damage, you are dealing with dishonesty, passive aggression and manipulation to name but a few. 


In fact, I think the fact that you called this silly.... Might be the root of the problem. Has your husband made it seems like a 'silly' problem? Did he act like it was no big deal and now you have to figure a way round your own feelings? Cos I'm getting a major gaslighting vibe from this post.
Did your husband know about the tree's history? 

If yes, he's TA and using 'u said I could do anything' to justify it.

If he didn't know, then you kinda only have yourself to blame. You did tell him to do anything.

I think the deciding factor is did he know how much it meant to you.
You can't get over something your spouse didn't bother taking responsibility for. That's not congruent with reality. When you voiced your hurt and anger his response was to deny you had any right to feel those feelings. 

You have the absolute right to feel those feelings. 

You don't have to "get your point" across to him. 

Get all the pictures of your family with that tree and have them enlarged. Frame all the pictures and start putting them up in the house. Then tell your husband that you want him to plant another tree there. Pick a tree that bears fruit. Something that works in your zone is self-pollinating and a dwarf version so you can maintain it yourself. This is now your tree. This tree will give you fruit in time and will be meaningful because you will use the fruit to create a variety of dishes for your family. This is now a new tradition. Regardless of what he did , your solution is to create a new life a new tradition in the place where life was taken away. 

If your husband does other "renovations" or behaves in a way that is retaliatory in a harmful or spiteful way then you have your answer about who you married. You married a spiteful person who doesn't like when you point out how his behavior affects you negatively. 

I also suggest that you reexamine how deeply you feel about the house and the land. If you really don't care then stick to that. But if you continue to disagree with his choices or not like his efforts then you need to step in. This is your environment not his alone. 





If you think this helped, reply **helped**
You shouldn’t do anything. Is he looking for the ways to understand you better? Is he looking for the ways to earn your apology? No? Then your relationship has a bigger problem than “just a tree”. Being upset over a tree, especially the one that’s been there for generations, is valid. I’d be upset if my partner cut a random tree out of a new property without checking with me first, and if then he’d just dismiss my feelings? That would be enough to reconsider the relationship. It’s never “just a tree”. He killed an alive, growing being for his egoistic wishes without talking to you first, because he knew you’d be against it.
Wow. I don’t know what to tell you except that I feel your pain. The way you feel is completely valid. It was a REALLY shitty thing to do on his part. He absolutely should have known to ask before cutting down the tree.
I don’t know whether I could just forgive tbh.
I would feel exactly the same your husband is an idiot and deliberately did something he'd know you would hate. I would get a lawyer and kick him out. He shows he doesn't know you or that he doesn't care to. It's complete and utter lask of respect.
Some mediation may help you two communicate better on this situation. 

I would take house renovation to include the yard. It often does. If you didn't specify that that tree was off limits, there's some gray area there. 

Did he know exactly what that tree meant to you? Did you tell him to leave the tree alone? 

Neither of you are mind readers. Whether you stay together or not, you guys should talk.
I would take that back and make all the decisions together.  Especially If it was a big tree and he hired a crew. If he is doing his projects, he might screw up or pick some stuff you really think is ugly. The stuff is so cheap-looking now. I would want a say.
Wtf was he doing in the yard when he asked about changing the HOUSE? fuck is his problem?
If you didn’t say „don’t touch the tree” then there’s nothing here for you to bother him about. 

You even went so far as to say painting the house bright blue wouldn’t affect you- he probably took that in the sense that you literally couldn’t care less what he does. 

So he did what he thought would look good and modern in the long run. 

You can be upset about the tree being gone but you can’t be upset at HIM because you didn’t let your wishes be clear and concise. Instead, they were vague and all encompassing.
I'm with your husband you said he could do whatever he wanted. That argument about "i said the house and not the three" is invalid for me, house means the whole thing.
So disrespectful - he is showing how he feels about you 

You may want to think hard now before you let him take over more of your house !!
This is a big deal... I am so sorry 😞 
Did your husband not know about the trees' origin? That your grandad named her Sally? Did you never tell him?
If he knew the value of the tree and had any basic self reflection and a bit of empathy he would not have done it without talking to you first.. I don't know him but maybe he did it like this because he knew you would never be okay with it.


You are allowed to grieve. Sentimentality is a valid thing and as you said it hold so much value to you. Not to mention the age of the tree. Its not replacable and was a sign of something. And he ruined it.


You are right to feel betrayed and angry. Don't devalue your own emotions here but ultimately only you can decide if its worth to keep it..
Hey, you could make a nice box or some jewellery out of the wood that came from the tree, or even some furniture :). I’m sure it was a mistake, don’t let something that once held your family together now be a reason to possibly ruin it, these things happen, at least you have one and other :)
Did he know it was important? 

If not, did he apologise when you told him? 

If he's sorry, plant a new one together.

If he knew and he's not sorry, start analysing the relationship.
I know how you feel. Trees are sacred. I'd be soooo devastated. I don't have the answer but I feel you. That's real grief.
Just tell him you know he didn't do it to hurt you but that you ARE heartbroken and in emotional pain because of his actions. The ball is in his court, really. If he loves you, he should want to make it up to you.
So did he know how important the tree was?

If you just want to move forward, maybe see if you can plant a new tree using the old one by taking it to a tree store/professional of some kind. I think they can use the cutting or similar. 

Then you can make new memories with a new tree thats still in many ways connected to your old memories of your old tree and grandparents.
Where I live you need to go through a lot of paperwork and hurdles to cut down a tree (even dead ones) or you could get fined. That tree was part of your family. That tree was also a whole mother-tucking ecosystem. Your hubby destroyed a lot that day. 

If your partner destroyed the tree *knowing* that it was a part of your family you should throw his ass out with the mulch.
Your husband, did he even apologize?

Like, did he took responsibility that he did wrong? It's a huge mega minus if he didn't apologize or even wanted to replant a new tree.

And who claims that trees are not modern, if anything, trees are very good at flooding, their roots block the water and soak up moisture like a vacuum cleaner. Which saves the house from mold damage!

Trees are modern!
The red line for me is that he cared about the house but only for the flip value. An even bigger red line is that a cute old house is TOO old style?! The Biggest red line of them all is his idea of making a garden modern is to cut down the tree!
My mum said she was going through my grandmas things and sorting out the older stuff that needed to be thrown away after she passed. The first item of the agenda was apparently, to my horror, all of the handmade gifts and cards I had written her throughout my life. I wrote a poem in each card - gone in the trash. There were genuinely broken items still left untouched. 

Apparently, it didn’t occur to her. Everyone else I speak to in the family believes it was a misunderstanding. I had a very hard time believing that, even though I wanted to - it was only once I saw a therapist and she said “That was not an accident” I really accepted it. 

Be very frank with yourself, OP. This simply does not make sense as a misunderstanding. It is odd to cut down a tree as the first project in modernising the house. He must have known its significance to your family. He was not apologetic and in a frantic state of despair when he saw how it hurt you. He appears to have some genuine disdain for the house from your other comments as well - I can’t speak to exactly why, but is there something about the closeness of your family that could trigger him? Did he not have beautiful signs of significance like that tree in his own family? 

I may be reading into it too much but it sounds like you are quite sentimental about the house and the memories it holds. It sounds like you have just “given up” trying to get your husband to understand your sentimentality, and you have a sense that modernising is inevitable, so you have just said “do whatever you want”. It sounds to me like you didn’t want to give your own input or be involved in every tiny decision because you knew he would railroad you and your opinion did not matter. Now you can see just how much he does not care about your feelings, values, or wellbeing.

I know it sounds ridiculous to end a marriage over a tree - but actually, it doesn’t. It only sounds ridiculous to people like him who refuse to acknowledge that items that *they* see no value in can hold incredible sentimental value to others. To me it makes all the sense in the world. Just like the tree, it’s symbolic. He destroyed something that made you happy and he now cares more about being right and being able to do what he wants than making it up to you and consoling your feelings. Put yourself in his shoes, OP. Imagine destroying the most important thing in the world to him, and getting argumentative when he lost his shit over it.

If he doesn’t inherently know what he has done and how he should act, he won’t. He doesn’t value you. If he did, he would cherish all the things you valued even if he didn’t feel the same way. Because your happiness should be more important than having a modern back yard (which, logically, there’s no way ONE tree is going to be the biggest factor when we are considering a full makeover of the house!).

My heart aches for you, OP. You have lost something with so much history and so many memories that cannot be replaced. Don’t let anyone, him or otherwise, minimise your grief. My grief in your situation would be deep and immense. This is a tragic loss.
He has removed something precious to you and your family so that he can make the home and garden his own. He probably feels that with all the family history, he doesn't 'belong' there. So he is trying to 'make his mark'. I don't understand why the first thing he did was take down the tree though. Couldn't he have remodelled the house? Or is this a pattern of disrespectful behaviour that ignores your feelings?
does ur husband not know the significance it holds? i feel like he would've and if he does he's very wrong for doing that, i don't think a husband wouldn't know smth imp to u especially when it's in most of ur pics
Op said, "Do whatever you want." So that's exactly what his partner did.
Was your husband aware of the special significance of this special tree? If he was aware of it and cut it down, it would be one thing but it doesn’t seem like it’s the case here. I can understand why you are upset but I think unless done in malice, you both have a stake in the decision. Could he be changing too much of your homestead at once and it’s too become too much for you?  
I was in a similar situation, I thought I was fine with the renovations but deep down it’s bothering starting bothering me and I didn’t fully feel it until it was a step too far and suddenly I was incredibly upset. Change can be hard. I’m not sure if you’re in a similar situation. It helped us to slow things down, discuss changes and give me some time to process before ripping things out and completely changing it.
It’s a tree- a living thing, but it could have got a disease, struck by lightning, etc. Please mourn the tree. Plant a new one with your husband to grow with your family as a way to heal.
[deleted]
you should plant a new sally, and take the wood from old sally and make something that can become an heirloom. that way sally can still move on through the generations
I see a couple of issues:

1. OP did not say “you can do absolutely anything but do not cut down that tree” he said “I don’t care what you do with the house.” Clearly, that leaves a little room for interpretation and it is reasonable to believe that OP’s husband did not consider a tree the single most important thing on that lot. 

2. OP’s husband did not demonstrate empathy for OP’s utter sadness for having a prized heirloom cut down. Instead, the husband defended his actions as just. 

Both need to come to a common ground. This tree is hopefully not more meaningful than their relationship and neither should being “right” about cutting it down. Sometimes, both parties need to meet each other in the middle. 

Relationships have these things happen all the time. Where both can be “right” or “justified” but neither feel good about the other being “right.” The relationships that last are the ones that assume good intention, demonstrate empathy, and reasonably talk through their concerns to find common ground. But BOTH literally need to step into that space and not be concerned about “winning the issue” at hand or “backing down.” 

Perhaps they both can go and get a tree and OP’s husband can lay out all work that he plans to do so that they can go over the plans, together.
Communication could have been better, but no apology sucks. I'm sorry. 😞
This feels like purposefully asshole behavior because who the fuck looks at a tree and says oh wow that's so outdated, not gonna work for my modern look. There are literally no plants that will ever be outdated. Nature cannot be outdated.

I'm petty and I'd probably never be able to forgive him. Every time I looked at him I'd be reminded what a fucking asshole he is and every time I looked in the empty yard I'd be pissed off all over. I would never get over this
Did he know the significance of the tree prior to cutting it down?
You should stay mad about it forever.  

Or move on. 

Those are your choices, so go make one.
Did he specifically wait for you to leave to do this? It sounds like it’s important enough to you that he *would know* it had a lot of significance.
WTF? Your husband sounds exhausting. He knew what that tree meant to you and your family and it didn't matter.

Why do you think he waited until you were gone?

I suspect that your husband is pretty selfish in general.

If you don't have any kids or any other reason to "save this marriage", this is a marriage ender.

I say that based on my other assumptions.
He was a massive cunt, I'd be pissed beyond reason
As a landscaper this genuinely hurt a little what kind of tree was sally r.I.p
OP, I would be so furious and frankly idk if I could get over that. What was his reaction when you told him of the tree’s significance? I think that’s a really important factor moving forward. If he’s not literally begging for your forgiveness then he’s an ass with no respect. I’m also confused as to why he didn’t consult you about it? I realize you said “do whatever you want” but cutting down a tree is a pretty significant change and he could have avoided this whole situation had he just asked. I get that you gave him a green light but it was your grandparents house for goodness sake! Why in the fuck would he cut down a tree!!! Did not use his brain.
Tough to get over. Time of use all of his shit reno money to import and plant a huge ass tree back there. And you bet your ass you’re doing this with the mutual bank account, and not telling him about it.
It does sound like a misunderstanding. Your "I don't care" vibe about a family home would lead me to believe that you don't have strong feelings about the inherited property.

That being said, you have every right to be upset. And to move past this misunderstanding, I would recommend making time to talk it out calmly. You are unhappy with the outcome of his understanding. And he should apologize for upsetting you, even if it was accidental. You might be sad for a bit, but time will help. You might consider planting that same type of tree elsewhere in the yard to more easily keep that memory close. But if you know he didn't maliciously cut it down, you need to forgive him to move on.
Divorce for me.  There's absolutely no reason for this.
You’re not going to get over that. You need help to cope but you’re not going to get over it. Get a therapist and talk it out. If you speak to your husband right now, he may further invalidate your feelings considering he knew the history but still waited until you were gone to do it then blamed it on you like he doesn’t understand what a house is compared to a tree. Your best bet is an outside party who can help you process those feelings and figure out how to best put them into words to speak to him.
Major decisions should be made mutually.
He sucks at renovation. I hate people who want just plain Jane shyit. No trees in the yard just empty grass. Dude sucks.
I wouldn't be able to stand him any longer, either. For the very fact that he found a tree had to be cut down. And then did it.
I love my wife of 8 years but I’d divorce her in a heartbeat over this. It’s a major and obvious sign that he lacks respect or cares about you deeply. Like a deeply cherished family tree? Seriously I’d fall out of love in an instat
Don't just let it go.  You need to explain to him that now he has to tell you everything he's going to change.  He can't possibly have been that oblivious, or he wouldn't have done it without checking with you.  He knew you would say no.
Did he uproot it, too, or just chop it to the base? If he uprooted, it's sad, but it is what it is. Gotta be very specific about the things that matter because men will take general statements as a go ahead. If he just chopped to the base, then it'll regrow. Unfortunately, the bed was kinda made on this one.
Well if you tell somebody he could do whatever and he does whatever, how can you complain about it? You learned an important lifelesson. What you should have said: Do to the house whatever you want but the tree in the backyard is holly to the family, don’t touch it. So next time give clear instructions. Room for compromise: Plant a new tree together in honor of your grandparents and watch it grow together. Let that tree remind you of how to communicate better next time. Call it the communicationtree. 🥳
"I didn't mind and told him he could do whatever he wanted to the house."

Whoops. 

You could have communicated that the tree was important. He wasn't to know. 

Now, you're both having a conflict over a miscommunication. The cause of most arguments - miscommunication. 

You're going to need to own that you weren't clear about not cutting down the tree.  
He's going to need to own that he unintentionally upset you.
He's not a mind reader and when you say do anything you want i most definitely would have consider the land to be part of the house/property.

Depending on the house/property and type of tree and it's proximity to the house I may have cut it down also, by cutting it down he very well could be adding to the value of the property.  If it's too close to the house, that can actually damage the house and roof.  If you are looking at having a real nice lawn removing this tree can fix a blight in it.

I understand to you and your family this tree had sentimental value, but I find it odd that you don't hold the same sentimental value for the house itself.  How is he to know there was a difference?
I found out on my property I couldn’t leave if anyone was working there. Even if I gave them instructions they wouldn’t remember them the way I meant them. So I had to blame myself for leaving. Also guys love cutting down trees. It’s kind of hard to stop them once they start. I even cut branches for an hour once after I started up a chain saw to cut one branch. And I’m a woman. I love trees though and consider mine in my yard alive and watching over me, keeping cars out of the yard for me. I’m sorry you lost yours and I understand the heartbreak. 
The biggest question is: did he know the importance of the tree? Just because your family has some photos in front of it doesn’t necessarily infer the significance of the sentimental value of it to everyone. Was he aware of the full history and sentiment prior to cutting it down? If he did, then it is hugely inappropriate that he cut it down, knowing he was crossing a line he shouldn’t have, and you should not let that go.

Second, find out if there is a way to get a cutting off the branches are still viable. Plant it anew and start a new tree.
Talk to him again—explain the emotional value behind the tree and why it hurt so much, but also focus on rebuilding your connection rather than staying stuck in resentment.
Did he know? Or did you only tell him after the fact?
I say this in grief for the loss of this beautiful family tree: this too shall pass…
I can completely understand your attachment to the tree!  When my children wanted a pool, I said we couldn't get one because there wasn't enough room in our backyard because of a 100 year old tree.  I bought this house because when I was touring the house there was a nice back patio, a porch swing and a beautiful large oak tree with some kind of green leafy plant spiraling up the trunk and into the branches.  When my  children wanted a pool instead of the tree, I cried and literally hugged that tree!  I was sentimental about the tree and because I love trees and particularly large, shady trees.

I said all of that to explain that I sincerely understood your attachment to that tree in your parents yard and all the memories you guys had there.  I think YOUR TREE is greatly more significant than my tree.

With that said, and only because it is gone you guys should plant your own "new tree."  If you have kids they can be a part of the planting and naming of the new tree. Maybe even make a rule that the new tree name has to go well with Sally's name. Maybe the new tree's name starts with an "S",  or has to have double letters.  But make it special for you guys.  Also, maybe make a new rule that whoever gets the house after you pass on has to plant their own new tree. It can be in place of your upcoming new tree OR they can plant one next to it; as an addition to your "new" tree.  And this can start new memories for the next generation. 

A bonus!  Is the story about how your husband cut down the original tree and you were so angry you almost traded him in!  It could be a story that could live on and take on a story and legend of it's own.  Just a thought!

Also, I am a jeweler and think it would be great if little trinket or jewelry boxes could be made for yourself, and your siblings and all your kids.   Although, since you were not home when the tree was cut down you may not still have the wood.  OR... You could make a frame out of the wood and take a photo of the house that has the tree in it and frame it... and have a little plaque on the frame, declaring how special Sally was to the property and the owners.  There are numerous things you could do.  The photo could even be when your dad planted it.  Just something special and different to commemorate your dad, your family and Sally.
Oh God. U.
The question is, does your husband normally do stuff you don't like, or was this a one-off?

The reason I ask is you did say do what you want, at no point did you say leave the tree. It's weird that you didn't know he was starting with the garden and saying about the tree. But while he knew you had memories with the tree, he may not have realised the extent of the significance. Is the tree the only thing he did, or did he clear the whole garden. Ie did he wait for you to be gone to cut the tree down. 

If cutting down the tree was delierate and he's done things like that before,  then that's one thing I couldn't forgive. If it was a genuine mistake, then you need to forgive his mistake. 
Only you can know which category this falls into.

The thing is the tree is gone. You can bring it back. But you can plant something new or make a new area for you and your family to make memories for the future. Think of it as a new start.
I am sorry for how you are feeling. I think you need to honestly ask yourself if he did this despite how important it was to you, or if he did this truly thinking it was okay. 

From what you have said, it seems like an honest enough mistake, but I don't know the intricacies of your lives together.

If this was an honest mistake and if he is truly sorry and understands that it hurt you, then i do have some advice moving forward. I recommend finding your next tree.

Decide what kind of tree you'd like to grow (and where). You can begin the tradition again with new memories. He can pick out a nice "modern" plaque or carved stone to attach to the tree or under it as a memorial to the tree your grandparents planted. You can have a memorial plaque that dedicates your new tree to Sally--the tree that honored your grandparents and was a part of your family, and that this tree is intended to provide comfort and companionship for your family and future families--thanks to Sally. 

If it's not too late, I would also recommend keeping some piece of Sally. Maybe a wood cutting or even just a small hunk of wood that you can keep for yourselves or turn into some kind of artwork, or even bury near your new tree. 

Best of luck to you. I know how much it can hurt when something like this happens. Try your best to move forward with your husband if this was an honest mistake. If he was reckless with your feelings purposefully, move on without him.. either way, Sally has done well during her lifetime and has now moved on to whatever comes next for her. Remember her fondly and in time the pain will leave you and loving memories will take its place.
If you truly think you can move past that with him and want to then definitely listen to the advice of other ppl here, especially the one person who said to have a funeral for the tree


But here’s my 2 cents: personally im not sure how’d I’d get past it, or at least get past it quickly, i have a lemon tree my great grandmother gave me, its not the biggest or in the ground yet but it was from her and if someone, especially someone i love, cut it down or anything id be so upset like you are 


If you want to move on from this with him here are somethings you should really consider:  did he know the importance of the tree to you and your family?  Why did he do it/wait until you were gone to cut the tree down?  and why did he dismiss your words and feelings instead of trying to apologize or comfort you how ever you needed in that moment?
That’s a big deal. Was he aware of the story of the tree and what it stood for, for you and your family? That would seem like a no brainer to me, to not cut it down. So you have every right to be sad. I’m sure your grandparents would want peace between you and your husband. So perhaps keep that in mind while you take the time to grieve. Maybe a little closure might help too? Perhaps you can hold some type of ceremony for the tree.
I can imagine how devastated you must be. There is possible hope depending on what species it is, (evergreens won’t though ) it may grow back. It wouldn’t look exactly the same but will still be that tree. Google to find out if your tree can grow back and if so ways to help it along. Another way is, if you still have branches you may be able to root them. Since some won’t take do many. Maybe, do it following a couple different methods to see what is most successful. Evergreens can also be grown-from cuttings. Start on it right away.
Either you made your feelings about the tree understood or not...

If no, I'm sorry for your loss, but you can't really blame him for not understanding it then.

If yes, then he did not only cut away that tree, he also disregarded your feelings about it.

But the question is why he might have disregarded it...

1. Maybe you didn't explain it well enough for him to truly understand it?

2. Maybe he's not an emotional person like that, and just cut it down without realizing how his actions might affect you in the moment he did it?

3. Maybe he didn't like the tree, and purposely demolished it because of it?

The first one is more excusable, but he should recognize your feelings and apologize regardless if he cares about your feelings. But then you should also admit that you have some fault in this, and that you were maybe overreacting to some degree towards him, when it's more about how you felt about your grandparents and that tree.

The second one, I think depends a bit on what you feel about him overall, but again - he should try to recognize your feelings regardless. Maybe he didn't grow up in a family like that, and don't know how to relate to it fully, so he sees objects more as objects, rather than objects of affection?

The third one is the worst, and I would say get away from him if that's the case...

In any case, you need to figure out how you feel about this, despite what you're feeling about him from the past, because likely he'll continue doing this kind of behavior in the future, if he does not admit any faults.

But if he's a bit stupid about that stuff, I think you owe it to him to explain it to him why it matters to you...

In the third case, it won't matter at all if you try to explain it, so that's why I said to get away from him in that case. Then he recognize your feelings fully, but choose to ignore it, for no other reason than his own egotism.
Did your husband save the tree trunk, or is any part of it still available?  I know it's not the same, but if he has, you could have a piece of furniture or some other structure made out of part of it. At least you will be able to see it and remember. You're definitely  NTA, though. I would have been fuming and heartbroken, too
I understand that you are heartbroken over the loss of the tree. But you’re mad at your husband because “he should have known I would not have wanted him to cut it down” which is bs. If you didn’t care what he did to the house, how should he know that you would care what happened to the garden. You need to grieve the loss of the tree without it ruining your marriage.
You need to talk to him about this. Did he know the trees’ significance? If so that’s psychotic to cut it down first thing.
Frankly, I could not get over this or let it go unless he acknowledged the horrible thing he did and offered a full genuine apology. And even then, IDK if I could let it go. 

This level of indifference and lack of consideration would kill the love I have for my partner. Is this a pattern of his? Does he generally ignore the things that matter to you and focus on what he wants instead?
if you are married, then it would be very weird if you never talked about that tree to your husband. so he most definitely knew about it and it’s sentimental value. then he proceeds to cut down the tree without consulting anyone, especially during your work trip. he probably knew that if you were home, you would put a stop to it. especially through how dismissive he was about your feelings when you confronted him. i don’t know about your relationship but from this post it really feels like he’s inconsiderate of your feelings, which imo is a big red flag.
Honestly, I think you need to put a halt to joint improvements into the house until you’ve sorted this out. 

Is your grandparents house protected and will stay with you in the event you divorce? With marital money being invested, you may lose the house, not just the tree. 

The tree is possibly a symptom of a bigger issue of passive aggressive disregard of you. Does he  do smaller things to get his way over yours? 

No one starts house renovations with a tree, unless you’re tearing the house down. That’s silly. Really, really silly to expect you to have contemplated the yard in house renos. 

He may have used the house discussion and found a loophole to justify getting away with cutting the tree without asking “hey does that include the yard?”

A couple of questions to get a sense of how egregious the tree situation is:

How close was the tree to the house (was is so close that there wasn’t a chance you could do house renovations without damaging it?) 

Was the tree dying/leaning toward to house?

Did he ever mention landscaping?

Did your husband have any sense of the sentimental value of the tree? If yes, he is physically demonstrating what he thinks of your feelings.
Plant a new tree together and it will grow along with your family. Take the opportunity to have your own tree. Let it go. You made that mistake of telling him he could do whatever. Just know he wouldn’t have cut down that tree if you said not to. So it wasn’t malicious. He is renovating and updating and usually home flippers will cut down trees too. It was innocent and he shouldn’t be punished for it.
He's making boss moves and denying family history is part of that 
I would have taken being told that I "could do whatever I wanted to the house" to include the entire property, including the yard. That being said, if my husband had told me the family history of the tree that you wrote about in the first few paragraphs I would not have removed it without assurances from him that it was okay. **Lots** of assurances and **lots** of my saying "are you *sure* it's okay to remove it." So... IMO you should let it go **if** he did **not** know the history of the tree. If he did know... I'm honestly not sure what to tell you.
I would give it time. It’s hard to make a rational decision of what you want to do when your emotionally raw and angry. 

Your feelings are valid and if you decide it’s a dealbreaker that’s valid too. 

You can’t “just let it go.” Has been acknowledged what he did and apologized? Has he made any efforts to fix it or make it up to you? I think you should definitely evaluate his character based on this situation to help you make a decision.
Get more involved in the renovations right now otherwise you will be miserable as more things change in the house you inherited. Look at what you like and what it means to you so that it holds something of your grandparents memory if you want some memory of them/your family in the house. If you don’t care, you don’t care. And communicate what you want/don’t want otherwise he will just do what he thinks. Agree there could be something else going on here if he meant to do it to upset you on purpose and that’s horrible.
Find an agronomist and check if the tree can be salvaged. Sometimes those f4ckers can survive even with the roots outside the ground..

As for your husband, if it were me, I would ask before even caressing the tree, since i can understand the significance the tree has to you.
I find it odd he not communicating you what renovation he will be doing. 

If I was me and my wife would give me full freedom on what to renovate I would still communicate how I plan to change things just to be sure.
First of all I'm assuming that your husband knew how important this tree was to you and your family. And his very first action was to cut it down? Yeah that was not accidental, it was a power play on his part and you really need to divorce this motherfucker over it. And the fact that he completely seems to lack remorse even now? Why are you with someone who cares so little about you?
Bets this is ragebait
Don't just let it go dear.....why he cut the tree..he doesn't own the house....

Why he want to change backyard....

Why he want to ruined your memories of past?
Did your husband know of the significance of the tree. It seems odd to cut down such an important part of the family history
Do what you want was the comment you made. He is not a mind reader, nor does he have the memories attached to it that you and your family had. Tell him that as part of the updating you want an outdoor family area and to plant a new family tree for your family to grow with. Our 200 year old tree had to be cut down this year and the bare spot is still startling, but it’s also the start of something new. Once the stump decays some we have bushes and plants planned.
If you love him, my only advice is to plant another tree, together.
Plant a new tree  :)
Did he really not know your feelings about the tree, or is this just another example in a long list of them where he’s chosen to hurt you but had plausible deniability all lined up?

Only you can know the answer, but if it’s the latter, get out.

Partners who engage in subtle sadism never, ever reform, they just get sneakier.
Are you wanting advice? Haven’t seen any replies.
Well tbh op you are the one who made the mistake telling your husband they were able to renovate your family's house. From the sound of things you didnt want any part of the renovation. Saying you can do anything to the house also gives him the go ahead to do anything. Your husband lacks awareness because he shouldn't have cut the tree down. But overall op you gotta take some accountability with the way you worded it to him.
OP doesn’t say if he knew how sentimental the tree was
It's not clear if your husband knew the significance of the tree or not so cannot comment on that part. 

I suggest you and your family plant a new tree, or trees using grafts from the tree he cut down if at all possible. If the tree is still there could you make something from the wood?
Idk why he wouldn't think to at least ask because I'm sure he knows the meaning behind that tree... I'm sad for you.. 

At the very least make him make things out of the tree.. I hope he didn't burn it or something. Least your grandparents tree would provide something for you that you could pass down.
Eh you’re relying on semantics w the house bit. Not super honest, you simply didn’t think to mention not touching the tree. 

What remains is why he was unaware of the importance of the tree, if it was mentioned and he was aware then it’s flippant disregard, i kinda get the vibe he simply didn’t know
First, Im sorry for the loss of your grandparents and for the tree that represented so much for your family.

Second, I don't think it's silly at all that you and your family had an emotional attachment to this tree, and more importantly what it represented. My family did the same thing when they came to the U.S. from The Ukraine after escaping the Soviet Union decades ago. The house they built still stands as do many of the trees that they plants. Some of the trees planted in the yard that they have planted have since died from various ways (storms, old age, etc.) And I can tell you it hurt a lot having to see those trees taken down and feeling like a family memory was being erased.

Does your husband know how important this tree was to your family? Even if the answer is yes, he obviously doesn't get or didn't care enough to understand what this tree represented to your family so I would show him. I would show him all the pictures of you and your family around the tree over the yrs, share the happy memories you and your family had around the tree (playing, having picnics, talking, etc.), and as calmly as you can try to explain to him what that felt like to have him just rip that away from you and your family without even speaking to anyone and waiting till you were gone on a business trip. You can even try to compare what this tree represented to you and your family by  finding/thinking of something that's super important to him and his family, and then ask him how he would feel if you went and destroyed it behind his back and never considered his or his family's feelings on the matter.

However you decide to go about this I hope you find something that works for the both of you to try and mend your relationship again and to bring peace back into your guy's household.
Honest to God, and I usually loathe Reddit's history of telling people to leave their spouses...

I would leave him and get him out of your family home. 

He went directly to the tree and chopped it off intentionally. It's your family and that relationship he's severed whether he meant to or not. 

You'll never forgive this and he won't genuinely want it. 

There's more to the tree than the branches. He has issues ans your issue is to get rid of him before he burns the hoise down and calls it an upgrade.
My daughter was 4 when she first said “I don’t trust the government” and it was over the township threatening to cut down our tree. She was furious, and I understand it was definitely special, owls would sit there at night, a raven visited it and it had a squirrel nest too. I’m mad at your husband too, but did he know the significance and how did he respond to you being upset? He does sound ungrateful to begin with, I would struggle to tell my husband that I hate the style of his grand parent’s house if we inherited it.
Although he was told to do whatever, something like this or any big renovation should be discussed to be sure that both of you will be happy in the end. It’s  not worth destroying your marriage. Maybe go look for another tree together and replant it in your grandparents honor.
It’s understandable that your husband may not have fully grasped the deep significance the tree had for you and your family. Sometimes, we can overlook the emotional value attached to things like a tree, especially when we focus on making practical changes. However, the deed is done, and unfortunately, there's no way to bring the tree back.

What you can do now is communicate openly with him. Explain why you’re upset and help him understand how much that tree meant to you, not just as part of the house but as part of your family's legacy. He may not have realized the emotional weight his actions carried, and it’s important for him to acknowledge that.

One way to move forward could be to plant two trees together in its place—creating something new that both of you can cherish and grow, just like your relationship. While this situation is understandably painful, it’s important to ensure that such sentimental attachment doesn’t overshadow the happiness and love you share in your marriage. This way, you honor the past while also building a future together.
Look, I get it—you’re emotionally tied to that tree because it represents family history, memories, and your connection to your grandparents. It’s not about the tree itself, it’s about what it symbolizes. But here’s the cold truth: your husband didn’t respect that, and that tells you a lot about where you stand in the relationship. You gave him permission to renovate the house, but there’s a difference between redecorating and erasing something with that much emotional weight.

At the end of the day, this is about respect. If he can’t respect what matters to you, especially something so deep and symbolic, how much does he actually care about your feelings? He didn’t think twice before making that call, and now you’re left feeling resentful. Resentment kills relationships faster than anything else, and it doesn’t just go away.

So what’s next? You’ve got to have a hard conversation—not just about the tree, but about what kind of man you need in your life. If he doesn’t get why that tree mattered, chances are he doesn’t get a lot of other things either. Maybe what you really need is someone who understands not just your past, but your needs as a partner. Go find yourself a real man who can give you what you need, in every way—including someone who can make you feel alive and who respects what’s important to you, not just a guy who wants to make everything look modern for his own ego.

At the end of the day, you deserve someone who cares about your satisfaction, not just in life, but in every way.
even the fallen tree can't.
To be fair you didn’t specify never to touch the tree. Sounds like he should have known the sentiment of the tree? If he had no clue how precious the tree was to you, honest mistake on his part. But if he did know and did it anyways…
I’m sorry you lost Sally. I wish things had not happened that way and your loss is valid. However, I don’t think a tree is more valuable than your spouse. I haven’t seen “Sally” so I can’t speak on the proximity to the home or if there may have been a threat of damage due to a storm or potential damage to future renovations that *you* authorized. I hope you move forward from this. You’re not getting Sally back, and it would be a shame for you to suffer two losses. I agree with the posts that said to plant another tree. That may help you heal. Also, maybe you can gather copies of all the pictures with Sally and have a tree-shaped frame filled with your memories created by a local woodworker.
Yeah divorce his ass. He is toxic.
I think the option for your husband to review his renovation plans before executing them would be well within the bounds of him doing whatever he likes. In not considering this, he hasn’t considered you. 
Did he cut down the tree to hurt you? Probably not. 
I think it was more to make a point. Maybe he feels like he’s not being heard in your relationship, and retaliated but trying to alienate you, both in terms of information and emotion. 
Either way, it’s worth opening up this conversation with your husband, perhaps with a couples therapist? Best of luck and ❤️

P.S. there is nothing silly about loving a tree! My grandparents also had a tree that felt like a family member. Luckily she’s still standing (but nameless).
If you’ve been married for years, you two should have better communication. Why would you not specify that the tree is special to you and your family and that he can do whatever he wants to the house BUT NOT THE TREE? Why would he not TELL YOU exactly what improvements or renovations that he’ll be doing to the house? Terrible communication. My advice is to talk to each other so you can get it off your chest about how you feel and move on. He should also apologize. Use this as a learning moment so that you have better communication in the future.
Did he know how much that tree meant to you?
It’s not the tree. You don’t like him and resent him for who he is. You won’t gain the respect back for him that’s for sure. Might as well just divorce
It sounds like you're going through a tough time. It’s important to express how you feel to your husband; communication is key in any relationship. I had a similar experience where I had to talk openly about a disagreement, and it really helped us understand each other better.
Did you even tell him about the tree?!
is he genuinely remorseful or is he making this out like "it's no big deal", making excuses?
Was he aware of the significance of your ‘family tree.’  Did you specifically tell him about it yourself… cause if he didn’t know and you didn’t explain it to him… then he’s correct.  You told him using broad a language to have at it. Which is what he did. 

I don’t think this about a tree…
He is tired of hearing about that damn tree, but now, he will never hear the end of it.
See if you can germinate something from the tress cuttings/ roots
Id probably kick him out
I SO understand the love and attachment for this tree OP. I’m incredibly sentimental because I lost many things form my childhood, so things that hold memories are huge for me. 

I also am deeply in love with a man on the spectrum so I could understand how a miscommunication could have tragic consequences. It would be hard for me to let go even if I knew he had no ill intentions. 

First: it’s completely ok to grieve. Being mad at your spouse is a separate emotion from grieving, and probably a more convenient feeling to have than sadness. Anger won’t help you heal and it also won’t help to just “not be angry”. Your energy should focus on proper grief. 

The memories your grandparents created are alive as long as the stories are told. Could you honor the memory in some way? 

Throwing out ideas: Maybe a sign made to honor Sally. Especially if the stump is there, something mentioning “Sally 1970-2024 Withstanding everything but a well meaning but too eager of a husband making a new home for new memories with his family.”

Something silly like that, but also holds Sally in high regards. You could even plant a new tree with a placard that says “Sally’s predecessor…that fits the modern aesthetic” 

The tree would have come down eventually, sadly. There is now a story to go with it. Grief and honor your grandparents by being determined to keep your family memories well preserved!
What kind of tree? Is it still in tact? Mill it and make a nice table out of it if you can.
I going with the contrary opinion here.  He asked and gave him blanket approval.  “He should have known” is not a plausible excuse.  He can’t read your mind.  Here’s a tip for communicating with thick headed men.  We don’t pick up nuances and innuendo like your girl friends do.  We are much more literal.  You needed to say something like “do what ever you want to the house but that tree stays.”  Or better yet, let’s go over to the house and you tell me your plans.   We love the opportunity to fire up a chain saw or a backhoe and you gave him all the approval he needed.
I think the issue is less that he cut down the tree (although I really sympathize with how much that must have sucked)

And more that he seems genuinely unable to understand why it's so upsetting to you?? Nothing is going to be solved without communication. Something big like this left unspoken will only lead to resentment. Good luck!!
I’m assuming he knew the family significance?? 
This is hella weird to me. And I get wanting to do renovations but considering it’s a family home, ANY renovations inside or out I would get approval from you on bc it is a family home. Like maybe I want to paint a door white but there’s markings of growth in the inside so I could leave that and paint around etc etc there can be a balance. 

I’m particular about my aesthetics and space but I would never make a change in a shared home without my husbands opinion or input so we can collaborate and compromise. 

If I were you I’d be hella mad and upset to. 

Idk what the fix is but me personally I would never be with anyone who cuts down an OLD LARGE TREE for modern back yard design let alone one with so much significance. I chose my hubby bc he loves nature as much as me and old things as much as me. 

It also seems like part of the answer is he needs to stop being in denial that he did something wrong and he needs to properly apologize. He is defensive and rude about it which makes you more upset. Regardless of his intention it upset you and he needs to take accountability. 

And if he knows what is good for him he would dig up the stump and keep the lumber to make soemthing like a cool chest or bench in memory of your grandparents. And plant a new tree.
OK, don't listen to the reddit hivemind, they're being as stupid as always.

This is nothing but a simple misunderstanding. When your husband said he wanted to renovate, he clearly, and understandably meant the whole thing, not just the building. Renovation commonly includes the garden area. You're not going to pretty up a house but leave the garden alone. You told him he could do whatever he wants, so he has done precisely that. You didn't give him any restrictions, you gave him carte blanche.

Sure, there is an argument for whether he should have been more aware, or should have double checked, but nothing you said really says that he every truly understood how much that tree meant to you, so it's not a surprise that he didn't double check. But even if he did know, to him it seems like you've given him permission.

This is just a communication issue, no nore, no less. If you want to repair this particular rift, you need to be ready to accept your part in this, accept that you made some fairly significant mistakes. If you can't do that, you'll spend all your time blaming your husband, who, quite frankly, is largely innocent in all this. He cocked up, but it's an innocent mistake, not some evil, underhanded, ma ipulativr move like the idiotic hivemind would have you believe.

Talk to each other, accept your part in it, and use it as a time to bond, not to place blame and build resentment.
You did mention that he could do anything. I think you should’ve mentioned something about NOT doing something to the tree. If you are pissed and he’s aware he should apologize.
Had you, prior to this, CLEARLY indicated the tree was of great sentimental value to you and was the ONE thing he could not change about the house, (which I would have interpreted as involving the yard, the landscaping, the lawn or the interior or exterior of the house) when you said you didn't give a damn and he could paint it bright blue if he wanted?

It doesn't matter if it was in all the family photos, I guarantee you a guy isn't paying attention to the tree in the background in an old family photo. He's half-ass looking at the people in it, and trying to make polite comments, because none of us actually want to go through old family photos with anybody but our childhood family. And 90% of the time, we don't want to do it with our families either. 

I get that it was important to you, and your brothers and sisters might have innately understood how much sentimental value it had for you, but I sincerely doubt that it was clearly impressed upon him. And saying that he should have known, is claiming that he is possessed of telepathy.

I have totally renovated multiple properties, and if there was something critical in the yard, people deliberately pointed out what they wanted to retain. If you didn't do this, you have every right to be sad, but you don't have any right to be mad at him.

And you owe him an apology for shitting all over him when you found it.
Was it communicated to him how much this tree meant? Like actually communicated?

Because if he knew how much the tree meant and didn't call you, he seems like a bad person.

But I don't get the vibe he would do something like that to something so special and not think to ask.

Since the deed has been done already, would it be possible to incorporate the tree into the house somehow to have it stay with you?
Tell your dickhead husband every tree provides enough oxygen cleaning for a family of four. He just killed four people's air and added to the greenhouse effect. Then, buy a new tree and make him replant it in the same place. And make sure the tree is about ten feet tall, like his attitude.
Your husband sounds awful. I wouldn’t know
How to move forward. It’s BLATANT ignorance on his part.

The fucked is part is HE should be the one asking Reddit. We can’t fix anything for you because you’re not the problem
It’s not strange that he assumes that when you say you can do anything to the house he includes the yard. I understand it’s difficult for you, but he is in no way unreasonable. Also, you’re saying he could do anything to the house, but I wonder whether that’s true. If he had torn down all the walls of the house you’d probably be angry too. In hindsight it’s easy for you to say: “I said just the house”, but I’m curious if at the time of you telling him he could do anything, you were actually thinking that he shouldn’t touch the yard. I think you could reflect on what you actually meant at the time and what you think you meant in hindsight after the situation got uncomfortable for you.

Regarding your husband, he should be kind and understanding. This tree was emotionally significant to you and it hurts you that it’s gone. A good partner creates space when you’re experiencing such emotions. Also, he should make space for you experiencincing anger towards him. However, I don’t believe he owes you an apology for cutting the tree. An apology implies he did something wrong and I don’t believe he did, except not showing any understanding when you were hurt. He didn’t know he shouldn’t have cut it and it was not weird of him to include the yard.
It IS a big issue. It’s a massive act of disrespect toward you. The way be reacted afterwards was more disrespect. 

There are many, many kinds of trees that will regrow after being cut down. Look into this about your tree. 

Btw I’m getting from your post (unlike the aliens in this comment section) that you told your husband about the tree’s meaning to you, like almost everyone would have done. You said he should have known. That means he was told.
Could have missed something but I didn’t see where it was explained that he knew about that tree, or specifically which one it was. Could have been an easy (but tragic) accident? If he did know about the tree then that seems hateful to cut it down. Maybe see a couples counselor on how to move forward from this if you still want to fix things
He’s a very inconsiderate man. Don’t marry him.
He better start building furniture with that tree
Gonna go a little against the grain here, I think it's just gross miscommunication. You literally told him he could do whatever he wanted. He decided on a backyard project, maybe wanted to build like a patio area or something, idk. But you told him, do whatever you want, which he stated and you stated. To say you can't stand your husband because of a tree, that you most definitely did not explain the importance of to him, is wild. It's a tree, he's your husband. Unless you explicitly told him don't touch the tree, he's not a mindreader. I'm almost on the husband's side except he kind of shut down your feelings when you found out. Instead of apologizing he got really defensive. Would it have made it better if he apologized? Idk, probably not, but unfortunately you can't uncut the tree. So I feel like this is one of those situations where like.... it sucks but what can you do about it? A cut tree would not make me hate the love of my life lol. More like just some disappointment and then move on. Plant a new tree?? Fresh start new memories deal? Idk the whole situation just kind of sucks
Absolutely do not let that go. If your husband knew your family history and the meaning of the tree and cut it down without asking that is incredibly insensitive. He has a lot of nerve being unsatisfied with a free home from your family. You can kick him to curb anytime. 
You can back out at anytime. You don’t have to stay in a relationship with someone who is so inconsiderate and ungrateful. If you want this relationship to work couples counseling can help you two to better communicate. But he’s in the wrong here, he should apologize and recognize why you are so heartbroken.
What kind of cruel man waits until you leave to take down such a sentimental item? 

Selfish, entitled, *cruel* people. 

Ask yourself if being with a man like that is worth it. He’ll only hurt you more as time goes on.
If he was never made aware of the importance of the tree then this is a simple misunderstanding, and as much as the tree meant to you and your family, you’re going to need to let this one go.
So did you ever tell him how important the tree was to you or not? That is entirely relevant to the situation  lol
You’re pretty valid for feeling the way you do. 

I think one big question to ask is if your husband knew how much the tree meant to you.

If he didn’t, it was just a huge mistake and the two of you need to find a way to honor Sally and your grandparents together that does it justice through the renovations without placing blame on each other. 

If it was intentional and he did know, then that was a huge consent violation and I recommend taking some time with a trusted outsider (therapist/friend/etc) to go over patterns of abuse in your relationship.
Did he know about it before he cut it down?

Has he done other things to undermine what you value in the past?

I’m curious because I’ve experienced things like this with different people and it can be different depending on their patterns of behavior and personality. 

I’ve definitely had someone do something like this on purpose with the intention to hurt me for the sake of control. 

On the other hand, he could be completely thoughtless. 

Regardless of sentiment, i would he upset because trees provide so much value and take a long time to grow.
Hi OP, you could cut down your husband while the tree is on a work trip.

Hope this helps!

Best wishes
I mean being angry won't really change the tree or the husband and physical objects, although are super sentimental, come and go. 

I'd forgive him and just explain you now want to be part of each and every decision.
he did it on purpose.
Your husband is shit
Did they know the tree had that much significance? This wasn't relayed in your post unless I missed it somewhere.
What species of tree was it?  Why did he say he wanted to cut it down?  
If the tree is was more important than your relationship, then stay mad i guess.
Ok, just gotta know. Did your husband actually know all the trees history? Most people do not care about a tree in their yard so a bunch of pictures probably would not have told him the significance. Also, he is correct in you said anything. There is too much room for miscommunication when you say house but someone renovating is thinking “property”.

Ultimately, if he truly was aware of its significance. Yeah he is at fault. Such a quick way to turn the entire family against you. Also how are you not aware of the planning? You should be and both of you should be communicating on it.
It is a big issue .. a huge fucking issue! I wouldn’t be able to forgive him
You never say if he knew the significance of the tree
LOL, "He should have known"?!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Let it go. You told him you could do anything, and if that tree was truly so important to you you should've said "anything but the tree". I would've with something so valuable to me.
OP, was your husband at any point ever explicitly told not to touch the tree?
Haven't read every comment, so I'm sorry if it's redundant...
As meaningful and as awful it is that you lost the tree, maybe you can both heal the relationship by planting a new one? Essentially a continuation of the love your grandparents had, but also of significance to you and your husband. Any symbol of love that is material will eventually fade, but the love that was had endures forever. Honor your grandparents by taking the loss of the tree and create a new tradition by you and your husband planting a new one, and you can watch it grow as your love and marriage grows with your husband.
Even if he wasn't explicitly told not to do it, he should have still checked with you before cutting it down. That's a major step to take, and to just do it without your input is bonkers.

Did he apologize at all? Did he show any interest in your feelings? Or did he just defend what he did? Because if he can't take a moment to acknowledge what this meant to you then he's being heartless.
If your husband knew how much this tree meant to you it looks like he has done this deliberately to get at you for some reason. Try to find out what the reason is.
My ex cuts trees down as a job, it's *very* expensive. It's ridiculously expensive, especially a mature healthy big tree. If your husband was so worried about the inside of the house being dated, why on earth would he spend thousands of dollars cutting down a tree instead of renovating the house? It makes no sense and seems extremely intentional.
My brother did a similar thing when I had inherited both of my grandparents home and a rental property. I decided to give their home to my brother and his wife as a baby gift. There was a large bush in the front side yard that my grandmother and I had planted the day I moved in with them instead of my father and his wife. My brother cut down the bush. I was a complete mess and almost stopped the transfer of the house over it. But I learned from a landscaper that I could take some starts from branches and buy this stuff that makes them grow roots and was able to start the bush over in my own yard. It's not the same bush. But it's a part of the old one with a new story and memory to treasure. Because I was able to plant the new bush with my own daughter. Maybe see if you can do the same not sure if you can with trees. Or buy a new tree sprout to plant with your husband so it grows with your love and new family. In memory of your amazing grandparents.
I don’t really have good advice just know you’re not alone. Many a man has done something dumb like this and many a woman has never been able to understand how. I feel your pain! I would be devastated 💔
Him and my wife should hang out. She always is throwing away our kids stuff and mine that have emotional value tied to it. But I get where she is coming from.

She didn’t grow up with emotional connections to material items like I was. She literally doesn’t understand the significance it has to me. 

Some can’t really blame her for being cold or doing it as revenge, it’s just that she doesn’t understand why I like what I like. But I’m the same with her and her shoe collection.
Knowing Reddit I'm honestly surprised the most up voted comment isn't calling for divorce
The house is too old looking and out dated for him…. So he cuts down a tree outside of the house??????? Nah.. I’d be heart broken even if the tree didn’t have sentimental value to me.
The biggest problem I see here is that it doesn't sound like he validated your feelings at all. If it was a misunderstanding and he cared that he hurt you, he wouldn't have shifted the blame to you.

This is honestly really fucked up imo.
I totally get where you coming from because we had many trees that my dad planted and had to cut many down….sadly he passed years ago…sometimes we have to just plant new trees and start new memories… 

“She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her.”

Omg I'm so sorry for your loss. This whole thing sucks. I know you said he could do anything he wants to the house, and sympathetically, I personally wouldn't think the yard is included in "the house." But then again, that's me since I don't believe they're one in the same. Obviously, your husband does, which is frustrating for him, too.

Might I suggest couple's therapy? That way, you can both learn how to talk to each other constructively about this for starters. Otherwise, the impasse of this feeling of loss will create a growing bitterness between both of you. 

I'm sympathetic and my heart hurts for you.
Did you ever ever tell your husband about that tree
Tree removal for a large, old tree is an expensive thing, and the lead time on such a project is usually several weeks. I can't believe he didn't discuss the finances and timing of it if he thought it was an OK thing to do. 

OP, he knew you'd be upset. He did it in secret so that it would be done while you were gone.
@burbnboujie
Believe it or not, straight to marriage jail!
Sounds like he wanted an out of the relationship and knew a way to make it happen
You have to take accountability for the fact that you fucked up too. It's a rather understandable miscommunication: most people would take "you can do whatever you want to that house" to mean _the property_ itself and that yard things are just accessories to a house. Since you didn't also say something like "that tree (/and the bones of the house/and the X room or loft) is the only thing all my memories are super attached to" then he feels he was given the wrong instructions and was attacked unfairly.

Once you have internalized and explained your part in creating a tragedy though, your feelings of loss are indeed still valid and he should be able to commiserate with you and wish your conversations had played out differently. If he can't address your feelings or it's like he was going to bug you until you let him cut the tree down either way, then barring some impactful things that weren't mentioned like the tree was dying or was a sweet gum or silver maple or one of many species often regarded as destructive or occasionally putrid to some people, then he's being an asshole.

Tldr "can't stand my husband because we miscommunicated and he cut down a tree" is an asshole take, but "can't stand my husband because he refuses to acknowledge my feelings over a tree I have family history with" is not. Take it far from the arena of blaming him and see if you can get the emotional support you actually need from him. Or if he's already been doing that and you didn't mention it, you actually need to get over it.
I am so sorry, and honestly I don't know how yo get over that. I have been setting here trying to imagine it but nothing. I wish you luck and hope you find some resolution.  Hugs.
I don’t have much advice to give but if there are any leaves or branches or even a stump that you can get your hands on then maybe you can turn them into some jewelry or other items to keep and give to family members. I’m so sorry he did that, but there is a chance it was just a misunderstanding. If so, therapy/counseling would definitely be the way to go. Good luck to you.
Something like that could actually make me look at the person that I love completely differently.  Not because he cut down the tree, but because he ignored the significance of it to you and didn't even bother to call and check. This gives me the ick for your husband and I don't even know him.....
This would be a complete deal breaker for me. Kick the husband out. Plant a new tree.
Sweet FSM. When we moved into our place it had been a rental for decades and there were three fruit trees that had been abused and neglected so badly that we had to remove them. But we still consulted extensively about each one because trees are awesome and deserve to be conserved.

People who murder trees recklessly should not be allowed.
You need to tell him exactly what that tree meant to you and your family, and he needs to replace it. If he gives you any shit over it, tell him to get out. I know how that feels. Some lawn care guys thought my fig tree was dead and practically destroyed it, I cried every time I looked at it for a couple of years. It took about a decade for it to come back
It’s not about the tree, OP. I’m sorry.
Here's what I'm stuck on: 

1. You said he could do anything he wanted, not anything he wanted EXCEPT for messing with the tree. Often, home improvement projects and updates span into the yards and include landscaping. You admit in your post that you believed your word choice would be clear--but that is an assumption. You made an assumption that saying "do anything you want" without specifying "to the house structure itself" or "without messing with the tree or yard" meant your husband would read your mind on the last parts. 

2. You haven't clarified whether your husband actually knew the significance of this tree. He might even have an understanding of "they really like this tree" without understanding the FULL extent that would go beyond "but they might like what my plans are even better". 

3. Did he apologize when the misunderstanding and full meaning of the tree was disclosed (assuming it was disclosed rather than you immediately yelling at him for something you technically gave him permission to do by omittance)? Has he been sorry to hurt you/your family in this way, or has he doubled down? (Or, has he only doubled down because the significance has still not been fully explained and just assumed?)

Because yeah, there are several ways this can go where your husband is the asshole. There are also a couple of ways this could go where you're the asshole or at the very least weren't as clear as you should have been. 

At the very least, I recommend a therapist for letting go of your resentment and to work on the obvious communication gaps between you and your husband. (Whether you make being more clear a personal goal for you or make it a couples'counseling goal together.)
There's nothing in this that says you made it clear that tree was important. "You say he "should have known", but don't say what you did to convey that importance.

I'd also like to point out that you said "I was fortunate enough to inherit their house", clearly stating house when you meant the entire property. That's a very common thing to do, you did it right there. It's very understandable he would interpret you saying he could do whatever with the house as the entire property. And be honest, if he hadn't touched the tree, but had done other landscaping projects, would you be upset with him for going beyond what you gave permission for?

This is a big misunderstanding about what seems to be an accident. He needs to have way more sympathy with what this means to you. That's the part I would focus on. Not blaming him for a misunderstanding.
If I was the husband I would be legitimately horrified to have done something to cause you pain, regardless of if I didn't know it would. My main focus would be how to make things right, not arguing that I was technically correct based on what you said...

That said, his reaction partially depends on how you addressed the issue. If you fly in there belittling him or telling him what he says is invalid, you're not showing compassion for the one you love and it's not surprising he would get defensive. 

To summarize, you should've put each other's feelings first. But there's still time to do that now.
Did he know the history of that tree with your family?
This is wild. I don't think I could forgive this. Every time I saw a nice tree I would be reminded of what he did :(
Your husband is a moron. Sorry OP. This was so sad to read. He just destroyed a place that had so much sentimental value not just to you but to your family. I would tell him he cant do anything anymore. He doesnt even care that he ruinee it, he is still talking about his stupid renovations. Who cares what he says, he needs to go eat crow for destroying a living family heirloom. God im so mad for you!
This seems like another one of those ads for OnlyFans
"He shouldn't known I wouldn't have wanted him to cut it down?"


Why? How? Did you mention not to cut it down? Did you mention it was important to you? Did he not consider your feelings, or did you not express them?
If it meant that much to you, you should have said, "except for the tree".

So many times, we expect each other to read our minds, and no one can do that.

You're literally mad that he can't read your mind, and that's not fair.

This is real life. You have to communicate clearly, and you can't blame someone for not knowing what you never told them. 

Men are literal. He took you at your word, and now, to him, you're acting crazy. He must be so confused!
Oh he was aware of the significance of that tree. You marry someone you make an effort to know what the history is of that family to usually not do any faux pas to avoid becoming persona non grata with your in-laws. 

He most definitely wanted to send a big “FU!” to his in-laws and OP. And then plays dumb about it. Sounds like your husband’s true colors are coming out now that he thinks the house is “his” house. Divorce him. He’s going to try to keep the house. He’s getting antagonistic to you and it’s really he’s one of those problem that dates someone specifically to see how much they can financially gain from the relationship. And they start doing stunts like that to antagonize people like OP just to psychologically screw with you.

You’re like “why would you do that?” And they play dumb. Then they do something crazier. And then gaslight you that they didn’t know it was a big deal and get you paranoid that you’re overreacting, that it was an “accident.” The “accidents” escalate until you get used to the toxicity of them doing horrible stuff to you. And then it’s insane when you look back that you saw the red flags and how you were trained to get used to being exploited like that. Like a frog getting boiled.
I'm confused. Nowhere in this post do you mention your husband knowing the significance of the tree to you.

Feels like that should've been an obvious thing to include if he did. Did he always think it's just a casual thing you appreciated? Did he know that you had attached significant sentimental value to it?

All-in-all, I'm going against the grain and leaning towards you being at fault here. When things are important to you, you should always be explicit in saying what's off-limits. I've got no idea your communication style so solely going off of what's written, you gave him the complete green-light with no restrictions and he did what he wanted which was the normal thing for him to have done given that.
OP, you really need to tell us if he knew how much you treasured “Sally.” A lot hinges on that. I think he did, otherwise you wouldn’t be seeking advice about it.
Make something from the wood of the tree and plant your own tree to look at, forgive him after a good frosting
INFO: does he often do things to weaken your links to friends and family in an attempt to isolate you, or was this a one-off?
Are there any branches left around? Could you take some cuttings?
The tree isn’t really the issue (although I really relate to your sadness and shock about it).

The issue is your husband invalidating your feelings over the tree and not apologising or not seeming to show any genuine remorse (as far as I can tell from your post. Maybe I’m wrong).

If he is often like this, then this is something you need to deal with. The tree is maybe the catalyst to you realising that he devalues your feelings.

It’s not about the tree, it’s about how he handles things when you are in grief, shock and distress. 
You did not disclose if you discussed the history and how special the tree was to you and your family with your husband. This was not a chop the tree down in rebellion. It was a lack of communication, on your part. Maybe you can discuss the history with your husband and have him plant a new tree. Best of luck🍀
In my view, this is a pretty monumental mess up on your husband's part. However, it's not unrecoverable. Has the wood from the tree already been hauled away? If not, perhaps you can take the wood and either have slabs cut from it to make a dining room table? Basically, that tree grew with your family, can it now be turned into a gathering spot for your family?

If that wood has been chipped or hauled off, then the only acceptable answer at this point is to plant a new tree. That tree can be symbol of the house and the family moving into it's new generations. Plant a beautiful garden around it that includes some of the plants and flowers your grandparents loved, add some of the plants and flowers that your parents love, and some that you love. That would create a multi-generational garden that represents the generations of growth the tree represented. 

I hope your husband has a modicum of realization how hugely impactful his actions are to your family and its traditions. If my family had a tree like that and my partner cut it down, he wouldn't be welcome at family gathers again.
I understand you pain and sediment. Unless the tree was dead or it's roots ruining the foundation of your house... your husband shouldn't had touched it. This is one of those things that can never be repaired or replaced. It's time you wake up and realize your husband doesn't care about you emotionally or physically.
I'm not sure I could ever forgive him. If you had told him how you felt about the tree in its history and he cut it down for me that would be the end of the relationship. There's a tree in my hometown that is now absolutely huge. When my uncle was a little boy he found this little tree that was about 3 inches high and he pulled it up by the roots and put them in his pocket and at night my grandmother would wrap it in a paper towel because he couldn't decide where he wanted to plant it. He finally did. And that tree is still there and every time I go back to my hometown we drive by and look at that tree but we all grew up underneath it. My generation and my children I grew up loving that tree so much. I can't even imagine seeing it cut down. I am so sorry. That was so mean of him.
Your husband is an asshole. There's no way he didn't know how important that tree is to you. 

Let alone him beelining to cutting it down as the FIRST thing he did. 

He sounds like a vindictive manipulative prick.
Divorce.
break something he loves and pretend he told you it was ok, not healthy but it sure would feel good.
Why did he pick the one thing that he knew held a lot of importance….. and he done it while you were away! Rather convenient don’t you think I
Well, let’s just say that it’s good for the divorce to have inherited the house.
If he knew how much the tree meant to you and cut it down anyways then I completely understand the feeling. 

If he had no clue the tree meant anything to you and cut it down because he was trying to make the property look nice even though it's sad the tree is gone you should try to realise he didn't do anything to intentionally hurt you and try to forgive him. 

It's not always easy to forgive but when there were no bad intentions it was a communication issue and he did not do anything wrong. If he did it intentionally knowing it would hurt you then you have to figure out if he wants you to be happy and if he doesn't then you should not forgive him and it might be time to move on. 

This is only one thing so it might not be time for a divorce yet but if he doesn't want you to be happy there are serious issues in the marriage.
When we were moving states for husband's job, we could only afford to bring about 1/4of our belongings. Some we sold or gave away, and more important things were stored in the basement of the house we rented out to friends. There was plenty of room. 

One afternoon I noticed my husband and young son tending to a small fire. I smiled, but then I noticed that they were burning a very detailed model of the destroyer my dad served on. My dad was rendered a quadriplegic after an airplane crash. He would never build another model. And I spent months locating the specific destroyer. I was Angry. Betrayed. Devastated. This happened over 30 years ago and it still makes my heart hurt.
Kick his ass out the door
Trees are family I completely understand ur rage and grief 💖
It's just a tress. Let go of your material attachments. Life is fleeting, don't let nostalgia stunt you.
He knew exactly what he was doing and that's why he did it while you were gone. 

He totally disrespected you. He's got absolutely no regard for YOU, YOUR FAMILY OR YOUR FAMILY'S HISTORY. 

 This incident says SO MUCH about him as a person and your relationship. 

Honestly, I can truly say, I would kick him out. I would file for divorce. To cut down my grandparents tree. OMG.
He knew the significance of tree right? Well tell you’re husband the house renovation shit is done. You gave him a fun project and he immediately ruined it like a child left alone with someone’s birthday cake. I think it’s only fair to tell him he can’t work on the project anymore since you CANT TRUST HIS JUDGEMENT. Seriously a fucking toddler would know not to cut down “grandpa/grandmas tree”. I’m sorry more so for the fact he can’t step up and apologize for fucking up. He messed up he should apologize there is no “both sides here” what did he think was gonna happen when he cut down you’re family’s tree? Seriously aghhhh! (Coming from someone a family tree)
I would be incredibly super upset about this too. It's not silly in the slightest. :(
Did he know that the tree meant a lot to you. If not, then, not his fault. But if he purposely knew, even if you mentioned it once, then that’s truly messed up.
Your husband is telling you exactly how much he cares about and respects you and your family. It would be best if you listen to that and learn now. Consult a lawyer about how to make sure he doesn’t end up with any ownership claim on the house since it was an inheritance. (Paying for upgrades/repairs may make him eligible in some part depending upon your state’s laws)
Sorry, I can’t give any advice because I would be at least as angry as you are. 

But what I would like to point out is that if your husband doesn’t even know you well enough to know that this tree was so important to you because of its history, I think you have a much deeper problem. 

Also, your whole way of seeing the world, what’s important to you and what you expect from life doesn’t really seem to fit together. You sound to me like a very solid person who doesn’t attach much importance to appearances, looks and prestige, which he seems to do. Doesn’t sound like a good match to me.
It would be over for me.

If done on accident ot not.
The tree was probably dying or something and needed to come down and you being a woman are overreacting and being emotional about it and blaming him for taking down what needed to be done.
How would you react if you inadvertently did something that caused him so much pain, OP? Would you dismiss his pain or would you be mortified and apologetic?

I don’t believe for a second this was a mistake. But if it was, wouldn’t he be devastated to have caused so much distress? The fact he doesn’t care speaks volumes.
Did you ever talk about the tree?  Did he know what it meant?  I don’t know, you either get over it or you stuff it.  Right now, I wouldn’t let hubby move forward with anything.  Stop any renovations until you decide how you feel moving forward.
gotta say as marriage issues go , that is an unique one

but i can understand if its part of your family history i can totally see why it would hurt to have it cut down.

and yeah as others says that indeed sounds like a SERIOUS dick move

it really shows he really doesn't seem to care about you or your family's history.

:-(
Your husband needs to be your ex. I hate him. I have planted so many trees that are significant to me. If anyone touches them, I go ballistic.
He knew. Plant Sally 2.0 and see if he helps or even argues.
I would be devastated. Even if he thought you gave him permission — WHY would he do this? That tree is irreplaceable. It’s a physical embodiment of your family.
Lots of trees can grow back even from a stump. Do you know what kind of tree it was? Maybe it’s possible to heal some of this by a) helping the tree regrow (or clone it—all of this is worth googling) if it is the right type of tree or b) planting your own tree and making a memorial of the stump. 

It wasn’t done of malice, and the tree is not the memories. You starting your own new tree would honor the sentiment and could help heal and fix this accident!
Your husband knew the story of the tree right? He owes you an enormous apology if he knew your story. You can’t do anything about it. I hope the tree is still around because I would make a bench of that wood, put a plaque on the bench including grandparents name and brief story or what ever you want. Family that live this tree can carve their initials on the back of the bench for prosperity but not on the front where only the plaque should be.
Sorry to hear about your tree. Is there anything left of the tree on the property at all? Maybe you can incorporate the tree into your house somehow. If you still have the logs and whatnot on the property, maybe repurpose them as exposed beams? If the stump is still there, maybe take a sliver of it and hang it as art?
That sucks, I understand your grief. I have a tree in my parents back yard that Im really attached to, I can imagine how sad I would be if they cut it down. He definitely should have asked about the tree before he cut it down. 

Maybe you could plant a baby tree of the same type where the old tree was? I know it wont replace it but it could be a start. Watching it grow might be rewarding. 

If you love your husband you guys will figure it out. You are totally justified in being upset that he would just go ahead and kill something that held significance to you. I don’t understand the mentality of destroying something so old seemingly on a whim. I hope you guys can navigate your way through this. He for sure owes you an apology as well as some sort of gesture to show that he recognizes the significance of what he did. Good luck OP, I’m sorry about your tree ❤️😔
This is the first thing he did and he did it while you were away on a trip? He did this on purpose.
I'm leaning towards this being a completely oblivious man problem. 

Did you ever actually tell him how important the tree was, or expect him to simply know based on the presence of the tree in photos and such?
lol. You gonna divorce over a fucking tree.  You didn’t love him anyway. Just admit it.
The tree is not the house. Throw the husband away and sue him for every penny Sally 2.0 takes, make sure you include an arborist to find out if you need to dig up the roots.
Unfortunately, the tree is gone. If you have a good relationship otherwise, I don't think this is a reason to end a marriage. He may not have recognized how important the tree was to you. And if he had a vision for your new home, he might not have realized how much it meant to you and instead just wanted to build out a home for you two that he was proud of. I know he mentioned the house, but honestly I think a yard is a huge part of a home and every time I move somewhere that's what I start on first.

Maybe get a new tree and plant it to "let it grow with your family in the new home" similar to what your grandparents did. You two can choose a spot together for the new tree and care for it. View it as a fresh start in your new home, but also a nod to your grandparents and following the tradition of planting a tree like they did. And one day you'll be able to look at your tree and know that was the start of your life in this new home. 

It's always sad when something is gone and you can't bring it back, but if there's no way to revive the tree, then just try to move forward if you want your marriage to thrive.
I bond with trees too, I really feel your sadness. Maybe something can be made from the wood? a table or piece of furniture that can stay with the family? Hopefully he didn’t just chip it all up too
Well I recommend taking in the fact you said he could do anything to the house and then the tree being cut down being an obvious example that he couldn’t, you can’t change he cut the tree accept the fact you could’ve told him not to touch the tree and leave it be. Don’t change the rest of your house and be ok with the fact you have memories.
Is it too late to take a branch or seed or something from the tree and replant it? You cant save the tree you know but perhaps save it’s heart! Im so sorry that happened. I can understand your pain and almost feel an element of it. It’s so sad when a tree is chopped down, let alone one of such meaning. I hope you can find some comfort and solace in the days to come.
So...he made a mistake. Divorce time!
I would have lost my shit. He knew if he asked you that you would have told him no, so he did it behind your back. Trees can become part of the family and I hate seeing trees cut down for no good reason. Please don’t put him on the deed to your house. It was a total lack of respect for you. What he did reminds me of people that bring their partner’s pets to the pound while they’re at work.
Ngl should have been more specific. Dude is renovating your family's house imagine the increase value of the whole property. 

Doesn't mean you shouldn't be upset I would been blown tf out of my family tree was cut down. Just whoop your husband's ass and keep it pushing don't let that resentment build up crush the issue soon as possible
Was he aware of just how significant this tree was to you? Maybe he knew it’s been there for a long time and the family may have mentioned it a few times but honestly it’s about his intentions behind it. If he truly didn’t know and he cut it down i would forgive him but if he knew and waited for an opportunity to do it while you were gone or intentionally didn’t mention any plans about it then it’s just mean and selfish.
i feel you! i visited my childhood home recently and found that the tree my (now passed) grandfather had planted in the front yard had been cut down. i know the new owners probably had a good reason (it was huge and pretty close to the house) but it was still super sad. presuming your husband knows about the significance of the tree it is absolutely crazy he’d think you’d be fine with that?
Well first off you said he could do anything to the house but you didn’t specify don’t touch the tree! How would he know how important the tree was to your family? Did you ever tell him or show him family pictures? If no, then it’s your fault bc he’s not a mind reader.
But he never mentioned doing anything to the yard so why cut down the tree? Especially while you were gone.  Honestly if I was you I would have said ok renovations over the house will remain untouched til the tree grows back and if it never grows back the house doesn’t get fixed either.  Precious moments surrounded that tree. Your husband is an asshole.
I just feel like that could've easily been communicated by him, even in casual daily chat? "Hey I'm thinking about cutting the tree down" "today im going to work on changing up the backyard, any thoughts?" Like damn what are y'all? Roommates? Passing ships in the night? How did this not come up in conversation at all?
Gong out on a limb, but have you thought about just forgiving him?
he should have asked before he cut the tree down. That was very inconsiderate, especially considering the significance it had to you, personally. However, in the final analysis, it is a tree. A living object. Do you care more about things, or people?
I don’t think you’re wrong for feeling resentful and angry. Losing a family heirloom like that, it’s like an insult to the entire family, not just you. That’s how I see it anyway. If you decide to stay, marriage counseling should be on the schedule soon. Honestly, perhaps you should think about staying somewhere else for a little bit. If he really did cut down the tree out of malice and disregard, there may be other feelings he’s wrapping up too. That sounds a little extreme but the time away could also help you heal. 

Either way, if you can recover the tree parts, perhaps you can have it built into something new. Or if that’s not possible, maybe you and your family members could plant a new tree or create another tradition/heirloom together.

I’m so sorry you have to experience this. It’s heartbreaking what he did. But something new and wonderful can be built even upon tragedy, especially with people you love and trust.
Did he actually know the significance of the tree?
This actually hurt my chest to read. Your husband hates you, I fear. 

I’m sorry the tree is gone, what  loss.
I wouldn't let it go. He did the old "ask for forgiveness, not permission" trick. He knew it was important to your family and you but did it anyway. Who does that?
Unless it's a fall hazard for the house, then why does he value not having a tree in that spot? Maybe struggling with compulsion like OCD, or maybe just craved a fast "accomplishment" for the project and saw it as a "breath of fresh air" for a fast dopamine boost. Maybe didn't understand the value and history, i.e. "you could've taken pics under any tree. It's just a/another tree." I absolutely love all trees, but in his defense, I love NOFX too and that band isn't universally loved. Reminds me of my dad throwing stuff away around the house. He's smart and good with words but seems like an absolute mongoloid sometimes when he seems aloof to certain things I value deeply or help me. Sorry that sounds difficult for yall.
I need to know if OP explain prior to letting his husband renovate not to cut down the tree regardless of him “should have known” if something holds that level of significance I can’t imagine not emphasizing that point also him starting in the backyard makes sense because who wants to come home from a work trip with their house a mess mid renovations that’s my thought process at least
He didn’t know. Plant a new tree with him and start again. It’s not worth fighting over.
I had a childhood friend who owned a tree trimming business, and I just had a thought - even if the tree has been cut down and hauled off, there is a decent chance that the crew may have saved the logs for milling. It would be worth asking if they could salvage the logs - many times the crews know exactly where they unloaded them.
NTA-I'd die on this hill. If he knew the value of that tree to you and your family then he'd be moving out NOW.
The biggest problem here is that he knew how you felt about that tree, had it cut down anyway, and can’t see what he’s done wrong. That’s a MAJOR issue

WHY did he cut it down? And why exactly is he so dismissive of your feelings after the fact? Those two points alone would be enough for me to walk away in that scenario
The tree must have always bothered him? He was jealous of the affection the tree received?
I’m so sorry this happened. Perhaps as you start to heal, you can start a new tradition? A tree that grows with the new owner of the house? A new tree just like the new generation? I wish you the best of luck and with many memorable traditions throughout your life. Thank you for sharing your story about that special tree.
No offence, but your husband sounds like a bit of a f\*\*\*wit.
Did he know how much it meant to you before cutting it down?
I would feel devastated as well. When my grandpa had to cut down the buckeye in their backyard, the one the swing hung from that my grandma was sang to me on, the buckeyes I would crack open to find the shiny jewels inside and feel elated every time... losing that tree was like losing a family member and I still grieve it though it has been over 25 years.

That said, a strong relationship could weather this. This seems to be a good indicator that there are some major communication and value system issues in y'all's relationship. He should have asked. And when he failed to ask and found that he had inadvertently hurt you, he should have been supportive, not defensive.

It would take a lot of work for me to forgive this.
Since you’ve been together for many years I’m going to assume he understood the significance of the tree? It’s not just a silly little tree it has a lot of meaning and I don’t think I could get over it. I’m sorry, what he did was beyond cruel and his reaction to you being crushed is so alarming. I’m so sorry about your tree!
He doesnt give a shit n never will! You own the house n if i were you id kick him out
I would never be able to get past it.
You didn’t say anything about the tree but what I would do to try to salvage some sentimental value and your marriage is take the wood from the tree and build some furniture from it.   Something that will always remind you of the good memories.
This is weaponized incompetence. To not know the significance of that tree is just bullshit
It’s not just a tree. Makes me think of the significance of the olive tree for Palestinians.
If he knew the significance of the tree to you and your family members, and he still cut it down without making sure you’re okay with it (if it was me, there is no way I would cut that tree down if it meant this much to my partner), I don’t know what to say.
I am very sorry for your loss. Trees have emotional significance for people as their lifespan is far longer than ours and as they are irreplaceable. Accordingly I understand why this is so upsetting for you, given the connection with your grandparents. I don’t think that you gave your husband permission to cut down the tree and so I guess that you may feel that you can’t trust him at the moment. You need to continue to talk to him about this so that he fully understands your feelings. If he can’t understand why you’re upset about it, then I fear that there’s no relationship. You can’t handle this unilaterally by letting go of the tree. He needs to meet you in the middle. Otherwise there’ll be resentment which will blow up in the future, ie if you must tackle this now and ensure that he takes responsibility for his actions rather than trying to blame you. You may need marriage counselling to see you through this
Op, people are trying to gaslight you into accepting this, but listen to me: this is abuse. That tree has clearly established significance to you. You are gone a few days, and without consulting you, he cuts it down? This is him flexing the control he assumes he can have over you and the house. Cutting down a decades-old tree would be a big thing in any case, it's weird af to do it without consulting your partner. But a decades-old tree that's basically a family heirloom? He's trying to cut your family out of your home. Don't let him. Listen to yourself. Don't give him a chance to do more. Yeet him now. 
Backyard IS NOT THE HOUSE.
if it were me, it would be 100 percent divorce time. idaf who you are. who tf cuts down a tree like thay, and one with family significance at that.
Your husband just showed you that he doesn't give a damn about what's important to you or your family. It's a family house and he immediately wants to tear it up to fix it like he likes. I think that the lack of caring about your opinion is the underlying issue here. Do you want to live with a man that doesn't give a damn about what's important to you? Sentimental or other otherwise. That's a decision that only you can make. 
I bought a new house with my ex. One of the things I loved most about it was an apple tree in the backyard that had a perfect branch for a swing. It also grew three different kinds of apples. I came home one day and he had cut it down. I was so upset. I cried and cried. He kept saying 'It's only a tree. It's only a tree.' To me it was the first major crack in the foundation of our relationship. I started watching and yes it was true, it was all about what he wanted and his opinion and mine was just not important at all. 
So you are The only one who can make up your mind what this issue means to you.  He sounds like a narcissist, so this is probably the best it will ever be. Chances are he will be cutting down your trees all your life.  I hope you didn't put his name on the house.  I would see a lawyer, because if he puts his money into remodeling the house he can make a claim on it.  My ex also screwed me really badly over our house.
It’s a tree.
Seriously though if all it took was one bump in the road probably wasn’t going to last anyway. Find yourself another guy who will tell you how right you were to dump the psycho who cut down the tree and ruined your life. Lol a tree ruined a marriage……weak shit from both of you
You could try growing a sapling if there's anything left. You failed to communicate to him. That's on you. Move on.
I argue that he knew what he was doing.
My mam had a tree that meant the world to her, gifted to her when her dad died years ago.. beautiful cherry blossom.
My dad cut down that tree and coincidentally it happened when she was away. He tried to gaslight and turn the situation around on her too to make it seem like it was okay.

OP he probably knew what he was doing and waited until you were away. I would be sick to my bones if somebody was so insensitive. Sorry this happened
Ouch. I’m so sorry, I get it

My grandfather had a pecan tree that he loved very much. We all knew the significance of it and shared that with our families when we became adults. I feel your pain.

Never would we cut down the tree without consulting each other. 

I don’t understand why he cut the tree down and then didn’t apologize. Part of me thinks he knew exactly what he was doing since he cut it down while you were away.
Ah just up and leave him, you'll definitely be happy you left him because he cut down a tree of great sentiment to you.
This sounds deliberate.
Why would he cut down something of such sentimental importance to you and your family? This isn’t something you can or should just get over. I’d try couples counselling, the fact he thought that was okay and doesn’t understand the emotional impact it has on you says a lot about him.
At first I thought I could have posted this, cutting down healthy trees in the year 2024!? WTF. But yeah, this is sad. That’s all.
This is not about the tree.
This reads like the posts where OP's most prized possession (often a childhood toy or something) is 'accidentally' thrown out by their partner. It's always malicious, and it's always on purpose.
VERY interesting that he waited until OP was gone on a work trip to chop down the tree. This hurts my heart reading this post. The fact that such a special, unique & priceless family heirloom is irretrievably gone, AND that OP’s husband has zero compassion about it. It has me wondering what else he will just bulldoze over & dismiss in the future if it doesn’t “suit” him. He sounds like a callous selfish ass. I’m really sorry OP 😞
Seems OP found a reason she could work with.  This isn't about a tree.
even if the tree didn’t have emotional significance, trees are nice! i would want a tree in my backyard! it’s rude of him to cut it down without asking, the sentimental value just compounds this. i wouldn’t be able to get past this without him absolutely falling over himself in guilt and groveling for your forgiveness.
I agree with the husband. You can try to play semantics saying you only said 'the house' but at the end of the day you gave him free reign to do whatever he wanted to the property and left.

You should have told him that you didn't want this tree to be harmed.
You should let it go, nothing will bring the tree back and you did say do what you want.
Everything hinges on whether he knew the significance of it. I'm going to assume he's not a sociopath and didn't know.

The memories you have of the tree don't die when the tree does.
INFO: Why isn't he horrified after you explained the significance of the tree? I would be so apologetic and offering to plant a new tree and falling all over myself.

Is he like this about other things which are important to you?

I think it's a valid thing to tell him you don't like him very much right now and that he needs to earn it back and fix this.
He didn't know that the tree was significant. ANY reasonable person would assume the whole property if you said "anything to the house." This seems like miscommunication

Though If he wasn't apologetic or dismissed your feelings then that's not okay.
It almost seems intentional....sus.
At no point in this post do you CLEARLY state that your husband KNEW the significance of the tree…

“He should have known….”🤔…

No. Unless u have actually explained what that tree ment to your family, he would have no way of knowing.

He didn’t do this intentionally.
Did you communicate the significance of the tree to him beforehand or was he supposed to just guess?
I could not live with someone who dishonored me this way. This would be it for me, personally.
I think what you should do is stop all renovations for the time period. Ask him to sleep in another room or if he wants let him stay somewhere else. Then just sit, think and wait. Just distance yourself a bit to clear your head. I'd take whatever is left of the tree and have it milled and made into furniture. A table, nightstands.. something you and your family can have. Wait for him to come to you with a sincere apology. Do not let him think turning the tree into furniture is his save all. He needs to grovel majorly and probably not to just you but your family. Don't make excuses for him either. Be strong right now. Let him see this is a make it or break it moment. 
Did he know about the history of the tree and did you communicate what it meant to you?  If you did then I can only see divorce as the solution.  He doesn’t care about you and showed you exactly what he thought of you.  That kind of obvious contempt cannot be repaired.

I know some people might argue that you weren’t specific…I don’t know…semantics like that just sound like willful ignorance to me.  He wanted that tree gone.  He would have coerced you into cutting it down eventually, so he sped up the process and did it already.  

He plans to renovate and sell it and he plans to buy one of those weird Telsa trucks for himself with the proceeds.  Is that what you want?  If it isn’t I recommend divorce.

You deferred to his wants and didn’t consider your own.  I don’t really want that to sound like blame and judgment, what I actually want is for you to really think about what YOU want and I want you to do what you need to do to have it.
Just out curiosity does he know how much sentimental value that tree is to your family? Did you communicate that to him, or is your husband just a complete moron? Honestly I think you should explain to him how much this hurt you and possibly your extended family. He destroyed a part of your family history. He's going to have to find some way to make up for that. Hopefully the tree wasn't hauled off to the landfill. Maybe he can have the wood made into pieces of furniture, a chair or dining table. It would be an heirloom to be passed down to the future.
It's a tree stop being so oversentimental
I can’t help but believe that him waiting til you were on a business trip to cut down a generational family tree was CALCULATED AF. He wanted it gone and he didn’t give a flying fuck about your feelings.

I wouldn’t be able to trust my husband anymore if he pulled this shit.
Why is he trying to logic his way out of being in the wrong? 

He should be absolutely devastated at what he did and be doing anything to make you feel okay. 

OP would you be debating ending the marriage if he had broke down apologising because he didn’t mean to hurt you and he thought it was okay, and doing everything he can to cheer you up/make you feel better? Is the problem that the tree is gone or that he is showing you no empathy or remorse for what happened? 

I would be devastated if something this sentimental was destroyed but the feelings wouldn’t be on my partner unless they did it without remorse and/or with intent.
That was absolutely, unapologetically, no empathy whatsoever out of order. I’m sure you had mad him known over the years with him how much that tree meant to you. And for him to cut it down when there was no need for it to die, is him totally saying, all the history behind the tree and the fact that it’s special and meant so much to you and was/is a symbol of the memories behind it ‘who cares’ suck it up. I understand why it’s made you change towards how you feel about him. Get him gone and see if anyone else will put up with his insensitivities. He’ll soon realise what he did was appallingly stupid, horrendously despicable and downright mean. Then he has the selfish mindset to argue back with you in order to excuse his behaviour and attitude. He’s not looking out for your best interest. He’s erased something very beautiful and very precious to you. The house and the garden are very different places.
1 ok pqq
Cutting down a tree is generally unpopular so these boards are already in your favor by default, but if you don’t have any sentimental attachment to a family home, and you gave him cart blanch to do literally do whatever he wants to it, why would he suppose that the tree of all things is so sentimental? If you communicated that explicitly that’s one thing, but to presume it means you failed to communicate and are getting mad because he didn’t read your mind. In the grand scheme of things though, if you have an otherwise good relationship, I would simply wait for time to smooth this over. These kinds of things can bring a lot of heartbreak but this should not be the kind of thing that destroys an otherwise good marriage. It can be a valuable lesson in commitment, which will show the validity of the age old adage “this to shall pass.” There is nothing really to “solve” here. It’s just something to get past. Once you are through with the anger and power dynamic operating in the background, you two can have a moment of genuine engagement, apologies, and moving on, hopefully with you both being wiser for the experience. 10 years from now you can joke about what an ass he was and it will just part of your history as a couple.

This resentment will fester if you don’t address it. I would go to couples counseling as fast as possible. Him refusing to acknowledge your grief or belittle. It is only going to increase the resentment over the years. It will not dissipate without proper help. Even with proper help, this could be a dealbreaker for you and that’s OK. 

My ex-husband was not the best, but I cannot imagine him doing anything like that without mentioning it to me first. That is something that is so huge. It seems willful that he didn’t check with you Or say I’m working on the backyard while you’re gone. Which then would’ve prompted you to say something like don’t touch the tree.
She said he could do whatever he wanted to the house

Doing whatever one wants to a house does not include trees in any conceivable circumstance, unless they are specifically mentioned 

He’s being a Gaslighter and he’s functionally lying 

Furthermore, since a tree is a living thing that cannot easily be replaced he should’ve cleared it with her in fact, he should clear all the major things with her even if she says she doesn’t care he should still do it because he doesn’t want to be a total jerk
Completely ridiculous relationship.
I totally get what you're saying, but truth be told, trees don't live forever and it would have had to come down sooner rather than later. Just plant a new one and watch it grow.
He’s an AH if he cut down a healthy tree that old…
Did you husband even know what the significance of the tree was?  If he did then this is a huge issue.
You can do what you want!!  A-A-A you did what you wanted!!!   hmmm
He cut down a tree. The man is a monster. 

Unless that tree was diseased or dangerous but that still needed to be a joint decision. That was your tree not his.
I think it's too important for OP to just "get over." An open discussion where the OP feels genuinely heard is absolutely necessary. If that doesn't resolve the issue, I'd recommend counseling. It's not just a tree. It's the feeling of being completely disregarded. The fact that the tree was chopped down while OP was on a work trip just makes it worse. This couple needs to get to the root of the problem if they want to move on in a healthy way.
Why is your husband so eager to erase your family history from the home? Is he jealous of your inheritance? NTA. He knew better, he did it anyway. Only he can explain his true motives behind it.
INFO: Did he understand the significance of the tree?
In a normal world, this would be a week of friction at home. In our new circus fantasy world, it's a post on Reddit.
Childish behavior from him. He needs to understand he did wrong and apologize in my opinion.
This sucks and it seems like communication lacked. He knew the significance, but not the importance of the tree.

The next best option here to save your sanity, is to turn that tree into a piece of furniture for the house. Coffee table or something (if it's big enough) that way you'll still have it with you
It is  devastating that the tree is gone,  you can't bring it back,  but you could go out together and pick out a new tree and start new memories with your family with a new tree...it won't be the same but start something new.
Mabe have a conversation about things you both want to do with the house and property before doing it to avoid any further upsetting moments. 
P.S.  do you have any of the wood from the cut down tree? ...if so make something special for your home like a cutting board or a shelf. 
I hope you can find peace in your relationship,  and get through this with your husband .
You can really only “let it go” if he apologizes. He’s not going to, because he did it when you were out of town *for a reason.*
In all the years that you've known him and have been married to him, has he been an otherwise good husband and partner? In other words, is he kind and considerate and loving and giving and helpful? For the most part anyway, because none of us are perfect.

Has he apologized? Have you expressed just HOW much this has hurt you? 

It's inconceivable, I know, to realize just how different some people can be. We are all the same in many ways, but we are also very different. To him, a tree is just a tree, and maybe he is unable to fathom just how much it has meant for you and your family, even if you told him. IF he has been a good partner in life, and you know you can trust him and count on him in many other ways, then try to forgive him. You MIGHT need to vent your anger, though. And, you should. There are plenty of ways, and you can find those on the internet:) IF you're able to forgive him, and this may take time, as well as what I will suggest: In time, find another special tree to plant. One for your future.....
I've flipped a couple dozen homes in my time.  I always start with curb appeal.  Fix the yard and get inspired with colors and light.  Paint the exterior then move inside.
What a twat he obviously must’ve heard once or twice in the marriage the significance of the tree he probably didn’t want relatives visiting all the time and using the tree nostalgia as a reason
Did he know of the importance? That's the question....
One question: did he know the tree was sentimental? If he did then fuck him, if he didn’t then I’d say at the very least you had an unfortunate communication. I’m on the fence if he didn’t know. I’m fully on your side if he did know.
Here’s what I can’t reconcile: you gave your partner carte blanche to make whatever modifications he wanted to the house your grandparents lived in—I mean, what says more about a dearly departed person? A tree or the house they lived and loved and hosted people in?—but the tree was a no go? I’m not trying to diminish the sentimental significance of the tree. At all. But you demonstrated extraordinary liberality and tolerance with respect to one precious vessel of old memories—your grandparents’ house, where I’m sure you also played, had your picture taken, and made many memories also—and then came down hard on your partner for cutting down the tree. I don’t necessarily want to say that it reveals an internal contradiction in your thinking, but it leaves me scratching my head. 

Secondly, what did you tell him about the importance of the tree before you gave him free rein on the remodeling? Did you tell him that he should leave it be?
I feel like even if this tree wasn’t emotionally significant cutting down a tree in a property is something you discuss. Even if just for shade reasons, so the fact that this tree was significant… I feel like this wasn’t just negligence. 

If there is a branch left laying around you may be able to get a cutting to root and regrown a baby tree. I’m so sorry.
i would 100% divorce someone over this because it shows that you will be alone emotionally at least sometimes and no one deserves that from their partner. 

he did what he did and now his words and actions prove that he doesn’t mind how it affected you as much as he minds not feeling like he is in the right

i’m so sorry, i would be completely heartbroken
Your husband is an asshole and did this on purpose while you were away. If you accept this behavior, be prepared for more abuse and rationalization of his actions.
Omg the devastation. It would take me a decade or more to get over this. I’d need therapy or hypnosis or something help my brain cope with it.
Get the tree made into a table benches etc . I would rent one of those machines from tool hire( forgot the name) turn the entire thing into outdoor furniture and grow off a shoot from the original tree. He tried to take your family out of the house…. Now it’s come back hard and fast!  Hell,  get a few shoots replanted and have an entire family of Sallys dotted around the garden. Have your family over for bbqs and enjoy the table and benches you made. Take his power move and… nuke it.
Most of the comments are ignoring this part. He doesn't like how dated the house is, so the first project he picked was...the backyard?
Yeah. Plus, seriously, what kind of person cuts down a big old beautiful tree? Why would anyone even want to do that? I really don’t like what it says about him.
And how did he react when you got upset? Was he suitably contrite? Did he apologise profusely. 

I have no idea about your marriage, but perhaps you can restart the tradition for your family.  Plant a tree to symbolise your family's time in the home,  and care for it like your grandfather did.
I really would struggle to forgive this, it’s just awful.
It was not the first thing he did,he has done renovations to the house and has not touched a single thing in the yard,that is why I was surprised to see the tree gone and him moving to the landscape of the house.

I apologise I didn't clear that up.
Same, that is the main point. He cut down a tree that means a lot to OPs family. There is no way he didn't understand this, he just didn't care. This would make me think differently about him as well. This level of selfishness is just astounding to me.
some people don’t understand or see sentimental value in things.
Did he know about the tree? I’d find it hard to believe he didn’t since so many photos and probably conversations revolved around this tree.
Had y’all talked about the tree? Had he mentioned trimming it up at all?

This situation really sticks, I’m sorry. 
Iv had things like this happen with my husband but on massively smaller scales. 
Like last week he asked if he should take the kids home to eat lunch or stop and get something that’s fast. We were running late for an appointment so I said to get fast food since we were on a time crunch. 
What did he do? He got food while out but it was at a sit down restaurant so it took the same amount of time it would have for them to eat at home. Very frustrating.

Unfortunately there are times you have to spell it all out, what to do and what not to do and no I’m not saying this is right. But some days it’s like that unfortunately and yes it’s absolute bs. 

We had a lovely little chat about thinking things through and the whole chain reaction of choices and options. I think it was enlightening, I hope it was at least.
This! How are they married for years but he somehow doesn't know how significant the tree is?
Because he knew it would hurt her. Her love for that tree was taking away from him. So he cut it down because he is the boss.

Sorry, I havr.lost more plants, trees, flowers to a fucking maniac who destroys years of care and patience just to stick it in, smirk and twist.
I find it crazy that OP"s husband wouldn't send a message saying "I'm going to cut down this big tree. Is that ok?" Even if OP said do whatever, surely you still consult with your partner about what your doing. It sounds to me like the husband wanted it gone and decided to do it quickly without OP knowing. I'd be very fucking angry OP. I can't imagine what your feeling. I would let your husband know how upset you are. But if you don't want it to ruin your marriage just give it time and you'll probably find it easier to deal with over time. 
>>I mean the most important part here is- did he know the importance of this tree to you?

THIS! Why are we the only ones asking this? If he didn't know then it was an honest misunderstanding where OP's husband thought the permission he had included the yard. If he knew then OP's husband intentionally waited until OP was out of town to have something important to OP destroyed because he didn't like it. Those are two very different situations and call for very different responses.
Yeah like this is it. Every comment is saying how could he ut I'm not seeing anywhere in the story where he explained how much he loved the tree to him. "He should have known" is not enough. You can't put that on people if you haven't told them. It could have been an understandable mistake. but if I had made a mistake like that I would feel awful about it and would do whatever I could to make it as right as I could.
I remember being a little kid and having a full blown crisis when my grandpa just barely trimmed the little tree we used to play under in the yard. 

They sold that house when I was probably 16 and I drove back over there recently (many years later) and took a peek in their yard and ended up rather abruptly sobbing because it was just a little stump now. I cannot imagine if it had been my spouse of all people who did it.
That's a cool idea
It's bizarre that everyone else seems to be focused on attributing guilt ("did he know?")

I think OP and his husband need to accept what has happened, and to address his biggest issue: his grief. If he husband can understand - without attributing guilt - that OP is grieving and upset, he can care for him, hug him, let him grieve. He can tell him stories and memories. They can plant a tree together and start a new set of memories. Stop focusing on guilt, and start caring for OP.
Your comment made me think of another option. Maybe OP could bring some of the tree to a carpenter/woodwork artist and have something made from the tree wood in honour of his grandparents?
This is a great suggestion. Make it into something that can be used for generations to come. That would be a wonderful thing. Hopefully it’s not wood chips now
I just want to add:

If not furniture, you can make the wood into other things, like wooden jewelry and accessories, a box/chest to hold family photos and letters.
[deleted]
Believe it or not, I actually had a court case regarding this. It was between neighbors as well. The tree had sentimental value for one neighbor, as it had been gifted to them by a recently deceased family member. The other neighbors cut it down because it blocked their beach view. As an outsider, you might see it as just a court case between neighbors over a tree, but when you hear their stories and understand the value behind it, you can see why it hurts.
I’m so sorry OP. I agree with this comment though, it just sounds like bad communication. You probably didn’t even think of the tree at the time or assumed he wouldn’t do anything to it so you didn’t say anything to him about it. 

What I would do in your shoes: Tell him how you feel about this and get through your emotions together (for better or for worse) but also admit that it wasn’t entirely his fault. You did tell him “I couldn’t care less if you painted the house bright blue” which could also mean he can do what he pleases with the property. It’s just bad communication and you could’ve been more specific. 

It’s truly unfortunate but seems like an honest mistake. That is if he had no idea what this tree meant to you. So sorry again, OP. Hope you guys can work this out.
That really sucks; I totally get why you’re so upset. It sounds like your husband didn’t understand how much that tree meant to you and your family. You definitely need to talk to him again, even if the tree is gone. Let him know it wasn’t just about the house—it was about memories and family. Maybe he thought he was helping, but he clearly missed the mark big time. Communication is key here if you want to work through this. Just be honest about your feelings and how hurt you are; it might help him see things from your perspective.
This is what is annoying me about a lot of the comments, the fact that so many are essentially blaming OP for this because he said "do whatever" - if you know something has huge sentimental importance like the tree, you still ASK before you touch it.
I was thinking the same thing - it's going to potentially become a marital asset instead of her inheritance if she's not careful. This guy may not be a keeper either.
If you said house to me I would also think house not garden..
I can not give you advice though, I cried (I was probably 20 then) when locale authority cut down a beautiful and perfectly healthy tree (Prunus) in front of our house ( later they put some rubish other trees that soiled the street big time).
I don’t think this misunderstanding was intentional. If someone told me I could do anything I wanted with the house, I’d probably assume landscaping would be included. I think it’s a massive, unfortunate misunderstanding
OP is also a man,  not a woman.
This. I also like the idea of the two of you choosing a spot and planting a new tree together. 

My dad made a coffee table out of cedar wood from a tree my great grandpa had planted after the tree died. 

I spent hours and days woodburning designs into the table.

 It moved with me through a marriage, divorce, and remarriage. I needed to refinish and reseal it and didn't want it to get damaged in the meantime so I moved it to a storage shed.

During COVID I finally had the time to work on the table. I went to the storage shed to get it and could not find it anywhere. 

I asked my husband about it, and he had no clue what I was talking about at first. He had cleaned out the shed a few months prior and had finally gotten around to taking an old bedroom suite we had to drop off for donation to free up some room. 

HE DONATED THE FAMILY COFFEE TABLE TOO!

He'd saw it in there with the rest of the furniture and just assumed I'd put it in there because I'd no longer wanted it. WHAT?! I'd told him the story of it's creation! To make it even more traumatic, I'd just lost my father 3-4 months before this. 

This hurt to the core in a way I couldn't put in to words. Yes, it was coffee table, a material thing- and I don't consider myself materialistic at all. But, it was so much more than that!

I think I felt much the same way you're feeling. I didn't know if I could stay in the relationship. I felt violated, I felt betrayed in the most horrible way.  I could tell, though he tried to brush things off at first as me blowing things out of proportion- it was just a damn coffee table! 

I told him I needed my space and didn't talk to him for a few days, didn't cook for him, didn't do any of the things I normally did out of love for him. 

This finally got him thinking I guess, and I still hated that I didn't have the table anymore and I would never have gotten rid of it, but I do love the man. When he admitted he should have thought about what the table might have meant to me, probably should have told me hey I'm taking x y and z for donation etc. My love kind of overrode the hate I guess. 

A couple of years later now, I still would love nothing more than to have the table back, but in a weird way my husband's and my relationship is better for it. 

I also think a little more before deciding to toss something of my husband's now.

Now, after writing this book reply- I think my husband and I will have a new project- we need to build our own table!
Good point! This is true and it could be nurtured to do so more quickly. This is a solution, if hubby really wants to show he’s sorry then he should learn how to grow back a stump and make it happen.
While he was on a trip?

Husband knew pretty well what he was doing. I'd plant another Sally at the same spot to make up for this one. If he's really sorry he shouldn't object, right?
And sheesh he could have planned around the tree. What a dick
I don't imagine that the husband would do that if he understood the importance of the tree.

It's not to say that he wouldn't have been expected to know, just that it's something that was likely thought to be understood and wasn't.

Honestly, I wonder if there were other issues prior to this(anything felt by either partner).

Is there anything that can be salvaged from the tree? Maybe seeds or anything that could be planted in that same spot that came from the original tree?
I literally came and found the damn post from a Bored Panda post on fb JUST TO say this! I saw that OP responded saying it wasn’t technically the “first” project he did. Be that as it may, it’s quite coincidental that it happened when you were OUT OF TOWN babes! Ohhh I’d be SEETHINGGGGGG🧍🏾‍♀️🙃
The first thing my mum’s new husband did when we got a new house was to cut all the trees down. I was in absolute shock since one of the things the realestate kept telling people all the expensive trees the previous owner had ($7000).
My family had to cut down our favorite tree because its roots were growing into the pipes of our house, and our neighbor's house. It was really sad but it needed to be done. Years and years of cleaning roots out of pipes was finally getting untenable. We tried it all,root removal, root killer, etc. Nothing stuck. And it was a crying shame, it was a huge beautiful tree that made the most lovely sound in summer and fall with the wind through the leaves. But alas.
But what if he could pave over the backyard with concrete instead? Trees drop leaves and stuff. Make it modern!! /s
I heard of chainsaw firing up this morning and I almost had a stroke, I went outside to see if someone was trying to cut down a tree, fortunately it was kind of some kind of stonework.
It’s going to escalate. Mark my words. The husband knew what he was doing.
This! Trees aren’t “modern”?
Did he know what the tree meant to your family? I don’t think you’ve mentioned that.
I would be absolutely furious to the point I would stop him from doing anything more at all to your house. The house is yours, not his. He did this on purpose.
If your relationship is otherwise strong and he doesn’t have a history of belittling you/your family or stomping on your boundaries then this seems like an honest mistake.


I know it’s not the same, but I’d just organise to buy and plant a similar tree in the same spot. I know large trees are expensive, but now knowing how important that tree was to you and your family, I would hope that he would be willing to fork out for one? Alternatively, have your family go out and pick out a new tree to plant there in honour of grandparents tree, but this one will start a new generation of memories for your family? Is there any way you could make the new tree more inclusive of your grandparents memory? Do you have any garden furniture of theirs that you could keep next to it for example? 

Another idea, Could you take some of the wood from the tree to a carpenter and have him make something special from your grandparents tree for you?

Sorry this happened OP. It is understandable that you are grief-stricken by this
ok so change it to "first thing he did when you weren't there". it's still really fucking weird and that's where you need to start.
I think this was a big miscommunication issue here. While he may have known that tree meant a lot to you, he may not have expected that you would be against removing it when he said he wanted to redesign everything. 

I feel like you should have stated you want the tree to stay to make sure there is no misunderstanding. You say the backyard does not apply when you mentioned house but it actually does, a backyard is part of the property and the house. It’s an attachment. 

This is super frustrating it happened though, I’m sorry! 

Maybe tell him you want to plant another tree to replace it and make new memories as that one grows. I don’t know you or your husbands stance on kids but if you are planning to adopt or something then a new tree would be a cool experience for a child to grow up alongside with just as you grew up with the past tree. 

I hope you two figure things out and if he absolutely knew you wanted to keep the tree then that is a red flag but you need to make sure he did not just think when you said go do whatever you want that it also meant in the backyard too. I do think this was a communication issue sadly. 

Good luck to both of you! Wish you the best!
RIGHT! I’m saying. Like WHY DIDN’T HE JUST ASK! Def seems like he was trying to do it quick and secret cause he knew OP wouldn’t approve. I would be sooooooo mad.
They have terrible communication as a married couple. Why would he not tell his husband to do anything he wanted with the house, BUT NOT TOUCH the tree. Why would his husband NOT TELL HIM what he plans to do with the updates/renovations. Terrible communication
For real though - I 'm learning to sew and we have a few cool old flat bedsheets we will literally never use. I wanted to turn one that used to belong to my partner's grandma into a dress but asked him first because of its origin, and he said no! I was surprised since his parents were using it as a dropcloth, but he didn't want his grandmas sheet getting cut up which is TOTALLY VALID even if a bit illogical. You don't ever mess with stuff like that, there's no way he didn't have some inkling at least that it was important to her. Unempathetic and uncaring moment right there at best.
I hear you, but cutting down a tree is a pretty significant change. They take a long time to grow- it’s obviously been there for a very long time. Trees are significant not just to people but to the land and the wildlife as well. They help with runoff and flooding, provide shade, important in lots of ways. Seems so weird to just chop it down without a second thought. I’m not saying he “should have known” but i think he should have asked. I get that OP gave him the green light on home reno, but that’s a major change. He should have respected that it’s OP’s asset and in this case.
Yeah, I was heartbroken reading this and I don’t even know the tree. 

I have had my house for only a year and there’s an oak tree in the back. If my partner cut it without telling me it would probably be a huge argument. I don’t understand how people can randomly get rid of something that’s been here longer that they have been alive in lots of cases.
*his husband
I don't think it's bizarre at all - intention matters.    Whether or not the husband knew this would deeply hurt OP matters a great deal.   It's bizarre to me that you think ignoring that potential major relationship issue is the correct path here.
100%. My husband and I had a similar issue regarding the birth of our first kid. We didn't get past it and the resentment growing until we both were fully vulnerable with each other about what we were feeling. We had a good cry together. We were both totally of opposite understanding of what I meant for my birth plan. I just had to mourn that it didn't go how I wanted, and he had to be fully sorry for his part in it, even though he thought he was in the right and doing what I said.  Misunderstandings happen. I learned I have to very clearly spell out my expectations going forward.
Apparently tree law is a whole complicated thing that exists haha. I feel like i went down a rabbit hole on it like a decade ago. 
In most states, civil damages for destroying a tree are automatically tripled. 
Landscaping would NOT normally including cutting down a large tree. That really should require special permission.
Damn. I missed that. Thanks for correcting me.
He's not really sorry at all though that's kind of the point
He. this is a male-male couple
This is bonkers to me...

That tree was as much a member of the family as a plant could possibly be. This feels almost like getting rid of a pet without discussing it.

And he waited for him to be on a trip?!?

Maybe I like trees too much, but I would be done with this guy yesterday.
He's not sorry because this can't be real right??? Not renovate a bathroom or create a man cave- we go straight to cutting down a whole ass tree plus I'm sure derooting the stump
I would plant a border of trees
This story is probably entirely made up for someone to practice their writers craft or for karma. Too many holes in this story.
>I don't imagine that the husband would do that if he understood the importance of the tree.

The fact that the husband did this while OP was on a work trip makes me think the husband knew exactly how important the tree was and that he wouldn't be allowed to cut it down if OP was there.

The husband also wasn't sorry about what he did. Instead he focused on the fact that OP can't be mad because of the loophole he found.
In this long of a marriage he should know this basic info, like this OP has photos with it, I’m sure they’ve told stories about it when OP inherited the house.
The tree had a name. How could his husband be unaware of how important a tree named by OP's now deceased grandparent was? OP's husband did a selfish thing in a sneaky manner and is not sorry. That's not cool.
Yes! If there are any young shoot branches less than a year old a clone tree can be grown from them 🙂
He did NOT understand the importance of the tree over the importance of the house.
That's insane, if I had a neighbor that did that I would be so pissed off
I had this issue and they replaced the pipes under the tree with plastic (or something similar—I don’t exactly remember). No problems since and it’s been almost two decades. Just putting that out there in case someone else has the same problem.
You can get your pipes fitted with fiberglass liners now that stop roots.
I’m sorry for your loss.
Yeah there's a lot of context missing from this story.  If the tree's roots were starting to become invasive then it needed to get chopped.

OP also doesn't talk about if the tree's significance was impressed upon his hubby.  If they regularly had family photos around that tree (not out of the ordinary if the tree was significant). Then hubby is the major AH for cutting it down.  

Overall I get the feeling that this is more about hubby wanting to chase away the deceased grandparents from this house that they have.  I get that impulse, but the fact that they gifted him this home ought to bear some significance.
What do you bet he wants an inground pool?
💚
This whole thread is useless without this information.
They are married for several years. How could he not know, if he has the slightest interest in his partner?
A bench for the backyard
I don't agree with that. People throw out statements like 'do whatever you want' all the time. I've gone to the hairdresser and said do whatever you want, I feel like a change. Knowing that she will have the sense not to shave my hair all off, lol! Any decent partner would still run something big by their significant other.
Exactly! It's standard protocol to just do a quick check.
I love this so much - especially because it shows how wrong we can be.

“Carte blanche” isn’t an excuse to not communicate because people can’t envision every possibility and will have assumptions that they don’t even know they have. 

Best case?
OP: “Of course he’d never cut down the tree,” so it’s not on his radar and he didn’t mention it as an exception. 
Husband: “Of course I can cut down the tree because I have carte blanche,” even though such a thing doesn’t really exist in life.

Outside of dealing with people in their teens/early 20s, I have never been in a relationship with someone who would take my openness and trust and run with it as if I no longer mattered. Doesn’t husband want OP to be comfortable in this “new” home, too?

A check-in is so logical and simple when you compare it against all that can go wrong. Also, a check-in is a loving thing to do. It is reaching out to make sure you and your partner are on the same page and that perspectives haven’t shifted - because perspectives shift and people are not immutable.
I mean I try to discuss every specific thing I do with my partner. but different people have different thresholds so I'm not going to input my own thoughts on that. I can imagine scenarios where he tried to but she was tired of dealing with it so she gave him free reign. There is a lot being left out of the story so I'm only working on the text as given
thanks for pointing it out. corrected.
false dichotomy. it's a relevant point; it's not the only point. it shouldn't be focused on to the exclusion all the other elements.
/r/treelaw
Yeah it is, overseeing the municipal side of tree law is one the parts of my job that I enjoy the least
That's like one of the most common parts of renovation in landscaping.
Haha and that was the comment’s point
I totally missed that! Not that it matters but it matters, you know?
Same. More importantly, he should have consulted about any major or minor work. That’s the way a respectful partnership should work. He disrespected you; and should be asking what he can do to make it right. Instead he’s gaslighting. Unless he sees the importance to you and starts making amends, I would take some serious distance and consider whether you two are a good match for the long term.
I'm willing to bet there are other warning signs in this marriage that OP has been ignoring. Because erasing this tree from existence is a very hostile act.
So funny how redditors think fake internet points are actually valuable to more than a tiny fraction of people
I don't think so. I had an apple tree I loved in the backyard of our new house. I had talked to my ex about putting up a swing for our little boy and had picked out the branch. The apple tree actually grew three different kinds of apples on it so it was really cool tree. I came home one day and he cut it down. Now he's my ex.
I'm not saying it doesn't look bad.

I'm saying that despite it looking bad it's important to make absolutely damn sure that he knew the importance of that tree, because in a situation where one spouse does something that really hurts their partner it tends to be a lot more likely that it was done by accident, so it's really important to make sure.

It is completely possible that this was done maliciously, and I'm just saying that it's important to check whether that's the case, specifically *because* this is such a touchy subject. It would be awful for the husband to do something like this intentionally, but it would also be awful for the husband to not know the importance of the tree and to cut it down and then to find out about the importance of the tree while being accused of doing something malicious.

If it is determined to be malicious, yes, that's horrible.

I'm just saying to make absolutely sure.

And the reason I mentioned whether there were issues between the two people before this is because it may go a long way toward determining whether it was intentional, whether it was a misunderstanding, or whether either spouse has a reason to be malicious or to be unnecessarily suspicious.
Zero empathy at all. 

The most important thing to OP about the entire house was that tree. 

I’m interested why the husband had so much hatred for it. Was it passive aggressive anger Rather than landscaping?
I also came here to say this. If you can, try to find a shoot or take a cutting from the tree and look into how to propagate it.
Yeah, roots in pipes is a pipe problem, not a root problem.
You really think his husband has no fucking clue how much he cared about the tree?
Yeah, and OP keeps not answering that question
That’s my assumption too. But OP should elaborate on how often they talked about it, whether his husband generally shows interest in his stories, does he listen, how did he react (appreciative, sympathetic, sentimental), etc.
I imagine OP didn't even think about the tree until it was gone… hence why he didn't stipulate it from the start as being off limits. Cutting down a whole tree is huge tho, I would have asked my partner about it no matter how much they didn't seem to care about the property upgrades. 
And tree cutting can be $1k +
That’s what I said. Why would they not communicate with each other before doing anything. They have bad communication
Yes exactly! but people like him would never admit they are wrong or back down he would have a million excuses why that couldn't happen but it's not his fault blah blah blah. So frustrating if you have to deal with people like that
People who accidentally hurt their partner apologize profusely and feel bad about it. It doesn’t seem like the husband feels bad at all as he continues to defend his actions instead of apologizing
That means he didn't clearly communicate it.
Doubt the husband really listens to anything the OP says.
There are some things we may want to assume at first, but can't:

1. that both partners communicated well, and 

1. that both had great communication skills, and

1. that the relationship was healthy to begin with

Unfortunately, those three things are not necessarily the case.

If they'd had any kind of problems, that causes problems for what you're saying. People can get defensive for any number of reasons, and guilt isn't the only one at all.

Is what you're saying possible? Yes.

Is it the only possible explanation? No. Mistakes do happen.

There could be any kind of issues, like maybe OP's husband had perceived the relationship to be in worse shape than OP and made an honest mistake and then got defensive because of feeling like the two of them were already having trouble and not feeling like he could convey a sincere apology.

Or maybe OP's husband might have some kind of neurodivergence and might not have been malicious but might have been literally unaware of the sentimental attachment to this particular object. Is it *unlikely*? Well, it's unlikely in marriages general, but is it unlikely among marriages where one partner damaged something sentimentally important to their spouse? Maybe not.

**Maliciousness is 100% a possibility.**

**But it's not the only possibility.**

All I'm recommending is to have a calm discussion with the husband, find out his intentions and understanding and see if he's sincere.

And I am speaking as someone who is not good at picking up on social cues and who sometimes sincerely misses things other people insist that no one could miss. I have repeatedly been in situations where my actions were sincerely well-intentioned and where no one would accept that that was even a possibility.

**I am not saying OP's husband isn't guilty.** He could be guilty as sin.

All I'm saying is that I think it's best to have a sincere conversation and to try to make a determination about whether OP's husband was trying to help and made a mistake, or whether OP's husband was actually malicious.

Most husbands don't go out and do things to maliciously hurt their partners, particularly not in long-term marriages.

And sometimes two people who are married can find out that they're not on the same page about something they both assumed they were in full agreement about.

I think it's worth finding out the full reasoning behind what OP's husband says led him to cut down the tree.

I think accidents and miscommunication tend to happen a lot more than people think.

In the end, if they do find out that he did it maliciously, he absolutely deserves to be treated as a jerk and an asshole.

But I think that it's really important to take a lot of factors into consideration before acting in a negative way:

1. that they've been married a long time

1. that (barring some kind of build-up) partners don't tend to randomly do things out of a desire to hurt their spouse

1. whether or not this person tends to be someone who makes social mistakes or ever has had significant misunderstandings

1. whether he had something against the tree

1. whether he has expressed wanting to do things to really help his partner and be really active(so for example, if he's the kind of person to bring roses every week or be constantly doing little romantic things, it might be out of character to do something that would so deeply hurt his partner)
Well he's only commented one time, could just be slow at responding - but it is pretty crucial info. 

I'm not sure how someone you marry could NOT know about the generations long beloved tree that is just outside the house you moved into which your grandparents owned... 

...but it's possible and would be good to confirm.
You said exactly what I was going to say and more. Without knowing if it was known and intentionally done it is hard to judge the situation. 

I have made a mistake like this before and felt horrible afterwards.  My wife was in an abusive 17 year relationship before me and she wasn’t used to standing up for herself. It took a while for me to pick up on things and her to realize she could tell me how she felt. We communicate so much better now and I would never make a mistake like that again. I’m sure this happens in other relationships as well. 

Hopefully the husband didn’t do this intentionally. It won’t bring back the tree but it would definitely make the relationship salvageable. If someone did that intentionally I would say they don’t truly love their spouse.
Agreed.
Someone sent my (chess) OF to my parents, what to do?
I (26F) have an OF. I do not use OF for any type of sw, although I am very much pro sw. I just don't have the body for it. 

However, last year was tough since leaving academia, so I gave OF a try. I exclusively post content about chess. Just giving tips on chess, as well as probability models related to chess (as I come from a math background). That's it. That's all I do. My clothes have never come off aside from one video where I was wearing a top instead of my usual t-shirt. Surprisingly, I make some money with it, ranging from 500€ per month to 2000€ per month. Not a huge living, but it helps with some bills. 

Well, some individuals online who I also most likely know in real life (I have a suspicion who they are, but I am not 100% sure) sent my OF to my parents. My dad laughed it off, and actually likes watching my chess content now, lol. My mom however... Well, let's just say that she has recently reported me for "tax evasion" (which I am not guilty of, we just have a difficult relationship and I went NC recently) has now shared my page with my employer, and other individuals in my personal life.

What do I do? Everyone seems to think that I do OF for sw, which I don't. Asking for them to subscribe just to show the proof sounds tacky. No idea what to do here. 
Print a review of your onlyfans page showing the chess content to business cards so everytime someone asks you can give them your card.  You might even get some new subscribers :D
It's quite simple. People are going to think what they want, that's life. But if anyone asks you about it then just be open and explain it's nothing dirty and you just teach people how to play chess? 

But I do have to ask, why did you chose only fans over patreon?
when you talked about Chess I genuinly thought that you misspelled Chest so often. but you meant chess. the board game. 

other than that, show your employer what you do on OF. (I guess you can just go on your OF page and show him via your phone, cant you?)and problem solved. 

or, if you feel cocky, just brush everyone trashtalking you off. they arent worth it. they barely know you thus who are they to judge? they dont know you well enough to dislike you.
So you're a pawn star?..
Sounds like your mom just sucks at chess.
This is intresting, maybe I should start an of and teach physics, I'm quite good at it hahah
Funny story: I read somewhere that this was the original purpose of OF but it got so over satured with porn and that put a lot of money on the table that now we have the OF of just full porn
Wait $500-$2000 monthly just for playing chess? Clothes on?! Something feels wrong, I mean, how?!
Makes a change for someone to be talking pawns rather than porn on OF. 

Good luck to you, can't see why it being sent out to anyone will cause you headaches.
Cut that bitch off. Only call and talk to dad form here on out. Reporting it to your job is a bit too far in my opinion and crosses the line for what a mother should do. Short of serious crimes, your mom should have your back
Doesn’t seem to me like you’re doing anything wrong. 

And by the way, I think what people do with their own bodies is their own business so even if you had been teaching people chess naked that’s your choice and I see nothing wrong with it. 

But in your case, you were fully clothed giving people chess tips. I’m not sure why anyone, including an employer would give a damn. What it tells me is you must be a very intelligent woman.

Your mother is some piece of work. I have never heard in all the years I’ve been on this forum of a mother reporting her own child for tax evasion.  Sounds like going NC was the right thing to do.

If the subject comes up at work and someone asks you, I suggest you just simply pull it up and show them. I’m talking about human resources or your direct Boss by the way not random people. Although I feel compelled to say again, there would be nothing wrong with showing it to random people.

Congratulations on being a smart articulate person who has a hobby that she’s earning money on. That’s awesome.

Good luck
I'm so confused... people pay you to talk about chess fully clothed? Couldn't they just use YouTube or something. I'm absolutely baffled by this
NGL, your mom sounds like a huge bitch. I’m sorry, but, reporting your own child for tax evasion is just disgusting. That’s not family behavior, that’s enemy behavior. Your mom is jealous of your relationship with your dad or something and you’d be smart to minimize her in your life. I also like the idea of leaning into the OF thing. Just own it and you’ll probably get all the subscribers you need to tell your mom to buzz off.
lol why don’t you physically show them your end of the account?
Delete your mom from your life. She falsely reported you for a crime and is trying to get you fired.

Take some screenshots of your OF so that you can show people what you do on there when/if needed.
So...your a pawn star?
Why is your mom trying to ruin your life? 😭 for what?? Makes no sense
I don’t think it’s anything to worry about. Yea OF is usually viewed as something for adult content but once people find out you’re just teaching people chess it’s no big deal. The reason you use OF is because it seemed like an easier way to gain viewers. 

Idk if OF lets you post like a free introduction video or something so people know you’re a page all about chess.
Your mom sent this to your employer? I hope this doesn't cause any complications with work.

Anyway you should voice your concerns about your mother to your dad and get some distance from her. She's showing crazy behavior. She also probably sucks at chess.
Imagine reporting your daughter for tax evasion. L mum.
I never thought I’d ask this, but… can I have the link to your OnlyFans?
Don’t OF profiles have a small description and info on what you’re selling? I mean without having to pay for it, one look at your profile would corroborate your story enough. But like one person said on here, you’re gonna meet people in life who just WANT to believe the worst about you. What they think will only drive you mad if you cared, unfortunately including your mother (who seems to have some other reason to go that far). Only person you need to explain your content to is your employer.
No offense, but you have a crappy mom
You can send screenshots of your OF as proof I would imagine. 
Also your mom is insane wow
For better advice, post this in r/anarchychess
Wow your mother is a piece of shit, no offence
[deleted]
Your moms a bitch id never talk to her again personally. Even if you were doing sex work, what kind of mother ruins their daughters life over it.
Your mom’s crazy. If you get in any actual trouble about this just show them the page. Otherwise I’d take it with good humor and make the jokes before other people make them, and they’ll leave you alone.
Focusing more on the latter half, your mom is sabotaging your life. I think you should talk to your dad about that, specifically, and see if he can get your psycho mom in line and to leave you tf alone. No contact is wise. I've had a couple of people in my life before who I cared about that I had to cut off. I handled it like this. I told them if they don't change "a, b and c" or if they ever "x, y or z" again then I'm removing them from life. Easier said than done but sending your own mother sending your OF to your employer is unthinkable. 

Maybe you already have that all handled. Regardless, wish you the best.
Tell your mom to relax, you’re only rooking online, for others pleasure.
Show them your OF, they'll see there's no NSFW content nd that should put an end to speculation. Most people have no idea OF can be used for pretty much any kind of content but if they see your page they'll probably get it
Keep doing what you're doing. Anyone in your life curious enough will subscribe and be sorely disappointed. It's also easy to explain away if you simply show it to the people who question you.
Be transparent with them and show them.
If it gets brought up, you can show them the proof from your side if you really care. Or explain and move on. People will think what they want either way. I'd take it as a compliment that they think you're sexy enough to do OF even if you don't believe so xD

You mom sounds the type of person I read about on r/raisedbynarcissists . Probably safest to keep her NC.
i know this isn’t the point of the story but any body is a good body for sw obviously no one should do anything they don’t want but makes me so sad seeing someone put themselves down for there body type , all bodies are beautiful
My favorite saying is: It's none of my business what other people think of me.
Start doing real sex work on OnlyFans to spite your mom and tell all of your coworkers to subscribe to you. That’s your only way to overcome this.
You make 2000 pounds a month for playing chess on a porn site? No you don't.
Show the people in your life your history of posting. If you end up losing opportunity or get attacked it’d be worth confirming who the person is so you can sue for slander
This is a tough situation and I have nothing but sympathy for you. I just wanted to say that i think a chess OF is both hilarious and really cool. Are you titled? like IM or FM or something? you dont have to say if you don't want to, and its still cool if you aren't titled, was just curious.
It's getting more and more popular for people to use OF for tutorials and stuff, people get more subscribers than sites like patreon because the nature of the nature of the site makes it a bit edgy and sparks intrest. I think 99% people would believe you if you told them it was chess and just see it as smart marketing. I would suspect some people your mum has told will subscribe just out of curiosity, and you can thank her for making you extra cash! She sounds hard to deal with
If it's nothing sexual then who cares? OF literally isn't just for sex work.
What you do is tell them look at your page they will only see chess
To parents, just show them your onlyfans and go "seriously, it's just chess. I'm as baffled as you are."

To friends, if they get involved, "listen, if you could get paid to talk about your hobbies, would you care if it was on onlyfans?"
Girl, please share your secrets. Anyway, if it comes up face to face just show them your OF on your phone.
Wow, making money without being revealing? Sounds like a win to me!

I feel like OF wouldn’t feel as stigmatized if more people start doing things like that.
OF I understood as Onlyfans. The rest gets harder.

>I do not use OF for any type of sw, although I am very much pro sw.

As a golfer, I'm thinking *sand wedge*, but it's probably *southwest*. However, that still doesn't make sense.

>we just have a difficult relationship and I went NC recently

North Carolina...?
The real issue isn't that your not-so-dirty secret was leaked; it's that your mom is harassing you and attempting to defame you.. somehow.. by telling people you get paid to play chess? Not sure what she hopes to accomplish there but *she* is the real problem.
Firstly. Disown your mother. The fuck is she doing?! 

I’m not exactly down with how OF works but I’m pretty sure you can do a free account (ie it doesn’t cost people to access the content) maybe you can go free for a week or two and direct people to check it out?
Some kind of demonstration of your actual content, however you make it available will take a lot of the wind out of people’s sails.

Personally I’d send out a link to a video in a company wide email - everyone who clicks that link - a) loses any moral high ground they might assume they have and -b) Will be disavowed of any mistaken belief you’re an online sex worker.

it probably won’t change some people’s minds but there a lot less room for nasty rumours to really take root if everyone knows the truth.

And, seriously, give your mother absolute hell.
You should definitely blow up your mom's spot... On your content. Tell the exact story and make it clear what happened haha. And then keep doing your thing. There's a lot of chess YouTubers, you may also be able to do chess collab content.
Run it and dont care. Just pay your taxes until the heat is clear. This is not legal advice.
While it is out there i would make it free for 2 months and just tell your employers its a free OF where your teaching chess. They will then check it out and provided your not doing any kind of sex work it will just die down.
what the *fuck* is wrong with your mother, jesus h christ >:(
That’s a tough spot! Maybe talk to your parents first and clear things up from your side. Getting ahead of any misunderstandings can help ease the awkwardness.
I'd let my page speak for itself 🤷‍♂️
"Mom, dad, my fans are for chess and math. Most girls do OF to show their buttholes, but I'm showing chess. But you already know that because you've seen my page."
....I didn't know G rated OF content was an option!! 

You may have just saved my house and car.

Now I just gotta think of something to do 😂

Anyways, you just keep doing you. YOU know what the content is. YOU know what you do and don't do. If anyone gives you grief about it, either ignore them, or give so much explicit detail it makes them uneasy and they walk away. Extra kudos if it's all technically chess related, but said to make it sound dirty ("This one chick railed 7 guys, one right after the other" queen took out pawns, bishops, etc)
Holy shit! Genius!
Take charge of the narrative in your life. Don't be afraid to say you do it, especially given the content. Yeah I do OnlyFans! Want to see?
I’m so confused. What’s the problem again? If your employer sees you have an only fans, and asks, you explain and move forward. Why is this problematic?
Honestly, I haven't the slightest clue what I'd do in your situation. 

Your dad sounds like an amazing guy, and your mom sounds like an ass.

As far as tax evasion, keep all your receipts and such.
If you 100% know who told your parents and you are on friendly terms, maybe don't be on friendly terms anymore.

On a similar note, there's a woman on the hub who explains programming and science and such. She might have an OF. There isn't anything wrong with it even if you do SW.
That is crazy and awful that someone you know IRL would try to fuck you over and super awful that your mom sucks that much.  So sorry you’re going through this- super laughable that it’s chess- super awful that some people suck as much as they do.
Aye, yoo. Now, this is what I like seeing. Talk about wholesome. You could also make a joke like, "Do you wanna see my chess?" lol
I think it’s funny and awesome anyone who asks I would just be honest that’s nothing to be ashamed about. I love chess and as long as your comfortable showing people a little it’s be way easier.
Can you share your @?
Set up a meeting with your employer and clear the air. Then if you talk to anyone at work sneak into your conversations that you play chess or sell tips for chess players on OF so they will know too.
Mom’s so salty she’s bad at chess that she reports you for tax evasion. 🔥
First of all, OF will send u a document if you’ve made enough to be taxed. Not everyone who has OF needs to report it for tax purposes. You can do your own research on that. One year I had to report it, the next (when I stopped posting) I don’t have to report bc I didn’t make enough income from it
Thats petty on a whole new level. I will say, however, that posting SFW content like you do on OF is a bold choice. Only reason i say that is that even though OF isn't just porn, 99% of people are going to associate OF with porn. Either way, who cares, but sadly that's the society we live in. Part of me would suggest shutting down the OF and opening a Patreon instead so that association is not longer there but i also understand that you have already gained somewhat of a following on OF and you would basically have to start back at square one. I mean in all honesty, fuck what others think and keep doing it. They should take you at your word and if they think you're lying, thats their problem and if they care THAT much, they can cough up however much your sub price is and see for themselves.
So if I sub, I get too see all your chess size?
Why… did you choose onlyfans? Why not patron?
How the fuck does one get 500-2000 pounds a month from this bro wtf
Honestly, just screenshot your OF profile from your point of view and send it to people to clear things up.
WHY DONT U USE PATREON
Can't you just show them your creator profile that it's just chess
Sounds like your mom is awful. 

If anyone asks, just simply explain the situation. If your work questions it, show them a video or two. 

If you don’t have shame in it, they’ll see the confidence and not shame you for it.
Id say get your mother arrested for something if you can…and why not just….show the people that its chess stuff? 
Seems like your dads a normal person and your mums insane and you can just show people that you’re not a sex worker…
Support SW and you should go down like them too. I don't care. Hopefully your parents kick you out
I’d do what someone said and make business cards. Lean into the free advertising
 What‘s your elo/national elo?
This whole time I read it as chest. Oops my bad
I guess you can always offer someone a month free if they want to confirm content? Really it shouldn’t be anyone’s business whether sw or not honestly. Your mom crossed a major boundary there but sounds like that’s not unexpected. Glad you were able to go mostly no contact
You should not do OF unless you are shameless and don’t care who knows.

Otherwise it will be a constant source of paranoia that someone you know will stumble upon it and share it to your other friends or family.

So my advice is quit, obviously. You aren’t shameless enough for this line of work. 

Which is a good thing. 
How do you market your OF?
Consequences of having an OF.


It's the Internet, what did you expect?
Kinda goes without saying when you use your branding with a specific platform. Just keep it honest that you dont do sex work with your parents and it’s about chess. Personally id use other platforms instead of only fans if you were concerned about being associated with sex work on a platform heavily filled with sex work also popularized and known for sex work 
I heard about onlyfans actually banning sexual content but IDK I can’t afford to check 
I would stay NC with that mum. That's a petty thing to do to your child. 
What is this, a secret campaign by OF to make people think they are more than just porn???
My suggestion is reporting your mother, sending this content could be considered illegal depending on specifics. Also, your content is copyrighted and your mother has committed copyright infringement, so send your mother a cease and desist if you wish. She has no issue reporting you, so you should have Mk issue reporting her.
Try Trading (Forex, Options or Stocks) or Binary Trading (it's different from general trading) alongside with spend time on High Income Freelancing Skill.

  
Learn it.
I'm just imagining the possible marketing innuendos you could name the videos with to draw in more customers.

Id be leaning into it
Well, I did try Patreon but didn't get any subscribers. Then I heard of a guy who got famous on corn-hub for making videos of himself making the bed, reading a book, etc and I thought that this would be a way to go. And.... it worked :D
OF is a subscription service but now it's  mainly SW. Heaps of other users are on it, like makeup artists etc.
That's super awkward, I feel for you. Just be honest with your parents if they bring it up. It's your life, and you shouldn't have to hide it. Focus on your own peace, ya know?
To be honest of you say you teach people chess on the side most employers don't mind.
He only shows pictures of his chest lol
ok i get the idea, but it would be very awkward to ask your employer “want to check out my onlyfans to be sure?” or sending an email with the subject “onlyfans pictures”
That's amazing
She's the queen

Rook(ie) mistake.
>Sounds like your mom just sucks
Sounds like her mom is secretly a fan
I think I heard about someone teaching math on p-hub! So why not physics!
Only Fysics
Send me link. I love physics. I think it's a great idea. OF takeover!
This has me thinking too
Why not if you enjoy teaching do it.
“Let’s get physical”
It's true.

It was a place to post content that ONLY your FANS would care about.  Stuff that they'd support you for just because they're fans.  Patreon kind of ... expects you to give them a reward for your patronage, it's less of a donation and more of a job in itself.

Like, it CAN be used as a donation platform, but it literally incentivizes with the tiered reward program.

OnlyFans was just a place to dink around and hang out with fans while making money, like Twitch streaming and people donating for the fuck of it.
Pandemic saw a ton of people doing porn stuff on OF, and at one point OF tried to band sexual content because they didn't like the change. That backfired hard, and they changed their mind.
Got told that too
I started doing it in a funny way by just staring at the camera with a demented smile, and people thought it was hilarious. But now some of my viewers actually want to learn chess! :)
Even crazier that OP says it's not a huge living! If I made that much extra every month on top of my job, I'd be well happy!
In the post when they said they went NC with their mom it means they cut off contact. NC = No contact
OnlyFans was a place people would go to pay content creators they were fans of. It was not meant for sw in the first place.  It just got turned into that.

For the same reason people donate to Twitch streamers they're watching for the sole purpose of throwing money at someone they like while that person is gaming or whatever, OP's fans are paying for the fun of the content involving OP specifically.
Maybe she meant tank top?
That was actually the initial purpose of OF, it only turned into the red light district of creator content because, well, sex sells...
Sw = Sex work (I think?)

NC = No contact. No contact of any type with her mother.
OF = OnlyFans

SW = sex work

NC = no contact
Must be very pro-Star Wars
She makes content on playing chess. Maybe read the description before making a stupid comment
She really is a pawn star.

Yeah this seems fine. I mean... if anyone asks you about it, obviously you can explain to them what it is. I wouldn't even bring up that "it's not what they think" before explaining. Just treat it like explaining you have a youtube or twitch channel. Tell them to check it out. You have nothing to hide. 

Sorry about your mom. She sounds like a real pill.
Well congrats I'm glad it's working out for you. But unfortunately I don't think there is any avoiding the negative thoughts that come to mind about that platform.

Informing the people who ask about it is the best way to go forward. I wish you all the best.
Make YouTube videos and push your patreon, you'll get subs that way
That math professor makes a killing on corn-hub

Oh, and your mom is a huge piece of shit and you might want to consider staying full NC. You'll likely realize how much more peace you have in your life without the anxiety about interactions with her.
Hey, have you checked out SubscribeStar? Has much less of a porn reputation
I mean yea, but its still fine imo
Sounds like your mom
Exactly! Was gonna say this too. Some dude earns a veryyyy, I mean veryyy, large sum from it.
;)
OF takeover!!
Please tell me you do some hilarious innuendo with an en passant
Yes ma’am! We internet strangers are proud!
This is so cool and im happy to see there’s people earning money using onlyfans not by selling their body!
Wait are you male?
Oh. I saw "NC"multiple times and thought people meant New York City. Like why does everyone move to New York, I heard it's expensive... Thanks for explaining!
Well to each their own I suppose :)
This should be her branding on OF for sure
i'll subscribe!!
are we not allowed to say porn-hub on reddit or something?
Sounds like
NC could also mean North Carolina for some people
Wow. I actually thought corn-hub was a thing. Like a super vanilla version of porn-hub, but with people making their bed and boring stuff like that.
I think it's just forbidden to write or say in so many places now (most notably YouTube) that people are just in the habit now of using these alternate terms.
Sounds
I'm just as confused as you are, my friend.
Pretty sure they changed the name of their site to 'corn-hub' and plastered the front page full of videos of shucking corn and such as an April Fools joke a few years back.

This is the part where I tell you that I heard that from a friend followed by the part where nobody believes me and mocks me.

Relatable
They did that back in the 2010s at some point too. Maybe like 2010-2012ish. I remember it being all over Reddit when it happened.

My [28M] wife [25F] ruined our honeymoon
This is going to be a very long one, I apologize in advance. My wife and I got married very recently this year, in a gorgeous ceremony, surrounded by our friends and family. We were together for 4 years prior. This last year has been monumentally stressful for the two of us, both work-wise and with the wedding planning. However, the day couldn't have been more perfect and it was undoubtedly the absolute best day of our lives, making all of the trouble and stress more than worth it.

I make very good money and provide for the both of us, while my wife takes care of finances/bills, plans our trips and generally keeps me uplifted when I'm stressed with work. I adore my wife, she's beautiful, smart, extremely well read and has always shared my sense of humor. When we met, I couldn't believe that there was someone as wonderfully goofy and weird as I was and I knew very early on that she was the one for me. We made it through the pandemic together, through distance at times and I never thought that anything could sway my feelings for her.

We booked an expensive honeymoon, in a tropical location, scheduled a few weeks after the wedding. She'd been there before and told me she had always wanted to go back. I paid, while she, as per usual organized the trip. The first few days were amazing. We're not super active on our vacations and were just happy to drink, go to the beach for the whole day and out to nice dinners in the evening. The second hotel we stayed at is where things took a turn.
While out, my wife and I started chatting to a few other couples at a beachside bar/restaurant. We're both very social, so we like asking other couples about themselves, sharing funny comparisons and including each other in the laughs. She was getting a little tipsy, but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary. At some point, she began to start slipping into 'drunk' territory and I started ordering us more food and suggesting she take it easy, which she obliged. Despite this, she later kept ordering more drinks. I asked her to please take it easy, because I know her pacing at this stage. She got quite agitated and stated that this was her honeymoon too and she wanted to relax. While talking some more, she got noticeably more drunk, pretty fast. I was talking to the couple on my right, when I heard my wife tell the girl next to her that she had a 'one that got away', who she wished she 'hadn't let go' and that she settled for me. My face, my stomach, my heart, everything dropped. I can't imagine what I must have looked like in that moment, but the people she was talking to got very quiet and awkward, the couple next to me tried changing the subject. Still, my wife went on.

She gestured toward me and began to discuss that I wasn't her type at all and went on to describe something entirely different. We had both made jokes in the past about not being each others initial type, but that since meeting each other, we were both the 'type' we both never knew we wanted. It seems this wasn't true on her end. She patted my head condescendingly and said "unfortunately, this was the best I could do, but life goes on". She wasn't laughing. She was completely deadpan. I was absolutely crushed. This didn't seem at all like the person I had been with over the last 4 years. I tried to get her to put her drink down, let me pay the check and leave when she outright snapped. The waitress had refused her when she asked for another drink and she stormed off to the bathroom. At this stage, the people she was talking to had migrated tables and the couple next to me were trying to reassure me, despite the bomb that had clearly gone off. I went to go check on her after a few minutes. This turned to 20 more minutes, after which the waiting staff had to go in and retrieve her. She had been getting sick in the bathroom. She didn't say a word to me when she got out and just grabbed her stuff. In the interim, the other couple had picked up our check, which I was incredibly embarrassed about, but grateful for. The parted ways saying "happy honeymoon" in awkward wincing smiles.

I left with her, feeling utterly dumbstruck, embarrassed, concerned and above all just heartbroken. She spent the entire walk back to the hotel saying that she knew I was embarrassed of her behaviour, adding "you know what, I don't care, you're an embarrassment most of the time". She went to point out that she that I was not funny or charismatic, as she had said in the past, but a clown, a laughing stock, and that our friends only put up with me out of niceties. She said that they all just saw me as a complete joke and that I was just too stupid to notice. This was all being screamed at me in front of as many people as you can imagine a popular destination spot would have walking around in the main town, all while I was trying to keep her from stumbling out onto the street. I had turned from embarrassed and upset to completely numb. I felt as though my marriage had detonated then and there. I'm ashamed to say this, but in that moment, I imagined leaving her as soon as I got back home and the ensuing embarrassment of having to explain to friends and family that my marriage had not even lasted a season without crumbling.

We were getting into a semi crowded elevator when she squirmed out and bolted off. I immediately ran back down 3 stories and spent the next 45 minutes trying to locate her on the hotel premise. Finally we got back to the room and she fell straight to sleep on the bed. I rolled her onto her side, tucked her in and got her water. We were going to our 3rd stop at a resort the following morning, so I just stayed up and packed. To say I felt empty inside is a complete understatement. She woke up about 2-3 hours later asking what had happened. Why I looked so upset. I asked if she was actually serious. If the most devastating part of our relationship, of any relationship I had ever been in had not JUST happened for her. She seemed anxious, as if it were less than half coming back to her, so I told her everything she had done, as calmly as I could. I told her how much she had hurt and embarrassed me with what she had said.

She was hysterical. She started screaming into the pillows, trying to hurt herself, screaming that she had ruined our honeymoon and our marriage, begging me not to leave her, telling me she didn't mean it. She was still fairly drunk. I told her to just go back to sleep, that I needed to go for a walk and have some time to think. She refused to give me it. She grabbed my arm while I asked her to let go, scratching me while I told her to just let me have space, screaming all the while. I stopped and just got into bed and told her I could not talk to her. We both went to sleep, but she woke me multiple times, telling me that we needed to talk through this and that I owed her that much. I just told her that I couldn't. I was shattered. I told her I didn't even know if I could finish the rest of the honeymoon and that I didn't know if I could go to the final resort we were staying at.

I woke the next morning. She had cancelled our 5 day resort stay that we were due to be at in 6 hours, of which I received no refund. She cried, she apologized, she begged for me to hear her out, but there was literally nothing that could fix what she had said and how she talked to me after, in that moment. She told me that it wasn't her, that she remembered none of it and that she couldn't even begin to think of why she had said and done those things. That it wasn't how she felt at all and that I was the best thing that had ever happened to her, that I had to believe her, after everything we had been through. Asking why I couldn't just trust her after all of this time together.

This is getting very long, so to put the rest of the trip briefly, she used her savings to pay for a very expensive resort for us that day, apologizing for cancelling the other one without asking first. She wanted to save the trip. For the rest of the trip she was remorseful, she was kind, she was sweet, she was the person that I had fallen in love with. She seemed just as shattered and upset as I was. I tried to make the most of the rest of our stay, but it was obvious that I was still heartbroken, despite trying to keep it together. She cried on the plane home and she cried most of the day we got back.
Fast forward a couple of very awkward, sad and tense days, she comes to me and lays out all of the changes she was going to make. She has always done the laundry but didn't really do a lot of the cleaning or cooking. In recent months she would often get agitated when I would finish work and start doing it. She promised to do all or at least most of the household stuff, to take the pressure off of me. She started dressing up, doing her makeup more often, she even cooked me a fancy dinner and decorated, to show how much she appreciated me and the life I had given her (her words, not mine). She told me that she had only said those things because she was insecure about not working, about herself in our friend group and how she had felt that our mutual friends liked me more than her. I don't believe that last part to be true in the slightest. More than half of them were actually her friends before they were mine. I asked about the 'one that got away', as difficult as it was and she said that she didn't know why she said that but she didn't feel that way. She said that I was her type, that I was the only one for her and that she would spend as long as it took to make it up to me.

We see a lot of relationship posts reuploaded to tiktok and one thing I absolutely cannot stand is that the couples cannot seem to fathom the concept of actually communicating to each other in situations like this... and that's what we did. We communicated. We talked openly and honestly. I told her firmly and candidly about all of the changes I needed. I asked about what I needed to change, what could have made her so full of contempt for me in that moment on our honeymoon and what we could both do to avoid it. Things started to pick up over the next few days and it seemed like things were going to be ok. There were some lingering things, of course. I wasn't initiating intimacy, I just couldn't. I felt like a complete loser. I felt completely undesirable. Questioning how anyone could see anything in me, if this is how she felt. She tried on multiple occasions, but I just asked her for time to recover. She gave me that space and reassured me that she would wait as long as it took for me to feel up to it again. We both always had a high sex drive and that was now completely shot.

Finally over time, we were intimate again, she cooked, cleaned, did sweet things for me, acted like she did when we first met. It really did feel like this whole nightmare might have been a net positive. Like it had kicked some things that were off in our relationship back into place. Like it was the wakeup call we needed. I still had intrusive thoughts, but we communicated and she would compliment and reassure me. She would constantly ask if how she was acting and the things she was doing for me were noticeable. I told her that they were and that I appreciated them and I tried to be more aware of any flaws I myself might have in my day to day.
It's been some weeks since then and things have started to slip back. The nice dinners stopped almost immediately, as did the nice gestures. She's started to become irritable with me with small things, unrelated to me. She's stopped doing household things consistently and is again irritable when I ask if she can help with them, while I'm working. I don't work the longest hours on earth by any means, but my work weeks are 60 to sometimes 70 hours. I'll find her downstairs playing video games or watching streams and asking her to help out is leading to strained discussions at times. She doesn't not do housework at all, but it's absolutely noticeably less already. She had started therapy through Betterhelp (I have no experience with that app and don't know if it is reputable) but that stopped after about 2 weeks. We have long discussions and things get better momentarily, but they keep resetting and I feel like I'm in a sate of déjà vu with everything. Again, I previously stated that I hate that couples can't just talk to each other in these kind of posts, but we've been talking. She'll turn around and still do sweet things, but I just can't bring myself to look past what happened sometimes and it's still eating at me. My confidence is completely fine some days and others it is just on the floor.

I still love her, but I cannot say with any confidence that I feel "in love" with her anymore and I don't know what to do. I never thought I would see myself on this end of one of these posts. She's talked to her mother about it and I cannot bring myself to say anything to my parents or friends. I'm so embarrassed and haven't been able to confide in anyone about this, aside from her. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. Any advice movement forward would be so appreciated. Have a wonderful day, all of you.

(TL;DR: My wife drunkenly said she settled for me and is still holding a candle for someone else, on our honeymoon. Then she said I was a joke)

Edit: Oh my goodness, thank you all for your messages, no matter what your opinions were, I appreciate all of them and I appreciate you all giving your time and advice. I only just work up, so sorry for not responding sooner. I really wasn't expecting this turnout in the comments. Being able to get the story off of my chest, outside of talking to her, is in itself some form of relief. 

I see a lot of people writing that my wife married me for the money. I really should have added that when we got engaged, we did not have much money at all. Sorry for not including it initially, I wrote this at around 1-2am my time, and the grammatical errors reflect that. We got engaged in the middle of the pandemic, work had dried up in my field and we were both banking on my plan to pay off. She always said she believed I could be successful, but I was by no means close to being financially sound when she said yes to marrying me. However that said, take from that what you will. 

I'm trying my best to read through all of the messages. I'll be honest, a lot are difficult to process. I see, acknowledge and appreciate the ones telling me to look out for my best interests, but also the ones telling me to actually ask my wife about her aspirations or goals, which surely cannot be sitting around/household tasks. In the past it's been touchy and/or difficult to get her to pursue the field of her degree. It's creative and daunting and she has often gotten defensive and dismissive of my help in the past. This morning I asked her to lay out a realistic and specific plan to get back into working, with the goal of working towards the career she actually wants.

I have never been to therapy, but I'm going to look into one on one sessions and go from there, no matter what outcome, after reading this, I clearly need to work on me, whatever that might entail. I'm going away on a trip with some guy friends for a couple of days and while they are our mutual friends, I'm going to try and open up to them as non-biased as I can. Thank you all for sharing your own past experiences so candidly with me and for the DM's also. I know that these next steps seem like baby steps and might be frustrating to read from your end, but we are both religious, divorce is not the option I want to go down if I can help it. However, you're all right. I cannot be miserable for the rest of my life and if no effort is made, it's looking like that might have to be a route. With that said, your words have given me comfort, and while they haven't restored all of my self confidence, they have shown me that I have to actually buck up, be more direct and not be so malleable.

I will update in the coming weeks. Thank you all so much again, I really mean it. Have a wonderful day, you kind souls.
This is a tough one. My question is, in the happiest moment, why did she act like that? 

You provide for her. She doesn't need to work. She gets irritated when you ask her to help her with housework while she's playing video games. 

To me, sounds like she's using you. She married you because it's easy life for her. So she has a lot of unhappiness bottled up in her just keep it going. That's maybe why she got so drunk and expressed her true feeling on which meant to be one of the happiest moment of her life. Because it wasn't. She has settled for the easy life, and she isn't truly happy about it. 

But I may be totally wrong. It may just have been a silly drunken incident.
As a woman  who used to drink a lot more and also easily black out: nothing I've been told I said when drunk came from nowhere. It all has roots in some feeling or memory my drunk mind has fixated on. 

I'm sorry, but she has given you a glimpse into her true feelings, panicked, and tried to smooth it over. However, it's taken more effort than she's realised she's willing to give. 

Whether this other person she referenced was an actual ex or a crush, it appears that she's looking to stick it out with you because you're the safe and intelligent option. You're giving her more than she deserves and I don't think anyone in your life, after hearing this story, would judge you.

 You're still young and you have so much time to find someone worthy of your love and affection. 

EDIT to add: please seek therapy for yourself. There is danger here that this experience will colour your perception of other women and will manifest as baggage in other relationships
I hate to say but, I don't think I'd be able to forgive that behaviour, let alone decide to spend my life with a woman like that
“The life you’ve given her” well damn she said it herself. She loves not working and you paying for everything. It’s possible since she’s only 25 she’s realized she regrets spending her early 20s with you and lowkey thinks she could’ve found someone else or was wishes she had gotten back with that other dude. 

I’m really sorry you’re going through this, but you’re still young and you can find someone else who actually appreciates you.
I would absolutely be done with her. I would have left her at the resort and filed for divorce as soon as I could.
I think this is done bro, I’m so sorry, the fact she doesn’t work and she can’t even be bothered to look after the house when you’re pulling 60 hour weeks shows she has no respect for you, I hope you had a pre-nup because it’s time to call it. 

You were in love before but how is the relationship ever going to recover from her saying that, idk maybe but for me I could never forget that.
Get out of that as fast as you can. I got divorced after 8 months after finding out my new wife was having an affair lol. I was embarrassed at first too, but you know what? Fuck “being embarrassed”. It’s your life. You only get one. Do what makes you happy and who cares about other people’s opinions about your “short marriage”. I met a girl just a few months after my divorce who has been absolutely incredible. Best relationship I have ever had. That’s out there for you too, and this woman isn’t the one. She doesn’t love or respect you. Don’t let your disrespectful, rude, lazy wife stop you from meeting the love of your life.
WOW OP. I could never ever ever come back from this. what an awful woman. She may seem ‘sweet’ and all that good stuff, but she sure did let you see her true colours, time and time again. I’m so sorry it’s turned out like this. You deserve SO much more. If I were you, I would be serving her divorce papers.
She destroyed her meal ticket, and so is remorseful. She meant what she said while she was drunk, even just a little, and is using you to get a good ride in life. This is evidenced by her behaviour afterward, she made some effort, was nice to you for a while, and now she thinks you mollified, has settled back into just being a passenger in your life while you pay through the nose for everything. You can't trust her, sober or drunk, because what she really thinks is what she said while drunk, but most especially demonstrates to you while sober. She doesn't care about you, she just wants you to keep giving her the easy ride.
In vino veritas, friend.  Get yourself out of this asap.
"I still love her, but I cannot say with any confidence that I feel "in love" with her anymore and I don't know what to do."

Do yourself & her a favor & leave.
Leave this child. She essentially threw a tantrum to get you to stay. Now she's comfy again and isn't doing shit. What she said to you, she meant every word. The alcohol just made it come out. I'm so sorry, OP, but this isn't going to get better.
She killed the flame and now you’ll forever have to try to stoke the fire or feel like it’s gonna burn. Out for good. Truth is words hurt. I’m not a big advocate on this but maybe you go to therapy or at the very least confide in someone like a family member. You’re carrying all this alone sometimes just talking about it with someone that actually knows you helps and sometimes having a outside source helps. I’m sorry this happened but the thing is she can’t change it now and neither can you. You can only choose to heal together or alone.
Thank you all so much for your responses. My inbox floored me when I woke up. Still trying to get through everything, but I appreciate all of your takes and outpouring support.

I have added an edit with my plans to move forward atm. I will hopefully be updating in some time.

Thank you all again!
She wants your money and lifestyle, not you.

She sees it as she gave up 'love' for comfort and now she knows she can get away with absolutely devastating you and gets to keep her lifestyle she will continue to apologise, act nice for awhile then go straight back to how she normally is.

Get a divorce lawyer now! Do it quietly and do exactly what they say so she doesn't get to take you to the cleaner's because that's her long-term plan. 

The longer she's married to you and dependant on you financially, the more she gets.
I have some information which might prove to be relevant to you. At least I made the connection.

I don't know psychology, and am just an armchair psychologist. This needs therapy imo.

But.. therapy doesn't work on people who aren't willing, or won't tell the truth.


There is a fundamental truth of people you have to understand, people are insecure. They are anxious, traumatised, have low self esteem and are running away from themselves.

In general people have emotional issues, and this dictates their lives to huge extents.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

There are people who seek love in order to fill a void in themselves, instead of seeking love for love's sake.

Are they incapable of loving? No they aren't, not by any stretch.

Do they ask more than the relationship can give? Perhaps.

A relationship can't sustain YOU and your self worth. If you try to get that support, the relationship will colapse.

Now comes the part i think might be relevant- 

Full disclosure, I read this in a newspaper article. This is extremely simple, but might be pertinent.

The headline read- Is your relationship out of love or loneliness?

People who love out of love can tolerate separation even if they miss their partner

People who love out of loneliness can't tolerate separation and get anxious when separated

People who love out of love will be sad to breakup and very hurt, but will prioritise your happiness along with theirs.

People who love out of loneliness will freak out when a breakup is on the horizon. They'll get irate or start shouting, or get very stressed


People who love out of love, have a calm and kind love

People who love out of loneliness will have a clingy and needy love



That's not to say that people who love out of loneliness may be incapable of love. It may be the case that they settle for partners who they might not want because they fear being alone.

Now, I've heard that when people get blackout drunk, people can say the most random or batshit insane things. Alcoholics have reported to saying things a complete180 of their actual beliefs.

So there's no guarantee what your wife said are 100% her inner thoughts. They might also not be.

What you said, there are very minor 'clues' if you consider them such.

She's not willing to take responsibility (the drop off in housework and effort after some time passed - you will not be able to pull off an unsustainable habit, by definition)

She doesn't have a job and likely has self esteem issues, as she stated she felt insecure due to not having a job, although that could've been a lie to appease you.

And it's sort of telling that she went to a 0 - 100 after an incident. Not that it happened, any spouse will be in "makeup with hubby" mode after that happened, but there's something to note about the quality of it.


Here you are who's been hurt, and your self esteem has been shattered.

How does she make it up to you?

By being extra nice
By doing all the chores so you feel grateful
By TAKING all the responsibility
By dolling up to appease you visually


I ask you, how's any of that relevant in a broken self esteem?

It's not. It helps the hurt sure, a small bit, but it's fundamentally (imo) a giant appeasement effort.

And appeasement is a misdirection tactic. It avoids paying the real price (earning trust) while gently coaxing you into a better mood.

Don't accept it.

There are many many examples of spouses who do nothing but video game all day, scroll online and are also in a dysfunctional relationship.

The relevant interpretation being the bad lifestyle and the bad relationship is a side-effect of dysfunction inside of them.

Do you think that's the case?

How well do you know your wife?

Is it possible that your wife has deep emotional issues which she has hid from you and just can't or doesn't want to tell you?

Some people don't want to solve their problems. They just want to put on a band aid and forget.

What's the probability of a person behaving like your wife did, if the person was deeply insecure, and was in a relationship out of loneliness and was repressing feelings of inadequacy which came from settling with someone who wasn't the fantastic ideal in all conceivable dimensions?

What's the probability of that behaviour, given the emotional issues were assumed to be true?

Is it possible that you were chosen for your wealth and status? Because there are plenty of people who go for that.


Start watching her like a hawk. Stop communicating with her. Collect data over a long enough interval of time. And do not allow her the opportunity to modify her behaviour.

Be precise in your observations. You'll have your answer in her behaviour to an extent.


It may turn out that she's not a good partner or it might not turn out that way.

In the former case, if you want to continue the relationship, get her to a personal therapist asap. Also go to couples therapist.

Some couples counsellors aren't therapist, I wouldn't recommend those.
You have money so seek out an actual therapist who does couples therapy.


And lastly. None of this is a reflection on you. It's a reflection on her. I suspect all this is because of some bad beliefs she has about herself and the world.

Don't take it so hard although that's foolish sounding at this time.

Get a therapist yourself. A lot of things will become clear.

Good luck and you'll survive and thrive. Dont give up.
Nah fam. She's not for you. Let her go and file for a divorce or annulment.
My husband(28m) and I (29f) have a similar arrangement. He works and pays for our living expenses and I take care of it all. I clean and cook and do the chores without him EVER having to ask… because I’ve been blessed with a man who wants to provide, it’s only fair that I take the extra load off him while I’m home with all this empty time on my hands…

I would never in a million years say those things to my husband, mostly because it’s not true. He’s my man. He’s the one, he’s perfect and I appreciate him so much and everything he does. He didn’t have to work for me I’m more than capable, but we thrive in our relationship, but I can’t be lazy and live off him… that makes me file like crap if I did!!! I do my part!  

To ruin a honeymoon in such a way breaks my heart for you, I wouldn’t be able to stay. Those words were nasty and they came from deep down somewhere… shes feels these emotions… I’m so sorry your going through this… but I feel like she might be using you, because I’m hearing a lot of “I love the life your giving me” not I love the life we’re making.
A few things; when people get drunk, they don't suddenly change in to someone else, only parts of them get amplified, while other parts get surpressed.
That is to say, she may actually carry these feelings and thoughts, but she has tried to repress them. Repressing them only amplifies them over time in her mind, until the combo of the wedding stress and alcohol finally caused the dam to burst.

Still this does not have to mean that your marriage is doomed, if both of you are willing to really work on it and communicate with absolute honesty.

As a personal anecdote, my wife actually told me, after we had been married for some years, that she had a "one that got away".
Keeping it to herself had been consuming her from the inside. After she admitted it, I of course was crushed. Over time though, through discussing it more and more, it became less of an issue. She realized that she had held on to an ideal and a "what if?" and not an actual person. This had been keeping her from fully committing to me.
Once we started talking about it, these feelings gradually faded, and as it seems are now completely gone.

So there might be hope, if this is something she can start communicating about, and you can actually face head on. It's not easy, but marriage rarely is.
You should look up the cycle of abuse. The perpetrator will do something horrid, get called out, lovebomb to make it all seem better, then slip back to the old habits when they think they have their claws in you again. I don't think it's a thing she decided consciously. It's probably just a behavior pattern she learned, maybe from her own parents or past partners. Maybe even "the one that got away" and that's why she let him go. 

Point being, if her patterns aren't erring in the upward fashion, then she's only done it long enough to keep you around. She doesn't actually want to change. She doesn't want her life to change. So she does enough to keep you around, and then she goes back to the old way. If you nag enough, she may eventually decide its too much work and move on, but you shouldn't wait for that. She's told you in every way that matters that she's not interested in changing or growing with you. Let her go.
She’s a con artist
Bro, I'm gonna level with you, you're a dumbass. You work 60-70 hours a week, which you somehow think is a normal amount to work, and then do housework, while she's chilling and enjoying nice vacations and so on. And you are now letting her gaslight you into thinking that what happened meant nothing.
In vino veritas
Im sorry but shes using you. Get a divorce because in the long run it wont get better at all i am so sorry she is like that to you. 
Hope you find someone that will carry your heart like you carry theirs
Jesus egging Christ, how much of a sucker can you possibly be?!? SHE IS SNOWING YOU, and you are falling for it, line hook and sinker!

Her only genuine moments were the ones when she was drunk and told you what she really thought about you. You should have flown home the next day and gotten an annulment! Instead, you let her hose you, when she realized her cushy life was about to slip away, and put on the waterworks - I mean, who else is going to give her a completely free ride? 

Now she knows she has you locked in again, and you're too desperate not to be alone to ever leave the female dog. She just has to make sure she never drinks too much again.

Please, OP, you sound like a genuinely nice guy (in the best sense of the word), caring and loving, successful - you deserve so much better in a relationship, than to be used by a manipulator who is just after your money.
I am so sorry you are going through this. You have no reason to be embarrassed. None. You loved her, and unfortunately, she played you. This is to your credit, and her shame.

Get an attorney, yesterday. You may still be eligible for an annulment.

Tell your friends and family, because you don’t deserve to be suffering through this alone. 

Get therapy. She needs it, but you don’t need to be paying for it.
I am genuinely surprised that you haven’t kicked her out already and separated at the minimum. 

Love truly does make a man blind 

I’m gonna be blunt here. 

SHE DOES NOT LOVE YOU, SHE LOVES THE LIFESTYLE YOU PROVIDE HER WITH 

Bro, stop letting your emotions cloud your judgement. Sit down and think logically about your relationship for a minute. If this happened to a friend of yours, what would you think and say to that friend? 

Get rid of her
Get an annulment asap. I'm so sorry but don't settle for a ife of misery
First and foremost, you don’t deserve any of this and I’m so sorry this happened. As a recovered alcoholic I want you to know that the horrible things we say when drunk have often have nothing to do with the person we’re saying them to and everything to do with ourselves. You deserved none of that.

Second, if you really want to try couples therapy is a must. And one of the topics to discuss is why she’s committed to a life that makes her so unhappy. 

Third, your marriage didn’t fall apart. It was entered into under false pretenses. Ending it now would, it seems, be *healthy* and give you the opportunity to find someone who wouldn’t think these things or treat you this way. No one who is worth anything is going to think less of you when you explain *why* it ended. They too will see her for who she has shown herself to be. You’re not a fool, you are someone who was manipulated and lied to. Selfishly and cruelly. 

No one deserves to be used and made to feel the way you’re feeling by someone they love.
I honestly don’t know that I’d be able to stay married to her after this. 
I think there is some truth to the old saying “what soberness conceals, drunkenness reveals.”. Specifically when in reference to how someone feels about another person. 
The less inhibited, more careless mind of a drunk person will overshare. While what they say may be a bit exaggerated or even embellished a bit but, there is some truth to what they say.
In your case, the things she said were fucking brutal and even if super exaggerated, it’s clear that she married you for the wrong reasons. For her this is a marriage of convenience, of necessity. If I were I in your shoes, I would always feel that lingering in my soul. Her words would replay in my head and it would wreck me. 

Brother, she didn’t ruin your honeymoon. She ruined your marriage. It’s probably not too late for an annulment. That’s what I’d be doing if I were you. I couldn’t stay married to a woman who said those things about me. That’s how she actually feels and no amount of apologizing, or playing Susie homemaker will ever change that. Clearly that’s all BS anyway because she slides back into her old ways. 

You deserve better than that. You shouldn’t have to wonder if your wife actually loves you, respects you and wants to be with you. You shouldn’t feel like someone’s consolation prize, a participation trophy.

There’s no undoing what was done, unsaying what was said. 
Her being drunk is relevant only in that it loosened up her tongue and allowed her real feelings to come to light. 
It’s not an excuse. It doesn’t make any of what she said untrue. 

It’s sad that she was raised to see marriage as a means to an end instead of what it’s supposed to be. Clearly she just wants to be someone’s trophy wife and she’s willing to settle for anyone who can give her a lifestyle she feels is appropriate. Let that be some other poor s.o.b.. 
You can find someone who actually wants to be with you, not just financially supported by you.
She doesn't love you. I'm sorry.
One thing you can trust with absolute truth, is a drunk person. I was raised by one.  The alcohol turns off the filter in their brain that keeps their mouth from going over time and saying shit that they know they shouldn't,  and normally wouldn't if they were sober.  All their "secret" thoughts and true feelings.  I call it, brown bottle honesty. It's the only time you will hear their absolute truest feelings and thoughts. The mask they wear slips off and reveals the actual truth of who that person really is on the inside.    Good luck OP, I hope you find the resolution you are looking for.
She will divorce you and take half of everything. The person she was when drunk is who she really is. She doesn't want to lose her cash cow before she can cash in. Get an annulment. Hope you signed a prenup. She may have NPD and went from the love bombing phase to the devaluing phase due to her feeling secure that you were married and she could start the process of getting rid of you. The real person you married is who she was whens he was drunk. The rest is just an act. If you stay married she will devalue you and take all she can from you.
I couldn't forgive her if I were in your shoes. What she did was truly awful and unforgivable.

No matter how many times she makes token gestures to fix this, it'll always be in the back of your mind eating away at you. It's just not worth it, I'd have left her at the hotel.
Am I the only one seeing her as a huge narcissist utilizing "love bombing"?
Anyways dude this is only gonna get worse. Get yourself outta there!!!
She's sorry because she's afraid of losing her lifestyle. As soon as she feels secure again, like now, she reverts to selfishness. I'd ask her to leave and I'd be extremely careful of being intimate with her. She could try to bby trap you to secure a place in your life.
Wow. I am so sorry. My husband & I were on the other end of a situation like this. We were driving home with a couple we had known separately before they got together, so long-time friends individually. She was a single mom and he moved her & her 3 kids into his home. He was a quiet guy who had his life together (great job, nice house, always kind w/lots of friends). We were driving to their house after a night out & she was in the front seat with my husband driving. Very drunk, she starts telling my husband how she couldn’t stand her BF, that she didn’t want to have sex w/him & he could go find that elsewhere cuz she was grossed out by him. Her BF & I were sitting in the middle seats of the vehicle & could hear every word. I was mortified. He was crushed & humiliated. The sheer cruelty lowered our regard for her severely. He did eventually break up with her, but I’ll never forget her doing that to him. Pure hatefulness & derision. 

You should do what he did: get rid of her. You deserve better.
I’m 99.9% certain that she meant every word she said while she was drunk. Alcohol alone doesn’t have the power to make you do things that aren’t true to yourself. Meaning that if you’re willing to do it drunk, you already wanted to do it when you were sober. 

They way she reacted with self harm when she realized what she did makes me think that she was angry with herself for letting her big secret out. And please don’t brush over the fact that she got physically aggressive with you after everything she put you through that day. She didn’t want you going out and thinking for yourself while she was still too drunk to spin her narrative on the situation.

She sounds abusive. Best of luck to you
Contact a lawyer and file for an annulment.
I don’t know if she meant what she said when she was drunk. It’s certainly possible that she did—drunk words are sober thoughts and all that. It’s also possible that she started off joking around, got caught up in having an audience, and the alcohol prevented her from seeing when it was time to stop being “in character” to remain in the spotlight. 

So she did something pretty awful, and also kind of unfixable, because if she meant it you should divorce and if she didn’t mean it you should find a way to let it go (and she should stop drinking) but there’s no way to know which of those two drastically different solutions to employ because only she knows how she really feels and you can’t trust what she says.

Without the ability to choose an appropriate solution, you settled on an inappropriate one: she spends the rest of her life unnaturally extending herself to make it up to you. All those changes you “needed” from her—they have nothing to do with her transgression, and they don’t come naturally to her, so what’s that about? Didn’t you originally marry the woman you actually wanted? Because to go straight from that to “needing” her to behave very differently is kind of odd. Maybe those changes were just a stand-in for the reassurance she can’t ever give you, or maybe *you* felt like you were settling in this marriage and saw an opportunity to level up.

I think you two need to separate for a while. Her being an ever-smiling Suzy Homemaker is not sustainable, and even if it were it wouldn’t solve the underlying problem. She didn’t hurt you by failing to run the vacuum cleaner; she hurt you by saying awful, awful things about you and about how she feels about you. She needs to find a job and move out for a bit while you both do some thinking (and getting back into therapy would help a lot—you should, too!). You need space from the issue, and you need some time to sort out what your relationship is really based on. Maybe you’ll drift the rest of the way apart and know it’s time for a divorce (and it’s probably better for you, financially, if she’s already working in that case), or maybe you’ll find your way back together, and be able to believe that when she chose you a second time she meant it.
Dude fuck that bitch. You deserve better. You are still Soooo young
How could she go from "not remembering what happened" to "I said all of that because I was insecure...blah blah blah. I would have dropped her off at home and gone right to a lawyer.  Seek annulment or divorce. She is going to end up cheating, leaving, and taking you for everything you have. Why put off the inevitable.
Drunk words are sober thoughts, That is all.
My husband said the day he married his ex-wife things changed. His honeymoon was eye-opening, like yours, and he tried to make it work. They had a child and 6 months after the baby came, he was out of the house. 

Just go. There isn't a relationship here. No need to get locked into her for a lifetime. (Its not 18 years, trust me on that.)
File for an annullment... :( I'm sorry that happened to you
When I drank, I would say things I never would have said sober. And I would say them because alcohol loosened my inhibitions. But there was always truth there in my words. 

I don’t think it’s as cut and dry as other redditiors make it out to be: that she is a nefarious gold digger. I think your wife settled for someone that she wouldn’t normally have settled for, it worked, and she convinced herself she was happy. The alcohol brought up those deep, dark, insecurities she had and was refusing to address. 

I think she does care for you but I think she also had her moment of realization that perhaps this really isn’t who she truly is and who she had been trying to convince herself of who she was. And now she’s depressed and in a dark place because she knows she can’t go on like this anymore. 

OP, I’m sorry but I think it’s over and it’s time to start separating.
You’ve tried and tried I feel like it’s time to move on from this relationship and find someone who actually loved and cares for you
Sorry OP, she won’t change. Honestly it’ll probably be easier to just be honest with your friends and family now, not a year from now. It’s a loss. Time to move on.
She said what she had wanted to say for a long time. Regardless of her "behavior" changes or household chores changes, nothing changes mentally. Divorce. NOW! Divorce before you introduce kids into the world and you get soaked for support. Divorce before you take another mental beating. I am absolutely serious about this. No therapy in the world will make this different. Act normal, get a lawyer, be the first to act or you'll regret it.
Drunk words are sober thoughts. Thats all I wanna say. Good luck on everything, I hope you two the best.
>I still love her, but I cannot say with any confidence that I feel "in love" with her anymore

This is what people getting a divorce say. 

Sometimes you shouldn't be married to someone even if you still love them. In the long run, it would be best for both of you to separate. She's not happy now, nor will she ever truly be happy with you. You are setting yourself up for more heartache when she finds someone that excites her, and she leaves you in the future.
YIKES. Any self respecting person would have packed their bags, flown home the next morning, and gotten a divorce.

Listen, I’ve been with my husband for 13 years, married for 9. Im currently pregnant and out on disability and even though I am limited in what I can do around the house due to what’s going on with me medically right now, I do everything I’m capable of each day. Sometimes that’s more, sometimes that’s less. I feel GUILTY on the days I just can’t get out of bed. 

And your new 25 year old wife is…. Playing video games? The standard was that she does things like… plan trips? Are you serious?? Where is your self esteem? You work 60-70 hours/week and she doesn’t work. You should be coming home to a clean house and dinner on the table every day. She is a sleazy user, and the truth came out when she was drunk.

You need a lawyer and you need a therapist for yourself so you can get to the bottom of why you expect so very little from a partner.
I would never forgive anyone for that. I’m so incredibly sorry.
I believe that alcohol is a true serum.
Drunks don’t lie. She’s a despicable human and you deserve so much better!
OP, I’m quite a bit older than you and your wife so I may have experienced a bit more, I believe when someone is as drunk as your wife was that is when their real self is revealed, especially someone who is constantly putting on a face, you’ve seriously got to consider she was telling the truth that night and her actions now are backing that up, she thinks you’re so in love with her that you accept the bare minimum of decent treatment she’s handing you at present,
You are the only one who can decide if you’re willing to accept the way she treats you and if having her in your life is worth putting up with being the one you know she settled for and being married to someone who doesn’t love you or respect you, good luck mate
Drunk words, sober thoughts.
I’m sorry you had to go through this, but there is a silver lining, even though you’re probably not seeing it right now. 

As someone who is in an unhappy marriage with children, I have some perspective. Early on, I had some indications that my wife was not going to be a suitable life partner and I ignored them. We had kids, bought a mortgage, etc. and now I have very few options and they all suck. I wish I had paid more attention to some of the things I realized about my wife before we had kids, because I would have made different choices. You can still do that. You’re young, you’re childless, you can extract yourself from this situation pretty easily. 

To be clear, I do think you need to leave. Your wife has some pretty serious issues, including possible alcohol abuse disorder, that will take years to address and that’s only if she commits. She isn’t showing you that she’s willing to do that. Untreated, these issues will compound and get worse. 

Second, it seems that the way she feels about you (and about ‘the one who got away’) are different than she tells you when she’s sober. That’s not something you can fix with therapy. 

I wish you the best. Have courage. It’s better to find out early.
Oh hun, she patted your head in public and said all of that I'm so sorry. She needs to address her drinking....getting blackout drunk is not normal behavior. I would never be able to get over that. I know you said you were religious, but she clearly has some substance abuse issues and probably some mental health issues. Right now she is using you for a good life. You need to think long and hard if this is something you can deal with. Marriage is not supposed to be like that you are a team and she is not playing her part
 She can be contrite and love bomb you over and over again, but not change. I got married at 19 we are still happily married we get along great and communication is there. He is disabled so I work. We are coming up on  28 years. I love my husband. I love being married and have a partner to help me through this crazy life. It's not a chore to be married. Please think about everything BEFORE you have kids. Good luck you have a lot of thinking to do.
I'm going to go against the grain here and ask if she is on contraception. Hear me out. 

High volumes of alcohol and women don't mix, that's not rocket science to us lol. But, add the contraception pill to that picture and you literally have a nightmare on your hands if she gets sh\*tfaced. I am saying this from experience in my 20's, with myself 'being' that nightmare and I have several friends who have experienced the same behavioral issues and literally abused their partners publicly (like myself) when they've had too much to drink. 

I said the most awful things to my partner at the time, cursed at friends, punched people and made a complete fool of myself several times. I thought I was crazy, but I wasn't. It was the pill. 

It's a blackout and the devil that doesn't even exist comes out. Don't ask me why, don't ask me for written evidence on this, as I can't provide it, but I can tell you based on experience that this is an issue! I wanted to die every time it happened and literally stopped drinking anything heavier than a light cider so it wouldn't happen again.

I did end up speaking to my doctor about it and he was the one that said it was likely the pill causing the behavior with too much alcohol consumption. 

I had no idea that contraception was the problem, but after stopping the pill at 29, it has never happened again - and the same with my girlfriends who stopped the pill and never had another episode. 

One went back on the pill after her first child and then had an absolutely epic episode at the races in front of hundreds of people !!!! She wanted to die. Like, I just can't explain the remorse, it's just so, so awful and so, so black, because the episode is 100% NOT a representation of what that person feels or thinks in reality, or who they are. Some women just simply cannot drink when they take the pill. 

So, if she isn't on the pill, I will swallow my words and refer you back to the other Redditors advice!
I’m so sorry, OP. I’m going to share my reaction, and a personal experience that I think is relevant:

I think you’re making a mistake, trying to work this out. I can’t speak to how she felt about you a year ago or more, but I think that night was the most honest she’s going to be about how she feels now. Maybe she married you because she had enough faith in your goals to bet on your future income; she might have left if you hadn’t become so successful, but it’s easier to bag a high-earner before they have money than after (you yourself have more trust that it wasn’t about money because she agreed to marry you before your success); maybe she was aware that you were willing to be the sole earner, and she didn’t care how much you made so long as she didn’t have to work; maybe she was impatient to be married and you were available; or maybe she genuinely loved you. But alcohol doesn’t make people say things they don’t mean; it makes them say things they don’t *mean to say.* They may voice a more exaggerated version of their truth, but the root of what they’re saying is generally honest unless there’s something significant pushing them to lie. There was no reason for her to say what she said unless it was true.

I think you’re trying to work through this because 1) you don’t want to mourn the loss of the love you thought you had, 2) you’re embarrassed to tell everyone that you’re getting divorced so soon after the marriage, and 3) you’re so sick of bad TikTok videos that you place moral value on being able to work through relationship problems. But this isn’t the sort of thing that you can fix by talking it out. Unless you could be happily married to someone who views you the way you now know she views you, cut your losses before she gets pregnant or your finances get more intertwined.

I married a guy I thought was wonderful. I couldn’t believe how lucky I was. After we got engaged, we started having problems, but I was convinced that being a mature adult meant working through things when they seemed hard. I took on more and more responsibilities on my own, convinced that if I worked hard enough then things could be good; to reduce his stress I started doing all the housework (he was working, I was a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience); I walked our two sixty-pound dogs alone so he could have more free time to play video games; I started therapy, lost weight, and asked less and less of him. After the wedding, things got to a point where I finally talked to him and said I felt like maybe he loved me, but he didn’t seem to be *in love with* me (by this point, he’d take his meals to a different room because he didn’t even want that 30 minutes or so together; one night we went on a dinner date and he didn’t even want to sit with me while I finished my dessert and we waited for the check, so he left me alone while he went home and I finished eating and waited to pay). He assured me that I was wrong, that he was just stressed, so I continued to try to take things off his plate. Then some symptoms that I’d started to have almost a decade prior got worse, and then I got COVID and they became unbearable. I started a process of medical tests, through which he told me I just needed a “more positive attitude” and that I was “steering into” being sick as an excuse to fall behind on housework. He wouldn’t even drive me to the testing that I couldn’t go to alone; I had to ask a friend to go with me. We had started couple’s therapy, and our therapist convinced him to at least go with me to find out the test results (she tried to get him to go for the last test, but the day before he decided he wanted to hang out with someone who had COVID so he’d have to isolate from me instead of going with me). The appointment was the week of our two-year wedding anniversary; I was diagnosed with three chronic (but not life-threatening) conditions that my doctor assured me were very manageable with treatment. Less than 24 hours later, my now-ex husband asked for a divorce. He later admitted that he probably wasn’t in love with me, and that if I still could have kept on top of housework perfectly while going through everything then he probably wouldn’t have asked for the divorce. Ask yourself: do you think your wife would be trying so hard to fix things if you weren’t funding her life? If you lost your income or got sick and needed support, do you think she’d stay? Because trust me, those things can happen when you least expect them, and while going through those huge life stresses is NOT when you want to also deal with a divorce. You can’t fix things if she’s just trying to keep her lifestyle, and the fact that she’s stopping trying so quickly tells me that she’s not emotionally committed to you; she’s just trying to do the bare minimum to keep from losing her meal ticket. I’m so sorry if that’s harsh, but I’d hate for you to waste more time and energy trying to save a loving relationship while your wife just tries to save a financially-advantageous legal contract.
First let me say how very sorry I am you are going through this. My opinion on this ans best advice I can give you is this. First of all being drunk doesn’t change the person and feelings you are and have. She was speaking some truth she felt as hard as that maybe to hear. Second I understand not wanting a divorce for religious or other beliefs, but you can get an annulment. But I would suggest you personally get some therapy and she also. But I would try couples therapy along with it. I feel like if she really didn’t feel that way she would still be doing things and helping more then just a few weeks and stopping.thats just her manipulating you. I have had many ups and downs in my marriage,we had some really hard dark times. But I would NEVER say anything like that to my husband regardless if I were drunk or not. If I had said anything hurtful to my husband which I have in arguments, I would do everything I could possibly do to make it up to him and show him how sorry I was not just saying it changes anything. Actions are a lot more powerful and meaningful than words. I’ve been married for almost 27 years and would NEVER disrespect my partner like that. When you truly love someone you would never say anything like your wife did. She is immature selfish and not very loving. Again the best thing you could do would be couples therapy and separating spaces to work your way back to one another or to an annulment. Good luck I hope nothing but the best for you and for a partner that loves you completely and respects you. I at this point would not be able to live with her until we worked things out. She has not only disrespected you, but broke trust in the relationship and that’s a hard thing to came back from. Trust, love and open communication is key to a happy and healthy relationship.
Updateme!
So sorry you had to go through this. It sounds like she is not thriving and is breaking apart. Either that or she is lazy. Maybe "Happy Housewife"^(tm)  doesn't actually fit her and it makes her break down. It's really important for most of us to have some sort of meaningful purpose in life and it doesn't seem like she has any? 

Also she might be starting to find reasons to not like you because she is financially dependant on you, maybe. I think if you were to do something that might work in the long run, she should get an education and an occupation. 

If you want to work through this, I think you need to get propper help above Reddit paygrade. 

I don't think she can undo what ever went through her head at that moment. I'm unsure if I could recover from that outburst. I'd worry about your self esteem going down with her picking you apart. Where you're at in this moment in time doesn't seem healthy for either of you tbh and I strongly suggest therapy. For both of you. 

Hope you figure it out.
As someone who is in a relationship where I have mental health issues and I have been/will be unemployed for a while until I get a handle on that, I could never, ever do this to my fiancé. He is my support, he is the reason I can work on myself, he is the reason I have the life I have. I will be forever grateful, and my goal is to get a job and help support us as soon as I can. 
I've had anxiety and issues with therapy, but I know I need to stay in counseling and work on myself constantly or things will never get better. I struggle sometimes with household tasks or chores, but being asked to do something by him would never bother me. I'm more than happy to cook, clean, pack his lunches, get the groceries, help him with mental loads, and much more. If I can't for any reason, the least I can do is take care of myself and be a smiling face for him to come home to. 
This is not okay. You have done more than enough by being loving and understanding and hell, even posting asking for advice. I cannot fathom why she thinks it's remotely okay to treat you like that, and clawing at you and refusing to give space after the fact? Nope. Not okay. I can't believe she said this to you and acted like this, let alone on your honeymoon in public!!
On the topic of drinking, when I get drunk, all I can think about is how much I love my fiancé, want to snuggle him, uplift him, etc. Even in our worst of arguments, I have never thought of insulting him or saying something like that to him. All of this to say, being drunk, having mental health issues, and stress are no excuse for this behavior. You deserve better, genuinely.
Marriage is over, stop kidding yourself. She doesn’t respect or truly want you. Divorce and work on yourself
Ok. I will likely be going against the grain here.

First- I would like to say you are enough. You have value. You deserve to be treated with love and respect, especially by your wife.

Second- you need to do some soul searching. Picture your life in 5, 10, 15 years. Is she in it? Picture her walking up to you tomorrow and telling you she’s pregnant (if you plan on having children). Would this be happy? Or the worst news of your life?

Divorce is completely reasonable in this situation. Staying is also a completely ok option. You seem to have good and healthy communication habits (not sure about hers), so I would tend to believe you could make either of these work. You also need to know that the end of someone’s relationship is no one’s business but your own. You would choose who you would decide to tell. To everyone else, « it just wasn’t working » or « it was no longer something that was making me happy ». Those that love you will always support you. Especially in situations like this.

Next, it’s hard to be someone who relies on someone else completely. Not everyone can do it. If she is not one of those people, which it seems she is, she needs to get back into the workforce. Honestly, I think you should be pushing for this anyway. Hire a cleaner to come in once a week. Ask her to pay some of the bills. She needs to develop more ways for self esteem to come through. Clearly it’s pretty low at the moment. 

Lastly- she needs therapy. The good kind. The expensive kind. The kind you go into an office and see someone face to face kind. Better help is a great low cost option for those that can’t afford more. It also unfortunately pays it’s therapists pennies to what they are worth, meaning very few stay on the app for long. To get a good therapist with a vast wealth of experience that will be able to tackle a more complex issue (self esteem can always get to be extremely complex), you need someone outside the app. For me, this would not be a negotiable. She needs to figure herself out, so that you aren’t sitting there waiting years for the ball to drop. 

You could likely use therapy too. This has obviously affected you big time. It has put a large strain your your self worth and self esteem. It will also give you someone to talk to about all this that can get to know more details about the situation and get to know you more than strangers on the internet. Help you ensure there are no other red flags that haven’t been seen, before you have kids and tie yourself to this woman forever.

Good luck.
Hey OP 

I'm sorry the honeymoon went that way. To be honest, maybe confide in your parents, 

This won't leave your mind it never does it might make less noise in your head, but it won't go away. You'll always think of it in your worst moments,

The best thing might be separation. Don't be someone's cash cow. Don't have kids pull a full stop if you're not in love as to be expected after such a bombshell.

Delaying will make it harder and worse for you. You will only have more to lose, I personally don't think being drunk is an excuse for behavior.

While drunk, you lose the thought filter and are more likely to let things slip out and follow through with ideas that you know have a knock-on effect. The question is if drunk and says at a later date I don't love you as much as blank or I settled again cause blank couldn't or didn't want me.

All I'm saying is it could pop out again later. Others might know this person from her friends' side, and they may have lifelong sway over her and lead to cheating, and it doesn't have to be with the person in question, unhappiness can and will affect her and opportunities are all it take to give in, liquid courage will just speed up the process and then it's I was wasted and don't remember, I was taken advantage of or any number of possible excuses to justify what happened.

People cheat, man, and then proceed to dump it on the other partner sometimes out of guilt sometimes because they are gonna be exposed by an outside party. Sometimes, they get caught because they catch something, 

You don't have to wait around to find out what your exact scenario is going to be. She tainted the relationship and exposed cards she had close to the chest and decided to never be truthful after slipping up, don't spend life letting that feeling you got swallow you up and continue to tear you apart slowly.

You've got it growing in you it's not something you can blow off. Treat the problem at the root cause and find actual happiness. Otherwise, the wound grows, and she might just make it bigger and quicker

Stay strong, king, and find happiness. Not everyone gets a chance to correct the course so early and prevent life-long misery. 

Keep your head up.
She sounds like a teenage daughter tbh.
If she’s not working, that’d be it for me. You are providing this thing and she acts like a child? On your honeymoon? Realize you are a doormat man
The question of how much she meant of what she said will *always* be in the back of your mind for the rest of the marriage. I know it’s hard but can you really picture yourself at 60, still married and *still* wondering if she meant what she said? 

I’m really sorry this happened to you, it honestly sounds incredibly traumatic. I hope you seek therapy, maybe you’d be able to sort out your feelings a bit better there without the shame.
I wouldn’t be able to come back from that. Did you ask who she was talking about?
Get a good lawyer and divorce her, she's using you for a good easy life and likely doesn't have the strongest of feelings for you but rather the lifestyle you provide for her. Let her go find the one who got away and let the world slap her upside the head with how badly she messed up brother.
You gotta leave. I usually only save these types of comments for emergencies but I guess now is the time to say it, “you are on a sinking ship, if you do not get off now you will drown with her”. Same goes for women too. If your this far in and your partner does something this egregious do not stay. It will end worse than it started. Praying for you friend. And praying for the girl to get professional help rather than “BetterHelp”
She gave you direct unbridled access to her true feelings about you while she was inebriated. This is all you need to know. And this is all you should use to base a decision by. Don't cloud this moment of clarity.

I am terrible sorry for you and your situation. Not to this extreme, but I dealt with a former gf who let slip something a long time ago, and it was something that always stuck in the back of our mind tainting our relationship until it thankfully eventually ended. I can only imagine how much worse your situation must feel, and I do not honestly believe that you can have fulfilling and lasting relationship with this person because of it.

Please, do right by you for your own health and happiness.
Hopefully the OP will actually return and answer some of the insightful questions put to him.

More likely he just came here to vent, and we'll never hear from him again, or he'll just make his entire post go bye-bye, because that's how these things often go.

We can throw a life ring to a drowning person, but it won't help them if they don't grab hold of it.

I wish the OP well. If he stays there will be many painful days ahead for him.
If she hasn't already, she's gonna cheat brother, run! And don't marry another woman until youre absolutely sure that you're her #1 pick. The rest won't be worth the headache. Don't stay signed up for this punishment. You don't want to be one of those old guys that finally shoots his bitch of a wife and everybody says you're the bad guy. RUN!!
I don't believe that drinking is a truth serum mostly because the people who are that shitfaced usually act like incredible assholes and say really stupid shit. Not saying it isn't true but I'm sure you've been drunk together before and if this is the first time that ever came up I find that suspect. It sounds like you know each other pretty well at this point.

That said, your wife needs to get a job. She's sitting at home playing video games? WTF...no. Lady is 25 years old and she needs to pick her ass up and find a job. I don't care if you're a millionaire. She's never going to have any self-respect if she has to depend on you like you are her father. That isn't your purpose. She is your partner not your child. She's a grown woman and she needs to be able to rely on herself. It doesn't mean she has to earn the same amount as you but it isn't 1950. Women have jobs. Let's say things don't work out between the two of you...well, she hasn't done herself any favors by not working. I actually suspect this is a big part of her problem. She is bored sitting at home all day, she feels inferior and there is a power imbalance. She needs to fix that. It's not like she's at home taking care of babies. She's literally sitting at home doing nothing all day. Her job isn't to make you gourmet dinners and be the housekeeper and my guess is, she's not okay with being that person. I know I wouldn't be.
Honey. She didn’t just ruin your honeymoon. She expressed her truest feelings while drunk. 


I don’t see how you could come back from that. How would you ever know if she was being genuine. 

Sounds like she doesn’t worked and hasn’t in awhile. 

Even if you have to give her some money to be able to move out and get a place of her own and get established, it will be worth it. 

I’m not saying you have to. But to expedite things.  

Rip the bandaid off. Get it over with. Get into therapy. Don’t let one bad woman ruin you. She doesn’t deserve to have your power like that. 

Find someone who truly loves you.
Several things:

1. Some people are mean drunks. They could be saints any other time, give them a drink and they go nuts. They'll say anything, even if it's not true just to hurt you because they are nasty mean drunks. That being said, these thoughts had to come from somewhere. She's probably been thinking a milder version of this for a while. 

2. Stay at home wife is not a maid or cook. If you want a freshly cleaned house and a hot meal daily, hire a maid and a cook. She needs to get a job or you need to both agree on what your expectations are for you to support her financially. Be realistic too- your job ends at 5pm and you get the weekend off. Hers should, too, if you are expecting her to work on the house. That doesn't mean she doesn't have to pick up after herself after 5pm just major chores can wait until working hours. If you can't agree then she should get a job.

I say that not because she should get a free ride with no chores but because some people just aren't cut out to stay at home. I tried for 3 years, my husband would come home throw his clothes wherever, not eat what I made or complain- I felt like crap, I cleaned constantly only for the kids or hubby to ruin it hours later. And if I didn't clean or cook-- it was the weekend for example and I needed a break, I felt like crap because here was hubby working 40 hrs. Eventually I got really depressed and considering leaving my husband but instead I got a job, told him to pick up his own $hit and we've been together 10 years now, much much happier. 

Not everyone is cut out for it and if she's not cooking and cleaning get a maid and tell your wife to get a job.

There are other things in this post however that are genuinely concerning. It's not ok how she embarrassed you, and even though she was drunk what she said was not OK. You both need to go to counseling and she needs to stay away from alcohol and get a job.
Oh my god, my heart hurts for you. You have the kindest heart. I’m so sorry you were treated like that. It sounds like you really want to believe in your marriage so I will offer the following; some people absolutely panic when they get married even if they love the person. It’s probably the biggest life decision you can make and she doesn’t seem like she feels in control or confident about anything she does. Which relates to her work I think. She sounds like she feel utterly powerless over all, she can’t influence her own life, can’t realise her dreams and maybe she jealous that you can. She sounds like she’s in a freeze state and needs help. It’s good you’ve been talking but there are some bigger conversations to be had that I think might be better had in couples counselling. I think she needs to hear a little more from you, not just about how hurt you are but what you want from your life, what you need to feel and that you don’t want that forced from her. You may come from a religious background but ultimately if the marriage is miserable, you may make a decision to leave. Tell her. She needs to know that while she is paralyzed with the burden of life, you are not, you have the strength to make hard choices for the both of you. You want to be in love, you want to feel genuine love from her, you want a partner in life that is happy and sharing the workload with you, carrying it together. She needs a reality check and she needs to be working towards her career (clearly she needs help with that).
Welcome to marriage, Buddy! LOL. But seriously, she sounds like she is not the one for you. I would cut my losses. I have a big heart and forgive a lot in my relationships, but this might be something I find I couldn't put up with... What if she gets dementia? It will be 1000x worse. She can't handle her liquor and belittles you? First mistake was probably letting her plan the honeymoon which I have done before but maybe take a more "take-charge" and masculine role here if you do stick it out. It is a tough call. But I would be out very fast if she was embarrassing me in public and saying she settled. On your honeymoon no less.
I feel for you… we are all on your side and want your happiness.  I want to stress that her drunken statements are no reflection on you.  No doubt you are the prize.  She sounds unhappy at her core, and might not be living authentically, to borrow popular phrase….
I want to encourage you to protect yourself as you walk out your married life with her….
Sometimes even religious people get divorced. People marry for different reasons and not always to join spirits and lives together.  I believe God understands we are subject to the free will actions of our partner…  and that sometimes we make mistakes in our choices.
It sounds like the incident put spotlight on potentially some true feelings in her part.  I think I understand how you feel—when I had proof of my husband’s infidelity it took weeks and maybe months to believe it, if that makes sense.  It also sounds like the perfect time to pray for direction.
Hard words, hard situation. My very best to you
I just saw this post on YouTube and thought I would put my two cents in.  What she did right after, man she love bombed the fuck out of you literally—get it— went back to her ways after you fucked.
Anyway, 1st—
you shouldn’t be doing ANY OF THE F-ING HOUSEWORK
you shouldn’t be doing ANY OF THE F-ING COOKING
You shouldn’t be doing ANY OF THE F-ING SHOPPING
What in the fuckity fucking hell is that.  
I worked all the way up till two weeks before my due date.  After we decided I should stay home and be a SAHM till our daughter went to pre-school.  The difference between me and your wife
-I did all the cooking—all the cleaning—all the laundry, all the shopping and I even mowed the lawn when he didn’t want to and on top of it all, I took care of our child.  I even encouraged my husband to goto the gym, the tanning bed or play golf.  He made the money (his 50%) I did everything else (my 50%)
The only way you should be partaking in any of that stuff is if your wife ALLLSOO worked full time.  
Give her a choice
She Goes to work-and chores are split equally
Or
She does ALL the chores and cooking 

I’m sure I’m not the only person on this thread who has said this already

DRUNK WORDS ARE SOBER THOUGHTS

She love bombed the shot out of you because you are nothing but a meal ticket and I would say there is a 40% chance she is already cheating on you
Secure your money and finances
Hire a PI
Check all her socials and hidden apps for private texting or even a burner phone.  Put up nanny cams that she doesn’t know are there.  These come in all shapes and sizes
You need to get an annulment before time passes too much. Should have been done right after the honeymoon.  You need to grow a spine and a backbone. She is walking all over you and taking advantage.  Leave this sorry excuse for a marriage and grow up. I'm sorry, but you sound pathetic.  You need to look out for yourself too. You are unhappy. You tried. The "marriage" is over. Sounds like she manipulated you into marriage and if you don't annul, you will lose half of your assets. HURRY UP.
There's an old saying about how alcohol tells the truth. Our inhibitions are lower and, in my experience, more truths are spoken than in a sober heart to heart. She told you how she felt (or rather sounds like she told strangers with the knowledge you were listening) so believe her.
People usually tell the truth when drunk.

Your wife seems manipulative. "you owe me to talk right now" and crying and threatening to hurt herself. Then she cancelled the 5 day resort to scare you it was over so that you would 'come back to her.'

This is always a risk when someone pays everything for another. I've seen it with one of my friends. He kept his gf and paid for her to go Australia for a year to study. As soon as she got to the first aeroplane change she texted him saying she hated him and had been using him.

It seems that all those dark thoughts were in her mind during the honeymoon and then surfaced when drunk.
I hope you dump her. You seem to have the misconception that communication solves the problem. That's not always the case, especially when one person, your wife, has contempt for you and no respect. Her "communications" are just lies to placate you.
My psychology professor in college told us that when people are drunk, they’re actually MORE likely to lie than they are when they’re sober. I tried finding a study about this but settled for an article from Buzzfeed, but you get the picture. That wasn’t your wife you were dealing with, and that wasn’t even an indicator of how she felt or what happened. If she does this sort of thing often I’d say look hard at continuing on, but it sounds like she had too much to drink and wasn’t herself. I’m sorry you guys went through this, but if ANY of what she said was true, she wouldn’t have gone to such great lengths to keep you. It sounds like she loves you, got drunk, and said some terrible stuff she didn’t mean. 

https://www.buzzfeed.com/kirstenking/scientific-explanations-for-your-drunkass-behavior
My mother and I got drunk together with my husband and my bestie. My mother is a very nice person. We’ve drank together before and everything was normal. This time my mother turned into a monster, she kept repeating herself, saying terrible things about my dad like he hit her and all that (which I know is not true), we tried to put her to bed and she cussed us out and and kept telling us to shut up. I called my dad to come take her home because I was genuinely concerned something was wrong with her because she’s never acted like that before. She found out I called my dad and told me she hated me (which killed me to hear my own mother say) and then called the police that we were trying to kidnap her.

Long story short she had mistaken on of her major anxiety meds for heartburn medication in her jumbled up pill jar earlier that night and she basically drugged herself. 

OP, I say this because if your wife is not normally like this even while drunk, maybe she was slipped something that made her nonsensical, or maybe she accidentally took something with her drink or maybe one of her current medications had an interaction. 

I’ve always been in the Drunk words are sober thoughts until I saw my mom do this. It was so out of character for her and she was spitting straight lies (which I asked about the next day and she definitely said “I don’t know why I said that, your father has never touched me, and I could never hate you”). She also was so broken up that stuff like that came out of her mouth and to this day she refuses to even drink because she is so broken by what happened. I don’t want to make excuses for your wife if there is a pattern of her putting you down, but this very well could have also been something bigger than just being drunk.
People say and do terrible things when drunk. Sometimes they are real. Sometimes not.

I'd potentially ask that neither of  you drink again. Certainly not heavily.

She absolutely said something very terrible. It may be unrepairable for you. That's understandable, but it may have literally just been a "in the moment what might have been drunken stupid thing".

There's no way for stranger on the internet to know what the next best step is for you. Couples counseling seems appropriate.
I think individual therapy for yourself is the first step. Then couples therapy. Don’t make any big decisions until you are certain.
You should have ended the marriage as soon as the honeymoon was over.
Yeah, I would divorce. Drunk words are the truth. She's freaking out because this will be inconvenient for her if you divorce her. That's the only reason she's trying to be nice. She meant everything she said, don't you forget that!
Not great advice for you now but i really feel like people shouldn't get me married at 25.
Wow - this is a lot. I think it sounds like you had a nice four years but unfortunately found out she’s not exactly who she says she is. And maybe it’s time to move on, chalk it up as a learning experience, and appreciate the fact that you’re still young. Don’t let her try to bring kids into this.
Doormat.

Sorry.

But it’s probably not gonna change.

Might want to keep tighter watch on your finances too.

✌🏻
Okay, I am not a psychiatrist and I'm not qualified in any way to make a diagnosis of anyone. That being said, I have known two people who WERE diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and one diagnosed with BPD With Narcissistic Tendencies. Your wife's behavior is almost textbook narcissistic behavior. 

She told you the truth while she was drunk. She got so drunk that her mask slipped. Continuously thanking you for the lifestyle you provide her is a very important context cue here. That IS why she married you. She DOES have a "one that got away" and she DOES feel she settled for you. She sounded bitter when she said it because she is bitter about it. 

This is the narcissistic abuse cycle, and I hope this information is helpful to you:

Stage 1-  Idealize. This is the part where she love bombs you: she verbally praises you, gets dressed up for you and does all the housework, tells you how great you are and how much she loves you, etc. It feels like she means it because, in that moment, she mostly does. Once everything starts to feel nice and comfortable again, we move onto:

Stage 2- Devalue. This is the part where she starts taking you for granted again. She starts thinking about the fact that she settled for you and all the ways she finds you lacking and/or feels she deserves better. It shows through her behavior. She slows down on the chores, stops making the effort to look nice and cook for you, her bad attitude starts coming back, etc, which brings us to:

Stage 3- Discard. This doesn't always mean breaking up or ghosting, though that's often the result. In your case, this is the part where she just stops doing everything you guys agreed on and withdraws affection and praise. Also in your specific case, it's possible to skip this stage and go straight to the next IF you are confronting her behavior while she's still in stage 2. If that happens, she'll go directly to stage 4, then rinse and repeat. If you don't confront her in stage 2, you get more of what happened on your honeymoon (that's a strong example of stage 3 behavior). Either way, a confrontation at any point will lead to:

Stage 4- Hoovering. This is the part where she begs and pleads and promises. She'll say everything you ever wanted to hear and then some, she'll agree to anything and everything you ask for, and she'll mean it all sooooo much. If you let her suck you back in, the whole cycle resets to Stage 1. She'll be very convincing and sincere and emotional, and I need you to understand that the only thing she's crying for in that moment is herself. She does not want to lose the lifestyle you provide her, full stop. 

I don't think marriage counseling is going to be helpful in this. It will only help her learn how to manipulate you better. If you're inclined, there's a lot of good information out there about narcissistic traits and behavior, and it might be very helpful to you in making a decision.

Good luck, and speaking as someone who divorced a narcissist, I'm so very sorry this has happened to you.

Edit: spelling
Leave and don’t look back no matter how hard it is. You deserve better bro she’s for the streets
Leave her ass

She showed you what she REALLY thinks. She doesn’t want you, most likely she just wants your money. Tossing a fit and trying to hurt herself because you discovered the truth?

She is a horrible woman who doesn’t love you. End it.
Drunk actions are sober thoughts
She's using you, brother. She loves the life you provide her, but she doesn't even seem to like you. This all spilled out during extreme intoxication. She's been in overdrive ever since trying to put the genie back in the bottle, but: a) you can't do that, it's impossible, and b) it's taking more effort and acting than she is willing to give which is why the cracks are starting to appear again. 

Your choice is to stay with your user or run. Good luck either way.
Sad example of a good looking girl ruining a guys life. This is just the beginning of the story...
She literally told you what it was. She loved the life you gave her, and it seems like that’s about it.
Wow, with everything that was said by her and her actions , your better off parting ways asap. The truth serum (alcohol) brought out the true person she really is. It will never get better and you can’t unring that bell, damage was done.
Good luck
Yea if you dont leave be prepared for a lot more disappointment dude.. a lotttt more.
My ex used to get blackout drunk and say the most terrible things to me acting like a mad man and destroying furniture. Then he’d wake up the next day and say he didn’t remember any of it. I had to call the cops on him a few times and it is one of the things that led to our divorce. He ended up going to rehab for alcoholism.
OP, I would do some serious introspection on this. Is this really the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?
This started out kind of fairytale like. But I think you guys have drinking issues on top of everything else. And drunks are mean when they get to a certain point. Sometimes, brutally honest but sometimes it’s exaggerated.

I’m not gonna address whether she thought you were the perfect one because I think she had too much booze and if you guys act like this is sort of your normal. The honeymoon was extreme but clearly she said something like she doesn’t speak up when you drink too much  She just went too far this time so I think you were going to have enormous issues that have nothing to do with being a “type”. I think you’re drinking problems.

For a very long response, I would run from this woman she’s not stable. She’s clearly lying on some level to you or herself or both which drinking people do a lot. I recognize behavior because I’m recovering from alcohol myself since 1990s.

It sounds social and fun, and it always is until one of you can’t restrain themselves. In this case it was her and I’m so sorry. This happened during your honeymoon. Recognize what is going to get worse because she will drink again. It will happen again, somehow or worse. This is potential cheating potential whole bunch of bad things I would let go of her.
When people are drunk or high, it just lowers their inhibitions.  These feelings came from somewhere, and the alcohol just allowed that part of her to slip out.
I really don’t like the love bombing after the episode. This is an abusive. I’m really sorry this has happened to you.
She doesn’t love you, she loves what you do for her. She tried to be her best self again to convince you, but like you said it started to slip because it’s all for show to lure you back in. You deserve SO MUCH better don’t trap yourself for someone who doesn’t value you for you. Sending love I’m sorry this happened
My heart broke so many times while reading this. I don’t think that I could be with someone who told me even when she was hammered and as a “joke” the thing she said to him. I wish OP a lot of luck with deciding what to do
The best advice i can give you is to open up to one of your closest friends or family. Talking with them will help you. 

Communication in a relationship is really important, but so are friends/ family outside of that relationship to talk to aswell
I hope you had a prenup in place. Sounds like she spoke her truth and it'll always be over your marriage. There is no way this will be a fulfilled lasting marriage. Good luck getting out.
That liquid courage is filled half truths and full truths. She can’t even change her actions permanently because it’s so difficult to do things she really does not want to do. You would be a fool to proceed with this sham marriage. Get out before she gets pregnant and/or gives you a disease.
Just steel yourself bc once you open up about what happened, your friends may have more to add. Sometimes they don’t want to hurt you but once the cat is out of the bag, they’ll open up. 
Glad you’re going to therapy. Wishing you the best of luck!
She’s a lifestyle baby and got drunk and spilled the beans that the love for you was conditional versus the love for the easy life. 

I feel for you though; ended up in a trip with a bipolar nutcase who when we went it was great for one day then spent 6days in misery after she got drunk and became belligerent.
I'm sorrt this happened to you. I don't think this situation will get better but I can promise youthst there is someome out there much better suited for you and will appreciate you for who you are
This is devastating. Her evasiveness of the “who is the guy she’s still in love with” topic is concerning. Brushing it off as “oh I was drunk I wasn’t myself” is a terrible excuse. This level of bombshell should easily be a dealbreaker, and it really doesn’t sound like she’s trying that hard to make up for it if she slid right back into old habits after making an effort for a short while. I’m so sorry
Should’ve let her wander the streets and let the rest take care of itself.
Your wife is an angry drunk. My dad is an angry drunk. He has said the most ridiculous and mean shit my whole life and then says he didn’t do it. She can’t drink anymore.
First question is why is she drinking herself into a stupor on your honeymoon? Getting a buzz is for fun... Getting hammered is usually an escape. 

Sounds like she told you what it is she's trying to escape. 

I'm sorry this happened to you
Not to cherry pick one detail of the story, but something that struck me as I was reading about the newfound niceties was my thought of “this behavior of hers won’t last.” I’m sorry that that was the case. People don’t just change - if they change because they get caught, they’re usually only changing because you noticed, and they’ll soon slip back into that behavior and hope you won’t notice. 

I’m also very sorry for everything else that has transpired. The way you’ve written this story and described your love for her and even your care in expressing your feelings is encouraging that you’re a nice, thoughtful person. I don’t have an answer, but I really wish you the best moving forward, whatever that may be.
I’ve been extremely drunk before, and I can tell you everything I said was how I truly felt. My bf had to pull me aside when I was drunk at a party with our friends because I kept hugging him and telling him I love him lol.
If she’s spending time playing video games or streaming, I’d question who is she spending time with online? 

She’s not prioritising home life, if her gaming or streaming take precedence. She may be having an emotional affair. Especially when she’s getting irritated with OP over the smallest thing.

I’m sorry OP. It was very difficult to read, let alone how you felt to be in the middle of it. I’m giving you big virtual hugs to you 🫂 I hope that you look after yourself first.
Aaaand the cycle of abuse has now started for you. Annulment, ASAP
Just get out of it man. I know it sucks and may feel embarrassing but you need to respect yourself enough to not let this kind of person treat you like this. She was on her best behavior because she thought she was going to lose the life you’ve provided. Now she has slowly but surely slipped back to her old ways. 

You’re working your ass off and she can’t even help out around the house? She sounds spoiled. 

Also, these thoughts/words don’t just come out of no where. She expressed how she truly felt whether she knew it or not.
Not too late to annul the marriage OP,  the lady only married you because she gets an easy life with minimal effort. She's already admitted that she's settled for you, the question is how long are you going to let her breadcrumb you with chores, intimacy, and small gestures before she stops again? Her efforts are just to pacify you for X amount of time
I have tried to read through these comments and the one thing I didn't see is someone saying the wife could be suffering from depression. Everything fits. Drinking too much, having no aspirations, down on life and feeling like she "settled", playing videogames all day, lashing out. It doesn't make what she did or said right, but it really sounds like severe depression that she hasn't admitted to or had diagnosed.
People are their ugliest but also truest selves when drunk. She really did ruin the honeymoon. I would annul the marriage. If she's sorry she will spend months or years trying to make it up and that's good. 

But you've now seen a totally different side of her. It is going to mess with you for a while. So unless you really think you can go through it with her around, you should find your space.
Growing Pains, Love is messy sometimes, well most of the time I guess.

Is your life better with her and the baggage or knowledge or without her at all?  That's the question you need to ask yourself.
From a secular point of view; individual counselling could be very helpful to you, no matter what outcome it leads to. I dont recommend couples counselling as she is not being honest with you so she is unlikely to be honest with a counsellor. From a religious point of view; you may very well be entitled to an annulment, as it seems she did not enter the marriage honestly. I’m so sorry you are going through all this
Sir this is a difficult situation within which you find yourself. I would offer a thought or two.

Growing up I had an alcoholic for a stepfather from age 3 until age 13. Due to this we (he, my mom, & I) moved at least every year, and sometimes twice a year. Whether it was to a different part of town, across the state, or to other distant states.

Whenever this happened, it was the result of a standard cycle. The cycle was 1)Drink to excess, 2)Do stupid things, say stupid things, or both, 3)Promise fervently that things would change, he would get better, and HE SWORE HE WOULD NOT DRINK AGAIN, 4)Things would ease up, 5)We would move because OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T DRINK HERE AT THE NEW LOCATION AS HIS FRIENDS WERE GONE AND IT'S A NEW PLACE, and finally 6)Things would settle down even more.

He would be loving, safe, attentive, consistent on his job, not steal our family savings, not take my meagre child level savings, and so on. Twice though during the 10 years he would not even stick to the usual pattern, but would just have taken our car, and left to the other side of the state, or a different state, so we went from 2) right to 5)/6).

Then once settled down more, something would flip a switch, or irritate him, or create too much pressure, or whatever the flavor-of-the-time excuse may be. And off we would go, through the 6-step process.

Whenever he was at home & drunk, he would speak about stuff, which fit what his actions displayed. This truly was the opposite of his promises given via his 'word.' When he was sober, he swore that his drunk words were not true, just drunken mental meanderings. The problem was that his consistent actions fit the drunken verbal musings. As his promises did not last long, whatsoever.

This is all to say, that I believe that your wife was truthful when she was drunk. It is only after sobering up she tried to fix things, but notice that her fixing was not a true turnaround from a genuine epiphany. The dedication to fixing things was insincere at best. And like most addicts - I am not saying she's an addict, just that the patterns are eerily similar - she will promise that she will NOT DO IT AGAIN nor did SHE MEAN IT AT ALL.

I think you are struggling with the wool over your eyes. As you do not want to fully believe that the bad things are true. So you are trying to explain away and excuse the bad things, so you do not have to recognize their true existence, and thereby having to embrace the problems.

As your belief system allows, be brutally honest with your assessment of her, and stop excusing bad conduct, look out for your heart as I do not think she has your best interest in mind.

Best wishes & kind regards.
I’m sorry this happened to you. To be blunt, your relationship as you knew it is gone, you have to realize that. You’re in an awful situation, but you have to do what’s best for you and that is to get a divorce or annulment. You can eventually forgive her, for your sake. But you can’t ever forget what happened on your honeymoon, she showed her true colors.
I asked my therapist assistant to read some of It and give some advice.


I'm sorry to hear about what happened on your honeymoon. It sounds like a very difficult situation, and it's understandable that you feel hurt and confused. Here are a few suggestions on how to handle this situation:

1. Give yourself time and space: Take some time to process your emotions and give yourself space to heal. It's important to allow yourself to feel upset and disappointed, but also try to focus on self-care and engaging in activities that bring you joy.

2. Communicate with your wife: Once you both have had some time to calm down, have an open and honest conversation with your wife about what happened. It's important to express how her behavior affected you and for her to understand the impact of her words on your relationship.

3. Seek couples therapy: Consider seeking the help of a professional couples therapist who can provide guidance and facilitate communication between you and your wife. A therapist can help you both work through any underlying issues and communicate more effectively in the future.

4. Reflect on your relationship: Use this experience as an opportunity to reflect on your relationship. Take into consideration not only this incident, but also the positive aspects and memories you have shared. Assess whether this is an isolated incident or if there are deeper issues that need to be addressed.

5. Reevaluate your expectations: It's important to reaffirm your own self-worth and not let this one incident define your entire relationship. Remember that people make mistakes and that relationships require effort, understanding, and forgiveness. Consider what steps you both can take to rebuild trust and move forward.

Remember, every relationship has its challenges, and it's how you both handle them that will ultimately determine the outcome. Seek support, communicate openly, and be willing to work on the issues to rebuild your relationship.
She may say that the drunk stuff she said “wasn’t her” but alcohol reduces inhibitions, which sometimes lets out things our conscious wants kept hidden. It doesn’t make up stuff. Some part of her feels what she said, even if she doesn’t want to admit it to herself. 

There was no reason for the conversations about “changing herself.”  She shouldn’t have to pretend or act like someone you would want. You should be with someone who is naturally who you want.  The cracks in her “act” are already showing because that’s not her natural self.  

Please don’t get her pregnant, until this is totally settled and you are 100% positive you want to stay with her. Don’t let her trick you into that happening. A child doesn’t need to be in the middle of this, and you don’t need more possible complications. 

Good luck!

Please !UpdateMe about how you’re doing.
Run... Don't walk away from that woman. You got a peak below the surface. Consider yourself lucky you found out so early in the marriage.
You got a glimpse at the real women behind the mask.. she's got you now, and she's married to you, so no more real effort is needed.. things like this will happen more often as the mask she wore to date you slips more and more and then she will try and love bomb you for a few weeks to get out of trouble for what ever she has done that time and then  things will start to slide back again and then there will be another mask slip probablywirse thsn the time before, maybe cheating that time. 
Rinse and repeat over and over as it steadily gets worse and worse.. 

NOW is the time to get out of there before you waste years of your life married to her or God forbid have a child with her, and then she will screw you over in the divorce.. get a good lawyer and find out your options. Hopefully, you can get out of the marriage without her taking too much... 

Things will not get better with her. SHE will only get worse...
I couldn’t read the rest of it my heart hurts
Drunk talk is sober thoughts. 

Deep down you already know that the woman you thought you married was an act.

Now you are seeing the cracks in the facades appear again as she struggles to keep it up.

Ask your friends on your guys trip what they really think of your wife.   Tell them about the honeymoon incident. They may have seen things previously you didn't.
In vino veritas.

Translation: In wine, truth. 

I'm pretty sure she was showing you her truth. You're young. You don't need this for the rest of your days. Whatever you do, don't be making any babies with her.
If divorce is not an option because you’re religious then what was the point if this post? You married someone who doesn’t like you. According to your beliefs there’s nothing g you can do. You can’t make someone like you. You can’t forget what she said. So you’re stuck. Suck it up. Fifty years or so and it’ll all be over.
You don’t need to “work on you”. You’re fine. That ball and chain you’re dragging around however…

Your wife does not deserve you. You deserve someone much, much better. Please do not stay with this terrible alcoholic wreck of a mean woman when you could have someone who loves you wholeheartedly and unconditionally.

Since you want to blame religion for your failure to divorce, remember that she is committing adultery by thinking of and pining for another man while she’s married to you.

She’s lied to you.

She’s a gluttonous drunk.

She covetous. 

She’s unfaithful. 

She’s wrathful in her treatment of you.

She’s slothful, using the money you earn at time and a half to pay for extravagant vacations while she sits on her ass and plays video games. 

She’s lustful of her past lovers.  

She is fixated on another man. That is who she wants.

She’s an adulteress. 

But most of all, she is not at all happy with you and will leave you in a second if someone richer or more handsome pops up.  

And nothing in her actions makes me think this person believes in religion at all. She’s far too prideful for that. 

Please divorce her, clear the air for a while, and date someone mature and responsible who can respect herself enough to not marry you under false pretenses. 

This relationship is not worth saving.
Bro, she totally GASLIT you when she pretended to not remember what she did.

Remember the immortal words of the great philosopher, Doc Holiday:

IN VINO, VERITAS.

She meant every word she said.

You deserve better.

Get out NOW.
!UpdateMe
I call alcohol truth serum for a reason. I was raised by them, and an ex friend was one. Once they get drunk enough, their filter is off. The mask comes off. That night, OP saw the REAL women whom he married. Even though you're religious and don't want a divorce, it seems one is needed. Get an annulment.  The married is still in that stage. She won't change. She'll get worse from this day forward. The one she holds the flame for is the only one she wants. Perhaps he got married or saw she's not a kind person and promptly left. Or she left him not realizing his absence made her realize her love for him or he was rich. Who knows. Count your losses, heal, and get therapy.  Work on yourself and stay single for a while. Learn who you are now.
Post nuptial agreement. Stat.
Seriously?

SERIOUSLY?

After all that and you STILL STAYED?
What the hell is WRONG with you?

When someone shows us who they are, we believe it. WE DO NOT TURN A BLIND EYE!

What the hell is the matter with you that you allowed this and stayed instead of NOT putting yourself through more LIES AND TRAUMA? 

And just what did you expect huh?
She showed you who she truly is and for some BRAIN-DEAD reason you decided to stay.

FOR WHAT?

STOP 👏 BEING 👏 HER 👏 CASH 👏 COW 👏 DOORMAT 👏!
You need.....need someone to tslk to who cares about you. If you are only in your head you wont resolve anything. Family, friend , therapist. You need a sounding board for perspective. 

That said...my experience is that alcohol only brings out an amplified version of yourself. If your angry, or happy, oe sweet or duplicitus...you need to ask yourself, after having seen that, will you ever trust her agsin.
The moment she didn't own anything she said the marriage was over OP, once can never improve or change without admission of fault, the rant might had been a drunk one but it was improvised by any means, it was to focus for that.
Star getting your ducks in a row and planning and exit, this will get worse before it gets better, it has written "pick me girl" all over.
It sounds like you are in love with your idea of who she could be if she really loves you and not  who she actually is now. I wish you the best!
The way I would’ve left her ass there and flew back home
Marriage is hard. Alcohol fueled nights can make them harder. People say dumb shit they think is funny and it spirals into stubbornness when the other person reacts poorly to it. People do weird stuff. Ultimately these communities are the most helpful and wholesome on Reddit but you should seek alternatives. Talk to your parents. I used to think all my parents would advise was “we will pray for you”. But they are actually a lot more helpful than I ever anticipated.  Not sure of your relationship with the parents but you need to talk to someone about it that is a neutral party as well. Better help is a good app. She may have a tough time facing the music and gave up on it. Sounds like she needs something to do, if she’s smart and funny etc.  if she isn’t feeling fulfilled or stimulated, she could be lashing out, resenting you for all you have that she knows she didn’t “earn” or help contribute to. My wife is exactly the same way. And now she has a career. She doesn’t earn even a quarter of what I do but she does well enough and is important in her role at work. And now we help each other with the dishes. I think women who get themselves into a housewife role, ultimately start seeing the fact that traditions have flipped and women can and want to have a career. Maybe she’s jealous and feeling trapped. All I know is that when someone lashes out like that and says all those hurtful things in front of or to you, it comes from deep seated insecurities of their own. You are obviously worthy and well read and deserve everything you have. She knows that and seems like she is not sure how to stack up to you.
Your wife's behavior after the honeymoon reeks of depression. The agitation, lost interest in doing things, etc. If you really want to save this marriage, both couples counseling and individual therapy simultaneously will help. Her doctor should put her on antidepressants. Good luck to you.
Go to therapy together. She needs to get a handle on her drinking, too. In vino veritas and all that... but you deserve peace, if only for yourself. Good luck, dude. I'm cheering for the best possible ending for you!
Im sorry for all ur going through but any drunken rant is based on truth. She wouldnt say those things if they werent at least a little true for you. And people sadly dont change so quickly. Her doing moee chores and being sweeter is more an act to get u back on track in the marriage. But at soon as she feels comfortable and safe in thw marriage again, shell fall back to her old ways. Change onlyhappens if someone is actively wanting and trying to change things. And what ur now wife ks doing is not because she wants to. Its because she doesnt want to lose you.

Now i dont thinkshes after your money, but i do think shes after a secure family. And seeing as uve stayed with her for 4 years and things went fine for all that time. I imagine she thought u 2 would be a good fit forever, but maybe ur not her true love.


Now thats mt perspective to all things. Do with it what u will
 But the way things are going now, i dont see a long and happy future.
Red flags! You need to find someone who loves you for you!
Get out now! She is using you. Have some self respect. Move on.
I would never forgive someone for saying this. What a truly horrible thing for her to say.
I'm sorry but you should always believe people when they show you their true colours. I wish you the best
My oh my. I would’ve went home the next morning and then served her divorce papers asap. This will always hang over your marriage regardless if she improves herself or not. She has proven her intent. Run before kids enter the picture.
sounds like she's young and immature. 

fortunately, almost everyone grows up, eventually. 

marriage takes a lot of training to get good at it. some people were trained long before marriage, and some people don't get that training until they're in it. 

the point of marriage vows is to stick with each other no matter what. this is training for both of you. how much can you love someone who is still learning what love is? this makes you a better person. and helping her through this makes her a better person. love each other as God loves you both
UpDateMe!
That was exactly what your wife thought of you. It is proven by you staying with her and she is going back to her old ways. Your wife is a lazy POS that doesn’t love you.
Bumping to remind for update
Update?
Hope she isn't like my ex was. My ex sounded an did much of what you stated. Basically after a few months she started cheating, with someone I guess that was her type. Of course I divorced her soon as I found out. But man often people say their true feelings when drunk. An how she starts to change an goes right back after some time... Seems like she may care about you but not truly love you. An not sure she even respects you. Hopefully I am wrong... But it's all your choice on what you do. You definitely should do some things, an self care.
RemindMe! 1 Year
Has there been any flags at all leading up to this?  


Does she have frequent 'girls nights'. Nothing inherently wrong with that, but does she have frequent time away from you?
[deleted]
Damm, it usually takes 10-15 years to hate/regret marrying your spouse. You guys got to that right away!
I’m going against the grain here: I don’t think drunk people always tell the truth, because I’ve been drunk and had a meltdown where I told bullshit stories and made a huge, embarrassing scene. Your marriage isn’t over, but you both need to make changes. 

I think your wife is depressed or are last struggling. Betterhelp is known as one of the worst therapy routes available, they treat their therapists so poorly it’s a joke. You need couples counseling and you *both* need therapy—in person and with someone who knows their shit. People doing alright don’t try to hurt themselves when drunk.

Also, she needs to get some kind of activity to do thru the week. Volunteering will make life better, promise (this is coming from someone who has been unemployed for nearly a year—get out of the house). 

The marriage isn’t over, but it is teetering. You have options on how to proceed to then live and love for a long time.
Somewhere in the deep-seated reserves of her (sub)conscious she believes everything she said to you on your honeymoon. To say something so vindictive and hurtful requires a source of conviction. It had to be fueled from somewhere. And while it cannot manifest in quite the same way as it did, it’s still there, surfacing a lot more subtly now. 

You should’ve left after the honeymoon. I know it had to be hard given how remorseful she was, but there’s just no real way to come back from that. Hope you can find the courage to realize your worth and leave her. 

Good luck OP - wishing you the best.
The worst part would be to spend another 20 years pretending things are ok then have her end it. You get one life, don't spend it with someone like that.
if you’re just looking for a woman to love you because you provide her everything, there’s plenty out there that are like that. I’d divorce and move on. She sounds childish & if she can’t hold her alcohol at 25….
Oh men I´m so sorry you  have to go through this. You know the truth, you know she does not love you and she is with you because of what you can give her in terms of finance. Just go, leave because this is not gonna get better.
You can do so much better
Sorry dude but this is over, and I think you need to end it and move on ASAP because it's only going to drag you down from here. This isn't something you can work through - she regrets marrying you. I don't want to say anything hurtful towards her but what she did / who she really is is leaking through in her behavior and there may be some real mental health issues that just some light therapy here and there aren't going to do anything about... Just food for thought. Good luck! Take time for yourself, and go your own way a bit so that you don't harbor resentment and unhealthy feelings towards women when this relationship ends.
You’re in the wrong subreddit.
It was drunk talk. It doesn’t mean anything. There’s no “secret meaning” behind it. 

Sometimes people drink and say the meanest, nastiest stuff they can come up with… it just happens. 

As for all the changes that aren’t happening, you knew who she was when you married her.  Change is hard and it takes time.

Just because you have her in a corner (her drunk disaster) , you’re now acting like king of the relationship. 

It sounds so miserable at your house.
Three things that tell the truth: 
Kids, yoga pants and drunk people

A tiger doesn’t change its stripes. She’s been repressing that outburst til it bubbled over. She tried a bandaid on that bullet hole, and it bled through and she’s back to her old ways and gave up on trying. She didn’t really change and you know that. She did what she needed to reel you back in, you were manipulated. She’s settled for you, she’s only there for the easy life you provide, she’s not in love. Neither of you are happy. You should have trusted your gut had the marriage annulled when you got home.
Get an annulment if you can. It sounds like she married you under fraudulent pretenses. Otherwise get a divorce and move on. This woman tricked you. She manipulated you. Her mask fell off. She tried to put it back on, but she can’t keep it up. You sound like a wonderful person OP. You deserve better.
Drunk actions are sober thoughts.

Have some self respect and leave the one who 'settled' for you.  Because people like that are ALWAYS going to be looking to 'improve' their situations at the first chance they get.

What do you think she'd have done if she were wasted and you weren't there?  Yeah....
When she started screaming at me in public I would have just walked away leaving her drunk a— alone. I don’t care how drunk you are and how much I love you I will not be disrespected
PLEASE CONSIDER. First all, my heart sank reading this. It hurt my heart to read all these things she said in a place that’s supposed to be happy for you guys. You did not deserve any of that and she was way way out of line. It does seem like she loves you and has a lot of insecurities to deal with. No matter what anyone says, people do not magically become their true self when they are inebriated. They may say very bad and hurtful things, but it in no way reflects their true intentions. Just based what I read, maybe her insecurities came out thru some form of aggression. When someone is drunk, their brain is literally not functioning from any type of logic or truth, everything is slurred and information flows to the brain differently than normal. It sounds like it’s just time that y’all need, keep talking and working thru it. It sounds like she is truly repentant of her actions. Even if some of the smaller issues come and go, the big issues doesn’t seem to repeat itself. Saying a prayer brother. Will he looking for updates
Hey how‘s it going? U alright?
For whatever reason, she is absolutely miserable in your relationship.

She's also disintegrating before your very eyes - she's not engaging in any self care and seems to be coming undone at the seams. You seem to have observed that.

Are you asking us if you are morally justified in allowing the situation by being passive and continuing to make your demands that she perfectly support you? Because it seems like your requests are undermining her wellbeing. So I'd say no, if that's your question

It's not working. Step in and get her help, and then work on your marriage problems. If your attitude is tough shit, she hurt me too deeply so I'm going to make my demands until she breaks and it's not my problem (which you seem to have adopted), then you need to leave, and let her get help from someone who will help her stop disintegrating.
UpdateMe
It's absolutely wild to me that you stayed after the honeymoon. Any love I had for my partner would have disappeared. 

I've seen my partner get black out drunk and they just tell me they love me. What she said was 100% the truth and I get you love her and don't want it to be true but it is. 

You give her a way to not work and have everything handed to her and she only actually cares about that. 

Please start putting yourself first and leave her.
She doesn't do anything all day while you're working, so you end up doing all the housework to? then has the audacity to do everything she did on your honeymoon? Feelings are feelings. Love isn't enough. After everything she said & did on that honeymoon, I'd leave her. You would be better off without this abusive mooch
Very long, sounds implausible.
Firstly… I’m very sorry you had to go through this. It’s very rough. 

I will not go on your wife’s defense, BUT - drinking, and especially in large amounts, in certain people, can potentially bring out very strange behavior and emotions. This mean that what she displayed wasn’t necessarily a clear reflection on what was inside her, but (I’m just guessing here) for example a display of complexes inside  her. 

You mentioned you have the successful career, make money, and you seem to be very put together based on how you write. I would not be surprised that her words to these other couples was a way of trying to affirm herself in her own complexes in her very drunken state. It is further assumed based on her behavior afterwards. 

The fact that she is trying to make amends and really make up for her bad behavior counts for something. Her drunken behavior is not sexy, but there might be more complex reasons behind it.

I really hope you can work it out and find each other again based on the good things you seem to have had together.
Most people are saying she doesn't love you and is using you. I have a different take. Your wife needs to stop or severely limit her drinking. I had a drinking problem in the past. Years ago, the morning after a night of heavy drinking, my best friend told me I had blown up at an acquaintance and said all kinds of absolutely nasty, awful things that I would NEVER say. That wasn't the real me. I said those things because of the alcohol, and I was mortified and deeply ashamed. I had NO recollection whatsoever of any of that. If drunk me is capable of becoming a terrible person, that means I can never get that drunk again.

"Sober thoughts become drunk words" or whatever isn't always true. Maybe she really does love you and was just talking nonsense because the "alcohol demon" overtook her for a time.

Maybe I'm wrong of course, but you guys just got married and she clearly loves you if she married you. Marriage is not to be taken lightly and is worth fighting for. At least go to couples' therapy - it's too early to give up. Try to find it in your heart to forgive her, if she's sincerely remorseful. This doesn't diminish how horribly she treated you, and what she did has real consequences, drunk or not. She needs to take responsibility for her words and behavior. But she wasn't in her right mind. If sober her is saying she loves you and wants to repair the relationship, believe her and give her that chance. If it still doesn't work out, at least you can say you tried.
I'm guessing she's a lot better looking but you were trying to convince yourself she likes you for your personality lmao
This whole thing sounds made up.
This is too long and too detailed and very cliche to not be a piece of fiction. I also find it hard to believe that a man who seems to be very well off coming to Reddit to express his relationship woes about his trophy “look pretty, stay at home, cook, clean and manage the vacation itinerary” wife in such an explicitly detailed account.

Also, after a slew of comments, OP has not made one response.
She's depressed and it's only making everything worse. The initial gestures were only an effect of the night and maybe at the time were sincere but it's clearly become a drag down on her. At the minimum, you guys need couple therapy. You got to know what she's thinking and have your truth too.
Man this is a complex situation. 

Me personally I'd divorce just because I wouldn't have trust in the person anymore and wouldn't know if their actions afterwards come from truth or guilt. Id fear for my finances after a divorce from a long marriage. As opposed to getting divorced early on. 

But I'm sure if it's this complex reading it, it must be more nuanced. Hope you make the best decision for you. And if you stay together that you guys live happily and can one day truly put it behind you.
She sounds really unstable.  You might be looking at a mental health situation.  Would she be amenable to counseling?
Are you sure she’s not having a neurological episode? If what she’s saying is true then, yeah I wouldn’t stay. But the sudden DRASTIC switch in behavior sounds eerily like a brain tumor
OP, the reason couples stop talking is because of scenarios that you’re describing. You get hurt, you bring it up, they’re remorseful for a little bit and then go back to their old ways. Over and over and over until you realise talking doesn’t do anything. 

My jaw dropped reading what happened on your honey moon. I would be completely broken and humiliated. It’s sad to see when a good partner gets f*cked over like this. 

It sounds like she’s gotten very comfortable in your relationship now and doesn’t appreciate the amount of pain she caused you. She may also feel you didn’t appreciate her efforts when she was trying however that’s her own fault and she needs to be consistent if she truly means it. 

I’m very sorry this has happened OP and I hope she’s able to realise the pain she’s caused and properly make amends

EDIT - also, ignore everybody saying they would have left. Because no they wouldn’t. They’d be just as confused and shocked as you and wanting answers. You don’t know what you’d do in a situation until you’re in that situation.
It’s easy for people to say “yeah get divorced” but that’s not what the first bit of advice should be. A marriage is a true commitment and the question within every couple is, is it worth a divorce?

What you described at the beginning, how you couldn’t believe you’d found someone so perfect for you etc. that’s how I feel about my husband. I am 100% his type on paper, he’s not really my type on paper but I don’t have a type. Anywho- my husband was my best friend and we fell deeply in love with each other and still are to this day. I cannot imagine ever saying anything negative about my husband, even when drunk. If anything, when I’m drunk I’m even MORE obsessed with him and can’t stop talking about how amazing he is! He owns a couple of companies and like your wife, I organise our life basically, am financially looked after and am a SAHM. I look after our baby, take care of all the housework and cook and clean every single day, breakfast lunch dinner. I’m not trying to show off or make you feel bad- but it’s not normal to act that way and say the things she said, drunk or not, unless she truly felt that way. 

My best advice to begin with would be couples counselling, or maybe speak to her mum since that’s who she confided in? Like you say, communication is key. I totally understand how shit that must have felt for you, I’m sorry you’re going through this. Sometimes people feel a little too content and comfortable and forget how lucky they truly are. She does seem to be very remorseful and regret her actions.
You both need therapy, alone and in couple.

Talk to your friends and family. Some of them at least. Because there will be aftermath. And they won't understand your sudden change of heart if you don't explain it.

The one change she should do is to stop drinking.
Alcoholism
I had a similar situation with my partner. We were on holiday with my best friend and her bf, and he said some downright nasty things to me when he had been drinking one night. I was numb for the rest of the holiday and didn't want to bring it up while we were sharing a small apartment with friends, but as soon as we got home, I told him I didn't know if I loved him anymore and I moved out to my mum's house. 

For us, the issue was his drinking. He has social anxiety and he felt the need to drink in social situations. He then felt resentful/insecure that I am more socially confident than he is and made 'jokes' about me in poor taste. 

After staying with my mum for a couple of weeks, the hurt had faded and I missed my partner. We started dating again, we moved back in together, and we started going to couple's counselling. That was the single most important thing for our relationship. 

Covid then hit and put a stop to any opportunities to drink/socialise, which I think was very good for my partner. I also became disabled by Covid and he stepped up and was an amazing support for me. We actually ended up having a baby soon after which again means we have cut down on drinking. There has been one incident where he slipped up and got embarrassingly drunk, but he was very remorseful and I forgave him. 

All this to say, I know it hurts when your partner betrays you like that. I know how embarrassing it is (I didn't tell many people about our temporary break up). Things can be fixed going forwards, but only if your partner is willing to put the work in (i.e. counselling), identify and avoid the triggers for that situation, show their remorse and step up to be a better partner. Only you and her know whether this is possible, and I would only give it a limited period to find out (I decided to reassess our relationship after 3 months and decide then whether or not to commit to our future). Good luck.
I might be downvoted to karma hell for this, but I want to say my piece: while it absolutely does not remove/excuse the wife's wrong in all of this, I'm getting subtle hints that OP undermines his wife, or at least for this account of the events.
Regardless, please seek therapy OP
Sounds like she was blackout drunk, we’ve all made mistakes surprised by the comments here.
I think the marriage is salvageable but you two need to stop thinking of it transactionally.  It sounds like something from the 50’s. I work for money … she cleans the house.  The bottom line in this relationship she does not respect you or herself. This is making her unhappy. 

You need to work on yourself. Read /r/marriedRedPill. Own your shit and be the man women crave.  Show her you are desirable and she is damn lucky to be married to you. Stop reacting to her childish bullshit. Stop moping. Stop begging for love. Basically stop being needy and pathetic. Do desirable men act that way?

Ignore the “one that got away” bullshit. Stop being hurt and dejected. Your attitude should be I’m high value and if you want someone else there is the door.  In all truthfulness lots of people have a “one that got away”. It is not real. It is a selective memory of a past relationship that ended because it was not as good as they remember. It was over four years ago. She is just remembering the good times when things were simpler. Ignore it. And stop being a whiny bitch about it. It makes you look needy and unattractive. That behavior makes her question if she can do better. 

The bottom line is you need to be fighting for your wife. You do that by working on yourself and making yourself the most desirable person you can be.
Why would she snap at you when drunk? Make her drink again to figure out if she would still say these things and maybe get out the true motive... Sounds toxic. IDC, I wouldn't want to spend my life living a lie if the other person just chose me out of comfort
[deleted]
Damn OP that's rough. I'm so sorry, what a living nightmare of instability
I'm so sorry this happened to you. I don't know that I have any words of advice other than - the way she stopped keeping up the doting wife act represents how big the problem was in her mind. You deserve better. 

She sounds like she has a lot to lose with you. You provide for her while she makes irrational and poor choices at your expense. I don't think she recognizes the gravity of the situation and you deserve your life partner to be someone who empathizes with your hurt enough to get their ass off the couch. 

Consciously uncouple. Find someone who loves you better. This is not how the love of your life treats you
All I can say is that I'm so sorry you are going through this and I think you deserve better. It's so hard, I mean I know people say you are brutally honest when you're drunk, but I know I've lied while drunk before. I can only imagine she said it if she didn't realize that it's how she feels. I wish I could provide words of comfort. But I think the fact that the good stuff has only been temporary definitely shows that it's an act. I think if couples therapy doesn't work, you may need to consider some temporary or permanent separation. You don't deserve to doubt the love your wife gives you.
Holly shit dude…
I will give my honest opinion on this. I do not know you so take it with a grain of salt.

I think your gf likes to be taken care of but hates that you work so many hours.
For whatever reasons you guys decided this, it will hurt you in the long run anyway.  
Do you spend time together?

There’s no such thing as drunken lies but only drunken truth.. so i honestly believe she feels this way..

I understand your commitment and communication p.o.v but please be kind to yourself first. If all of your efforts are in vain, get the courage to leave.
Run. If you don’t want to end it, get couple counseling. You need to talk this through
Absolutely not. Getting a little too drunk and throwing a tantrum is one thing. While bad, it’s forgivable. But what she SAID? Nope, nope, nope. That’s unacceptable.
Fuck that mate - get out
OP, I think you are in a very bad situation and that you need to think long, hard, and quickly about what financial advantages she might derive from getting this "marriage" to continue. Is there a pre-nup? Any 1-year, 5-year, similar clauses? Does your home location have any tenancy, residency, or divorce laws tied to time frames?

Her actions in the hotel strike me as hard-core abusive manipulation to force you not to leave her. She has shown you what your life will very soon be like 24/7. She has a reason for wanting to drag this out, and it could be a pretty specific reason. I honestly think that the sooner you get out of this, the better. She may have an annulment window in mind - is there a post-marriage period in which your home location allows annulment without some of the financial losses of divorce?
Hun, you need to duck out sooner than later.

She embarrassed you on your honeymoon, and said some of the most hurtful things a new bride can say to her husband.

This is 100% on her, you owe her nothing, divorce her before she gets pregnant, and you're tied to her for life. Make her get a job before you divorce her, else you may end up having to pay alimony. 

You deserve so much better.
The speed at which I would have had that marriage annulled.
I’ve had my self-esteem decimated from a relationship.  And I had to fix it.  Whether you stay or not, you need to heal yourself. Your wife cannot heal the damage she did.  It’s not fair, but it’s the truth.
Hard to feel any sympathy or empathy for you.

The universe tried its hardest to warn you. It didn’t help you catch her emotionally or physically cheating (which she must have done at some point), but it tried so hard. On your honeymoon, when you would have had time to file for an annulment, the universe showed you her true colors. The hate, the contempt, the disgust she had for you.

You know what reading your post tells all of us. She only seemed concerned about your money and the “life you provide” for her. She never once spoke about you and her love for you. All she did was focus on the creature comforts you give her.

And with this knowledge, you took no real action. No separation. No real threat of divorce. She cancels the hotel and looses all your money and you do nothing?

Of course she slipped back to her old ways. Why wouldn’t she? You’ve shown you won’t leave. You’ve proved you would rather let her use you as an open wallet then move on.

There’s a reason the old adage was written, a leopard can’t change its spots. When drunk the truth slipped out, but I guess it was too painful for you to accept.

Can you answer one question? Why have you still not contemplated divorce? Why are you cool marrying someone who doesn’t work and doesn’t show love? I’m confused on that part.
Leave before you make the stupid decision to have kids with her or buying a house
So, one got away and she found you who could enable her to be a kept woman. Not her type and she compares you to the other guy in her mind all the time, has no respect for you — but now she’s married to the guy she doesn’t respect or love, secured herself a cushy life but was dumb enough to get drunk and it all came out.

And you, op, was unlucky or lucky enough to witness all of it.

Leave her. Annul the marriage or divorce if need be. She’s no good for you and is a leech. You dodged a really big and hideous bullet by finding out early.

Get out and do not fall for her antics to try and get you to give the marriage another chance. She duped you for four years to get here.

YOU DESERVE BETTER.
She didn't just ruin your honeymoon. She ruined the marriage. You will never get that night out of your head. Your pain will turn into resentment, because you are supporting someone who has already expressed her true feelings using alcohol as a veil. She disrespected you and humiliated you in public. There is no talking through this. It just is what it is, and it's up you to make the right choice for yourself. There are plenty of women who would like a kind soul such as yours. Don't let her poison it.
I was told when I was a young kid that drunk people and angry people always tell the truth... the fact that she expressed so many details about you and even said those things about your "friends" something tells me she was saying the truth how she truly feels about you and the relationship. She can use the whole "blame it on the alcohol" but thats her cop out and if she doesnt remember at all that means that her real self took over her. Who you saw that night is the real her and the one you fell in love with is her mask. All that irritability with you can be that shes bitter by being with you and to be honest I wouldn't doubt that she might even be talking to someone else. She doesn't have much respect for you my brother and doesnt care about putting her part in the marriage. Chances are things are going to get worse and you need to start prepating yourself for it.
I just hope you got a prenup because she ain't letting that alimony go away
I’m sorry friend - she’s not who she says she is. You need to get this one annulled.
Yikes man, alchohol is a truth serum in many ways. You got to see behind the curtain. I might go for an annulment and start over.

Drunk talk doesn't usually include that much detail. It might include a "who are you" or "you know what you're an A..hole" etc. But the whole settled comment and your a joke and patting on head... a little too thought out..sorry man.
I’m sorry. That’s horrible. I think there might be someone better out there for you, someone who will wholeheartedly accept you. You might be able to get an annulment. 

If she has continued doing all the sweet things, it’s a different story. It shows absolute change. But the fact is, she didn’t change.. 

Further, if you’re the one working and she’s a stay at home , and no kids it seems, then why isn’t she doing the housework ? She seems like she’s just with you cuz it’s easy and convenient. She gets to be lazy and be provided for. 

What do you get?
Long term, I think your marriage will be a struggle - married for almost 43 years myself so I know what long term  means
Cut your losses and run she accidentally revealed what she truly thinks of you while drunk those feelings haven't gone away she just attempted to hide them for a bit. the longer you stay with her the more it's going to hurt you in the end.
You should get an annulment. Your wife mislead you about who she is and what her feelings are. She only changed for as long as she feels you should be over it. It’s the abusive cycle of hurting you, love bombing and then slipping back into behaviors before hurting you again. You can’t unhear what she said. That bell can’t be unrung. 

I’m really sorry this is something you’re going through.  You deserve much better than this. It is time to mourn the woman you thought you married and find someone who brings more to the table. At a minimum someone who contributes equally to the relationship and who loves you deeply. Get yourself into therapy too. You were betrayed to your core. That’s a lot to process and having help as you grieve this before you find someone new can help you feel more at peace and not take this trauma into your next relationship.
Just awful… drunk words are sober thoughts and she laid it out on the table for you. I’m so sorry.
Bro, from the bottom of my heart, I feel very sad for you. Life as a man is tough. But as hard as it may be, the truth is she IS using you. And you are better off without her. I leave the decision up to you.
When you talk about your wife, you speak about her in terms of the things she does for you and her appearance, you don’t mention her personality. I do get the impression that she presented herself in a way to catch you, and after the honeymoon she amped that up to keep you since she knows she fucked up. Do you and her have much of a connection?  Because my sense from this post is your relationship with her is the kind that looks great on the outside but doesn’t have much depth. I know you haven’t been able to bring yourself to talk to your friends and family about your concerns but I think you need to do that for your next step. Ask them what they truly think of your wife and your relationship with her. You need someone else’s perspective and it’s hard for us internet strangers to properly give that since we don’t know your wife or her side of things.
What part of you thinks that the best that you can do is someone that behaves this way? I felt absolutely sick reading this. I think you’re committed to a relationship that you shouldn’t be committed to. This is not a healthy place/environment for you, and you cannot take ownership of her.
Get a therapist and a lawyer.
There is no further communication you can do to resolve this.

The "good girl/good boy" act is what I call it when somebody fucked up their source of supply or money, and they do some grand gesture to make you trust them again. It is a deliberately deceptive maneuver they then taper off back to normalcy. The people who implement these acts are used to love bombing to ensnare a person they will instrumentalize, so what they're doing is a deliberate attempt at manipulation.

The truth of this matter is that nobody would utter those words while drunk unless they were true. It's not the kind of thing that wells up randomly into the mind of a person. It also doesn't surprise me that it happened AFTER the legal binding - this is when people with personality disorders are in their comfort zone. They have essentially captured their prey, and are ready to devour it (ie, treat the source of narcissistic supply or resources like absolute dogshit).

The other truth of this matter is that you deserve a life and marriage with someone who would not, did not, and will not say these things about you.

Your vows do not stand with a woman who said her true feelings out to the whole world like a drunken idiot on what's supposed to be a celebration of your future together. She literally just proclaimed to everybody at that venue that her vows were a fucking lie. Nothing she did is acceptable, and you shouldn't be forced to cope with the pain of this. She did not marry you in good faith, and you do not have to subject yourself to this.

I highly recommend contacting an attorney as soon as possible to understand your options and limit any potential financial impact of divorce. You should not be paying alimony on somebody who did this to you.

One last thing which I say not to scare you, but to be as blunt as I can possibly be about the ramifications if you don't permit yourself to see her for what she truly is: if she feels this way about you now, she will cheat on you in the future. If she still has a "one that got away," that means there's a man she would pick over you. If you're not her type, that means when her type shows up, she'll consider her options. She doesn't work and she has ALL the power financially - if she divorces, she can take your money, and have her new shitty man too. Your initial instinct to immediately leave her is valid. That is your true feeling, and her begging and pleading is just going to happen when you try to leave. Her begging, pleading, and assurance means as little as all her other words did - she uses words as tools to get you back into line, not as communication tools.

Please do not leave yourself vulnerable and exposed to a wolf in sheep's clothing. I can tell from the detail-orientation of your post and other elements of it that you are a conscientious, loving, and capable man. You deserve somebody who truly does see you as their type. Any indication otherwise is a slap in the face that you should NEVER have to endure.

Understanding the BPD and NPD cycles in relationships may help you form a better grasp of what will be in your future with her. I can't diagnose her, but I can certainly see that deceit is a core foundation of personality, and she is following a pattern of idealization and discard. There are plenty of subreddits about both of these topics, and perusing some of these may put more into perspective.

One last note on one of the seemingly pettier matters which still represents a large component of her taking advantage of you: with you working 60-70 hours a week and her not working at all, she should be doing the housework and not putting up a fuss when you ask her to do more of it, which I can tell from the post you likely ask in a very reasonable way. It's one thing if it slipped her mind, r she wasn't feeling well or something. But her being combative about it is putting you into a situation where you're not on a team, you're with an antagonist who's angry that she isn't getting it all from you. Not okay.

And you know she's lying about saying her friends like you more than her. You knowing she's still lying to you is enough to know she's not the one. Fuck what anyone thinks about a marriage ending soon - none of those people have to deal with the pain that you're in and the financial turmoil this could cause you. You have to do what's right for you, regardless of what anybody else thinks of it.
Bro you sound like a gem. Sorry this happened.
I would see a lawyer, pro text yourself, make an exit plan. If you think she is vindictive type hide the non replaceable stuff  like  photos and memorabilia.  Maybe freeze your credit etc. if you want for some reason to salvage the relationship she must move out, get a job and couples therapy. 

Also what’s up with people not working when they are young and healthy enough.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. Honestly, they say that contempt is a sure-fire signal that a relationship is doomed, so for it to happen on your  honeymoon of all times is not a good sign. Honestly, I think you need to cut your losses. The trust is gone, and this is not the happy lifelong relationship you had hoped for.
If you stay with this woman then you’re the one who’s “settling “.  She sounds like a gold-digger with multiple personality disorders (ianad, but her behavior screams narcissism and borderline) and who’s a high-functioning alcoholic.  Get out now.
OP if she didn't sign a prenuptial agreement, then get a post nuptial. She's just putting in her time until she can leave and take half.
I think you married the wrong person.  And I think you need to cut your losses and get out.

Drunk words are sober thoughts.  Sorry, but her attempts to make it up to you after 'the incident' are likely the result of her being worried that she's losing her meal ticket.  And now that some time has passed and you're still there, she's back to taking you completely for granted.

You have nothing whatsoever to be embarrassed about, other than being embarrassed for her.  She's a trainwreck.

You can do better than this.  You deserve better than this.
Someone who loves you would not say such things either drunk or in jest. You have seen her real feelings for you, she is obviously in love with the money you provide. Game over dude, move on.
This was your wake up call. Please don't waste your life with this woman. Get everything in order and divorce her, don't listen to her anymore.
Try getting her drunk and “communicate with her” obviously she puts up a good facade when she’s sober
She married U for ur money/ability to provide for her. She settled for U. U know this, no doubt her looks were why U enabled a grown woman to live off U. It's not her U love, it's the fake her that she presented to U to get what she wants. Just like the fake her the morning after the incident...her actions weren't remorse she hurt U,but remorse U knew the truth. She then fake communicated with U till U relaxed & is now living her life for herself doing nothing while U work 60-70hrs a week. U know the truth. Have a good hard look at ur relationship & why U love her.
I don't know if she's a gold digger. I'm speaking from the perspective of a woman who has anxiety and sometimes tells her husband she regrets marrying him (yes I'm an awful person).

She was clearly stressed up to the point of the honeymoon and alcohol can change people. When I am stressed I start thinking about what is making me stressed and how I can get rid of it. Marriage is stressful. Sometimes this translates into temporarily loathing your partner. For me, it's 90% projection. I'm usually mad at myself over something and project it onto my husband.

For her, maybe she felt inadequate in the relationship and projected onto you, blaming you for the imbalance.

Honestly, if it doesn't happen again I think you can work through it. But if it does (drunk or not) she is definitely harboring some problem. Therapy might help. Might not.

Good luck.
.
I’m sorry sweetie but it sounds as though she’s using you. Folks tell the truth when they are drunk and it sounds as tho that’s what she did. Obviously she was mortified the next day because she showed you who she really is. 

Unfortunately she sounds like a typical gold digger, she’s bone idle, she doesn’t work, you’re expected to keep her in the style she wants to live. She must have been horrified at the thought of losing it all which is why she started bettering herself. It didn’t last long did it? Her behaviour towards you will get worse and worse as you’re already seeing. 

This woman doesn’t love or respect you as you deserve and you know you need to draw a line under the whole relationship before you lose all your self respect. 

I hope you had her sign a prenup. 

Good luck
You HAVE to have someone who knows you IRL and is aware of what is going on. You can’t do this alone. Honestly I think a therapist is the best bet for you and if you decide to keep working on this marriage, couples therapy if she will go. It probably is about her and her own insecurities but that doesn’t make it okay. My husband is convinced that I am the smarter, cooler, funnier person in our relationship (I think we’re pretty evenly matched overall) but he doesn’t let that insecurity affect how he treats me. He’s proud that I’m smart and funny.
Bro, she's using you.  Who you thought she was is not real.  Smash one last time and move on.
If you choose to stay with such a selfish and toxic person then you are choosing the suffering that goes along with it.


She is unwilling and unable to make the changes necessary to make this a healthy relationship for you long term. 

This is who she is fundamentally. The good part was all an act. Best foot forward dishonesty. 

Surly, you can see that now.
You already know what to do. You are just putting off the inevitable. You married her for love. She married you so that she had a financial daddy and someone with whom she could feel superior. The drunkenness brought out the bald, unfiltered, really ugly truth. She was brutal. In that moment, you saw that who you thought she was, was a terrible lie. I'm so sorry.   


I hope you get to what you need to do without further damage. Please go and talk to a lawyer.
I would start by protecting your finances. I would close joint accounts or withdraw any money she can potentially squeeze out of you before she leaves if you are thinking of leaving
Sadly, I think this is a case of in vino veritas.  Sorry, dude.
How do you even come back from that? I was once told that a relationship is like a china plate, if you drop it, it breaks. You can glue it back together but that crack is always there and everytime you run your fingers over it, you remember how it broke. Sorry mate, but your marriage is done
I'll lean the opposite way from most of the comments. Sounds to me like she had kind of a break down. Maybe not a clinical break down and yes, alcohol certainly fueled it, but she essentially list her shit and fell apart. IMO your spouse doesn't need to make up fir this for the next weeks months years. She needs support. Marriage has ugly parts. This is why the vow for better or worse is built in. If this were a pattern of behavior, that's a different story.
Man this is rough. You seem like a level headed dude and I empathized with how you’re feeling while reading this. She’s definitely tugging on your heart strings while doing this back and forth thing. 

I’ve always felt that there’s truth to the saying, “a drunk mind speaks a sober heart”. Who knows what she actually thinks at this point. She could have meant it, she could not have. I don’t think you’re going to find out for sure any time soon because if she did mean it, she’s not going to tell you. But the fact that there was mention of “the one that got away” makes me think there’s some truth to it. 

Also while reading this, and to the point some other folks are mentioning, it seems like she using you. She’s completely reliant on you. Her attempts at making it up to you and then going back to her normal ways makes it seem like she’s only doing those things to appease you in the moment, not to actually show you that she cares. Once she thinks you’re satisfied, she’s goes back to normal.

Regardless, personally I don’t think I could carry on in a marriage like that. I need to be confident about how my partner feels about me - I think everyone deserves that, and I don’t think being told that was “settled for” would be something I could ever shake off.
This is certainly not an ideal situation for you, OP, and I can't imagine the damage her words caused you. No one should have to put up with or deal with that😪  You've said that she has told her mother but the only person you have to confide in is her, the one who brought about this mess in the first place, and that isn't healthy! 
You may need to open up to a family member or close friend, it might help. It should be someone who knows about your relationship and has seen you two together. It's easy for us strangers on Reddit to say leave her, she's not in love with you, but we have no way of knowing for sure. 

It seems from what you wrote that your wife did want to make it up to you but she may be getting burnt out. I'm not saying she is in the right but she's used to doing the bare minimum, so she might feel as if she has done enough to make up for her actions. 

Could you two try counseling together? 

To move forward you'll need to forgive her. Do you think it's a possibility that she knows you haven't forgiven her? Maybe she feels she's out of options so she's reverting to her older self. If you can't seem to find it in your heart to forgive her, which I can honestly understand, then you may want to think about reevaluating the relationship and if it's worth staying in an irreconcilable marriage.
A slightly different take here— could there be some other mental illness going on? 

I was in a relationship with someone, going perfectly well, who suddenly raged and broke up with me and said all these spiteful things seemingly out of nowhere. I was shocked. He came down from it a couple days later, apologized and expressed deep guilt and remorse, and sought out a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar. 

Alcohol is a notorious, well documented trigger for bipolar episodes. Along with sleep deprivation, stress, stimulants, and any kind of disruption to a routine. 

If you check out the /r/BipolarSOs subreddit (support group for people in relationships with bipolar partners), people experience frequent breakups, emotional “flipping of the switch”— like “she’s so sweet for 99% of the time but then sometimes i feel like i don’t know her.” Super super common— in mania people may experience feelings of grandiosity  in the form of thinking people around you are “holding you back”. It follows an eerily similar pattern to what you’re describing. The memory loss too— people not having proper recall of what they said or did during manic episodes, because it came out of an emotional fog and not a truly rational place. 

Of course hearing these things are detrimental to a relationship regardless of a BP diagnosis. But ruling that out could create possibilities to move forward. If you feel you two have genuinely had a stable, genuine connection for 4 years all the way up to this point, and it suddenly inexplicably changed, it makes me wonder if there’s something else going on.
Listen man I've been there in a similar situation, where my long term girlfriend acted like a complete ass on vacation. She got drunk as fuck, fought with me, blacked out, started flirting with guys and just completely ruining our vacation. 

This was one of multiple occasions where she had a drinking problem. I stayed longer after this incident but not much. I could not put myself into a position where I have to clean up her messes anymore.

I look back on how she was towards me and wonder why I stayed for so long, trying to fix someone who was clearly broken.

If this truly was a one time thing and not a pattern of terrible behavior for herself and you, then you can chalk it up to a drunken, fear based reaction to getting married. Maybe she was just acting out after a very momentous occasion in her life. You can tell yourself all these things but it sounds like she's not someone you should consider an actual life partner long term. She's got some demons that will continue to be a part of your life unless she changes, but that's unlikely for most people.
I’d say get an annulment but looks like you’re past that. She’s using you dude
I had a major major red flag thrown at me by me ex wife on our Honeymoon. She admitted to having a crush on her manager at work and then kind of played it off. She admitted that she thought "marrying me would help fix ." She went on to have an affair with a different coworker and then kept it secret for years only to confess at our lowest point. Save yourself a LOT of time and heartache because YOU DESERVE SO MUCH BETTER and get the heck out NOW.
I would be getting a divorce. You aren't in love with her and by her actions, she's definitely not in love with you.
This is heart-breaking.

Suggest you take some time out to truly work out how you feel  (say, sleep in a different room) and see how things are in a week or a month, maybe?  I would never suggest leaving her (in true Reddit fashion!) as life is so much more complex than that, but you will learn a lot about yourself if you get some time to reflect.

Also how your wife is in this time will tell you a lot.  Nothing wrong with you doing different things in a relationship, but if one of you is in it for what they get rather than *who* they get, then it's imbalanced.  You might find out that this is not how she is, but it sounds like a possibility.  You're supposed to be a team but sounds like you're really not equally there for each other.

I'm sorry you were hurt in this way.

Best of luck, Reddit friend.
Personally, I would leave. You’re so young. I understand you love her but there are people out there who will treat you soooo much better than this. And as they say, drunk words are sober thoughts. I feel like she’s just trying to backtrack now so she doesn’t lose her cushy life. I’m really sorry that happened.
I’m sorry man. She’s with you for your money and the fact that she doesn’t have to work. Those things would’ve never come outta her mouth if they weren’t already sitting there in her mind already. If I heard my husband ever talk about me that way, he’s be served divorce papers so fast. Please don’t put up with that. You deserve better. I’m so sorry you were duped and wasted time on her, but at least you know now and not 10 years from now. Good luck, OP.
I know with how I am, I could not stay in that marriage. She basically told you the truth while her guards were down from alcohol. You are strong.
Divorce and move on. Youre young, and you’ll find someone that appreciates the help out of you.
Being drunk doesn’t change who you are, alcohol doesn’t inject new thoughts into your brain. All being drunk does is lower your inhibitions. It seems to me that the truth came out and she’s been trying to convince you otherwise ever since.
You sound like a decent guy and you deserve better. Leave this crazy girl
People get drunk and talk worst things ever and then blame it on alcohol. I've been drunk so many times in my life, yet I never say things I know are stupid and f-ed up. It does give me courage in some situations but you still mean everything you say.  


She' using you.
You have a concubine not a wife, not a partner in life. Govern yourself accordingly, but if you stick around, don't complain, you continued to be with this person when you knew better. 

And I would start watching your money was I you.
Despite getting married at 23 and going on 38 yrs, I'm no expert, but have learned a lot.

Sounds like the following are the key issues: you work your ass off and your wife does nothing, literally nothing, to contribute to a successful relationship.

+ She needs therapy
+ She has a drinking problem
+ She has low self esteem
+ She needs to communicate 
+ She needs a job (maybe not a paying one, but at least donating parts of 3-5 days a week at a non-profit.
+ She needs to show you respect
+ She needs a major dose of humility

If she's not willing to completely overhaul herself, your marriage may have sadly run it's course. 

I wish you well.
RemindMe! 3 Months
In vino veritas OP. It seems like the mask slipped off momentarily. I know that reddit users love to scream DIVORCE!!! ...  But divorce her OP, you deserve better.
Sounds like you’re her caretaker not her husband. You need to get the hell out of that marriage.
I’m so sorry this happened to you. I know you’ve probably heard the phrase, “a drunk man’s words are a sober man’s thoughts”. What she said on ya’lls honeymoon was true for her. and of course she would do some heavy damage control after hearing about her behavior, who wouldn’t with the person they claim to love let alone be in a marriage with. She sounded contrite and willing to change at first but in the end it all seems very performative. Only doing it to try to win you over when it’s not genuine. If it was truly genuine, it would’ve been consistent.

You deserve someone who WHOLEHEARTEDLY desires you to the fullest degree. Unfortunately, she clearly doesn’t. 

Picture your dream person. THAT is the person you deserve and she is clearly not that person

Look at it as some sort of blessing from the universe that you caught all of this on your honeymoon! Thank god it was this early and you didn’t find out her true feelings years into your marriage. It still very much sucks though and I wish you all the very best.
You must find someone to talk to. I hope it can be your parents or close friend but regardless, you probably should talk to a therapist. It can help you unpack this. This is a truly horrible story and you don't deserve it.

 Go talk to an attorney, even if you are not sure, get a consultation on options (annulment, settlement and divorce etc). You must do something. You can't go on like this.




.jbbv.
I'm in a WLW relationship so idk if it makes any difference, but I wanted to be transparent. My partner and I have been together for 8 years now.
Let me start by saying im a hopeless romantic, i loveee love. I'm the type to think we can work almost anything out. Now, in these 8 years we've both done and said things we regret, however, no matter how bad things have gotten between us, never has she said she "settled" for me. That I was an embarrassment. I'm extremely insecure & would totally believe it if she told me, but at the end of the day she hasn't made me feel like I was a 2nd choice. If she (or I) ever put us through something like that, it would be over. Being drunk is no excuse, these thoughts are coming from somewhere. Also, to completely disregard how much the entire trip was that she canceled just because things arent going her way, without consulting you shows another side of her. Lastly, her already going back on her word about being helpful around the house is just the cherry on top. 
Love yourself, so many people would love a life you can provide, she's not grateful & she's not it.
Marriage counseling might help, but honestly, Op I think it's over. Sorry you're experiencing this.
My grandma’s husband changed with her the second they got back from their honeymoon. She says she doesn’t know how stupid she was to stay that long, but is glad it happened because she has my aunt and my dad.

Sometimes, it’s better to leave asap than let it progress to something terrible. However, like someone else said, it sounds like she is using you. It also seems like she’s telling you what you want to hear.
Unfortunately the things she is (was) doing to make this up to you don't correlate to the thing that she did in the first place.

If your marriage was going to fall apart because she didn't pull her weight and never paid you any attention then her initial plan might work (if she could sustain it)... but saying she doesn't respect or love you can't be made up for by 'acts of service' - fundamentally she has broken your trust.

:-(
I would be done.  I see a lot of [fawning](https://www.charliehealth.com/post/is-fawning-a-trauma-response-what-you-need-to-know#:~:text=Commonly%20seen%20in%20trauma%20survivors,outcomes%20in%20the%20long%20term) in your post.  

You’ll survive this and find someone who really loves you.  I’m sorry you’re going through it.
Your wife sounds immature and spoiled… I’d definitely think hard about divorcing her! You’ll forgive her for disrespecting you and she’ll do it again! Cut ties now and you’ll have nothing to lose.
Good luck
This just makes me lose trust over the concept of marriage. You could have never ever thought that the person you love the most think so differently of you. I just cant digest it. You are truly better off without her
Did you all live together before marriage?
First, let me take a sec to acknowledge what you know - this is horrible, not what you signed up for in believing you had a loving, trusting relationship at all, and plain not fair. I know it's silly sometimes to look for fairness, but it sounds like you're downplaying for yourself how unfair this is to you.

Next, I agree with the other commentors who have said that it doesn't sound like she actually cares much for you unfortunately, friend; perhaps it's the idea of being married, of being financially supported, or a thousand other things, but that again doesn't sound like what you signed up for. My suggestion for you would be therapy or other self-evaluation, even one half of a couple's marriage book to really evaluate what you want out of a relationship and a life with someone, then compare it honestly to what you're living today.

Finally, it strikes me a horrible idea that she is your main confidant on this one - she can talk to her mother all day, but that doesn't necessarily give you any form of objective or supportive or plain-in-your-corner input. Since you took the time and energy (and likely emotionally wrung yourself out a little) in writing all this out, can you go to your closest friend or relative, ideally in person, and let them read this as a conversation starter? I know it's embarassing, but honestly, there's no shame in being tricked, which is what it sounds like here - there's shame in lying, there's shame in *tricking*, there's shame in taking a vow and going back on your word. And at this point, stranger, sounds like you need all the folks in your corner you can get (plus this lovely collective of internet strangers and comments). 

Good luck, OP, and maybe keep an eye on the duration of this marriage - IANAL by any stretch, I know certain jurisdictions have annulment or no fault divorce, and not to say that that is your immediate next step, but don't let time close doors for you that someone else may be watching too.
her drunk thoughts don’t come from no where. maybe she doesn’t realize it herself but it’s definitely in her subconscious. putting in effort only to win you back and taking it all away is a manipulation. her not respecting your need for space.  you can forgive her of course but that doesn’t mean you need to stay with her. you’ll still love her and appreciate the memories you’ve made but it’s changed too much to go back to the way things were.
I can’t even imagine. For me, I try not to be such a sensitive person, but there would be nooo coming back from this. For fuck sake. “The one who got away. I had to settle for HIM” ooff. I know it’s absolutely unbearable, but you should think about maybe accepting that this may be how she truly feels. Which tells you what? She’s using you. For convenience, for money, for the life you’re able to provide for her. She’s doing a “fake it till you make it” as vile as it is. I’m so sorry. I wouldn’t be able to stay with someone after finding out that this is how they truly felt about me. I hope you really think about this. There’s other women out there that will love every single part of you.
sorry, my dude, but she let some inner poop out and she will keep tracking it across the carpet in your mind. let her find someone else to "settle for" and leech off of.
*op, you owed her nothing *

I realize this was your life so I won't say "just leave her!" but she might just be kissing ass for the money, you deserve better than that

I would say if she doesn't continue with therapy-which is telling on MULTIPLE levels, there is no hoe here and u can't continue making yourself suffer because it will not get better 

I think u fell for a narcissist. I'm sorry
!Updateme
UpdateMe!
In response to your update, can I just say that, the best way to create better communication, in my experience, IS adding therapy to the mix.  Several decades of marriage under my belt and it’s gotten us through some seemingly unsurpassable moments.
I have done something similar to your wife. Me and my fiancé were at a wedding and I got drunk and when I got home I just flipped, I said horrible stuff that I didn’t mean but I did know why - it was because I am insecure and believe I’m worthless which I’ve been in therapy for and was pushing him away because I didn’t feel I deserved it. We had to work through it and we have through good communication like you two. But I don’t know if her subconscious came out that night when she was drunk and she said all that stuff, like how she tried to get away.
With the nice things she’s doing that have started to slip, if she is struggling deep down with a sense of worth or something else she may be mentally exhausted. Maybe it’s time you both had another little mini break? We’ve scheduled in actual dates. Which probably sounds obvious but we stopped going on any since we moved in together, and realised that actually it’s something else we needed. 
Hope everything goes well for you two x
You sure put a lot of effort into this obviously fake question
Oh wow, this is tough. I had a somewhat similar situation happen a few years ago where one of my “best friends” got drunk and verbally assaulted, threatened and shoved me. I refused sex and he then threw insult after insult at me, told me no one liked me and he hoped I’d die alone, etc. I actually forgave him. Over time though, I realised that who he was drunk wasn’t that different to who he truly was sober. He continued to be an awful friend and person even after the initial niceties and apologies. Needless to say, he’s not in my life anymore.

Marriage is a completely different ballgame, one which I have no personal experience in, but honestly, I don’t think you will ever 100% be able to fully get over this. I think couples counselling could be an idea, if you think this is something you can work through and not hold resentment for in the future, otherwise it might be time to reconsider whether the relationship/marriage is right for you. All the best ❤️
INFO: is her getting blackout drunk a regular thing?  It doesn’t in any way excuse her behavior, but as an alcoholic woman who is now sober, I’ve behaved in this way while under the influence and I truly did not remember any of it.  However, if this is even a semi-regular occurrence I would suggest she maybe seek help for substance abuse.  This of course by no means requires you to stay in this relationship; you have to look out for yourself, but it may be something to consider.
I’m so sorry this happened. It definitely monumentally sucks. But i don’t think she means it. I think she is deeply insecure and unhappy with herself. That’s just my take though. Good luck to y’all moving forward. I hope nothing but the best happens for y’all moving forward ❤️🕊️
I’m absolutely shocked that she gave up on fixing herself only a few weeks after you got back. Shocked I say!

It sounds like she just enjoys the easy lifestyle of getting to stay at home all day, play video games and watch streams without needing to work. I know in your edit you said you’re trying to figure out a way to get her back into working, but I’d be willing to bet a lot of money that’s not going to work out.

I’m not sure if something like this exists, but see if you can get some kind of prenup that protects yourself from this moment forward (even better if it can go backwards but I doubt that’s a thing), and watch her reaction. If she truly loves you, wants to make things work, is going to change, etc. then it should be no big deal because she wants to stay together anyways. If she panics then it’s clear where her priorities are
Couples therapy or leave!
> I'm ashamed to say this, but in that moment, I imagined leaving her as soon as I got back home

The only thing to be ashamed of there is not following through with that impulse and ending it.
I’m so sad. I hated it when my ex would get drunk and say terrible things. He’d wake up and forget about it. When I told him, he’d gaslight me telling me that it’s all in my head, or I’m overdramatizing it. Then he repeated them the next time he was drunk. 

Sometimes things say when drunk are their true, unfiltered feelings.
Move on…having to work at it happens before marriage, not after. She's using you. Get out before you have kids. Pack up or pack her up if it's your house. She devastated you, yet you stayed in the relationship? Have some self respect…file the papers and end things…her comment that she settled is true. Don't you think you deserve more than that? Out there is someone who will think you are special. She doesn’t,  she settled and had no problem telling you. Alcohol reduces inhibitions…..she was speaking her truth….move out, you deserve someone who thinks you are great. She doesn't deserve you or a second chance.
Jesus Christ, what an awful experience for you. 
I don’t think I’d ever be able to forgive and move on from something like that
*Annulment.*

Drunk words sober thoughts.

This is straight up abusive behavior and tje next step is physical violence. Particularly the inability to respect when you set boundaries amd the Love-Bombing Tactics afterwards. 

Run. Don't walk.
Doubt know if you will see this but so many on Reddit always scream divorce, but I don't see that being an option here. I think she has some mental health issues. Maybe even bipolar. If she can get help for whatever is going on, it may fix things. Granted if it is something like bipolar, its not easy to live with someone who has it. It's up to you on how strong you are and if you are willing to deal with the ups and down of such things.   


Do I think she loves you? Yes. Do I think she settled? Maybe. I love my wife but there is someone in the past I kinda think I would have worked well with. That doesn't mean I want to be with said person or anything. Just stating there was someone else who things would have also worked with had paths gone differently.   


Did I settle for my wife? Not really. We are VERY much the opposite of each other. But in the end our love is why we work together. We both had been with terrible people before hand. I think maybe your wife also just has some regret about her past and needs help to get over them. People do tend to dream of wanting some perfect life, perfect marriage....etc. You know the saying about the grass being greener on the other side... until you visit that side.   


This all said I can totally understand your hurt about the honeymoon. That is awful. Even if she truly did not meant it, it ruins your only honeymoon memories. My mother went with me overseas when I married my wife. She wanted to be at the wedding. But she semi ruined the honeymoon by calling me while drunk and talking crap about my wife. Which then made my wife kinda not cheery. Obviously lol.   


I hope things with your wife work out, whatever is going on needs therapy for sure. And if you still feel hurt by what happened or the random outbursts in mood, I'd probably get some help too. More so if you find out it is mentally related as you may need help to deal with it. Best of luck to you and your wife.
I’m telling you rn I would’ve turned into a Netflix doc
RemindMe! Two weeks
You need counseling,  plain and simple.
Man. Imagine being one of the other couples that had to hear that happen in person.

It does sound like OP is being used, and he was fortunate enough to find out early on.
I totally agree. She’s not in love with him, she’s in love with the lifestyle he provides, she’s just not happy about it so she does the bare minimum. The question is, “How long will OP put up with the bare minimum”?
He can see the writing on the wall, he just needs to bite the bullet and leave her. He deserves so much better than her.
see, i would’ve understood it to be a drunken incident if she truly changed after the incident but she changed only for a little and then he started noticing her behavior become distasteful and not the woman he initially married. the fact that she was not consistent proved that she was just “changing” for performative reasons and damage control.
OP- do you have a relationship with any of her friends that you could ask them about it? If she was truly unhappy she likely told someone.
She’s a gold digger. OP can you see yourself putting yourself through this for another year? Married to someone who tolerates you so she can live an easy lifestyle?
And she’s gonna cheat. If she’s not already. She settled for the ‘easy life’ but she’s gonna want her cake and to eat it too.
I’m really sorry OP but this is the truth. I feel so bad.

You seem like a really good guy.  To me, there’s no better quality in a guy as a good sense of humor.  

This was a learning experience.  You WILL find someone who loves you for you. 

PS.  You are NOT a loser.  Far from it.
Although it sucks OP should use this as a bit of a learning experience. There’s no reason that she shouldn’t have been working if they didn’t have children. Even part time, something. It’ll attract the wrong types unfortunately.
She’s clearly a gold digger and she panicked that she would lose her easy life. If she loved OP she would have NEVER said any of that, even when hammered. OP, why doesn’t she have a job? She needs to get off her lazy ass.  I think this relationship is beyond saving tbh. She sounds exhausting and obnoxious.
Agreed. She’s not in love with him. 

Dressing up, wearing makeup and doing the laundry has nothing to do with her admitting she settled for him. It’s a weird way to “fix” the issue. She’s offering appearances again rather than substance.
Drunk words=sober thoughts. Especially when she just went on and on and on
You know what I keep thinking about; she’s been faking being in love with OP for four years!  What kind of a person could do that?!
Not a tough one. Settling is incredibly insensitive thing to say. Having a 'one that got away' heavily implies not being over someone else. I'd be seeking annulment.
She got drunk and let her mask slip off.  She was then terrified she messed up her meal ticket.  I know this saying is on here all the time but..."When someone shows you who they really are...Believe them!"

edit: spelling.
My heart hurts for OP :( if my husband has said half of the things she said, I would never be able to get past it. I hope they figure it out and OP gets the life he deserves. I'm glad he's going out with friends and hopefully opening up to them helps him.
Saying it's a drunken incident is just an excuse for her, let's be honest we all know that people say what they really feel when they are drunk for better or worse. Definitely a tough one though.
She settled lmaooo that’s obvious from the get go homie
The drunk confession is definitely the biggest concern here, but I'd also be concern with the level of drinking the wife engaged in. The OP clearly knows the signs of partner being uncontrollably drunk, which is a good indication that it happens too often. 

Also, refusing to give him space the next day isn't OK, and borders on abusive. All I can say in this situation is for OP to protect himself from a toxic relationship. For now, that means distance. Later, it's either going to need a lot of counseling or divorce, and if they go with the former, be prepared that it just might not work
Her behavior is more thsn that. Here she's showcasing a grab bag of classic abuse tactics including not respecting when he sets boundaries and Love-Bombing tactics after the abusive outburst. Her behavior afterwards being motivated mostly by fear and shame of abandonment in the moment and not by remorse or concern for his feelings. She just needs a little bit of liquid courage to actually go all the way with it.
As a fellow former party girl that used to black out on the reg, this isn’t everyone’s experience.  When I used to black out I would be told that I said things that came out of nowhere and wasn’t actually what I believed or felt at all.  

To me it wouldn’t be so much of an issue if things truly changed after they got back home, but that was clearly short lived.  Her not having a job plus no kids means that she should be taking care of all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc…. Yeah seems like she’s here for the easy life.  Him working 60 hours a week and then going to cook dinner while she’s gaming? No….
People rarely seem to understand that being drunk doesn’t mean you actually say shit as if you were a different person. It’s such a toxic attitude to avoid any and all accountability for what someone does when drunk. OP’s wife is horrible and sounds like she’s just falling back on the easiest excuse to dip out of trying to make up for her explosion. She’s lazy as fuck.
This is one of the saddest posts I’ve ever read on Reddit.  At first, I thought it was weird you cared that she got drunk on your honeymoon.  Thought it sounded controlling but after reading through it, I assume you’ve seen something in the past which made you not want her to get drunk.   

I totally agree with post I’m replying under..  Been the drinker where things would  slip out ti friends about my concerns in the man I married.  I didn’t feel I settled, but he had behaviors that were hurtful and confusing so this is a different scenario. 

Your wife needs help.  She might have an alcohol issue even if she doesn’t drink much. Some people seem to change even after a few drinks.

I don’t know why people let their mask fall once married.   You might consider a separation for a few months while she gets help.  If she really feels she settled, then a therapist will help her address them issues and she may chose divorce.  Suggest you get therapy too as you have been treated poorly.   You missed sone red flags and may have been in denial.  You might try couples therapy if you want to save the marriage although this is hard to overcome. She may have chose lifestyle over choosing you. 

It’s weird after 4 years you don’t know who this guy is.  I’ve been working thru a trauma bond and learned that I must look for someone who is consistent  and steady.   I was conditioned over my 25 years with a narcissist to live my life on eggshells trying ti avoid his wrath.  I learned that I was used to living life on a roller coaster.  This isn’t healthy.  Healthy relationships are more like a merry go round. It’s not as thrilling as a roller coaster and so the merry go round seems boring. I’ve been warned by my therapist that finding a healthy relationship might make me question if I’m settling as the merry-go-round seems boring… like I’m settling. Ultimately though, this is what I need to find true happiness.  I share this bc many times “the one who got away” was a life on a roller coaster.  I suggest you drive into that relationship she had with this other guy to determine what happened.  If he treated her poorly, this might explain her confusion. No doubt the reality of being married causes people to question their decisions at times.  This is the only explanation I can think of that might make the marriage salvageable.   

Don’t tell her what you are looking for when asking questions about their relationship abd breakup.  Look for trauma, any type of abuse, abd inconsistent behavior on her previous partners part.  Perhaps he treated her inconsistently like love bombing and then ghosting.  Doesn’t mean he was a N, like in my case, but he could have had avoidant attachment style or possibly didn’t  card as much for her.   For some reason we always try to get back the one who doesn’t love us back. This could be why she felt he got away.  If you do see signs of this, then bring it up in couples counselling as it’s best to have an expert there to help navigate this tricky bond bc you don’t want to make assumptions.  As I says before, I suspect you lived in denial and missed red flags, perhaps justifying her behavior the past 4 years.  You want to be careful you don’t do this now.  

I’m so sorry that you are going through this after such happiness.  My heart breaks for you. I hope something I says adds clarify or a direction for you to go. I’ve been working on myself a lot during the last 2 years thru therapy and various other methods.  Suggest you be careful in sharing too much with family and friends.  The kids others get involved, sides will be taken, friends lost, and more problems created between you. Suggest you choose 1 or 2 friends/family to talk to but understand that they will never support a reconciliation after learning the truth.  Feel free to DM me if you need a random person to unload your thoughts and feelings.  I’m a 55 year old female who has been thru a lot but in a good place.  Willing to help anyway I can as I wouldn’t be here without the support I’ve received. Believe in paying it forward.  

I know you world has crashed down around you right now but keep in mind that things will def better.   It’s better to know all this now than 10 years down the road when you have kids.  I believe these type things make us stronger if we work on our issues .  You will need to learn to trust  again and repair your damaged self esteem.   She’s said  some mean things to you that make you question your reality.  Look at them seriously as it may or may not be the truth.  

One last thing… I attended a really amazing retreat in Sedona that really helped me heal. It has sone “woo woo” attached as all the life coaches all have gifts that they use intuitively.  It change my life.  Would  be happy to disclose the name abd how it worked for anyone interested.   It’d be helpful for those feeling lost and overwhelmed, grieving, going thru divorce, or list of self esteem.
Why would you even want to forgive it?  That's still how she feels regardless if she gets better at faking it or not.  Who wants to live with someone they know hates them in every way?

Forgive her after the divorce if you need to for your own peace of mind.
After she fell asleep I would have packed my shit and left her there. It's insane he continued the honey moon after that like what?!!
Forgive?  Yes, for my own well being.  Forget and continue the relationship once the changes were proven to be insincere? Prob not. My mom always says, “a drunk man’s words are a sober man’s thoughts,” and “you can’t put toothpaste back in the tube, once it’s out there it’s out.”
[deleted]
He better file for divorce or annulment asap or he’ll be paying her alimony and child support if she decides to baby trap him real quick. She’s unemployed and doesn’t even do any cleaning or chores. OP is dumb if he didn’t get a prenup.
Annulment. My first thought was annulment. Because if these are her feelings, way far down the line she will divorce OP because they lost the spark or doesn’t love him anymore. If she settled she does not love him in the first place. This is awful.
I hope he has enough time to annul this
She probably fooled a lot of other people too. There is no reason to be embarrassed. She was highly manipulative to get what she wanted and the moment she had him she felt safe in mistreating him.
Anyone "judging" you for a divorce, doesn't have to wake up with this person every day. Only you do. It's hard putting aside what other people think, but in this situation, you really are the only person that matters
No one should feel embarrassed on ending marriages at all because of these things when you were clearly the victim and your partner should be the one to be embarrassed since they don't know how to maintain a  relationship. It's more embarrassing if everyone knows what happened and yet you stay. I get the feeling ops wife is aware what kind of person she is and that's why she settled for op, no one is gonna wanna deal with her and her disrespectful and lazy attitude, I won't be surprised if her "one that got away" just had enough of her, didn't want to deal with her, or is way out of her league that he would never settle for her.
I was wondering if it was a Freudian slip when OP kept using the phrase “she was acting like the woman I married” instead of “she was again the woman I married” for the rest of the trip. 

He knows she is acting.
She does not even need to be drunk anymore. 

She is showing OP every day how it is.

OP already knows the truth. That is why he can not talk to his friends and family about it, because then he will actually have to man up and be alone again.
That phrase popped in my head as l was reading this. Her drunk thoughts are the real ones. 

Get out now before she gets pregnant.

Yep. People lose their filter and their judgment when they’re drunk, but they rarely say things they don’t actually believe deep down. This is who she is. And you deserve better.
thank you for not making me look up how to spell that….
Someone tell me what the post says?? I'm not reading all that
Please think about moving on to someone (when the time is right) that will love every part of you and feel no regrets. What you have now just… isn’t it.
I’m not sure you’re doing either of you any favors by staying.  But if you want to try and stick it out I think couples therapy in addition to individual therapy is necessary
You may both be religious but an annulment is an option given she didn’t go into this marriage honestly and with appropriate intent.
There is no world where what she was wasn’t how she truly feels. You’re being used and should probably move on sooner than later. You are still young and can find someone that appreciates and loves you for who you are.
I think you’ll know when you’re done. You just feel apathetic. I get wanting to do everything you can to make this work. I think you should try if you feel you should. You’re the only one who knows. Also therapy. A good therapist will help you sort through your feelings and help you make the right decision.  Don’t worry about embarrassment though - do what’s you feel is right.
Also just wanted to note no shame in divorce. Shit happens. I split from my awful ex after only 4 months of marriage. Super embarrassing at the time but I’ve now been married to an amazing guy for almost a decade. It’s not too late.
OP redditors really don't take into account the nuance there is in relationships, and how it's extremely difficult to "just leave." I would see a therapist and stop coming back to the post. I don't know why she said what she did and why she did it then, but Reddit will just tell you she's a gold digger. I don't think this is helpful. She could be going through something incredibly intense, which you are now as well, and hearing from a bunch of internet strangers isn't really useful.
Please accept my one thousand upvotes. This is such great information, presented in an extremely helpful fashion.
I agree with this. Alcohol loosens inhibitions a lot, but it can't make you into a completely different person. It's possible she always felt this way on some level, and communicating very clearly about this and working on this with a lot of marriage counseling might be the only way through this. It might be really difficult, but it depends on whether OP thinks trying to save their marriage is worth it at this point.
Not knowing when to say when, is just as much of a detriment as jumping ship too soon. OP, don’t go down with a ship that isn’t yours.
I completely disagree. When I’ve been blackout drunk, I have no idea what I said or did. When I find out, it’s a total shock and is in no way my true thoughts coming out.

Once, I got out of bed and stripped naked and then squatted down and pee’d on my clothes!  This is after I playfully put a golf club through my husbands new tv. Hilarious, right!?! 

Maybe everyone is wired differently. But I know, for a fact, that I speak complete nonsense when I’m drunk. And I’m super glad no one rubs my nose in it.
Hmm. Yes. Everybody acts as if we are all 100% in love and lust with every aspect of our partners. That it is all or nothing. I must be your eternal partner forever, not a stray thought shall enter my head or it's over. While you should have standards and values and things that you are in love with, sometimes life is complicated.
As someone 12 years into this cycle, I wish hindsight I had realized it on the honeymoon and be able to leave….vs now after 12 years of depleting myself, I feel a level of hopelessness and beyond unsalvageable that I would never wish on another soul. I hope OP has the ability to step away from this before turning into another “me” :( this post broke my heart.
[deleted]
Sorry OP but this is your answer. Really hope you can escape from your lazy bastard leech of a wife.
Plus pump a kid out asap to trap him further.
This! This is the comment I was looking for
But don't actually fuck her because I can totally see her trying to get pregnant to keep him around
same for me - the DAY we arrived to our honeymoon destination I remember things changed - 3 out of 7 days at a Sandals resort did we even sleep in the same room - (not my choice) and the day we returned home they pulled their two young kids from their previous relationship into their bed since they “missed them all week” and sent me to the couch. Marriage lasted 8 months. Found out later it had gotten much worse than I even knew - and I did not think it was possible. Red flags only look like a flag if you are wearing rose colored glasses. I think you already know your answer you just don’t particularly like it - but you don’t have to like an answer for it to be the right one. (Writing to the OP here)
In my opinion it seems like she got drunk and the truth came out. Then she realized she put the lavish life you let her live in jeopardy and went into panic mode trying to save her own ass cause she has it so easy with you. Now that times moving on, she’s falling back out of the save her own ass mode because she thinks she’s safe again. I don’t mean this in bad way but it sounds like she’s using you to maintain the lifestyle and doesn’t truly love you. I can’t imagine in any drunken scenario that I would tell my partner those types of things, unless I actually thought those things.
Annul the marriage while you still have time.
FFS. “No matter what”…haha NO
I think this is it.  My sister had bipolar and when she drank it was always in excess and she would say the nastiest things.
Unfortunately it progressed and she took her life last year.  It’s very sad though and a huge red flag for you.  I am so sorry you had to experience that
Oh fuck off. She's taking advantage of him and said some absolutely foul shit and it'd HIS job to fix her????
"stop making demands and help the poor thing" is your takeaway from this story? he works 70 hour weeks to provide for his mooch of a wife even after she said the absolute most horrible things to him and about him, and he's somehow the one who's not doing enough for her? the only thing OP is at fault for here is not walking away then and there and holding out hope that he might be able to get over being shattered in the most cruel way imaginable.
Don't necessarily agree that it's his job to fix this situation but to me this is a DRASTIC and sudden personality shift that bears interrogation. I think OP needs to soul search about his wife, if this is truly so left of field as the post implies (rather than there being some delusion) then I would be asking myself why my wife had suddenly developed a mood disorder, because what he describes is extreme. Could something have happened to her recently that he's unaware of? Is she on some new meds inducing psychosis with alcohol? Does she have a hormone disorder? I would exclude these possibilities before throwing four happy years, if they really have been as happy as OP is indicating...
That's why it got removed from /r/relationships . It's a creative writing exercise/ragebait.
Oh my god finally someone said it. It’s totally made up

“awkwardly wincing” …yeah, that’s a creative writer
It’s really not that complex. She’s using him.
He married a con artist and the con is their marriage and the life it gives her.  I'm all for taking marriage very seriously, but this isn't a real marriage.  He entered into it in good faith.  She didn't.  It's been a con from beginning to end.  You can't try to save something that never existed in the first place.
She already violated the commitment and betrayed him. She didn’t make a legit, honest commitment to begin with!
'On paper your failing marriage has a similar anatomy to my successful marriage, so you should keep it'

I'm sorry but if she's getting annoyed with doing basic household tasks then it sounds to me like she has a serious mental disorder and it's not OP's job to enable her to continue neglecting herself by giving her all the resources and comforts she could ever want.
Girl this sounds like a….less than ideal situation/partner. I’ve struggled with social anxiety my whole life and have gotten *very* drunk on more than one occasion, being a recent graduate and all. Not once during any of these scenarios have I went out of my way to make the people I love/the people around me feel bad or put them down. Why are y’all staying with people who not only are mean and nasty to you but who also can’t control themselves while ingesting certain substances?
This is a garbage take. She's not worth fighting for. You can still maintain some semblance of self-respect by leaving her.

She isn't worth it. Men shouldn't have to just "put up with it and take it all in stride". Women are human beings, not trophies to be earned, and a man has just as much intrinsic value. 

There's a lot of this "high value vs low value" nonsense that is predicated on a very faulty understanding of human nature.

If someone is unwilling to contribute or reciprocate in any way than they're not worth keeping around. Constantly having to "prove your value" when you already provide her with everything will be a life of constant battles and endless frustration. It's petty, juvenile, and more concerned with maintaining power than fostering a healthy or fulfilling relationship for both parties.
Also, it's not your responsibility to "fix her". She's an adult.
I would have paid for their tab too, and quietly offered him a plane ticket home.
But it’s not early on, they got married after 4 years together. How could she be with him and stand those feelings for that long? Was she really banking on his financial success that whole time and expecting to be happy as a housewife? And she showed zero signs of any problems for the entirety of their relationship up until the point they were on their honeymoon? There had to be some hints of her complacency at least
That is indeed going to be the question. He wants to believe she wants to change, but it’s not clear she really wants to in the long term. Like you said, she loves the lifestyle, not him.
I feel like op should look into an annulment.  He shouldn’t live with someone like this. He deserves a chance at finding a genuine partner.
Lol now that song is playing in my head
>The OP clearly knows the signs of partner being uncontrollably drunk, which is a good indication that it happens too often.

The fact that he noticed quickly, and started panicking a bit, tells me A) this happens quite often and B) there are other horror stories of her being drunk that OP doesn't want to say
The refusal to give him time to process is a desperate attempt to prevent him from seeing the truth. She knows she's manipulated him and once the door has been opened a crack, he'll begin to see her for what she really is. She couldn't have that so she panicked and tried everything to distract him, including 'hurting' herself, screaming and throwing an unholy fit. She's manipulative and calculating as hell.
This sounds like you are detached from and not honest with yourself. People just don't say things that have zero kernels of truth in them. They come from somewhere.
Trust me… Those things you said, when you were drunk are lurking somewhere in your subconscious.
With as short a time as it's been, an annulment might be the better option.
I agree with the forgiving part after leaving. She told him she settled and regrets losing the one who got away. She’s still in love with someone else. That’s the part I could never get over. I feel bad for op. He’s never going to measure up in her mind. That’s why the changes she makes are only temporary. She’s not happy or in love with op. So sad.
Pretty much aligns with her description of him as not being able to read the room. Most people would have left Edit: To clarify, that I meant HE should have left after she said all of the ugly things she did. Pre-meltdown, he sounded grateful that someone would even be with him. Now he has his answer. An answer no one would want to hear. What a terrible woman.
[deleted]
I think a lot of people mistake “forgiveness” with still choosing to have a relationship with them, which is not the case. I can forgive someone and still set a boundary that I never want to see them again, those two things can coexist. So you absolutely got it right. Also, love the toothpaste phrase from your mom, haven’t heard that one before lol
There is no way this would qualify for annulment honestly.
I made this mistake. Trust someone when they show you who they really are. He needs to get out asap.
I had a friend who once told me that she believed that dumb quote, until she met me.  I have said some very strange very untrue things when blackout drunk.  Like made up an entirely different life story in my partying days and had no idea that I did that until I was later approached by multiple people I had apparently met before, calling me by a different name and referencing some details that I had apparently completely made up.  I once got into a really dumb argument with a friend while blackout, and when she told me what I had said the next day I was shocked, because it was bunch of stuff that I genuinely didn’t believe or feel.  So yes, I agree that it’s nonsense.
Then don’t comment holy fuck
Couple on honeymoon, wife tells husband that she basically doesn't like him while she's drunk off her ass, back home she makes a token attempt to be "better" and quickly slides back into being awful. He is too embarrassed to talk to his friends/family and feels he is no longer in love with her.
> vino veritas

In truth
I'm usually on the side of the woman but this is just beyond what can be explained away.

I have little empathy for someone who says something like this, can't explain it and quits therapy after 2 wks
>I don't think this is helpful. She could be going through something incredibly intense

so it's fine for her to not only blow up on him, but humiliate him in front of random strangers, and he has to stick around with her just because she's "going through it"?

Bullshit, as someone who's been on that side of the firing range, it's a form of abuse to take your "something incredibly tense" feelings out on your partner.
Except every day that goes by he’s more on the hook for funding this hobos lifestyle through massive alimony payments since she doesn’t work and god forbid she gets pregnant.
You've got to be joking. "She could be going through something incredibly intense" is not even close to an excuse for her behavior. Not. Even. Close.
This! Thank you! I really find so weird that redditors are so easily suggesting leaving or going no contact with some family members. Blocking someone so close from your real life isn't like blocking some stranger from social media.
Hello Internet Stranger. Your praise was very flattering. Thank you.

If you found it useful, can I ask you a favor?

I want to know somethings which you might have an insight into.

First what was the useful points in my comment that personally interested *you*?

I am asking this because I also encounter people who just shower wisdom in the comments and I'm grateful for that. I strive to so the same.

And more importantly I want to know what people find useful, and what exactly IS useful in reality, so that the extra stuff can be dispensed with and I can get straight to the point more often.

For me personally I'm delighted when people tell me some great psychological insight, or make present a rigorous or intelligent analysis of something. Anything that's useful or that they have put some time into.

So i apologise for being forward, what exactly interested you in my comment? Was it the stuff about loneliness vs love I quoted out of the newspaper?

Second, did you find my comment coherent or flowing?

I'm working on that, and i don't understand what stage I'm at in improving that.

Someone I admire told me that they have a skill which they practice almost everyday with almost everything.

It's the skill of doing things at the right pace such that they don't feel tired, and the output is maximised. They said they learned it during the time they spent in water by pushing their hand across the water and watching it glide along in it and feeling it's resistance.

They wrote such clear answers and easy to read answers that i fell in love with them, and i suspect that they using that skill to spread out the information they want to communicate in the answer, such that it was easy and very natural to grasp.

So once again, sorry to repeat, what is the state of coherency or flow in my comment if any?

It would helpful to understand what changes to make so as to reach my goal of getting fluid reading answers.

You don't have to answer if this was too long or too weird. Thanks.
SHE has to admit she feels this way, out loud. She hasn’t done that. She’s made excuses, tried to change, yet still continues to feel, deep down, that she settled. Until she’s ready to be fully honest, this marriage is over.
If you're peeing in the house and breaking tvs, maybe someone should?
It's never too late. You can still create a new and different life for yourself. The transition will be hard and you may wonder why you ever made that decision, but it is so much brighter on the other side. I promise.
Just hire help, it's ultimately cheaper.
That's how they operate.
Ahhahaha broo😭
Having been in a similar situation, I think you nailed it. There's the threat of losing the security or comfort that she finds inside their relationship, and "settling" is a sacrifice she'll make to keep from losing that. I've been in that situation. I've heard the drunken words and it never got better. I'm in love now with a different person. She makes her own money, has her own place. She doesn't "need" me. She chooses me. I have never felt "settled for" with her, where I felt barely tolerated by the last one. Your comment is spot on and OP's post just breaks my heart.
"In sickness and in health, in poverty and in wealth, but definitely not in their immaturity and selfish moments. I'll be allowed my selfish moments, but not them. If THEY do it, yup, kick em to the curb."  


I've seen marriages survive everything, even infidelity and children from that infidelity and still be incredible marriages in the end. Everyone has to make their own choice for their own situation, but few things can purify you to become more perfect than learning how and working to make a bad marriage good.
Yeah my concern is she’s with him for the life she gets to lead... if so, what else can we advise except divorce.
When operating with people who live by deceit, we cannot play nice and keep our promises while theirs were never real to begin with. This is the biggest trap I see in so many marriages - the honest person says "I made a vow." The dishonest person said words to get what they wanted. Completely agree with your sentiment.
I don’t know, he seems to still like her. I don’t think you fully understand what I’m saying, probably my fault. I didn’t explain it well.
and offered him free therapy once I get my license
And he should have taken it.
There are, he just refuses to see them because of his rose tinted glasses. Even after her outburst he thinks that they can work through them because of the fear of appearing to be a failure for divorcing so soon and because she’s been plying him so as to not lose her ticket to the easy and free lifestyle he provides.
I think some people can disassociate some feelings from others and a surprising amount of people think that once they get married those feelings will go away. 

I’m not excusing it, I feel horrible for the OP, I’m just saying I understand her thought process. She probably *wanted* him to be enough, and thought that once she fully committed then he magically *would* be. 

But then she got married and that little voice in the back of her mind that she had been ignoring, still wouldn’t shut up. Meanwhile she still *wants* to want him, so once she sobered up she wanted to try and make it work. Rationally she knows he’s a great partner for her.

The problem is that love is rarely rational. I think we’ve all tried to date the person who “checks all the boxes” but just can’t make ourselves *want* to be with them despite our own better judgement. Then there’s the question of “how much of settling is just settling down?”  If you hold out for “perfect” you’ll be single forever. 

Despite all of that, I don’t think there’s any coming back from this for OP, especially because she sounds lazy and too reliant on him. The good has to at least outweigh the bad. It sounds like for her it might, but I doubt it does anymore for OP.
People CAN and DO do this. It’s awful. They can lie to themselves so that they almost forget their true feelings of resentment. Then they crack.
I know a couple that was together for 2 years. On their honeymoon, she broke down in tears and stayed in bed for a week because of how upset she was about getting married. Some people really do just tell themselves it will be OK and keep moving forward until they break.
I don’t know that she even loves the lifestyle. She sounds like an unhappy person.
Might be a little late for that
We've all made mistakes from having a little too much, but if you're 25, and your friends/family etc. doesn't trust you to know the difference between letting loss a little a ruining a night, that's a good indication that you have a problem.
I would make up blatant lies to try and be mean sometimes. So no, not always
Usually, but not necessarily. Sometimes I said things simply because I knew they were hurtful and I wanted someone else to be in as much pain as I was. Lashing out like a wounded animal.

Once you’ve said something like that it’s over, though. There’s no taking it back or convincing the other person you didn’t mean it, whether you did or not. And they will always remember it.
Sorry, but no. At the time I was dealing with a lot of stuff I didn’t have the tools to be dealing with in a healthy way.  I had a lot of very repressed anger, because nice girls aren’t supposed to be angry. That plus lots way too much alcohol kind of created the perfect storm.  I was finally able to express that anger, but in absolutely insane ways to people that had nothing to do with it.  With context, so much of the shit I said had absolutely zero to do with who I said it to.  Not to mention all the stuff that was completely insane and had nothing to do with anything.  I’m not saying it came from nowhere, but it wasn’t “secret truths” by any means. So no, I don’t think drunk people (always) speak sober truths.
I disagree.

He was shell-shocked and hurt. Numb, as he even described.

Pretending things are fine and continuing on are a common response to that sort of thing - you want to go back to normalcy and routine as much as possible. He didn't know what to do, being stuck somewhere and having a bomb just dropped on him like that.

It's not a matter of reading a room or not, it's how to handle and deal with a traumatic and hurtful event.
That’s overly harsh
No man in his right mind would allow an incredibly drunk woman (especially his wife) to stumble off alone, at night, in a foreign place.
Me too- Sage old school mom wisdom.  It really applies to so many situations.
Absolutely!  I had to forgive my ex so I could move on peacefully with my life. I didn’t want to spend my life angry and jaded. 

That being said, I have no desire to ever see him again. If I ran into him, I’d be pleasant, because I truly did forgive him, but I wouldn’t be asking to go for drinks and catch up. He can live his life and I can live mine, completely separate.
Truth in wine. 

Id est, things that people say when drunk that they wouldnt say sober tend to be more honest.
He’s 28, he could be married to someone who actually loves him by the time he’s 30. Cut and run son. I would rather die alone then live with this over my head.
I agree that a lot of reddit responses immediately go nuclear and want to blow up the relationship; this is a situation that's warranted. There is no excuse for her behavior and no path to a healthy relationship moving forward.
Thank you that means a lot to hear. We got married when I was 18. Just turned 30. I think I have a harder time letting go because it kills me thinking that I spent my “fertile” years having faith in something that never came and feel like my life is a waste and will never have kids etc etc (thanks society for making women believe that’s what fulfilling means in life) lol
It even goes beyond that a bit. Sounds like bpd from someone who married a person with it.  When it was undiagnosed, she'd randomly snap and say the most hateful shit on Earth, particularly when she drank. Meds helped a lot, but it didn't undo the damage of her words. 

However, you love the person and you disassociate the crazy with your day to day person. Worse, you know their life crumbles if you walk away. It leaves you somewhat trapped, particularly when kids are involved.  Not saying leaving isn't the right answer, but it's hard even when you aren't blinded by love.
Actually the OP is mainly the unhappy person here who is not able to forgive. 

The wife was just speaking what she felt at the time. The OP already knew that he wasn't her type and they liked each other for different reasons. Since he wasnt her type she settled and found other aspects to like. She married him, so she obviously likes him regardless of what she pointed out while drunk.

I also have an unattainable type. We all do, and we're all settling in one way or another. The OP is unable to see that and only hurts the relationship by being unable to forgive her burst of honesty.
Agreed.  At times when I was really drunk, I would say things I feared were true.  Of them.
What I should have added, is that he sounds like a very nice guy who allows himself to be taken advantage of by people who pretend to care about him. She did this for 4 straight years, waiting until immediately after the marriage to finally pull the curtain up.

It sounds like maybe in working so much, he either missed an awful lot in those years, wasn't paying attention, or was making excuses for her in  wanting her to be what she isn't. In any case, she's a terrible woman.
Yes i wasn't justifing her behaviour in any way. I was just venting about the general trend of redditors going nuclear.
I don't agree about the fact that their relationship is broken forever for sure. We don't know how was their relationship, we don't know her version, we don't know what they both are able to find a meeting point.  There are too many variables in the game that only op and his wife knows.
30 is not too late to have kids. I have a friend who had one just shy of 40 and another 6 years later. And, honestly, I didn't even begin the best parts of my life until 29-30. I'm 33 and much happier and more confident and more secure in myself than I have ever been. And I owe a lot of that to getting divorced. 

30 is so young!! That's not even half your life, and he only got a third of what you've lived so far. Why let him steal any more of it?! You've got so many precious years to fill with the most wonderful adventures and the most dulfilling friendships! And if you find another partner, great! But don't settle again. Care for your health, mental and physical, and you'll likely see several more decades. Do you really want them to be miserable?
This was my thought, too. Especially because when she woke up she wanted to hurt herself. This does not get better on us own, but only with intense with a trained therapist
I was glad to see someone thought of bipolar disorder. I even considered whether she had been roofied at some point since she couldn’t remember what happened. I’m not an expert on either, but man her behavior seemed like a sudden turn off the nearest cliff. If nothing else she should probably be seeing a professional to get to the root of the problem.  He needs to insist on this.
Plus he said they were LD for a bit during the pandemic.  So he could've easily missed the signs between work and the pandemic.
I totally hear ya with the venting. It gets annoying when some situations are so innocuous they don't warrant an insanely over-reactionary response. 

We don't know the specifics of their relationship. I'm just putting myself in his shoes, and personally there's no way I could resolve the damage of my spouse having that much animosity on a Tuesday, let alone on the honeymoon. But different strokes, different folks, right?
Also blacking out and making zero sense does exist and does happen. I'm not sure if OP wants to hang around and wait for it to happen again but it's a thing.
Man you got me. This made me cry (in a, thanks big sister I never had sisters to give me girl advice, way) thank you. Youre so right. Thank you for taking the time to make a positive impact on an internet stranger <3
She says she didn’t remember, but she looked anxious. 

If what she said was true, she had contempt for him but acted loving because she chose to settle for him, then she’s been dishonest for four years. 

Alcohol usually lowers inhibitions.
BPD = Borderline Personality Disorder 

Bipolar is a walk in the park compared to BPD.
Of course! I think everyone deserves to be loved and fulfilled and happy. I hope you chase that freedom and joy. 💜
Damn we are like the same person. 11 years in and no sisters :/
I have both bpd and bipolar, I can confirm this statement 😂😂
OMG! I didn’t know you could have both, that has to be one hell of a rollercoaster. I hope you’re doing well!
Unfortunately so, I also have ADHD to add to the mix along with other disorders 😭😂 I’m stable thank you! My boyfriend keeps me level so I’m lucky ❤️
The man who nearly killed me wants to apologize.
Long story short. On Christmas morning of 2015 I was nearly beaten to death. It took a year but he was arrested and served a 5 year prison sentence.
Through my own path of trying to heal from what happened to me, and with the help of a therapist I have made an attempt at trying to forgive him for what he did. I was torturing myself with my hate and rage and forgiveness was the only way I could see a way out of a mindset that would have only kept on hurting me.
Recently I've been made aware that he is in a program, is sober, and is now trying to make amends for his lengthy list of transgressions.
He wants to meet up with me to extend an in person apology.
All of this correspondence has been through a mutual friend of ours who has kept tabs on him for me through the years.

I guess what I'm asking for advice about is, am I completely misguided? Am I being incredibly stupid in even considering letting this happen? Is this a bad fuckin idea? I think that hearing an apology would serve me well. It might help me finally close the book so to speak. Also, being willing to allow him to give the apology feels like it would be the right thing to do. I'm not saying I'm a fuckin saint or anything but I feel like if he's actually trying to better himself that maybe helping him would help me.

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Part of me still hates him for what he did and other parts just feel bad for him.







EDIT: I appreciate all of your replies. Honestly, the response I've gotten for this is overwhelming and I thank all of you for taking the time to give your opinions and advice.

I do feel like I need to clarify something. This is not a domestic violence situation. I'm a cis het male that ran afoul of a dangerous individual. That being said, all the replies regarding domestic violence are all valid and I hope anyone who read those replies and needed to hear that advice took them to heart. 




EDIT 2: I'm sorry for not replying to everyone but I promise I am reading everything and internalizing all of your thoughts. 



EDIT 3: I'd like to thank everyone again for all the kind words and useful advice that has been given. 

I've contacted the Victim's Services advocate in the county where this took place and asked about any restorative justice programs they may have. She said that while they don't have a program like that it's only because they've never done this before. However, she's going to talk to the DA and prosecutor of that case and see if they can facilitate a meeting. She suggested that the prosecutor, herself, and the main investigator of the case attend as well to have a law enforcement presence.

If he's truly on the straight and narrow then he should have no problem attending a meeting with them waiting in the wings.
Giving amends in a program SPECIFICALLY says it should not harm either party. He can write you an apology. It doesn't have to be in person. 


If it's going to help you then having it in writing reduces the likelihood of retraumatizing yourself. Maybe have the therapist read it first. 
I’m a domestic violence counselor and it truly bothers me when my clients say they are struggling to forgive the person. That puts way too much pressure on the survivor. I don’t believe that you need to forgive that person. I believe you only need to grant yourself space and time to hold what happened to you. Allow yourself to go through all the stages of grief around this very traumatic experience. Anger is one of the stages and you’ve earned every right to feel that.
You can forgive him if that’s what you feel in your heart you should do, but you’re under no obligation to speak to him or be around him again, and it’s on him to understand this, not on you to have to explain.
Yeah. I'd pass, personally. No thanks.
NO!  


The very fact that this abusive person, who nearly killed you, is asking for you to see him in person is proof positive that he does not fully understand what he did and cannot be trusted in any way, shape, or form. He terrorized you to the point of near death and now expect you to be in his presence again? Absolutely not. He is still dangerous. If he truly understood all of the harm he caused you and felt genuine remorse, he would also understand how disruptive and scary it would be for you to see him again. No. Do not go.  


Furthermore, I would tell this mutual friend several things. First, have him tell your abuser that you do not want to meet and do not want any more contact or communication whatsoever. Second, if and when he does understand what he did to you and truly feels sorry, he can demonstrate that by being good to the people still in his life. He can honor his apology to you by being a kind person to others, he cannot express it to you. And third, this mutual acquaintance should no longer relay any news or messages to/from you two, and if they can't respect that, stop talking to the acquaintance. 


But whatever you do, do not meet him.
I wouldn't meet him in person, you don't owe him that. If that's something you want then take someone, or multiple people with you for safety and support. If it's what he wants or needs, then you don't need to oblige him anything. You're the victim, not him. It can be a phone call, a video call, an email, a voice note, whatever. The apology should be on your terms and what you're comfortable with especially given the nature of the crime. Take care of yourself, this is a lot.
he nearly killed you. never ever see him again. sorry but there is no closure or apology that will ever make up for what he did to you. please protect yourself
Meet to listen to his apology? Fuck that. I'd be getting a  restraining order now that he's out of jail. Look after yourself first and foremost. He's just looking to make himself fel better. Not you.
Don’t meet him.
Yeah I agree with a lot of the commenters. You doesn't owe him anything. My stepfather tried to kill me for standing up for my mother on Jan 1st this year and demanded I apologize to him. I did it so he would stop treating me like shit (he didn't, quite obviously) and all it's done for me is continue the rage and hate. You owe him nothing, not forgiveness, not even a meeting so he can apologize. You deserve to move on without him looming over you. Just tell your friend "I don't want to meet with him. If he was sorry he wouldn't have done it. I need to move on with my life, so does he."
He tried to kill you. No, do not meet this creature in person. It is not for your benefit, it’s for his. The last few years you could have been doing anything other than healing from trauma you shouldn’t have been at the receiving end of. People can say sorry, you don’t have to accept it, you definitely don’t have to accept it in person. Stay strong
Please do not meet, it's not worth the risk.

>It might help me finally close the book so to speak. Also, being willing to allow him to give the apology feels like it would be the right thing to do.

What if they write a letter and give it to your mutual friend to pass on to you instead? I genuinely believe meeting up in person is an extremely bad idea.

But even then, do you really want their apology? would it actually change anything? You should have a really long think about the situation and how you feel. Either way I stand by my "Do not meet".
I watch too many crimes shows to think that this is a good idea. He wants to meet in person so he’s still trying to control the situation and environment. Let him apologize and make amends. Sure. But it doesn’t have to be in person. You’re in charge and in control now. And honestly having to ask in this forum tells me that you already know your answer. Your intuition is speaking to you. If you meet in person I can guarantee you that you will have a ptsd reaction. Well, I shouldn’t say guarantee, but the chances are high that your body and mind will be triggered. Trust your gut. ❤️
He can write you a letter, at least first - No WAY would I even think of meeting him without that first. You can gague from a letter if this ‘apology’ is actually going to help you or if he’s doing it more for himself or just going through motions.  It could be a really bad fuckin idea.  

  Seeing him will probably bring up all sorts of trauma and panic from that night and the whole experience, dumping you straight back into fight or flight mode, and set your own recovery back.  He beat shit out of you nearly killed you and you have *zero obligation* or responsibility to fuck yourself over again so he can feel good about himself.  It’s likely him virtue signalling and patting himself on the back for being a good dude and apoLogiSinG or maybe drone on about how he found Jesus and has bEEn forGiveN - who gaf stick yr apology where the sun don’t shine mate.   It’ll never make everything unhappen. 

If your therapist is telling you that you ‘have to’ forgive in order to move on, you should change therapist.  We don’t *have to* ‘forgive' monsters who harm us in order to help ourselves move on, at least just get to a point of indifference - or yeah feeling sorry for - and pure *dgaf* regarding them.  Maybe years decades later forgiveness can come but you’re *not obligated to* forgive in order for yourself to heal.  

>I think that hearing an apology would serve me well. It might help me finally close the book so to speak.

Yeah a legit apology *for you and to you could* help, and *if it’s not a legit apology for and to you* it will just open a WHOLE nother can of shitty worms - for YOU.  While he sails off feeling good about himself that aT leAsT he apoLogisEd.   Idk, but best of luck to you!
It’s your garden. Are you going to let him in, and trample what you’re growing? I would not meet him.
You take care of yourself.  No reason to help him feel better about himself.
"Is this a bad fuckin idea?" In my opinion, yes it is.

The chances that you will experience his verbal apology with a sense of closure and relief are slim. It has a great chance of being deeply triggering and may reignite feelings that could be quite a setback for you in your healing.

You can 'forgive' him and release this in your own way without being exposed to his presence and that's my strong suggestion. There's something about being physically near someone who caused you bodily harm. It's very different than letters, or even a video. 

Your heart is in the right place by looking for the 'right thing' and wanting to help both of you move forward. I would never call you or your idea 'stupid' but it might be optimistic and misguided. Can you discuss this with your therapist?

My feeling is this is not a safe idea, not in any way. I wouldn't recommend maintaining any kind of contact with this individual and your mutual friend should know that sharing any information about you is off-limits. Violent criminals do re-offend, it's a fact. You don't owe this man a thing. Whatever you do must first and foremost be safe and healing for you.
What does your therapist say?
Tell him to write it in a letter. Then that doesn’t require any response from you. Or if you do decide to respond it’s on your own time. He is not owed any sort of response from you
2015,, its now 2024 almost 2025. I dont advise meeting up with him. Too much time has lapsed and you dont need to relive any part of what happened 10 years ago. The past is the past and you should focus on your future. You have already internally forgiven him, so that is great and is enough for you to move on. You dont need to hear him say 3 words ( I am Sorry) because then what? It doesnt in my opinion offer closure or anything. Close the chapter,move on, forgive but dont forget.
Your healing is on you OP, his is not. Do not feel obliged to meet his needs of forgiveness because you’re trying to find yours x
Very tough situation. .
I still wouldnt trust such a person. .
Only animals can hurt someone like that when they're out of control..
I wish you goodluck whatever you choose
He can apologize in hell
What will this do for you? That is the question you need to ask yourself
If he is truly doing work on himself and doing what the program is about, he will understand if you say no. As recovering addicts we are to make amends, not for ourselves, but to let the other person know they didn't deserve whatever it was the addict did to hurt them and that it was never about that person. You are already realizing this, on your own, so idk that you necessarily will benefit from his apology.

If you think you truly will get something out of it, do it for you. If not, don't feel guilty saying no and if he pushes back, even a little, he is not doing what he needs to recover. I have had 3 people I had amends for deny me and I ended up doing the amends by myself. Just saying those words to the ether is helpful and it isn't hurting the person who was hurt by me in the first place.

I am so sorry this happened to you and I'm glad you're here.
Never see him. Don’t. He can say sorry in a message or text. Don’t trust him.
I have been in violent relationships and the recent one nearly cost me my life... Twice.  That man would look me in the eyes and say 'I love you' and I would say 'I love you' and I meant it.  Men who try to kill you or who abuse women do not mean it when they say I love you.

I've done lots of therapy and I get 'blamed' for 'choosing violent men/staying in a relationship/returning to a violent relationship '. The kind of letter you have and the contact with mutual friend is how I've been drawn back into abusive relationships.  Men promise to change. Few do.

You've done therapy.  He's done 12 Step Programs which are valuable but I'm not a fan of that 'Make Amends' step and a few others because he will have a Sponsor helping him who might not have medical training. Loved experience and the sponsorship in 12 Step Programs is great for addicts helping addicts but my concern is this meeting might not help you.

You've already given him the gift of forgiveness.  What do you get out of that meeting him? 

You say you still hate him, a part of you does. I think hate is a valid reaction to abuse you suffered and it's also the flip side of love.  I'd be concerned he might be able to flip the coin back to love.

Have you talked to your therapist about this?  Maybe look online about trauma bonding.  I hate the term 'abusove love' those men abuse and it's not love.  In active addiction where there's a painful withdrawal a person becomes addicted to the substance that removes withdrawal pains.  Violent partners put that pain there and then say I love you and pain recedes.  Meeting a man who broke your heart because a relationship grew apart after a few years ago wants to say sorry is one thing you could be meeting a violent Psychopath Stalker that tried to kill you once, is still a bit obsessed and staying in touch and will do that again.

If I were in your shoes I'd consider this a life and death situation.  I'd choose no contact and I'd advise Police he was out and he had requested contact.  I'd never see him again.
Look up restorative justice programs. A lot of people find closure by meeting the people who have hurt them. Finding a way to forgive him may help you move on with your life and let go of your anger an resentment, but it a deeply personal decision and I don’t recommend you listen to internet strangers.

[restorative justice Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice)
I do not think you should meet with him at all. You can move forward with your journey and healing in other ways. I do not think this will give you the closure you are looking for and will set you back tenfold. 

That being said, IF (and that is a big if) you do decide to meet with him (bc I think you are going to go in this direction anyways and thought about this a lot- despite people telling you it wouldn't be in your best interests at all), I think it would be best to meet with him through an offender victim program or something along those lines where the meeting is supervised by a trained professional to ensure it is (as) safe (as can be) physically and mentally for you and to ensure the conversations move in a productive healing direction. 

But again, I think there are much better ways for you to heal and I would NEVER advise a loved one to meet with someone that literally tried to kill them. Also, I do not think you should have ever been corresponding with him at all (through a mutual friend or whomever). 

I also feel you also don't know his true intentions about meeting so you should also keep this in mind (he may want "revenge" and blame you for being in prison all those years, he may want to meet you to kill you since he wasn't successful with this endeavor last time around, and/or he may want to manipulate you in some way).
Step 9: Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.

Your call. If you feel you would personally and emotionally benefit from the experience then move forward. Don't forget that his 'step' includes you having the right to say whatever you need to say to him. Good luck.
Terrible idea stay. Safe!!
If he’s sorry, he’ll move far far away and never bother you again. Let your friend deliver a letter if you so choose but seeing his face seems retraumatizing. You owe him nothing.
NO NO NO.  NOT ON A BOAT. NOT IN A MOAT. NOT IN A HOUSE. NOT WITH A MOUSE. You should still hate him and he doesn’t need nor are you required to give your forgiveness. This is classic abusive behavior to make it about them again. The mutual person needs to stop they are not helping. Be safe and move on.
You could not meet him. Like forgive and forget. 
Don't meet them. Do you know how convinced of your own actions you have to be to try to beat someone to death? 

Statistically and from your wording, it looks like you knew this guy. Do not under any circumstances let this asshole back into your life. Your safety is more important than his need to feel good because, let's face it, he's going to do it again. No amount of therapy helps people who try to murder someone with their bare hands on Christmas. Come on now. 

(This is just my opinion, I've been around a lot of these types so I'm not exactly willing to cater to them anymore)
I am going to lay out a different scenario for you to consider.   Let's say I almost killed someone and was sent to prison for 5 years.  Part of me is going to be very angry at the person who got me sentenced.  I might get out and decide to better myself or I might decide I want to "finish the job I started."   The best way for me to do the latter is to pretend I want to meet in person to apologize, gain your trust, and break down your defenses.  Are you willing to take that risk?  I wouldn't meet this guy.  If he wants to apologize and explain what would make him try to kill you, have him do it in writing.  I don't see any good reason for you to put yourself at risk by meeting in person. 

As for forgiveness,  you forgive someone not for them,  but so you can let go of the anger and move on with your life.   You don't need to tell him you forgive him and you don't even need his apology to forgive him.   You just keep moving on with your life and put him far behind you.
Don’t go 

He can make amends from a distance
I think you should have some other type of contact before you see them in person. I would email or write a letter something that will show you won’t be in any physical danger and even then it won’t be a guarantee
I worked as a psychologist in a prison for the better part of a decade. After my experiences there, I would never discount the possibility that he wants to meet up because he still blames you, or maybe blames you for the years he spent in prison and whatever bad stuff happened in there, and wants to finish what he started. It's probably not the case, but it's a possibility. I can't think of any reason that a well thought out apology letter from him wouldn't be plenty, both for you and for him. I also think it's possible that even if his intentions are pure, seeing him will be harmful or traumatizing to you.
No do not meet them in person. If you feel it gives you closure accept their written apology.
Allow him to, try to forgive as much as you can bc anger can destroy you.
He can apologize in a letter. You are under NO obligation to respond in any way! The amends does require you to forgive him or even respond to him. We (people in recovery) even write letters to people who have passed away and then burn to letter to 'send' it. ONLY response if you absolutely want to. 

"Make direct amends whenever possible except when to so would injury them or others".
You are not obliged to go through trauma again just for someone's else "progress"
Usually, No Matter the reason. Be it schoolbully, sexual abuse, streetcrime and what not and the one who did the harm wants to apologize, it is a onesided relief.
As you keep living with the trauma, the lost year, lost chances  and don't feel better after it.
Him apologizing is supposed to be about you, not him. If you don't want or need it, that'd fine.
I'm not sure why you want to forgive a fella for nearly killing you, even if it did seem like the only option out back then, but absolutely do not meet up with him. Even on the off chance he's actually sorry and not just trying to look better to the law, a written apology or phone call will have the same effect and without the risk of more violence. 







>Am I being incredibly stupid in even considering letting this happen? Is this a bad fuckin idea?



Yes on both counts. Cop on and avoid all contact with him
He can **WRITE** you an apology.
Nope.  He should be nowhere around you.
Wow so he gets to feel like a big boy and get patted on the back by his AA buddies. He needs to take it up with God not you.
This shouldn't even be considered at all. F*&k him I hope he drops dead
I would not. People think an apology for physical and mental injury is some sort of stupid acceptable justification that suddenly makes everything all more better? 

BS! I want money, lots of lovely money and then I still most likely would not accept an apology.
Facing this person is not going to do anything for you that is positive.  You do NOT need anything from him.
Gonna be succinct, why give him a second chance?  You don’t owe anyone forgiveness, and if he wants to atone or make amends, he could send you a cheque for damages.   In my life I’ve experienced violence and abuse, all of them got away with it.  His journey is his journey, my view is, he already derailed you once, there is no guarantee he couldn’t do it twice.  It’s likely hes doing this to make himself look good to probation or something and so he can say to a future partner, “look, I can’t be that bad, we’re friends now!”
No, just no
As a person who's tried to clean up their past and get right with people they've wronged, I just want to say, thank you on their behalf for even considering it. I'm sure it can be scary for them to even pop up from the past especially if you've moved on.

That said, you are under no obligation. Receiving a letter (ideally without divulging your address, through a mutual friend etc.)  is perfectly fine. If they react negatively to the suggestion then they're probably not ready anyway. 

Side note. Family member was approached for an amends about a decade after terrible thing happened to them. Asked me what I thought and said they'd feel guilty if the other person got messed up again. My advice to them was same as to you: if you think it will be harmful to you in any way, just skip it. They don't get to save their ass at your expense and besides there are built in contingency plans if a person who was harmed doesn't want to see the person trying to get sober.
I wouldn't recommend it. =( I have been through this. My attempted murderer is dead, but this will only A) open up all the old wounds you worked so hard to heal and B) Give him access to you to harm you further.
I wouldn't do it.  12-step programs have step 9 where you have to do amends for stuff back when you were using or whatever.  As the injured party you have zero responsibility to let this jerk clear his conscience by sharing the air you'd both be breathing.
Anything he has to say to you can be said to your lawyer. I would get a no contact restraining order and a dependable firearm. 

NAL
Sorry to hear of your trauma and hope you are on your road to healing with therapy. Are you ready to meet the person who hurt you so much? If you still harbour anger towards him, you are not ready at this time. Remember this is about you now... He may be doing his own recovery through his own personal demons, but think of yourself here. Yes it may open old wounds, but it may also provide closure for the emotional pain that has carried on long past the physical pain. He may be in a different place now and is likely not a threat to you anymore. You have every right to hate him for what he did, and his penance to you will say that as much. If he is reaching out to apologize for how much he hurt you, he means it. Are you ready?

For what it's worth, you could also connect via video link. You don't have to meet in person if you still are fearful of your safety from him.
If it will help you in any way, then meet him, but do it for yourself, not for him.
If it gives you closure do it, if not don’t
I agree with everyone saying you don't owe him shit. But I also believe in the idea that sometimes these things can help victims heal. In Rwanda there have been programs where there was sociotherapy in groups of victims of the genocide together with the people who committed it (after their return from prison), and this has allowed a lot of them to move forward with their lives. If you feel inside that this is what you want, hear him out. You can always decide to walk away if you change your mind.
Personally, it sounds like you need to hear him say the words. Nowhere does it say that you HAVE to meet with him in person to do it. I would personally suggest that you find a mutual person have them call you and put him on speaker phone that way you get your apology and you can hopefully move on
Sorry, but all the advice that people are giving you is cowardly and one sided. 

Whatever you decide to do is perfectly fine.  Don't let anyone tell you that either decision is wrong.  I would personally consider accepting his apology, as it might actually help you close a door.

But only you can gauge your own trauma, and you don't know this person very well, so you don't know what kind of an apology to expect, and whether it will reignite the old trauma and anger that you've had. 

Either way, don't do anything out of pressure   There's no bad decision as long as you're comfortable making one.
My gut says no, you shouldn't meet in person. BUT...if you decide to (because ultimately it's your decision), you meet in a public place, and you bring someone with you for support, who can hang back and keep an eye on the situation. He can certainly put his apology in a letter, delivered by the mutual friend, but if you choose in person, this is the way to go. If you choose to forgive, it's for YOU, not for him.
In my personal opinion, in situations where the abuser is seeking to apologize in person most often than not they are looking to make themselves feel better. Not actually feeling remorse, but rather for a way to feel like they are doing the right thing and move one past their horrible actions.

He hurt you and you had to fix yourself in order to life a better quality of life. If you say no that you don’t want to meet then that is okay and not a stupid thing to do. But if they insist on seeing you in person and not accepting your boundary of no contact, just know they aren’t seeking to apologize for you, they are only thinking of themselves.
The ninth step challenges people in recovery to make amends wherever possible *except when it would cause harm*. It sounds like it has caused you some harm even by asking. He will need to learn how to deal with it by himself. You don't owe him shit. If not apologizing to you directly gets in the way of his recovery, it's his own burden to bear.
Look personally i understand the mindset of bettering yourself and part of that is realizing that the reason people do shitty things is their own traumas (IS NOT AN EXCUSE) but it helps explain a lot if behaviors and lets you know what to watch out for in psychotic people in the future. It is not your job to help fix him but if you personally need an apology have a friend who also knows the situation at the very least only busy public places, no ride shares, and there is no future attachment understand that and you have no obligations towards him.
I don't think reddit is the best place to go to for advice in regards to this.
Don't meet up with him. Only accept his apology through another person. Protect yourself.
If you think that hearing an apology might serve you well, I highly recommend talking this over with your therapist to get her expert option, especially since she knows your whole story. Perhaps it could be a letter that your therapist could read first to gauge the possible impact on you. Working a program does include making amends but only if it won't hurt the other person. Seeing this man in person could be dangerous for you, physically and/or emotionally. Tread carefully, but only you know what you need most.
You can forgive what he did, for your own good, but you don't need to force yourself to meet with him, accept an apology, it reunite with him. Honestly I wouldn't go, you just have the mutual friend's word and abusers are known for being good liars, so he might as well be using that mutual friend to get closer to you and harm you. Please get away from the mutual and from him.
I wouldn’t do it.  The apology is to ease his guilty conscience, not to help you.  Seeing him again will probably be too traumatic.
I would say at this point of your life and road you took to get better is something you should not jeopardize by any contact with that person.

Just close that chapter and move on as you already did, no need to be reopen.
He can do whatever he needs to do withou meeting you in person and you are not obligated to forgive him.  Im a firm believer in grudges and would be holding this one for dear life. He can go kick rocks
Fuck his feelings, do what you think is right for you and *you only*. If hearing his apologies can help you move on then go, if you wouldn’t bear to see his face again then don’t go.
you know what they say. "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... a fool cant get fool again"
Your healing does not require that you meet with him. I treat trauma and people get better without meeting with or interacting with the person who harmed them. 

His amends can be made many ways that do not, and should not, involve you.
The best advice I’ve ever taken is to listen to my body. Does your body feel tense or rigid at the thought of meeting up? Or does it feel a gravitational pull toward seeing them in person? Bring a friend with you if that makes you feel safe, the mutual friend may be an option, but ask yourself if you should bring someone else who may not know the situation. Only you can truly decide this, but listen to your visceral reaction.
As long as you arent sscared, hear the apology out.  Decide if you do forgive him and dont ever let him near you or speak to you again
Tbh while I haven't dealt with this level of a situation, but I was surprised when someone years later apologized for pain they have inflicted on me. I did not expect how good it actually felt. I never wanted the apology or anything from this person. It wasn't about me forgiving. I deserved the apology. I deserved to be heard. That was all.

It's very hard to forsee whether or not it will help you or not. 

All I can say is that I wouldn't meet him alone. Only go if you want something for yourself. Don't do it for his peace. If you want to say what's on your mind, you can say it. You can say how many years you have struggled. You can say what it did to you. You can cry. 

Do not do it for him. Say what's on your heart. Don't think you have to accept his apology. Do it only if it feels right. Not as a goal.
I would tell him to go fuck himself
It seems you feel the in-person apology might help you.  If that is the case, be sure you bring someone along just in case there is a problem.  Make sure you meet in a very public place such as a coffee shop.  Good luck whatever you decide to do.
You don't have to do anything. Not forgiving someone who nearly beat you to death (not exactly an accidental act) doesn't make you a bad or weak person. It's not up to you to now help him in any way. I don't personally think such apologies are for you but for them. You owe him nothing. Also I think it's best you move on with your life and leave him to move on with his. I could understand it if it was accidental... But beating someone is not exactly something you do by accident. It's up to you... Only you can know what's best for you. Just don't worry about his wellbeing... He'll be absolutely fine no matter what. It's you you need to worry about. Nobody else
This is up to you to decide if you want to meet him but if you do make sure that you do it in a place that you feel comfortable and protected. He can apologize over zoom with the face to face satisfaction. Make sure that you want to do this and feel safe doing it. A letter or call can give the same level of closure. It takes a lot to try and forgive someone for this kind of crime and I think your doing something a lot of people would struggle with. Wishing you the best.
I think first and foremost, you are incredibly strong. Not only to make it out on the other end, but to even be able to conteplate, allowing him to apologize. I always commend people like that. People who can forgive even when being wronged so bad. 

Id do whatever my heart tells me. If you feel like it would benifit you, go for it. I couldn't
Unpopular opinion... To my understanding... If you don't do what you feel is right... You will regret it. 
You're not crazy.... Or any more less than anyone else... 
I feel like you want to see that the person has changed so they don't do it to someone else. 5 years in prison is a lot of reflection time. 
It's a form of restorative justice which studies have shown are more effective than just punishment alone. . You want what's best for the person because you know that's what's best for anyone who has to interact with them in the future. I feel you also would want the chance to apologize if you were in their shoes.. we all create lessons for ourselves and I prey we all learn from this interaction. 
You have 100 percent my support no matter what you choose. Protect yourself how ever you feel you need to. And do what you feel is right
To understand all is to forgive all.
If you want him to apologize to you in person, than go for it, if you're safe in going so. If you don't want to, then don't hesitate to say no. Nothing wrong with being like F that guy. Maybe it would be better for him to know some things are unforgivable and you don't get a clean slate.
I'm a strong believer in forgiving people for almost anything, ESPECIALLY if they served their time and learned their lesson

Obviously it was a very traumatizing experience for you, but it seems like he might genuinely be trying to be better

I grew up around a few people that had drinking problems and unless you've seen it that close you don't really understand how much was out of their control

Personally getting a letter or something similar does nothing to me cause it's just words on paper, so if you really are interested in closing this chapter I would recommend meeting him in a public place with that mutual friend just so if you see that you're not actually ready to meet him you'll have an easy exit
Letting someone apologise is always the right thing  to do. You don't have to accept it if you don't want to. I'd recommend asking him for a written apology but if you meet him take a friend.
Forgiveness is meant for you, it's not for him to elevate his own guilt for the choices and decisions that he's made. You don't ever have to let him or anyone know if and or when you forgive him because forgiveness is something for you and you alone. You don't owe him or anyone anything. I hope you make the right choice for you and nobody else but you in this situation. Good luck!!!!!
I think if it is going to be performed under literal lock and key supervision what’s there to lose? Some gas and maybe your time? I don’t believe you can forgive someone without them apologizing first and if this is something that would help rehabilitate them to prevent further harm then fuck it you know. If this individual wants to apologize in person part of that is you being able to express your feelings and lived experience back at them, it isn’t like you walk in he says sorry bro and that’s it. I think you having that outlet to talk to your assailant would also be therapeutic for you most importantly! I say do it homie!
I could understand if it was a DUI that nearly killed you and got him locked up.  But something as long and interpersonal as beating you up?  Someone who put that much time and energy into hurting me really badly?  I wouldn’t feel comfortable even knowing he’s out, let alone meeting up in person.

A point I have not yet seen: IT’S POSSIBLE YOU COULD END UP TRIGGERING HIM TOO, especially if he sees you as the catalyst for anything he endured as a result of his conviction.  I’d argue that alone makes it physically, if not emotionally, unsafe for both of you.

If you’re still torn about seeing him, I recommend testing the waters with written communication.  It’s an objectively safer way to see if you’re comfortable with his presence & allows him to critically prepare his thoughts without getting carried away.

I’d also have a long talk with this mutual friend.  Passing on anything about you, including your location, without your permission to someone who tried to KILL you is so many levels of not ok.  And, since it’s through one of his friends, it’s possible that his “apology” is absolute bullshit & there’s something more sinister at play.  

I don’t think you’re a bad person for considering it.  Sounds like you have a good, kind heart.  Just don’t let that goodness become a liability.
Follow your instincts & those of your therapist. Don't let anyone else convince you anything that undermines what your heart & guts tell you is "right". Neither is objectively the correct choice.

Restorative justice is *powerful* & undervalued in western society/ online. I truly believe all criminal justice should include communication like this whenever possible (so long as it's safe for all parties).
Hard pass.
That you have a mutual friend makes this a weird encounter, why is that person friends with someone who almost killed you? 

In my view, he can write an apology that you can choose to read or not. I wouldn't want to see him.

It's your decision.
Do not meet with him. He can apologize via letter, an in-person meeting is strictly for him, because he thinks you won't be able to refuse to forgive him in person. 

WTF does he have to say in person that he can't send in a letter? Personally, I would be very unlikely to forgive him or to respond in any way. 

I think that *oh, forgive hime for yourself!* is bullshit dreamed up by abusers and enablers. I can **move on** without forgiving someone.
If you want to do it and think it might help, do it. Just do it in a public place. 
Just make sure you think through how the apology will make you feel. If it’ll help, go for it
Would it be possible for your mutual friend to be there for the apology? If not, ask that he write it in a letter
I've never understood the forgive them for yourself thing. I get letting go of anger but I don't understand the rest. 


If you feel like this is the best thing for you then do it but you don't owe him your time or attention. He wants to apologize to ease the burden of his sins on himself not because of any other reason If he's working the program. You do not owe him any piece of mind or sentiment of peace unless you decide you want that for him. 

Personally - for the sins I've committed in my own life, I don't ask for forgiveness, I don't assume anyone would give it, and the bad feelings of guilt and shame will be q constant vigilant reminder to become better than before. 

Yes I do still apologize for the things I've done but not for the other party to ease my own guilt as I don't believe in that.

Anyway I'm a firm believer "in do what thou wilst" 

If anyone wants to attempt to explain this forgiveness thing where I might actually understand it other than "i don't want to think about it anymore" or "I want this person back in my life" it makes literally no sense.


Sins in this context I'm using is being used as a replacement word for transgressions, hurtful actions/ words/,  being a deeply hurt person and taking it out on others et al.
I'm not sure this is a one sized fits all question/answer. I think some would be served by meeting, others by getting something in writing, and others by removing all aspects from their life. I think a counselor could help you figure out which might be the best and healthiest approach for you. Speaking for myself, if it was just me he hurt, and not someone I loved, I would 'consider it', maybe after verifying his progress.
Do what feels right for just you. A lot of people are saying not to meet, but as another highly empathetic person I think I understand where you’re coming from.

I would be wary of putting expectations on a meeting though, it may go differently than you expect, if that doesn’t feel okay then it might be too much of a risk.

I don’t think you’re being dumb or naive by considering it though, and depending on who you are it may be a positive experience.

Just make sure whatever you choose to do it safely and with your own well-being as the foremost consideration.

Best of luck.
Get a restraining order
Maybe he wants to murder you and it’s just a trap for him to do that.  He knows he could go to prison, but maybe he has little money and for him it’s better to be in prison than to starve on the street with nothing to eat.  Even a phone call or letter could give him information to find where you are.
Your only question is "will this help me"? If yes then think about doing it.

If the answer is No, or even just dunno. Then there is no upside to being near this person ever again.

As far as right thing to do. Again for who? For him? Fuck him he gets no consideration at all. If its for you then see my previous statements.

take care and good luck
Look…at its heart, the act of him apologizing is for him…while you forgiving is for you.  Those are two separate things.

There is literally nothing he can do that will make up for the trauma he put you through, and most of us could never, ever understand what you had to go through during and after his acts.

Most importantly…you owe him nothing.  That needs to be abundantly clear.

With that in mind…I suggest focusing on what this means for the future.

A meeting is largely symbolic.  He can apologize from afar.  You can forgive without seeing him.  But doing it in person, the visceral nature of it is harder…but also, the effects are more powerful internally.  That’s why he’s asking for it.  The question you should ask is…what benefit will you get from it?  Is that benefit going to be there for you, too?

There is a secondary consideration as well: your appearance could help convince him that it is worthwhile to live better going forward, to stay sober.  Many felons are never allowed to get past what they did by society, and that can lead to an ongoing cycle.  It’s ambiguous, but you meeting him could help break that cycle…

But focus on yourself first.  You owe it to yourself first to take care of your mental health.  Only once you decide that there is a benefit to you, or at least no harm, should you consider what it means for him.

Again, I have no idea how to equate that based on what you’ve been through, and I can’t tell you what’s right for you.  But you aren’t misguided in your thoughts.  Talk to trusted loved ones or therapists, and make the decision for you.

Best of luck in whatever you choose.
Mine tried to be friends with me after... I told him I had no interest in being friends with him but I hope he got the help he desperately needed 

YOU OWE HIM NOTHING. His recovery doesn't rely on you or him making a mess to you because it also says you need to be prepared not everyone will want to hear it or will forgive you

In recovery we say "grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change , the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.
I really respect how thoughtful you're being. To the extent that I have any advice it would be to really think through all of the possible scenarios, including emotionally. Like what if he implies it was your fault? What if he reminds you of a detail you didn't remember or tells you something you didn't know? What if he gives you a new perspective on the event (which of course he saw through different eyes), would that be upsetting? What if he is an even bigger jerk than you imagined? Hopefully thinking through all the options would allow you to make a decision that you feel good about long term. Making a pros and cons list can help you see what all the variables are on both sides. Once you identify the most important factors, something I do is try to reach a place where I think "I'd rather live with This set of problems than That set of problems." Then even if it turns out that I've made a decision that led to problems, remembering how carefully I thought it through has kept me from blaming myself for what I was going through.

Then if you make the decision to see him or read his apology, I would consider what support you'll need. An extra therapy session? A day off of work? A funny movie? Friends who are ready to listen? 

Good luck and I'm sorry you're grappling with this. I think forgiveness can be powerful, but doing it in a way where you're protected from curve balls could be best.
Please don't endanger yourself.

You don't have to hate a dog turd but you are also not obliged to step in it.
It’s up to you, but that’s pretty humbling to want to eat crow and ask for forgiveness of someone that you wronged. I’m sure he’s very embarrassed for his state of mind and is very sorry? He is either haunted by his decisions and remorse that he wants the relief of apologizing and perhaps getting your forgiveness, or he feels that what he did against you was so egregious that you deserve a proper apology maybe it’s both. 

It might be healing for you. Maybe just have him write a letter. Then you can keep it or throw it in the trash, depending on how it benefited you.
He can write a letter or do a video chat if you'd like but you don't have to do anything that you don't want to make him feel better
The fourth step of any twelve step treatment program, and a huge step of any treatment program that takes some other format is making amends.  The *biggest* aspect of this is that

SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T EVER APOLOGIZE FOR AND WILL HURT THE OTHER PERSON BY CONTACTING THEM

If you have to ask you probably aren't ready.  If this guy has tried to talk to your mutual friend correctly but you didn't understand, cool, forgive him for that 2027 or something, but back out right now.  NO is a complete sentence.

If this explanation clicks with you have an honest discussion with yourself if you are ready right now.  Take control of the timeline.  This is about YOU so make sure it's healing.
No. "In person"?  
They are doing it for themselves, so they can feel better.   
If you want it, that is different.
Really bad idea. Don't let him start manipulating you and I bet this is exactly what he'll do.  Him apologizing to you would be for HIM (to make him feel better) not you. Don't fall for it or any BS that comes out of his mouth,
Sounds like they're in AA or NA. Making amends is a part of their process. I've been on the receiving end of amends twice now, and both times it honestly felt like it was completely for the other person. If it takes someones life collapsing into itself for them to muster up an apology to others, they probably don't really mean it and they're doing it for themselves. Up to you if you want to indulge them.



I know some people making their amends are truly trying to right wrongs, but pessimistic me wouldn't waste your time.
Accepting his apology may very well help you in your forgiveness process. Having your therapist read it first as another commentor said is a great idea. 

I can't help but think meeting in person - even moderated by therapists/friends - is not in your best interest. Only you can decide. Talk it over with your therapist and arrange to read the letter with your therapist present. For that particular appointment, please have a friend drive you.
"Also, being willing to allow him to give the apology feels like it would be the right thing to do. I'm not saying I'm a fuckin saint or anything but I feel like if he's actually trying to better himself that maybe helping him would help me."

I think it comes down to what would be best for YOU. It is commendable that he wants to make amends for his past mistakes but it should not come at the expense of your mental health. If you feel it has the potential for damage, he can always write a letter. If you think this might also help YOU to move past this experience and finally find peace/let go of what happened..then go for it. 

No need to make a decision overnight.
Anyone telling you to behave a certain way is missing the point. 

This all boils down to what you want. That's it. No other factor matters.
Actually, not only does he owe you an apology, but he needs to make amends with you. I find that a lot of people settle for "sorrys" ... but people aren't really trying to make amends these days. Why? Probably because it requires actual effort and actions other than saying "sorry." 

That's just my two cents though.

If all you need is an apology then go for it, but have no expectations and if thats all you truly need in order to "move on" then so be it.
I don't think you should agree to meet him. You don't owe him a face-to-face apology just so he can feel better about himself. Have him write one; you don't need to read it.
It's understandable to feel conflicted about meeting him. Reflect on your feelings and intentions—are you seeking closure or simply trying to help him? If you decide to meet, set clear boundaries to ensure your comfort and safety. Having a trusted friend or therapist available afterward can also be helpful. Remember, forgiveness is a personal journey; it’s about freeing yourself from anger, not absolving him of his actions. Trust yourself to make the choice that feels right for your healing process.
If you are going to Talk have your Lawyer and Therapist there and talk online.  Also, Record the communication.

Him wanting to Apologize to a "Live" version of your does not mean it has to be "Live and in person."
What does your Therapist say?  If your Therapy is on board with this, perhaps ask if you can meet him at their office. That way you have a Mediator (on your side) to make sure this doesn’t go sideways for you.

Think it can be therapeutic to face down the “demon” but only if you truly feel strong enough to do this and it’s in a safe situation (public with back-up, preferably with your Therapist).
Why, in the name of Christ, would he insist on meeting you in person?

For all the people he hurt before you, and all the ones he'll probably hurt later, dont meet with him. Don't let him feel better.

May he find peace find his peace the same way he tried to make you find yours.
You don’t need to accept his amend. The point is just for him to try to make it so he can take responsibilities for his actions. He can send you a letter or email instead if you don’t wanna see him and you have no obligation to actually read it. Writing it is for his healing not yours, so you don’t need to ever look at it if you don’t wanna.
Absolutely not! He is doing this only to make himself feel better, not you. Don't do it.
Surely he has to be prepared for the possibility that you may want nothing to do with him or his apology, it is your call but I think the letter idea sounds correct, you can either read it or not, I have been through these 12 step things as the apologizer and luckily everyone I apologized to were just happy I sobered up, but I luckily never committed such a brutal act, and for that I am truly thankful, I truly hope you can get some form of closure and peace of mind.
The question you need to ask yourself is how you will feel if it turns out his apology is either insincere or meant only to make himself feel better with no regard to you, how it will make you feel, and helping you to move forward. Unfortunately it seems like a lot of these “apologies” are done to make the perpetrator feel better about themselves, rather than helping their victim in any meaningful way. And in doing that, they actually re-traumatize their victim, who may have already moved on but now finds themselves sitting back in their anger. 

If hearing this guy’s apology will possibly lead to you backtracking in your recovery, I wouldn’t do it. If it won’t, and you’re feeling generous, then maybe.  Just know that either way, this is not about you, it’s about him, and you have zero obligation to him.
He wants to put you in the position of accepting the apology, and then saying it's ok.

Do you want to do that?

Do you want to hear his story?
Listening to all these responses and not discussing it with a counselor is your first mistake. You have to do what is right for you.
Because I've seen "restorative justice" mentioned a few times, I think it's well worth mentioning that these are **facilitated encounters,** with trained professionals involved. 

Further, the person seeking forgiveness generally completes a course/program before meeting with their victim. 

It's not a DIY project (speaking of restorative justice specifically).
You know how when people are enraged at someone and they say “I just wanna talk”? They do not just want to talk. Do with that what you will. Stay safe.
Do not meet him, get a restraining order and forget about him. He can live with his fuck up
I’m not going to weigh in on whether or not you should do it, but I will say that a local police officer might be willing to be present if you need someone at the meeting for safety reasons. My brother was stealing from my dad and he finally decided to kick him out of the house and they asked for a police officer to be present just in case and they agreed. I didn’t know you could ask for that. Probably it’s not a common thing but maybe worth asking
Sometimes it actually does make you feel better to hear the person who wronged you actually say they did it, and that they are sorry. It is not something that always makes you feel better, sometimes it makes you feel worse.

Also, if you do let this person formally apologise, you do not have to forgive them. You might want to. Some people find they are more able to move on with life, but others it’s not healing at all.

Do you attend any kind of therapy yourself? Like a trauma group? This might be one of those senarios where talking through your options with others who have experienced trauma/ violence can give you some insight.
Forgiveness is not giving up your right to boundaries that keep you safe. You don't owe him a chance to make amends. 


You can forgive and never see him again. He is not allowed to put the burden of his repentance on you. 
It’s kind of easy to say “id pass” coming from a position that this did not happen to us. But i have been through horrors of my own, nothing like this though, and i know it is nowhere near that simple. 

I think the best thing to do is make sure whatever decision you make is not impulsive. Thinking about it for just a moment here, i can easily imagine how even seeing their face may help. It’s inherently obvious to everyone without the experience that it may hurt. But really considering that this actually happened and the amount of pain you’re in… i can easily see it being healing.

When shit happens to us and we remove people from our lives, we all can build this sort of mystery in our minds of what they are doing and who they are. It can be torturous. Just even wondering. 

It’s weird to say, but someone who did something awful to us can have such an effect that they are on our minds as much as any healthy relationship we have. Allowing ourselves to actually know the person later, hear them speak… especially an apology could give us whatever moment we have built in our heads that we may need. Whether it’s to flip shit and never forgive them, or to stand there stoic and strong and basically unmoved… or to even forgive them. 

When the pain is that great, the remedy usually involves some pain or risk. We don’t usually notice because they knock us out for surgeries and such… but most of the time the remedy involves a little more pain. 

That being said, still be smart. It’s definitely a gamble. Perhaps having a mediator or therapist on hand for written apologies or in person would be best. Such as, if you decide to go in person, have a professional there to go in that room first to talk with him and find out his mental state and if it may be riskier than worthwhile. 

It’s a damn tough question. And i’m sorry this happened and is still happening. I hope whatever you do helps. A lot. Truly.
I can't tell you what will give you closure or a sense of security but as for me there is NOTHING someone like that could ever say that I need to hear. In fact I would be inclined to think the apology is more for their conscience and their peace of mind and I would absolutely deny them that.
I don't think you're misguided for thinking about it. Someone who hurt me asked to make amends by apologizing for the things they had done. I gave them the release from the sin but frankly didn't care. I didn't want to continue dealing with their efforts to earn my forgiveness and I also didn't want to be a hindrance to their path to being a better human. So I allowed it, accepted their apology and closed the chapter. They didn't really change all that much tbh. I wouldn't see this individual in person if I were you. A letter would suffice and I would also not feel compelled to respond either.
If it's not safe to meet him in person, do not do so.

You do not owe him anything.

If you really want to meet him in person make sure it is in a public place and take someone with you.
You owe him nothing, the only person you owe is yourself....

..to live contently, productively, to enjoy the love and nurturing that is natural to the human experience. 

If after such time you feel that he has nurtured himself, and if under such circumstances you may even find it helpful to live, then by all means entertain such LETTERS.
I would say do it in person but bring a fire arm and have it very obviously holstered on your body and just calmly let it sit there and don't fidget or put your hand on it. Have it as a visual deterrent and nothing more.
You could do it two ways one if you meet him in person have somebody there for support and back up the other thing is you can set up a FaceTime video call that have them apologize to you if you do not want to meet him in person I also heard that he could write you a letter of apology and you reply backI’m sorry this happened to you and I’m glad that you were in a better place in getting the help that you need.
Here is my take on it.  If you want to meet face to face, do this when you have time with your therapist there.  The reason I say this is so you have the space to process with them what was said, and you don’t spiral.  Best of luck when it happens OP.
You don’t owe him anything. I say move on with your life and try to forget his existence.
Think about how this will impact your life specifically.

Have you moved on, are you well adjusted, etc? You don’t owe him or anyone else anything. Play out all the different scenarios in your head. One where they make excuses and offer non apologies, another where he’s a combative pos, one where it’s perfect for you. Then play out as many more scenes as you can. You don’t need to have contact with him to do this and it’s a forgiveness exercise for you. Them wanting to reach out to you, I’m a skeptical jaded bitch, feels selfish. He could have given your mutual friend a letter, but didn’t. 

You can forgive people and move on by yourself. I’m sorry you went through something so violent and violating. Please do what’s best for you.
Hell nah. Mf can post it on YouTube and I'll watch it later.
I don’t pretend to be an expert on the kind of hurt and suffering you experienced but the whole restorative resolutions movement is built on what you have described and I know from people who have gone thru the program that, if done well, it can be an incredibly healing and restorative process. I have a  friend whose brother was murdered in a really awful way (not that there is a good way to be murdered but this way was especially hard for her to live with as it involved knowing that her brother suffered before he died). She said that the lack of remorse from the people who did it added layers of pain on top of the pain for her and her family.  I also know someone in our community who murdered someone, went to prison, came to terms w what he had done and, thru the restorative process, met w and apologized to his victim’s daughter. It brought them both healing that one would never think possible and it led to some really awesome changes in our community. This man spent his remaining days serving inmates, victims of violent crimes, and their families and the daughter of the man he killed attended, spoke at and cried at his funeral. It is hard to understand and yet…

I am not suggesting your attacker is like this man or that you should feel compelled to meet w him. If, however, you feel that there may be something healing in it for you don’t necessarily dismiss it because it seems implausible.  

Follow your heart. Do what you need to do in order to protect yourself and your healing process….but don’t rule out the unconventional because it seems counterintuitive. Also don’t let yourself get pressured into something you don’t want to do. 

I am sorry for the pain you have been through and wish you all the best for your healing journey.
I got a written apology from my abuser and I can tell you that it was very healing to get it and it helped me a lot. Not with forgiveness because I do not believe I need to forgive but I did need to be able to let it go. It doesn’t have to poison my life anymore and I let go of the anger which made me feel better. I doubt I would have ever been willing to meet in person though and they have no right to expect that from you. You owe them nothing. Letting go enabled me to move on with my life and heal emotionally.
Don’t force yourself to forgive them. Let them rot. They almost ended your life.
Yeah, he can send me a letter if he wants. If he comes near me I'm taking it as a threat lol
Nope nope nope nope nope apologize to Jesus.
True forgiveness comes from a point of strength.  You're not there. 


Let him write a letter.
No man, don't be a fool, stay away.

If you have to have to come on this board to ask for permission then you are not ready and you may never be but that is okay, it's your life we are talking about.

You had many chances to visit the guy while he was in prison, confined and in a secure place. But something in your gut kept you away.

This apology stuff is part of his story not yours, you don't owe him a damn thing.

Good luck.
I can’t say for sure about him but I know some people apologize for selfish reasons. They aren’t actually remorseful for what they did but they want their consciousness to be cleared. And you don’t owe him that.
Given your clarifications: It seems you have the right mindset on this - just because it's likely he wants to face you directly for his own benefit, it doesn't mean it *can't* help you too. Sometimes confronting it directly can be the best thing, as it can provide a more tangible closure on your history.

But remember that you owe him nothing - if what's best for him isn't what's best for you, there are other options. For example, as others have said, he could write a letter directly to you (checked over by someone you trust before it gets into your hands). If that's better for you, propose that.

However, if you're sure that you're doing it for yourself, and it would give you that closure you want, meet him in a public place during the day, and have your friend with you to approach him first and make sure everything is on the level. Even if you have no reason to doubt him, having that will avoid even potential problems, and put whatever lingering doubts you still have to rest. Plan to keep it brief - it's an opportunity to say what you want to say, close the book, and part ways for good. Nothing more, nothing less.
Personally I wouldn't. Maybe a phone conversation would be okay. I don't think I'd be comfortable being in the same space as someone who did that to me. You know yourself better than anyone here though.
Personally I'd pass myself because that wouldn't mean shit to me and you don't know if there's another motive. But if you decide you need it have that meeting like at the police station or sheriffs office and make sure they know what's going on beforehand.
I understand why you feel a need to hear him out. I think if you choose to go through with it you shouldn't go alone and it should be in a public place. Be careful not to reopen your wounds in doing this. You're a good guy for even considering putting yourself in this situation. Keep your safety in mind and be cautious.
Just the thought of meeting up with my ex abuser - seeing his face, hearing his voice in real time - makes my skin crawl.

I understand the need to make amends, I’m a friend of Bill’s, too. It’s perfectly acceptable to request that he write a letter instead of meeting face to face. If he is working the steps correctly and truly wants sobriety, he will have no problem with that request. 

It took over 15 years to accept intensive treatment therapy, but that treatment ultimately saved me more so than regular therapy sessions. In hindsight, for my mental health, treatment was needed before moving onto casual therapy. But I worked through his trauma, truly accepting and truly letting him and that trauma go for good. It’s hard but when it was lifted I truly felt free. 
I just wanted to share that part of my journey with you, so you know help is available. 

You are what’s most important in this story -What’s best for you and your mental health. You’ve made progress in healing and I’m afraid it would only hinder your recovery from him. 

I’m praying for your healing and strength in this time.
My only question is do you want an apology? I know he wants to apologize, but fuck him. It’s not about him. You were the victim here. Would you like an apology? If so, accept it as graciously as you feel prepared to do. If not, he can continue to fuck off.
If it serves you some kind of healing that I think you should find a safe space for you to have it take place.  ONLY IF IT IS YOUR WISH!!!  You owe him nothing, if it will harm your healing leaving you alone can be his amends.  Please do what is best for yourself.💕💕
Tell him you meet up but you wanna throw the ones up believe me it will take all that pain out your soul
You were the victim of his violence and OWE HIM **NOTHING**. Whatever you choose to do, let it be for YOU and no one else.
Bring a big fuckin dude with you as backup to the meeting.
Please don’t do in person. Tell him you’re willing to accept something written he wants to give you, but that’s it. I wish you the best.
Since you feel like you’d like it and he wants to give it, then it sounds like a good idea. You don’t owe him anything, so if you would rather not listen, that would be equally ok. Forgiveness doesn’t require you to do anything except set down your anger and move past it. But honestly, it sounds like two people had an awful encounter and have since learned a lot about life. I think it’s beautiful if you can close this circle. Take care.
If you think an apology would serve you well... idk... I'd say go for it.
Zoom?
Imo,: 
Meet in your therapist office. 
Your heart may say let him apologize, but your brain when you see him might bring up triggers.  That way, you're in a very safe environment with a therapist. 
I wish you good luck. And may your new path be continued healing.
The one thing that you need to keep in mind is that the apologies has to be for you and not for him to make himself feel better for being a shitty human. 

Everything that this has come to is and should always be about if you need the apology and if it will do YOU any good, his feelings have nothing to do with any of it here.

Do what's right for you and the rest will follow.
I would never in my whole life get even close to someone that this to me, that’d be my personal choice
First off, I'm sorry that happened to you. I hope you are in good physical health and I hope that you are on the right path  emotionally.

I will be upfront and say that I am not expert in any therapeutic field and have never dealt with a situation like this. So if you don't want to hear from me, fair enough, don't read the rest. 

Forgiving others is extremely important for moving on with our lives. It keeps us from building up resentment or hatred that could potentially affect other aspects of our lives. So I would say, if you can find it in yourself to do so, yes, forgive this person. I see in your post that you feel bad for him, this is a good sign. It shows that you at least have a desire for him to be a changed man, and to be better. When we don't forgive people, we are only keeping them within the category of their faults, and barring the possibility of improvement. Both parties need to be able to forward without being defined by one bad incident.

HOWEVER! Forgiveness does not equal trust. We need to be prudent in these matters. This man assaulted you, and you only have his word to go by. If you're leaning towards a physical gesture of forgiveness, as I've seen others suggest, an exchange of letters would suffice. If you are seriously considering meeting him in person, be cautious. Meet in a public place, bring a couple friends to keep an eye on you, and it wouldn't hurt to have an exit strategy. Even assuming an in person exchange goes well, recognize boundaries, so if he wants to meet again, calmly say that you both should move on, and that the past is behind you both.
Personally, I wouldn’t do it. I’ve had a few friends who in similar situations who wanted closure, or to let them apologize, and bottom line is things went… poorly. Very poorly. If you really want to let him apologize, the best thing to do would be to do so over zoom, through a letter, NEVER IN PERSON. In case of the Zoom, having someone sit in the room would be best as if things go south, they’d have the clarity of mind to shut down the laptop. 
I know it’s not a DV case. But I’d like to tell you a story.


My ex wife was abusive on all levels (sexually, physically, emotionally and financially). I actually just got out of the financial hole after 5 years. My credit is barely starting to recover. The emotional, physical and sexual scars are mostly healed but it took a lot of therapy (and I’m back in therapy actually due to a recent relationship rekindling the pain of my marriage due to similar behaviors by my partner).

I was consumed with anger. I used to wish that I had just let my ex wife end herself one of the times she threatened to (it was a manipulation tactic) because the pain and humiliation she caused me still haunts me (and I lost a good 90% of my friends because despite being a victim of DV somehow as a man I was still blamed by people)

Then one day I decided she wasn’t with the pain anymore. I haven’t even forgiven her for what she did I just chose to move on. It was an active decision to “let it go” so to speak. And my life has been so much better.


You don’t HAVE to forgive anyone. You don’t HAVE to let someone do something to ease THEIR conscience.

They made the decisions to almost kill you. They did what they did. YOU suffered. So while someone may say “you should forgive them because it will help you” or “it will bring you peace” fuck thems they didn’t live your life and if you truly need to have them apologize for YOU to move on then great. Let them.

But don’t let ANYONE tell you that YOU need to do anything for the person that harmed you. They can live with their own guilt forever. Because it will pale in comparison to the pain they caused you.

They always say “you can forgive but don’t forget” but one thing I learned is you can forgive and forget…you can forgive and not forget…OR you can not forgive and just forget about them because they didn’t give a shit about how their actions would impact you…so why are they even worth remembering? Why is the impact of their actions on themselves something YOU need to deal with?


This ain’t something WE can decide for YOU op…but I wanted to offer a perspective most won’t but my therapist agreed with at one point (she even laughed because she didn’t think of it but thought it wasn’t a bad thing because I was able to move forward and grow as a person)
If you do meet in person please take someone with you to a busy place and have him leave first
If you decide to meet in person, please bring a friend along with you for support.
If it helps you, or you think it will ... Do it. But just to think it will help only the beater... Don't.
Okay so I would ask your therapist what they think. Would this be therapeutic to you? is this the right time? What are the pros and cons or what kind of negative impact could this have on me? Type of thing.

Then also check with your therapist to see if it would be best to do this either in office with them present or meet your therapist right after if your therapist thanks meeting face-to-face with this person would be a good idea.

Also if your therapist says a face-to-face meeting is a no-go at this point maybe see if he'd be willing to write his apology. That way he can still give you the apology and you can either read it, not read it, or wait until your therapist says you're ready and read it at that time. Hell your therapist could say just set it on fire possibly. No matter what you do though loop in your therapist.
I’d let him apologize and tell him I appreciate it but don’t accept it. See how much he’s really changed.
Op, it seems like you want to meet with him. I support you doing that. Maybe it could make you feel better.
It's your choice to forgive him or not. I generally preach unconditional forgiveness, but not unconditional reconciliation (except with loved ones--with a very small handful of exceptions, basically cheating, refusal to change, physical abuse, more than extremely isolated emotional abuse)

Are you meeting him in private without anyone else around? That sounds unsafe. Perhaps a very public space and a concealed firearm can make it better.

I imagine it will be very difficult for you on your emotions, you will probably feel immense fear. Brace for a lot of emotions to come at once if you do do it.

However, it could also go well, it could help give you closure you need. Don't view this as helping him--he should be doing it to try and help you, and you should be doing it to try and also help you.

I think it's worth a try, but just be prepared for it to potentially emotionally backfire on you. However, don't expect that as a guarantee, either. It's good that he is trying to change himself--proof of change and atonement is often, at least for me, so healing that I hardly have any hurt left afterwards. For others this may be different, but I find it helps me immensely to hear and have proof of improvement.
Genuinely.
For your safety.
And In general, there is no reason to meet in person.

Even if they would like to make amends directly, use technology. FaceTime or video call. They're is literally no reason to meet in person.

That's it.
Forgiveness is highly overrated. Not everything deserves to be forgiven. If it helps YOU, that’s fine. But don’t forgive out of pressure from others. Especially the one that attempted to murder you. 

I would tell him to put it in writing or a video. I would NOT meet up face to face.

I’m very empathetic as well. I guess I’d ask you what if he did this to your mother, father, child or loved one? Would you be working as hard to figure out the ‘why’? Because you need to love yourself at least as much as you love others.
Here's the thing: it *might* be good to hear him sincerely apologize. Imagine he bawls his eyes out, demonstrating overwhelming remorse and expecting nothing from you in return. That might help.  

That probably won't happen.  

Maybe this guy is sincere in his efforts to become a better human, and more power to him if that is the case, but the years of *whatever he had going on* that led him to assaulting you do not disappear into the ether; his apologies will almost certainly be imperfect, his explanations may be underpinned with excuses, his communication style may be disjointed or even threatening. And that's not even getting into how his very presence might be triggering for you.  

What this really comes down to is whether or not you think you can handle it if the apology goes awry. If you think you can, I agree with you that helping him become a better person is a laudable cause.
Have him write a letter and mail to a P.O Box, if he doesn't know where you live
I wouldn't. He can write an apology. Why would you want to see some lowlife piece of shit
I’d say do it. You seem like you want to go forth past your trauma in an attempt to gain something.. 

Go for it.
I say do it! 
You have obviously done a lot of work on yourself regarding what happened and it seems like you've thought about it a lot as well. You think it will be good for you so I'd trust yourself and go for it.
Let him send a letter. Seems unsafe and triggering to see in person but I am not you.
As a sober person who has made amends let me assure you thay you're under zero obligation to have any contact with this person. What they want is immaterial.

I'd tell him to fuck off and never contact you again for any reason or in any way.
Yeah no. This is a phone call situation. Use a temporary number.
No one can answer this question aside from you. But whatever you decide to do, do it for YOU, not for them.
Listen, just my thoughts but

1. Are you feeling any sense of owing HIM relief in his guilt? If so, you dont. and thats ok
2. You are currently aware he feels shame and guilt for what he did. What specifically do you hope meeting him will give you? It sounds, to me, like a hail mary for 'idk maybe this will finally kill my hurt by him?'...which if true, id heed as a WARNING not to meet him.
3. Forgiveness is tricky. It means different things to different people, and different things depending on whether victim or perpetrator. Personally forgiveness here should be for your benefit, and NEVER at your expense.

If the answers or responses to above are

1. No
2. Yeah, sort of a hail mary
3. Sorta dont want to.

Then i say dont meet him, at least yet. You forgive him when you do...meaning when you feel you have, and in whatever capacity means the incident and this guy have no hold over you in life whatsoever. Forgiveness, in my experience (plenty of 12 step and otherwise) truly is an outcome, not labor....never a fake-it-till-you-make-it endeavor.

To me, those should be your tablestakes. Good luck!
Why give him the satisfaction of letting him apologize? So he can feel better? Fuck that no way.  You don't have to tell him shit or listen to his shit or see him to forgive him.  I would never.  He is using you to get thru some 12 step program? Fuck him.
What’s a cis het mail?
This happened to me when my ex wanted to weasel his way back in my life. You shouldn’t have to traumatize yourself again because he wants to feel better about what he did to you. You don’t need that.
 If he’s in control as you’ve depicted to us, I’d say meet up. It’s mentally beneficial to find closure in traumatic situations of the past. With that being said, meeting up doesn’t mean you’re friends or obligated to hang out. Give a farewell, then let go.
Hi… lots of comments and idk if you’ll see this one. My story is different and unfortunately I couldn’t read past the first paragraph then skim to find an actual question to respond to in this. 

You aren’t completely misguided. You also are not incredibly stupid. It might be a really bad idea. But also, you need to do things that are through the court and whatever advocate agent or whatever DV support you have as far as literal agencies go. You deserve an apology. And, in some ways, I mean if he does his rights, he is in some ways owed one. But it’s a slippery slope, I’m experiencing it myself right now, and you have to ensure your prioritizing your safety and serenity more than his ‘right’ to fix his wrongs. 
My DMs are open. 

-sincerely, a girl who was strangled and blackened too
Apologizing to someone is about admitting to yourself, and letting ​that person know, that you have accepted responsibility for harming them. It's awesome if they are willing to forgive you, but they aren't under any obligation to do so.

OP, the fact that you're so uncomfortable with potentially meeting this person for their apology, that you've come to strangers on the internet for advice, shows me that you shouldn't meet them face to face. You can accept their apology without meeting them in person again. You can also choose to not accept their apology. If this party is truly trying to make amends, they will respect whichever reaction yo​u​​ ​g​i​v​​e​ ​t​h​​e​m​. 

If they have certain expectations that they expect you to conform to, they aren't actually remorseful. They're looking for validation.​​​​
Is this an AA thing? Or a correctional services restorative justice  oriented program ???
An apology will only Serve HIM not you. Do not give him the opportunity
Being in his presence could trigger deep seeded emotions that you aren't able to control, so it would be like gambling.

I personally think it's way too risky to wager your inner peace for whatever you might stand to gain in this scenario.

Peace be with you.
He’ll feel way better about himself if he gets to apologise.
You gave validation (an apology) to someone who willingly wanted to harm you? If anything you should apologize to yourself. The idea of forgiveness while acknowledging the wrong is questionable because a narcissist will ALWAYS seek attention from their victims 100% of the time. Considering you used the words “nearly killed me” should you only acknowledge that this person will have to and should have to live with there actions. That’s without an apology. Also, how do you apologize for nearly killing someone? Does the apology change the actions for you? 
I only say this because I was the victim of DV. This person nearly killed me. I luckily found strength to live, but the reality is that this person will now live with their actions. For me the apology (which this person I speak of) meant nothing and only gave someone an opportunity to have my attention. And let’s be honest… most people who are capable of doing such things do seek some level of attention
The more time I spend on reddit, posts that are extremely relatable to a very unique event in my life just keep popping up. 

I'm sorry for what happened to you, I've been through the exact experience, except I was the other guy. 

I've had anger issues my entire life and one day I was having a real bad day and lost my patience completely. Long story short, I beat a man close to death over a stupid altercation for a parking spot (other person got physical first, I just got harder, stronger, faster). 

I ended up going to anger management where they teach you you will never be cured of having such a low temperament, you just need to be able to cope with it and that typically means I need to recognize the situation before it gets heated and remove myself from it. Part of the therapy was to make amends with this guy that I've changed the life of forever. Similar to what op is going to do now. The meeting was as awkward as expected. Did he really accept my apology or was he just saying ok to end the encounter, I don't know. 

At the end of the day I live remembering that day always and I wish it didn't happen but it did. Both of us came out learning you can't really assume or know what other people are going through and you cannot control others, all you can do is control yourself and with that control you may be able to steer the situation into a more amicable solution for everyone. I've never had another episode since this one. 

I gather in your case the other guy was drunk and looking to pick a fight with anyone and you just so happened to be the lucky person to be there at that time and place. So different for sure in that detail. The man who assaulted you will not be the same man you meet and receive the apology from. He might claim he was very wasted and do not remember the events, so he's apologizing for his actions while drunk, but really the root cause is he should not have been drinking irresponsibly in the first place, ever. If he has gone to therapy as well, he might have made changes to prevent that in his life as well. I hope your meeting goes well and you're satisfied with the outcome. This event will be in the memories of both of you for the rest of your life.
Tell him to write you a letter. Dont get reinvested in this episode of your life min which  you have already worked through.
I don’t think it’s stupid at all. 

Look up restorative justice and you’ll probably find stories from people in similar predicaments and it might help you better understand what the outcomes could be. 

Make sure you’re absolutely doing it for you and not for him. 

I’d also think about what’s the worst thing that could possibly happen, and whether that outcome would be something you regret. 

Personally I understand. I’d probably try to do restorative justice with the guy who raped me. Chanel Miller said in an interview the other day that many victims are fighting to have someone look them in the eyes, say they’re sorry, they understand what they did, and they won’t ever do it again. I fall under that category.
Really the only question should be “is it beneficial to me”. If this is something that is genuinely going to help you get closure , and it’s better served in person than a letter then you should do it. If this is something you’re thinking of to help him, or you think you should help him, then I’d really consider the impact of seeing him after all this time. These are his mistakes , his responsibility to change. He’s has plenty of help , programmes etc in prison. It’s not up to you to try and help him along, if you don’t want to meet then refuse and ask for a letter.
I think what he did is unforgivable
So your a bloke then beaten badly by another bloke. No you shouldn't forgive them they caused you serious harm physically and mentally.
Whatever you decide, just remember that forgiveness is for you for the purposes of healing and closure.
I agree with the other comments. He should write an apology letter to you if he is genuine. There is no real gain from an in-person apology.

It could resurface trauma, and it could lead you to feeling uneasy or anxious in his presence.

If you feel the desire to forgive him, that is admirable, but he is not worth any effort on your part. You need to look after yourself foremost.

Whatever happens, I would not let him back into your life, but I am proud of you for being thoughtful and compassionate in your perspective.
That’s such a tough situation to be in, and your feelings are totally valid. You don’t owe him anything, especially not your forgiveness. If you think hearing his apology could help you heal, then maybe it’s worth considering, but only if you feel safe and ready.
I wasn't nearly killed, but I was jumped by a few people (separate incidents) as a teenager.

I met them a few years later and they apologised. This was spontaneous and random, not planned. But it kinda made me feel better. I dont really care if they are doing better, but it did help close that chapter officially. Bumping into them isn't a case of.. what are they going to do now? Are they still against me? In general, they seemed scincere. It kinda turned them from, violent monster x, into just stupid fucking person. Takes the power away a bit.

It's risky though. You don't really know this guy at all other than that he nearly killed you. You definitely don't owe him anything, so anything you do or don't do should be for you. I personally would decide if I wanted to hear what he had to say or not, and then if we happened to cross paths, I'd deal with it then. If we didn't cross paths, then that's fine too. I wouldn't go out of my way to hear it though.
I just wouldn’t want to see him in person 

He can write or record an apology - but that’s about all 

I wouldn’t want an apology to give him better treatment or anything because then it could just be inauthentic
Fuck this guy to the moon, let him rot and move on. As a previous poster said, he can apologise in hell
OP a lot of people are projecting what they feel onto this so remember if you think it would help you heal absolutely do it. Definitely at least get a therapist to read a written apology and then maybe if you think it helpful (along with your professional) consider in person. But if either of you think it retraumatizing obviously don't.
Fuck your attacker, they can burn in hell! Can you sue them for damages? That would be my response.
This is restorative justice. If you engage with him under supervision (YOU are not the subject of the supervision, he is) and you both tell the other whatever each wants the other to know about the situation, it’s likely going to help you both.  There are restorative justice programs in many states, you can call your local court and ask if they participate in such a program
As the victim, if you think it will be good for you then do it. If you’re not sure ask for a letter first to hear what he has to say before considering doing anything further. You don’t owe him anything though.
You can forgive him without him being privy to it. It has nothing to do with him at this point, it's about you healing. You don't owe him anything, especially not an in person interaction. He can apologize in at written letter if he must, though I wouldn't read it.
Your forgiving him will set your spirit free without him asking to be forgiven. The burden of anger and hate will be lifted. You need to examine your own thoughts regarding seeing him again. You could bring someone with you for added protection. 

I'm a 67 year old female and I would want to meet him and hear what he has to say. That act would complete the circle of forgiveness so that you both could move forward from this heinous act. Best wishes, OP.
5 years is all your state gave him? That piece of garbage should’ve been in prison the rest of his life not released to do the same thing again. Do not give that 💩 your time or energy. Ever. And definitely don’t trust a word he has to say. He’s doing that to check a box on a parole paper not because he suddenly gained a conscience. He’s doing that to benefit himself somehow not you. 

Ensure that a permanent restraining order is in place. After that, if he comes near you at all, eliminate him from the earth. 

I’m in the camp that forgiveness is unnecessary. You can let go of how ever much pain & suffering your mind & body will let you without involving that 💩 stain.
I wouldn't let him apologize to you in any way, OP. It only serves to benefit him, it's part of HIS  aa program. This is a selfish act. Seeing this person will only bring back memories that need to stay in the past, and may cause you mental trauma. There was a person who sent me an apology letter once, but the letter wasn't genuine because they still were insulting and blaming me for their actions. It did more harm than good. Don't let this person get the satisfaction of unburdening himself. You can forgive them from afar.
((OP)) I am SO sorry that happened to you. It sounds like it was very random and unexpected, which somehow seems to make it worse. There are other replies that are much better than mine - I just wanted to give you my sympathy and let you know I care about what happened to you. I like the idea of accepting a letter of apology but having a therapist read it first or maybe even read it to you in case there are parts that will not be useful or helpful to you.
Tell him his apology should be a large donation to an anti violence charity.
You don’t have to do it in person. He could write a letter and/ir record an audio message or video. Something about being in person and him having access to you now or in the future is giving me serious alarm bells. Good luck OP.
You do not need to forgive him to move on and help yourself, just closure. If you feel that having an open and honest conversation is what will give you closure do that. But don't just forgive him because he asks, accept his apology and be honest. If you can't forgive him right now tell him.
"I think that hearing an apology would serve me well. It might help me finally close the book so to speak. Also, being willing to allow him to give the apology feels like it would be the right thing to do."

This seems like your guiding principle. Do it for YOU and your process, which ever way feels more healing.
Hell no not in person. He can write a letter if he wanted to. It doesn't take an adult to teach someone what's wrong to do to others. He's bat shit crazy don't risk it.
OP, the only “right” answer here is between you and your heart. Trust your gut and your intuition.
As a person who has both made and received 9th Step Amends there are something to be aware of about the process. 

1) First and foremost the amends process of for the individual that is “cleaning up the mess of their past” It is about that person taking responsibility for themselves and the actions taken that have harmed others. 

It shouldn’t have any element of shifting blame for or justifying their actions. BUT that doesn’t always happen. It depends on the guidance they receive from sponsors and fellows. 

2) An amends should not be asking for forgiveness. Forgiveness actually has nothing to do with the amends process. By owning my past actions I am seeing the past with honesty and admit to myself that the stories I’ve told myself to justify things are false. The response/reaction or opinions the recipient actually has nothing to do with the process. As mentioned indirect amends can work better times. 

3) Be aware of your expectations of the amends. This is a very tricky part that I had to unpack when someone very close to me made an amends and I had strong negative feeling afterwards. I was expecting their amends to let me know they really understood how they harmed me and could empathize with the pain it causes. Again this was someone very close to me and neither of those expectations were met. I worked though my feeling on that and came to realize that they will never be able to understand at a level to satisfy my desire to be understood. It’s not humanly possible for them to feel and know MY pain from their actions. 

In what you have shared about your situation, If I were in your shoes I would opt for an indirect amends letter sent to my therapist. Let your therapist take a first read to make sure it’s “clean” and the person is not trying to blame shift. Then you also have the support of a professional to go through the letter in a session. You are in control of how or if you want to receive the amends    

Lastly it sounds like you have done a lot of work to realize that forgiveness has nothing to do with the other person. Forgiveness is you choosing to no longer hold onto those feelings of hate and rage that tear apart a soul after major trauma. It is not forgetting the past nor is it necessarily repairing relationships. It’s simply making the choice to stop the internal turmoil by letting go of those negative feeling towards the person.
Forgiving someone who wronged you isn't for their benefit, it's for your own. So if you feel meeting him would allow you to voice your forgiveness and close that chapter so that you can move on, go for it. Obviously bring someone as a witness and meet somewhere public not associated directly with yourself so there little chance for him to find where you live or work. You also state that he's in a program to deal with his issues and hopefully trying to truly turn himself around, perhaps allowing him to ask your forgiveness and apologize is part of what will help him, which in turn could help others who come across him in the future. 

That said, if you choose to do it go into it knowing that it might bring up some repressed feelings or forgotten moments from it, which is another reason to bring someone with you that you can confide in, someone to comfort you afterwards who can let you vent those emotions if needed.
Don't accept it. Fuck this cunt, hope he dies of guilt
I'd prefer an apology in person...
Listen, I was in this exact situation around the sane time, and my word of advice? Move on. You have done so much to heal and put your life together, but you have to face the possibility that you won’t hear what you want to hear. You have no idea how this person views the situation and, even if genuinely remorseful, you still don’t know what those five years in prison did to him psychologically and how he rationalizes everything.
You’ve done SO MUCH to move on from that horrible event, and to risk retraumatizing yourself in order for you to have an apology you (rightfully deserve, I might add, I’m not disputing that) is just not worth it. This man did a horrible thing to you, and you moved on and persevered. He apparently has to, and changed his life around. But let me tell you from experience: I was offered an apology by my abuser in person and through mail…and while I had mostly moved on…. A small, yet highly reoressed part of me kept thinking of all the horrible physical things I would do if I was in physical proximity to my abuser. You might say you are truly healed right now, but YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR REACTION TO SEEING THIS MAN AGAIN WILL DO TO YOU. 

I beg you as a person who is in similar straights as you: move on. Persevere. Succeed. That is how you find closure.
First, you don’t owe him anything.    
The right course of action is to do what will bring YOU peace.   If you decide to hear him out, you set the rules of where, when, who is present.    Perhaps seeing him will help you not feel threatened in the future.  

I know the saying is forgive and forget.   I personally think it’s possible to let go of the anger and hate and just put that person in a category where you never think of him again.    Good Luck!
Ask if you can beat the crap out of him like he did you then you will be able to forgive him. If not ghost & block.
cis het = straight , right?
The fact that they are insistent on it being in person means it’s about control, not amends, creepy
What does your therapist say about this? What happens if he has a relapse in the future and goes back to his violent ways?  The risk isn’t worth it. If you have PTSD, are you going to be able to get his face out of your mind when you see him?  I’m sorry you are going through this. You have come a long way to forgive him, but you owe him nothing.
It is up to you. Not comfortable? Don't do it.
You need to ask yourself if you’re really and truly ready for this step. It’s okay if you’re not. Everyone heals at a different pace.
“ a mind is like a parachute. It doesn’t work if it isn’t open”
Personally, as somebody who has had some PTSD in a similar vein, but not as intense as yours, I would let him write a letter if you really want to get involved at all. There is no reason you should have to meet this man in person, and I don’t know how you’re supposed to feel safe doing that. Prioritize your peace.
No.
do it:             you have nothing to lose and something to gain.  
dont do it:    you have nothing to lose and nothing to gain.

do it.
Demanding or pushing for an in person meeting is a power move. 

Therefore it’s not amends. 

Allow only a letter to a third party persons address (your lawyer) or else deny any contact attempt.
You went through a massive trauma and I'm so happy that you're working through it. 

He's more than welcome to apologize, but you're also able to not accept it. Whether it's in person or via letter or however YOU feel comfortable corresponding, you don't have to accept it. 

Perhaps one day you'll want to, perhaps you won't. But that's not up to anyone but you to decide.
If it were me, I wouldn't bother. His rehabilitation isn't your problem
I had a friend send me a random IM After years of no contact apologizing for being a dick to me for his past transgressions. I thought he was trying to restart a friendship that I thought I enjoyed. But no it was AA telling him to kill yourself from your past transgressions. Had I known what he was ultimately trying to do I would have refused his apology because I would not have found it sincere and I still don't. We became sort of friends again regardless but I still don't trust him.
Consider giving him the opportunity to write you an apology. It gives you the opportunity to read it over and to formulate a response (if you desire) in a timeframe that works for you. If you meet in person it's very easy as the victim for you to not properly convey everything you mean to say and for the process to not fully grant the closure you're looking for.
He can want to apologize, but you have no reason or need to hear it or anything
"Forgivness is a gift, not just for your enemy but for yourself." - the Quran i believe it's also a Buddhist teaching. As a man who been consumed by hatred, let it go. Not for ur enemy but for yourself. It will consume u if u dont. "Let go or be dragged" is an Indian proverb, i believe. Those who matter will see you as stronger and braver for doing so, and their opinion of you is only second to ur opinion of yourself. Hell sometimes it comes first.



As for communicating and seeing them in person. Pain and fear can be healthy things they let you know you are alive and try to keep you alive. But if left to fester it can grow into the worst kind of problem. Dealing with it sooner is better than dealing with it later. But it's a balancing act confronting it to soon can do more bad than good. So I think you should ask your self if you really think this person has changed for the better and if they are deserving of your forgivness. If you are ready to give forgivness is a hard question to answer. But sometimes you must first give a gift in order to receive one.
forgiveness is overrated. i'm more of a righteous vengeance person, but that doesn't way on my mind in the slightest most people i guess it does. Screw him though
I'm always on the side of trial by fire because facing your fears makes you stronger. I think it would help to face him. See he's just a man. Not a monster. Forgiveness doesn't mean forget. I'm not a huge fan of forgiveness honestly. Sometimes though. People that hurt you aren't the monsters we think they are. Desperation will lead people down some pretty dark paths. Ultimately. It's up to you. Do you remain scared, or do you face your biggest fear and come out stronger?
I would not meet him in person
I would NEVER give my abuser the opportunity to experience closure, since I never did.
Carry a gun from now on and train. Dont be a victim.
Can you explain what actually happened? (if you’re comfortable doing so)
You are doing to have to decide this one yourself. Talk to a therapist. Your own well being is what matters.Try to figure out if you would find it helpful or harmful to meet him, and then choose based on what will be better for you. 

If receiving an apology in a non personal way, like a letter, would be better for you, then request that.

I'm sorry this was done to you. I hope you can find a way to heal.
In my opinion you should go for it. It sounds like it’ll help you and people change (obviously not all) so it might help to see the person who did that too you no longer exists. but if you don’t mind me asking what did you do to ‘run afoul’?
Only do so if you're comfortable. And only in a public place, preferably with a friend or relative close by. If he is in therapy, maybe you could meet in his therapists office. Having someone oversee it would be a good idea.
A friend of mine was responsible for someone's death unintentionally (and did time for it) he apologised to the family in writing and tried to in person but they weren't interested, it was difficult for him and I think it did probably contribute towards his poor mental health and eventual suicide but I don't remotely blame that family that lost their loved one as a result of my friends actions and no one in their right mind would ever blame you for not wanting anything to do with this individual but if you genuinely feel like this could give you catharsis then you should do it
The timing must mean he just got out of prison and has serveral years of probation with all the required anger management, DV classes.  He shouldn't seek physical contact with any of his victims.
I would add my own experience of being “apologized” to buy someone sober a long time who didn’t have the facts right on what he was amending was really painful. It made me feel hate again, embarrased, confused and didn’t help in any way for me to see the situation differently. 

Though in another situation, i have had someone make “amends” who actually did know how they hurt me, really put themselves in my shoes and said how they could have posdibly made me feel, and that was so freeing and cathartic. I felt peaceful and relieved. 

I would say really tune into yourself, take a few minutes to get quiet-ish in your mind and ask “ will this be helpful” and ask your body to guide you. If a tight-tight feeling comes up, its a no, if a warm drippy kind of feeling comes up, with a loosening in the shoulders, i would say thats a yes. 

If the person doesn’t say anything helpful, it be helpful for you, to even just look them in the eye and say you hurt me. A part of you now can stand up for yourself for when you couldn’t at the time. 

It sounds simple but sometimes those are the most necessary and healing things to say. 

Good luck with your decision 💜
There's some really good advice here, and I'm not trained in therapy or anything, but if i chuck my two cents in...

In my experience, when I'm dealing with something that makes me nervous, I often think in black and white terms, and it's not really helpful in the long term.

My advice would be to sit down and write down your thoughts in as much detail as you can, remembering that in reality there isn't just two choices, it's not meet him in person or don't. It's have him write to you, or take more time, talk to your friends and family etc. All I'm saying is there's a multitude of choices on top of choices in terms of next steps. That's reality.

What's most important is to make sure you're having an honest dialogue with yourself and not doing things because you think you should, but do it because you genuinely think it will be helpful.

Genuinely wishing you all the best, it sounds like you've made some incredible progress so far, and I hope you can allow yourself to be really proud of that.
The apology is for him, not you. You don't have to accept their apology or forgive them. You just keep doing you.
He can write you an email then. Why should you be forced to face your abuser, do a ton of emotional labor, and get triggered into PTSD hell just because your abuser wants closure? He’s already done enough harm.
I don’t know if you should or not, but it may be a way to get some closure yourself as it seems like you may have some lingering trauma from this ordeal…. 
Do you know of anyone else he apologized to? If so how did that go? If you don’t know- I’d do some sleuthing to find out, as that could be a way to predict how your conversation with him could go. Also if you do decide to talk to this guy- don’t go alone… good luck buddy.
Don't do it,if something happens to him soon after,you're prime suspect.
An apology is an offer, you’re within your right to decline the offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept the apology if you don’t feel ready
out of curiosity, there was criminal consequences for him but were there civil consequences?

I mean, I'd be open to forgiveness, but I'd want to be monetarily compensated... A LOT... i imagine its impacted you monetarily quite heavily
If you feel it'd bring closure and some kind of relief to you, go for it. You sound like a balanced, kind and emphatic person from your edits.

Personally, I wouldn't forgive something like that, or just wouldn't go as far as to have a face to face meet in order to accept their apologies.
You need counselling OP. Don't have any contact with that violent man! It's not worth the risk! UK 🇬🇧
I would not meet him.
Tough one.  Only you know the answer. Go with your gut.
There's no right or wrong here, only what feels right *for you*.

If it feels right to let him apologise and you think it'll help you move on, then do that. Doesn't matter whether other people think it's crazy or not.
I wouldn't meet him face to face. I wouldn't want to give him the satisfaction... but you need to remember. Hate is easy. Forgiving is hard. It sounds like you really haven't forgiven him, and that's ok! You need to heal in your own time. You also need to really think about having these people in your life that keep up with this person. Because will they ever give up your information? Tell him where you live? Tell him your number? Tell him anything? You need to think about how far you want this person and all who shake his hand. Or you will never heal
Absolutely let him apologize. Might be good to have someone there as a mediator if needed, but I think it'll help you heal.
You don’t have to meet him in person. If he truly wants to make amends he will want you to be comfortable and care about how you feel. Not force the fact that he wants to meet face to face. If it’s what you want he can write a letter and you can have it for when you are ready to read it.
Not in person, that can trigger trauma response/panic attacks
Could he record an apology video and send it to his friend who could send it to you?
It kinda sounds like the apology is so they can forgive themselves in your presence, not for you to forgive them. What they did is a heavy burden to hold but it is not on you to relieve them of that. Personally, I would tread carefully about giving more information out and go on about my life. You even said so yourself that you’ve been working towards forgiving them through therapy. Don’t let someone that caused so much destruction disrupt your peace.

The best apology that they can offer is changed behavior.
You think it could be good for both of you. That seems like reason enough to try.

If you see him and can't go through with it, that's your right. Do send the message that this could happen. That you might at the last minute not be able to be face to face with him and that it doesn't mean you are rejecting the apology but that the trauma from what he did just isn't something you can always overcome. 

Choose a neutral ground to meet at and have someone you trust accompany you.
As a person who served 17+ years in prison and jails, I have made my attempts at “Making Amends” to people I may have harmed. It’s likely they’re apart of a 12 step program, and feels like this will help you both. However it truly must be whatever you want, and if that’s in person or writing. I personally met with a person who was very very grateful for my apology, and it’s impacted both our lives in a very positive way. He said that he held such hate and rage against me, but after my apology he felt anew freedom of self. This situation was a long time ago, but it was something that still holds a special place in my life daily.
I’d allow him to write you a letter through a third party.  But being in the same room with you may trigger something and set back your healing. 
I’d ask a professionals opinion
Only forgive for your sake! Sometimes forgiveness is about you moving on and not so much for the perp to get a clean slate
Do not meet with this person. He could be full of it and just trying to get you alone to really kill you. I would never see him in person again. He wants to apologize, great, let him apologize, but he can do it just as well from faaaaaaaar away.
Could you do it at arm's length and say you appreciate the apology but there will be no forgiveness or forgetting?  He's done his thing and you are still protecting yourself.
This probably won’t be seen but I’ll give my two cents. 

You being able to forgive him in order to move on with your healing and him wanting to apologize to you are two very good and utterly separate things that do not need each other in order to happen

I mean that you can and apparently have started to move on from it

He is on the path to recovery and has offered to meet in order to make amends and that is potentially noble of him

DO NOT FEEL LIKE YOU OWE HIM THAT MEETING. HE WILL UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON‘T WANT IT.

that’s the important bit. You can move on without the meeting. Thank him through a medium but decline and wish him well if you’re able. 

If he truly understands what he did then he’ll understand the potential for you not to want to meet with him. 

Only do it if you earnestly feel it will help you heal. You owe him nothing. He should get that.
Your strength is an incredible inspiration to me. I've been wronged and just feel vengeful and hateful. I think that if you're ready, you should do it, but get professional opinions first to protect your mental health.
Yeah, you don’t owe him anything. He tried to make an amends. You said no. That’s it. He moves on to the next person on his list.
"Forgiveness from those that we have hurt in this world never was guaranteed"
Tell him you forgive him but you aren't interested in hearing anything else.
No
It's understandable to feel torn. If you think hearing the apology could help you heal, consider it, but prioritize your safety and mental well-being. Trust your gut  
  
if it feels wrong, don't go through with it.
Nah
Check yourself first are you ready for that convo ? Be assertive and if you waver it’s because you are not
2. Would in person apology be better or written ? Check yourself.
How do you deal with in person interaction vs written interaction 
3. After you know, make sure to communicate and if at anytime you would want to speak or accept that apology let the person know that it may not be the right time for yiu
Forgive yourself, fuck his amends.
This doesn’t have to be in person. You don’t owe him anything. It’s more so for him to come to peace with his character defects. Ask for a letter if your uncomfortable, which is completely understandable
You do not owe this person anything.

His progress on becoming a better version of himself does not depend on you looking him in the eye when he apologises. 

As humans, sometimes we have to understand that we don't get to apologise. He needs to make peace with that. That's his process, his work, not yours. 

If you don't want to have any contact with him, you don't have to.
There are organisations that facilitate restorative justice, where criminals meet their victims or their victims families to apologise and hear the impact of their crime. Below is a couple of links. There’s a young guy called Jacob Dunne who met with his victims parents and it completely turned his life around as well as helping his victims parents, and they’re still in touch. He know supports others in rehabilitating. It can be incredibly healing for the victims whilst also rehabilitating for the criminal and helps them move forwards positively. But it’s complex so there’s a process and usually people to facilitate the conversation, if people choose to do a face to face meeting (which they don’t have to). So it might be worth googling restorative justice and reaching out to organisations for advice before responding to the request. Ultimately you need to only proceed if you have support and feel able to. It could be amazing for both of you, but I have no doubt it will also bring a lot of emotions up for you and you need to look after your needs first. I wish you well as you process the decision.

He does not deserve the opportunity of any kinda of redemption, resolution, or recovery that involves you and your forgiveness. If you think it’s what’s best for you that’s okay but from my experience I thought an apology would put me at ease, make me feel better somehow for it to be out in the open that I was wronged. It didn’t, it reignited my anger to have a half baked apology as a requirement for some garbage 12 step program. Do NOT let yourself be an arbitrary stepping stone in his recovery. If you think it’s your opportunity to finally be taken seriously, it’s not.
Nah, fuck him. He doesn't deserve to be forgiven.
One thing - making amends as part as a program is only advised if it causes no harm. 

That’s what it will come down to. 
 I bet lots of others have said it as well and probably better. 

YOU come first.
"Mutual friend" is wild.



If homie A beats homie B viciously enough to almost kill homie B, there are very few circumstances where I see myself remaining friends with homie a



If your boys are still bros with a dude who tried to kill you, and that isnt a deal breaker for them, you need and deserve a better circle my guy
I know a guy who had someone try to kill him years ago, and I mean like 25, and he does not fucking want to see him now or ever. If YOU. WANT. to see him then do it, but you owe him nothing. 
I'm glad your still alive my dude. Do what feels right and just do it in a safe setting. It could help, I can only imagine the range of emotions you feel. Just be safe and have a plan incase it makes you spiral ♡
You don't owe this person anything. Only participate if you think it would be good for you. If possible I would consult your therapist first.
This is your chance to say everything that has been rolling around in your head all these years. The things he needs to hear to truly understand what he did.

You have a family that nearly lost you. You have friends who would have been without you. He jeopardized all of that, just because he was in a bad mood. When you see him, tell him that you will let him apologize, but you want him to know the magnitude of his actions before he tries to say it. Tell him everything it has caused, and let him apologize in the face of his own demons. That is how a man changes to his core.
Absolutely not. Although you say it wasn't a domestic violence situation, you have no way to know if his intentions are genuine, or to try to trick you into being friends or to harm you. If I was almost beaten to death, I would never want to be in that person's presence ever ever again. Do not do it.
I had a similar thing, happen. I realized I can forgive the person, never forgive the action and unless it’s something you need to do for you, if you have moved and not plotting his murder every night to fall asleep (what I did). He can fuck right off about with his apology. You’re not responsible for his atonement, he can figure out another way to forgive himself. Like you had to, to heal and get over his shit.  I told mine to fuck off, when he tried to resurface with some bs apology and excuse of how he is a broken and damaged man trying to be better blah, blah, blah.  I keep thinking it’s all the times he was given grace, it enabled to continue what he did and I will be the first and hopefully not the last, to show him your  actions are NOT and will never be acceptable or okay.
It’s up to you 100% and if you feel like you’re not ready yet that’s fine. My husband was murdered in 2007. The person is serving 25 years (Canada life sentence). I reached out to him and forgave him when I was ready (12 years into his sentence) because I was ready to let go of the hate and pain. I’ve been part of those 12 step programs and it’s great that they want to reach out but that’s for them - you don’t ever have to accept. I felt a lot better after I did but it’s definitely a personal thing.
The only real apology that counts is changed behavior. So the apology will be accepted in the end when you know that he is not harmed any other people in this lifetime. The end!
Either way an apology would be good for both parties in my opinion. i believe that you should forgive him , not for him , but for you. I believe that that would be you putting some good vibes into this terrible situation. Also when the apology is given, you also have the right to accept it or not. Also your decision, but also I believe you are generally a decent person and trying to find a different perspective is responsible and i commend you. good vibes and positive JUJU your way.
Just because something needs to be said it doesn’t mean it needs to be heard. This is ur choice. Ask yourself what you will get out of this. Will it be pain, sorrow, grief or joy. You won’t know until u find out brut look at the positive and negative impacts and if that doesn’t work go with ur gut.
Ok so, not sure if you will see this but, the decision to forgive someone is not for them, it is for you. I won't go into too much detail but I was sexually abused when I was younger age 7 to 14 by a man I trusted. For close to 20 years I hated this man, he was the reason I missed out on so much of my life, afraid to go out, afraid to be alone around Any male, I lost out on school functions, dating, parties, jobs. Until one day I decided he doesn't get to control my life anymore, I made the decision to forgive him for my own mental health. I still see and talk to him sometimes, one day, he actually told me he was sorry, he didn't exactly say why he was sorry but we both knew what he meant, I had waited so many years to hear him say that, but it didn't feel the way I thought it would, I know he meant it and I know he is sorry but it didn't change anything I had gone through. I hope you can forgive that man, but not for him, going through life with that kind of hate can and will change you. I am so sorry for what happened to you, and I truly hope that man has changed his life. Even if you don't tell him that you forgive him, I hope one day in your heart you can let it go. Very different traumas but from one survivor to another I wish you the best. And remember forgiveness does not mean forgetting,  just letting go of the anger and hate. 💜
HELL NO!!
Similar thing has happened to me.. they just feel sorry for themselves! Embarrassed by their own behaviour..

DONT give him the satisfaction..

You have healed and you don’t need his apology
Don’t do it. Write them a letter and let them live with the guilt. Fuck them
I would do it - in life, modelling kindness and forgiveness can change someone’s life. Even if you don’t do it, it’s nice to know he’s sober and working through a program.
If you think it will help YOU, then it is absolutely worth it. 

The program says that if someone you want to make amends to doesn’t respond or refuses to accept your apology it doesn’t matter because what is important is the addicts willingness to apologise. So not talking to him or not accepting the apology will not in any way affect him. 

If you don’t think it will be useful to you, then don’t do it. You owe him exactly nothing.
Jesus NO!! Do not go anywhere near him!! Who fucking cares what he wants?!!! That’s bullshit. DO NOT SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN TO ANYONE. DO NOT SAY A WORD TO THE MUTUAL FRIEND. DO NOT GIVE IT LIFE BY GIVING AN OUNCE OF ENERGY TO IT. 
He should still be in fucking prison!
One, I am incredibly sorry this happened to you.

Two, in my experience, violent people do not change their ways. He can write all of the letters he wants, but if you are not 100000% comfortable with any form of contact, you don't have to be. He is not owed an audience for whatever apology he wants to make.
The top comment. He can write you an apology.  You in no way should feel.bad for him. His actions, his addictions put him where hebis and where he needs to be. It sounds like your therapy is not finished yet. You were the one wronged, you are the survivor. Don't give him anymore power. Don't feel bad or sorry for him.
Dude has proven himself to be a poor steward of your time, you've got no obligation to give him any more.
Highly recommend watching the documentary Risking Light which discusses this topic.
Desmond tutu wrote a very good book about forgiveness that may benefit you. It’s about forgiveness and also a work book. But in it, part of what he explains is it’s good for both sides. Forgiveness is a choice and has to be to mean anything. Deciding to maintain a relationship or separate is also a choice. You can forgive him and tell him you never want to see him again.
The biggest lesson I learned about forgiveness is that is not about the other person, it's about yourself. This is about freeing yourself from what you said above - the hate, the anger, the amount of energy you spend passively or presently on this person. That doesn't mean you forget, that doesn't mean you have to spend time with this person, but it allows YOU to heal and move on. Lastly, forgiveness isn't a one-time thing - you don't forgive once and you're done. It's a path, and sometimes you need to retrace that path. Just like when you love someone, you choose that over and over again.

I would say find terms that you both can agree on. Maybe it's a public place, maybe you have people there who will have your back, etc. But it sounds like it could be healing for both of you.
You need a better therapist.
Was originally going to comment, but you've gotten some good advice, so all I'll say is do what you think feels right. If you go, and it feels wrong, then just leave. You don't owe him anything. Anyhoot, be safe.
This situation makes me feel very torn, I want to grow into a better version of myself by the path I walk and the choices I make, however I believe we’re animals, and the laws of nature are acceptable as well and in some instances deserved, sometimes pretending we’re a just society doesn’t create a proper justice system, I want to hurt this person for you as your story enraged me
I would be inclined to meet him. Meet in a public place accompanied by someone trustworthy.  Why? He clearly is not out to get you. He wants to let go of that past of his past. Maybe it will help you find a better place also. 

You are considering it also. There is a part of you that has questions and empathy.  Take the high road. Help the guy on his path to recovery. Maybe he doesn't even deserve it, but you can walk away knowing you've done your part to prove to him and the world that decent people exist.  

Do people have to run into burning buildings to save strangers, or even dogs? No, but they do. They do it because everyone deserves a chance to fix their wrongs. Especially those who are making a real effort.
I think sometimes our salvation is the life we created after a traumatic situation. I would decline and keep moving in the direction of forgiving on your own terms. You don’t owe this person anything.
Interesting question. Everybody seems to be saying “Hell no, absolutely not.” I think it definitely has the potential to help you heal if you receive an in person apology. A letter is a good alternative if you don’t want to do an in person meeting. I do think there is something different about doing this type of thing in person though. Like I said, I think there’s the definitely the *potential* to help you heal if you go through with it. 

If you do it in person, definitely do it in a public setting, go with a social worker to observe, other people you’re close to, have someone check him for weapons in case this is some type of trap, have someone who goes with you bring a weapon themselves in case it’s needed, & carry a weapon yourself.  
I’m not sure about how the meeting would affect you. 

But one thing my wise old aunty told me is that when you forgive someone. You’re not letting them off the hook. You’re letting yourself off the hook. 

This sounds exactly like what you’ve experienced, but it’s important to emphasise that forgiveness helps YOU toto move on. Is not really about the other person.
You can do whatever you want. Do what’s best for you not for him. His process or his needs are not your concern. Not at all.

It may or may not be what you expected. It sounds like you won’t be in danger, but have another person there anyways.
Don't do it! Too many victims are victimized a second time when the perpetrator finds them again!
Oh GOD NO. I can't see this helping you in any way. You don't have to forgive him, fuck that noise. Curse his name and piss on his grave one day. The contact could actually be really detrimental to you because he might minimise what he did, or use as an opportunity to be abusive. Just no. He can write you a letter and get someone else to read it first before you to check if it's ok.
Remember that his apology is for HIM to feel better and/or get brownie points for a parole officer. I’d personally ignore it. If he truly feels bad and doesn’t get closure, that’s part of the punishment
Meet up if it helps *you* move on. You don’t owe that asshole anything.
I would tell him to go fuck himself every day for the rest of his pathetic life and bust his ass trying to make the world a better place after he nearly took the world away from you. Fuck that guy nearly to death, don't give him the satisfaction.
Screw him. You can let it go without needing to let him unburden himself. That is a kindness you don’t owe him(if it even truly bothers him). Did you somehow have it coming? Did you repeatedly antagonize him? Sleep with his girl? Or was it a beating out of the blue. If you share some blame then maybe yall can meet in the middle.
Forgiveness is for you to find peace. You can forgive and it does not mean there is ever any other interaction. Don’t meet just write a note. It will have to be enough for him but sounds like it lifts a burden for you.
The local court system may have someone trained as a victim's advocate or specializing in restorative justice that could help you manage this process in a healthy way, if you do end up going that route.
If YOU believe it will help YOU, that should be your deciding factor.   If it helps him as well, that is a bonus.    

If this was a random act by a stranger, my thought is that it would be beneficial.   If it was DV, I would feel differently.
In a 12-Step program here.

You should in no way feel as if you have to see this person and listen to an amends, or even read or respond to a letter. Too often people make apologies to feel relief on their part. If they did the steps thoroughly they would be relieved of the burden of their actions before any contact with the person harmed takes place, in Step 8. Making a 9th Step amends, such as you describe your attacker considering, is likely a an attempt to seek forgiveness and is not okay. If you want to receive this gesture, go ahead; if you have any reservations, you can say you will contact them if you change your mind.
Fuck him
No.  Protect yourself.
He can apologize by being a better person and never contact you again 


Wanting to apologize is a damn selfish thing to want in that context, he just want absolution
He can write you an appology letter, screw seeing him in person.
apologies without compensation are worthless
Worth saying that “mutual friend” means that guy thought “hey I know he almost beat you to death, but he’s fun to get a beer with” 

Like that person is not a mutual friend. That’s the other guy’s friend
Sounds like he needs to feel better about his horrible, life changing actions. He wants to heal.

I wouldn't give him the satisfaction. Let him hurt. 

Unless you need to forgive him for your own progress, I would let him go through life thinking you've never forgiven him. He doesn't deserve any help from you.
You don't owe him forgiveness or kindness, that should be entirely down to what you want.
DO NOT MEET THIS MAN. It could be he genuinely is sorry, but there's been too many cases of people meeting up with the person who got them locked up under the pretense of wanting to make amends only for them to actually be seeking revenge for getting them arrested and end up hurting them even more or even killing them. You don't know his current frame of mind, and the risk is just not worth it. If he truly regrets what he's put you through and wants to apologise, a simple written letter is more than enough. If he insists on doing it in person, that is only a major red flag. I hope you find peace and healing from the traumatic experience this man put you through.
You don’t owe him shit. Let their conscience rot.
Bottom line, what would be best for you? He may be trying to be a better person now, but that in no way obligates you to be part of that. He can write a heartfelt letter if he wants to apologize so much.

If meeting him gives you the closure you need, then do it with the mindset that you are doing it for you, not for him. He committed a heinous assault and it is now his burden to shoulder. By his actions, he changed your life. It was his choice to do what he did. Don't give him that power over you again.

There are people that commit crimes that turn their life around. Good for him for doing that, but once again, it's not your obligation to be part of that. 

Whatever you choose, do it on your terms and do it for you.
No wtf, how the fuck is this even a question. You almost died dude.
The nature of the apology is completely on your terms. Whether it's in person, written, or simply through the intermediary, it's your call and there is no pressure to give someone going through Step 9 anything you're not comfortable with.
Nah fuck him he’s just doing it to fulfill a program requirement. Make him struggle.
For me forgiving someone wasn’t for the other person mostly, it mainly was for me to move on from whatever the situation is or person involved. Its like closing a chapter and not holding that weight anymore.
5 years isn’t enough time really. The fact is animals like this are extremely difficult to train. It’s important not to reward its behaviour especially when it’s simply not fit to exist in a human society. Ideally, it would be put down for the safety of others, but unfortunately many will still consider it to be human despite the extreme danger it poses. If you have a list of its transgressions, I would publicise that alongside its face as much as you can. The legal system has simply failed you and everyone else.
for your own safety please don’t meet with them physically
The person who hurt me was court ordered to provide an apology letter as a condition of his plea bargain.    The letter was very damaging to me.  It re-imagined what happened and only served to re-victimize me and once again try to make me feel like I was crazy and that what happened didn’t happen.   There was a lot of 12-step language in there but he for sure missed the memo on amends not being damaging to the other party.   0/10 do not recommend.
You're under no obligation to help him or forgive him or do anything for him. His program and sobriety are his to manage.
Its amazing its only a 5 year prison term because you were too strong to die.
To be forgiven you have to forgive if you believe in Christ!
You don't have to accept his overture for amends. He has to accept that. Someone tried to reach out to me to make amends when I was pregnant. My sister told him that she didn't think that I would want that. She told me years later and just knowing was fine and I'm glad I didn't have to go through the stress of assuaging his guilt. Don't do it if you think it would trigger anything in you. You don't owe him anything. Be careful around the person who is in contact with both of you.
It leads you down 2 paths potentially …you will probably help both of you heal…or you will hang on to the hate and regret not doing it later in life. Men that want to make amends on their wrongdoing are generally going through more pain of regret than anyone realizes. It hurts more than any physical pain. I would trade more physical pain for less regret.  Physical pain is generally temporary and regret is forever.
Duck them. You have no obligation to them.


>He wants to meet up with me to extend an in person apology.

No

>All of this correspondence has been through a mutual friend of ours who has kept tabs on him for me through the years.

Smart

>Also, being willing to allow him to give the apology feels like it would be the right thing to do. 

The right thing for who?

>I’m not saying I’m a fuckin saint or anything but I feel like if he’s actually trying to better himself that maybe helping him would help me.

You didn’t beat him within inches of his life so you don’t really owe him anything 

There’s no reason why you need to be anywhere near this person EVER again. 

Set your boundary. If the other person is unwilling to abide then that will tell you all you need to know about their efforts to improve themselves.
Um no? I'd send him a quick "ESAD" and call it a life on that one.
Listen to his apology. Then tell him you don't accept it.
The purpose of making amends is help the person who has been harmed, not the harmer. It’s not so that he can be forgiven or feel less guilty. Any benefits to him is incidental. If he wants to make amends, he can write a letter. There’s no reason to do it in person if you don’t want to. You can decide if and when you want to read it. If at some point you want to, you can let him know that you forgive him. Or not.
Fuck them, the apology is for HIM to feel absolved
you definitely do not owe him your forgiveness, and if would end up meeting with him please bring someone with you
How come he nearly killed you? You have mutual friends. What did you do to piss him off? Did he use weapons or his body?
Idk.  To each their own... but is the risk worth the reward? What if the "apology" just makes it worse?

Example: let's say it's the best apology ever. Checks all the boxes, and it helps you feel better. Great!  What are the odds of that happening? More importantly, what are the odds of new shit coming to light that actually makes it worse?

Is the possibility of the perfect apology worth the baggage of all the other stuff?  Not sure how this is quantified, but hopefully it makes sense.


Sounds lovely on paper, but in practice it sounds pretty risky
I can't prove that my on-and-off stalker of 18 years was the person who tried to run me off the road after a party on New Year's Eve many years ago, but the hostess was a friend of his, and I'd told her I wouldn't attend if he was there. Could she have told him? Well, she wasn't much of a friend, I later figured out; the headlights in a pickup behind mine went on as soon as I started my car, the driver followed me and tried to push me off the road in a secluded area, so . . . yeah, it seems likely. I did some pretty dramatic driving I couldn't have imagined I'd do, and I got away only because I had a lot of luck. I don't know if he was the person who cut my phone line way back when, before people had cell phones--that was a scary night. I can't prove he was the person who left unwanted "gifts" (like a massive freeway sign) on my doorstep. (The Department of Highways picked it up the next day.) I DO know that he was the perv who called me all the time and whispered sadistic things he wanted to do in the days before Caller ID and cell phones--I heard him say that sort of thing once, and after that hung up as soon as I heard whispering. He certainly was the person who wrote me that he was planning to come and see me while I was living abroad for a year. Maybe he did. I moved the next day. I was terrified. I cut contact with all of my friends--I didn't know who had given him my address. Later when I'd returned he called me to say that he knew I was looking for a place to live (and I was; how the HELL did he know? a PI?) and he was going into the local hospital for treatment for cancer and would be there for months and I could move into his apartment while he was gone. Uh, no thanks, I'm not a complete and utter moron and that's not how cancer treatment works. This was all decades ago. The police are some better about stalkers now. The phone company let me change my phone number every time he found it out. 

He called me for the last time using his REAL voice, not whispering about wanting to tie me up, and said he was doing AA and wanted to apologize to me, in person. With a lot of hesitation, I agreed to meet in a well-populated coffee shop and told my closest friend where I was going to be and that she should call in a kidnapping if I didn't call her within an hour of the time I'd agreed to meet him.

He was there and was clearly tortured by the shame of the apology he made to do his amends. He was in tears and seemed genuinely agonized. Good, I thought. He told me he would never call me or contact me again. ("We'll see about that," I thought.) He asked me if I could forgive him. I thought "If I say yes will he leave me alone?" and said "Yes." I can't say I meant it, and I don't mean it to this day. I wish I could forgive him, but . . . I'm married, I have a good life, but I am just a lot less trusting and open than I was. Forty-five years have gone by and I still jump when the phone rings; you wouldn't think you could get PTDS just from stalking (and never knowing if you're being observed, any time you leave home, but you can. I still have trouble having the blinds open, especially at night.

I never heard from him again. I hope he's less messed up. (I wasn't the only woman he stalked, it turned out.) Make of that what you will. There's no guarantee that the man who nearly killed you will be sincere about an apology, and if I had to do it again I'd hire an off-duty policeman to sit in the next booth in the cafe. It might work, but . . . take precautions.
Do not let him apologize or for that matter don’t let him know anything about you if you can help it!
“GFY”
Do NOT respond do not let him near you report it to the police.
Might be a little to the party here, but in my opinion u can and should listen to the apology. I don’t pretend to know or understand what u have gone through. I think it will help better understand his reasonings, as stupid as they may be, and maybe understand why it happened. Because as humans our initial response to anything we don’t understand is fear and anger/frustration. Second thing is a part to rehabilitating a criminal is for them to apologize to the victim because it shows them what their actions have done to another’s life. If he has truly the guilt of his actions are probably plaguing him.

He did almost kill you, so hearing him out doesn’t mean you MUST accept the apology. It’s up to you what you him. (Don’t go alone, if you so choose)
My problem with addicts making amends is that...it is all about them.  I don't need an apology. I don't want anything from you. And I certainly don't want to be used in such a way that now you feel better about yourself and what you did because I told you I forgive you.  I've got 3 addicts in my family.  What they don't tell you is that even if they are working the steps, they are still an addict.  They may not be actively using, but they still are an addict.  And, that means they still have that same personality and at least with my family, operating like a user.  And making amends? It was just one more opportunity for them to use me to get what they wanted--absolution while shifting the blame away from their choices and toward addiction.  No, YOU made those choices and now YOU want me to continue to cater to you.  I'm sorry, but I'd say fuck that guy, you owe him NOTHING.  It might be better for him anyway to know there are somethings you can't just forgive, that maybe he needs to sit with the consequences of his actions for a bit, and if that makes him uncomfortable, too damn bad.  Time to get tough, dig in, do the work, and stay clean.  And him staying clean isn't predicated upon you forgiving him but him forgiving himself and loving himself enough to do it.
That guy spent 5 years locked up because of what he did to you. You really think it's safe to meet him somewhere to let him apologize?
the apology will obly heal him, not you. yes it would be nice to hear him say the words but that doesnt replace the years of struggle you faced to heal your self. he only wants to apologise so he feels less guilty.

do with this information what you will
What led to him beating you up? No one beats someone near to death for nothing.
personally I don't think there has to be a ven diagram where his healing needs overlap yours and I think it may be asking yourself too much to have the bandwidth to hear his blah blah blah about why he did it and he's sorry. Or maybe he won't even say anything beyond that's he's sorry and that will feel flat.

I would say the same to him, to avoid talking to you because if he ever really contemplated the level of harm he did to you his head would explode.

I suggest no meeting with him. If he wants to write a letter. . . maybe have him address it to your therapist and have that person review it- or just say "no thank you," you are not obliged to help him heal, which is why he is asking you to meet with him. And I don't think on your side of it you will ever get the answers you are looking for. You can't ask why they did it because they don't know why they did it, and that feels terrribly unsatisfying . I am sorry to say this to you and I am sorry this happened to you. I salute your journey. You are not "incredibly stupid" no matter what you decide. You maybe just have an optimistic heart, don't ever be ashamed of being optimistic
I had a friend that was the person that assaulted another person. Did six years. In that time of therapy that he was in, he reached out to the victim. Said that he was sorry and a new person. Wanted to apologize. to my friend. They said, "in five years, contact me again. If what you say is true, you should be sucessfull in life by then with no issues with the law. If you truly turn your life around, then yes, I will forgive you. But I will not forgive you to get an A+ for a homework assignment in prison.
I don't know where you live, but there are "restorative justice" mediators who could counsel you on the process. You do not have to go through with it. That is completely in your control. The victim services or prosecuting attorney's office may know.
To state something up front: Whether or not he is trying to better himself and make amends for his past wrongdoing by apologizing to others, you do not owe him anything. I say this not because that is the dilemma you are facing as you've stated it, but because it's important to acknowledge feelings here that may be going unstated. If you feel uncomfortable with putting yourself in a position where you have to listen to his apology and politely accept it, know that it would be completely fine for you to decline. There's not actually a right answer here for whether or not you should hear him out, as only you can ultimately decide that.

That all said, as you've evidently done a lot of working through your feelings, I don't really have to tell you how bad harboring anger is and how much better it is for a person to forgive someone else, even when they don't deserve it. As you state, you think it might help you, and that's exactly the point: You forgive not for their sake, but for your own. If you feel you're ready to put that philosophy into practical effect and hear this guy out, I think that would be a great thing for both of you and I don't at all think that would be crazy: I want to state again, though, that, should you choose not to do this, that would be completely ok, too.

You really have to be the judge of this for yourself, and you should make this decision without any reference to what you imagine other people may think or feel about it, because this is completely about you and what you feel (or don't feel) comfortable doing: The decision you make here should be entirely about doing what you think is right for you.
Meet in public place with lots of security.   It can help you both heal.  be safe first.
Why and or how did this situation come to pass?
No. It’s not a safe choice to be in the same physical space as that person.  Unless you bring a body guard.  Just don’t do that.  He might want to be a better person but you know who he actually is.  Use that knowledge for your well being.
Forgiving does not mean forgetting and does not require reconciliation. I think for your own safety, you should not meet in person, it just isn’t worth the risk. He can eye you a letter or maybe do a video call but your safety is more important then his desire for an in person meeting.
Fuck that guy
Nah I’d write him and let him know his life is eternally effed and there’s no point in trying to fix it. (Most likely true but if not I’d still want him to think so)
Would it be helpful closure for you? Only entertain if this can get you past any potential lingering trauma.
Fuck him what an arsehole
Don’t entertain this, for safety reasons. Forgive if it helps you, but you don’t owe him forgiveness.
Forgiving someone is really about you. Its about recognizing that everyone is struggling and feeling pain. The world will continue no matter what you do, but you should do what you will feel proud of doing.  In the future you will hurt someone , we all do. Perhaps a car accident or misspoken words, but you will need to know that you can deserve forgiveness as well at that time.

The pope met and forgave the man who shot him. Do you feel that made the pope a better man, or a worse one? It changes nothing about the man, but it does define the pope.

Do what ever it takes to replace hate in your life with something more constructive.

Hate, will end up be far worse than the beating you took. Don't hurt yourself.
Check with the state agency that handles prisons if you’re thinking about it. I work for ours and we do have a program in which victims can meet face to face with the perpetrator of the crime against them. It’s facilitated through our victim services division. They are there at that meetup as well. They can advise you on if it would be a good idea or not.
I would never forgive him, he wants to do this to ease his conscience now that he is sober? No, no way. Let his conscience torture him. If some lunatic almost beat me to death, I would eventually stop hating for my own sake but I would never take his apology. That’s for him to feel better, screw him. The fact that he was capable of doing something like that shows he is more beast than human. He is probably doing the program to get some sort of benefit, like his parole or probation ends earlier.
The only thing that matters is whether you want this to happen. It doesn’t matter at all if he wants it.  Do what works for you.
Meet up with him and get your lick back /s
Stay clear. Like others have posted, a written apology,text, or a phone call will suffice.  No need to meet in person.
Fuck him. 99% of people who drink and do drugs, even addicts, dont almost beat someone to death. Let him stew for eternity with guilt and dont let him off the hook because he's finally started acting like a responsible adult. 
You are under no obligation to forgive and you're mental health doesn't rely and giving this person any more time in your life than you already have.
Is the guys name Earl by any chance?
Nope, nope fuckity nope nope. If he feels bad you should NOT let him have the gratification of apologizing; it doesnt even fecking make sense to waste a second on somebody who nearly beat you to death. It it were me, I would grab popcorn if I saw the dude bleeding out, but otherwise am definitely not trying to interact
Meet him, face your fear and possibly find closure. This is a once in the life time opportunity of growth for you. 
Go into it with the mentality that this is to benefit you and you are the one in control not him.
You are not responsible for their feelings. Protect your own wellbeing and nothing else in regards to that person
Go full no contact.
I would meet up and forgive him if I felt I was up to it, everyone else here seems to be reactive but if it was really that long ago and you’re feeling alright about it now I see no issues with an organized meet up with professionals there
People are saying that “you don’t owe him” but it doesn’t sound like you are doing this for him but for you. 

From my point of view where I was in a situation where I almost died because of someone, my wish is also to forgive them.. not for them for me.. and it could have a positive repercussion on them letting them see that doing the right thing is possible perhaps preventing them to do it again. 

I don’t think it’s stupid or dangerous for you to meet him in person but have someone with you and tell them they will be there. Ask them if they could have someone too preferably from their program. 

I think this could be a healing opportunity for the both of you that you don’t owe him but nonetheless risk being beneficial.
I didn't read the other comments so I'm not sure if this has been said. If you're still in therapy, talk to your therapist about this. They are there to help you understand what's going on in your brain. If you're not in therapy anymore, consider going for a month or so just for this issue.

Asking people on the internet for advice is great but for something this personal, that took you this long to come to terms with, it's best to check in with a professional.

I hope it all works out for you!
If it help give you closure go for it. If it's going to cause you more grief and pain just send a not accepting his apology and how you feel. Leave it at that.
YOU get to decide when the time is right for an apology from him. There is no right or wrong amount of time, including ‘never’. He must wait for you. No one should ever pressure you. In fact, they should all stop asking or even bringing him up in any way.
If it feels helpful to you, do it. If it doesn’t, don’t. You don’t owe him accepting his apology. He should better himself with or without you accepting his apology
His apology only makes himself feel better. All it will do for you is muddle up your own mental recovery. The right thing to do is take care of yourself. Whatever that looks like.

Edit: You can forgive that person anyway you like. mail, zoom or just by sitting in your own house and thinking it.
What the hell is a cis het male
You're not obligated to hear an apology or offer forgiveness.


However, in my experience the people that do are much better for it. The human heart does not understand fairness, but it does reward empathy. 
Hell nah
I'm not a pro, but I feel his apology only serves him. Fuck him, let him live with it. My humble opinion
You should forgive him in your own mind to get some degree of closure. As far as expressing forgiveness to him personally, nah. This idiot nearly killed you, and intentionally at that. How do you even know if he is truly remorseful? Perhaps he only wants forgiveness to ease his own conscience. Either way, he doesn't deserve forgiveness. You mentioned there are common friends between you. If the subject of forgiveness ever comes up, you might want to tell them to tell him that he is not ever going to get your forgiveness. Not because you are angry, afraid or bitter but because he has shown himself to be unworthy of your presence, let alone your forgiveness.
You don’t have to forgive them. Like seriously fuck that guy. I hate when ppl say you have to forgive. Because it’s always about them, and fuck them. I had my own situation. They did what they did so why do I have to now make them feel better about it. If you feel like you need to for yourself. Then by all means do. But that’s for yourself to decide and they dont need to be a part of that. I would rather heal and forgive myself before and if they get theirs.
I once met up with an ex from years ago who left me abruptly/without any warning.  I was devastated for many, many months.  

By that time I'd moved on, I was happy, I was glad I met up with her that day for lunch... Until I drove away.   That's when every emotion I felt when she first left me came rushing back.  It was unbelievable how it seemed to put me right back in that moment from years ago.  It was very tough.  

I share this not to warn you, just hoping you're certain you're prepared to go through something similar.  I can't imagine the rage/anger you must have felt and may feel again.  

GL with however you handle it.
You don’t owe this person anything. If you don’t want to you don’t have to accept the apology or even hear him out. The ball is in your court and no one can be upset at you for however you choose to deal with the situation. Do what you feel will help yourself the best. But whatever you do don’t force yourself into meeting with this guy unless you’re sure that’s what YOU want
I think that what you could do is say that you wouldn’t be ready to meet with them in person. If this is about someone making amends, your reaction is not what matters. They need to be okay with writing an apology or working with their sponsor to do that. 

This amends process is not to make them feel better, it is a process to make others feel better. If this will not make you feel better, then it would be outside the program anyway.
You can forgive someone without ever seeing them in person again, or getting an apology from them. 

If there is a ruling in place that he cannot contact you or be near you, going through your friend is probably violating that. 

He is not respecting the boundaries of the consequences of his choices and actions, and by requesting to see you in person, no matter what he is telling others, is highly suspicious. 

I would cease the third party contact and perhaps schedule some therapy to discuss it.
Do not meet him! 

I feel like his could lead to emotional abuse. If he actually had transformed he would realize that and would realize that in person is inappropriate. He would write a letter and give it to a mutual friend. 

No way do not do it!
Came to say essentially the same thing . This will be a lot. You need to really look twice before moving forward with any in person anything. 

I found out a past abuser moved to the same continent as me a few years back, and it knocked the air out of me. It really shouldn't have he had a history of stalking and I ghosted him so completely and changed every aspect of my life that it totally freaked me out knowing he was an hour away from me. Immediately, I applied and was granted a residency visa to a country in yet another continent, I was actually  considering it at the time and guess where he lives now. I now live back near London. But the death-grip fear had on my soul was complete.  Just have an exit plan. Or three.  ( I worked out my leak and plugged it. Yeah, it was my pick me best frienemy)
“We made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.”

- Step 9

As a person who participates in a twelve step program, it very explicitly states in our literature that sometimes the *best* amends are indirect amends. 

It is great that he is working towards making himself a better person, but OP, you do not have to engage with him if it is going to re-traumatize you. If he had gone over this with his Sponsor during his 8th step, they likely would have told him it would be best to make indirect amends on this one. Indirect Amends can look like a lot of things, like maybe donating to a charity that focuses on what you did to harm the person. The best amends a person can make is just *never committing that action again.*
This is what I came to say. Let him write to you OP, don’t meet him in person. This guy beat you half to death. I can’t see it being good for you to see him in person again. Keep yourself safe, mentally and physically 🤍
THIS^^^^ I think it's unsafe to meet with the individual who almost killed you.  Safety first OP. You Do Not have to physically meet this person. Hard pass.
Wonderful reply.
Maybe the person has genuine remorse. Or not. First try to reconcile over mail. Or text. Only if you are comfortable, meet personally in the public. You are not obliged to. It’s only your call.
I am not sure you should have any contact with him.  He could be mentally ill or a personality disorder, so no, too risky.
Just read this!
I mean in a situation like this I think most would just do a living amends, where you don’t contact you just live your life in a new way. I left I were his sponsor I’d be like yeah write him a letter but really think about even sending it, it could bring up real trauma
Yes!! No harm is the key! He doesn’t even need to contact you. He wants to give the amends to OP to absolve himself. It’s selfish. He wants to feel better and brag about how he’s been forgiven. You don’t reach out to people who you traumatize. My abusive ex did the same thing. Messaged me to make amends for his own conscience. It retriggered the nightmares and I had to go back on meds. Fuck people like this. 

You make amends to the people
You’ve traumatized by being a good person to others now. You don’t dig up someone’s trauma.
Hi. Thank you for your words. I do appreciate them.
I feel like I need to clarify something for some people in this thread, I can do an edit if necessary.
This wasn't a domestic violence situation.
I got caught in a dark parking lot by an individual who blamed me for certain things outside of my control.

I don't feel pressured to forgive him. I have been told I have an extreme amount of empathy at times for people who don't deserve it. I've tried to understand what would lead a person to become the way he became and what made him do the things he did. I'm in no way excusing his behavior, simply trying to understand it. If that makes sense.

I believe that over the years I've run the gambit on the stages of grief. I'm in a good place with it, I'd like to think, and believe that I am in the acceptance stage. I haven't thought of this situation in many months and am only thinking of it now because of this "reconnection".
Do you think it’s normal/healthy for someone to skip the anger stage? 

I am a survivor of childhood sex abuse. I’ve never felt anger toward my abuser or any individual tbh. I do feel anger/frustration toward societal systems that wrong all of us though so I know I am capable of feeling these emotions.
I LOVE this. I find the Judeo-Christian concept of forgiveness so deeply destructive because of its focus on the perpetrator. I FULLY understand all the gymnastics its advocates go through to explain that away, but there shouldn't have to be gymnastics. It comes from a patriarchal, classiest, and racist cultural tradition that is all too painful grounded in historical human vices. The focus of healing should always be on the victim.

Sometimes perpetrators have also been victims at some past point. Rather than forcing their victims to figure that out and deal with it - often WHILE society and the perpetrator continue to fail to do so! - is just another crime. Maybe if we were better about focus on victims and healing through our society we would make fewer perpetrators in the first place.
THANKS

Seems like people normally consider being consumed by anger and forgiveness as the only 2 possible outcomes, while that is very much not the case
I love this response. Kudos!
This should be higher up! This is spot on
the apology is for himself to feel better, not for you
I'm not disagreeing with you. Is it misguided to think that maybe this last step towards forgiveness might help me? I understand that what he's doing may just be for himself. I'm secure with that. I know I don't owe him forgiveness but for myself I've wanted to.
Some people do change and try to better themselves. Not saying OP should meet them unless they genuinely believe it will help but I personally think it's good to not assume the worst intentions. 

Hopefully whatever OP chooses ends up bringing them more healing and comfort.
Thank you. That's what has me stuck. Forgiveness is one thing. Trust is another. Obviously I'd never meet him somewhere that I didn't feel 100% safe. I just don't know where.
This is what I was going to suggest! A restorative justice organization can help facilitate this process in a way that makes you feel safe.
That's fair. None the less, I have appreciated all the responses.
People keep throwing around the phrase, but the criminal setting up a personal meeting with the victim is not a good example of restorative justice.

The first of the three core elements of restorative justice is encounter, which is a **facilitated meeting.** Not, yo, can we meet at the mall so I can apologize? 

If the perpetrator would like to apologize under the guise of restorative justice, then they need to do the work to set up a facilitated meeting.
No man, stay away.

If you have to come on this board to ask for permission then you are not ready and you may never be but that is okay, it's your life we are talking about.

You had many chances to visit the guy while he was in prison, confined and in a secure place. But something in your gut kept you away.

This apology stuff is part of his story not yours, you don't owe him a damn thing.

Good luck.
Holy crap, I'm so glad that you're safe. Nobody should be forced to Jason Bourne themself like that, I hope you never have to again.
You might want to review/edit or delete this if that person is a current concern..
>moved to the same continent

oh well

>an hour away from me

ah.
How did you find out it was her? 😨 And this sounds like it should be your very own off-my-chest post!
That frenemy is fucking evil. I’m so sorry, fuck that rancid piece of shit for endangering you like that.
Also, amends are not apologies. They're supposed to be an attempt at repairing the harm done. I'm not sure what that would look like in this situation, but an in-person apology isn't an amends.
Thank you. 
You forgiving him isn't the same as him asking for forgiveness. You can also understand without talking to him. Mental health is pretty straight forward. 

From personal experience it just brought up that rage and anger I worked good to get over. Whatever you choose. Good luck
Sounds like he tracked you, stalked you, and attacked when he knew you were isolated. This was a deliberate, premeditated attack. The 5-year sentence suggests the evidence was damning.

At no point should you be in face-to-face contact with this person. I would also tell your friend to stop updating you.

Don't waste time trying to 'understand' him. Live your own life.
First I want to say that I’m so sorry you experienced that. I don’t think there’s any right or wrong way to go through trauma. Everyone is different. You have every right to feel anger and frustration toward societal systems that have wronged you. I totally understand that. We have come a long way but there’s still A LOT of work to be done. Please take care of yourself
I agree with your statement. Is it possible that both sides could feel better with letting this happen? I'm honestly really torn about it. I want to forgive for my own sake but I'm trying to do a threat assessment.
Award
i hate to be so callous but you dont gain much even from the best case scenario of meeting him. i dont even want to mention the worst case, but if this is something you are seriously thinking of you need to seriously consider all options. could i also ask what you are seeking from potentially meeting him?


you have no idea if he has truly changed. 
all you know is what you are being told.

i highly, highly recommend against meeting him. if you really feel to talk to him he can write a letter where you are safe and far away from him.
He can always write his apology and you don't have to meet him.
Talk to your therapist to explore your options.  If you do choose to meet him, do it in public and bring a friend.
Be cautious. He could be setting you up so he can finish the job if you will.
Hahaha, yeah, looking back, it was an extreme reaction, but it didn't feel that way, not at that time. I have the bonus of having friends all over the place, and my family have always travelled, so it wasn't seen as extreme. Honestly, I was literally running away from my problems. But I didn't want to be a statistic of dv, so I ran hard. I recommend it. 

The socialised way women are taught to be polite often is what leads them into risky situations with violent men. Distance and time mean I have no fear of being rude or causing a scene to remove myself from his proximity, that wasn't always the case. I knew that, j knew he could do anything, and I was too afraid to cause a fuss would never dream of making a scene.
Thanks, but it's unlikely to be an issue now.
She was the only person I told my new escape plan, she kinda admitted to it, she kept contact with him, she said to help protect me. It just didn't add up. With help of a mutual friend, I found out that she was in regular contact. It was unexpected as she was one of the key people who tried to help me get out of his cluches. 
Essentially, she let it slip while drunk, caught in her own lie.
I’m trying to imagine this guy thinking it’s a good idea to say, “I know that when I did *x* I traumatized you. What can I do to make this right?”

I really have a feeling this was never mentioned to a sponsor. I know when I first got clean I wanted to try to fix something’s and made them so much worse. When I came around to my 8th step, not only did I have to put the original situation down, but I had to put the follow-up situation on there as well. 

It’s why it’s so important we don’t try to “fix” all of the harm we caused when we first get into recovery. The steps are in order for a reason, and you work them with a sponsor!!
Why does it sound like that? A friend of mine manages a pizza place and this drunk/high guy thought one of their drivers was stealing his pickup truck and partially strangled the delivery driver getting into his own vehicle.

Another friend got into a fight at a bar because this drunk was convinced my friend was fucking his gf, but they had no idea who the drunk guy or his gf were 

I know it's inconceivable, and perhaps even frightening, to imagine you can have your life ended or severely impacted for a total stranger's irrationality and paranoia, but it happens all the time, just look at school shooters
Thx!
This is up to you. The reality is it's potentially a closure moment for them, but it might be a trigger moment for you, or a closure moment for you if you can accept their apology. Under no circumstances should you feel guilty or required to deal with it though. It's an act of charity most of the time, at best, and at worst can cause you yourself some damage.

If anything, I'd prefer something in writing long before anything else.
Threat assessment here is: extreme.

Your attacker is still asking you to do things for him. He wants to see you face to face to get a good look at you now.

Do not do this.
Let yourself heal and move on and if you feel the need to forgive him then do so without seeing him face to face. He wants to apologize to help him overcome his own guilt and help himself. He doesn’t need to see you face to face. I worry that could bring up old trauma for you
You don’t need to meet him to forgive OP! My worry is that meeting him may actually trigger a lot of your trauma that you’ve worked so hard to heal from. 

It’s one thing having the image of him in your memory, it’s a whole other thing actually looking into his eyes. If you want to go ahead with meeting him OP, I would strongly suggest you only do it with a therapist’s support. 

Trust your gut OP. No need to rush this decision. I do agree with the other answers though, he’s apologising for his own benefit, not yours. Stay strong OP and do what’s best for you! You don’t owe him anything. ❤️
It is up to you about how you feel about it. You are under no obligation. If you think it would help you, do so. Otherwise, do not.

I am also going to disagree with the whole "people only apologize for themselves" viewpoint. Sometimes people who apologize do it for non-selfish reasons. That is not to say they don't also get something out of it, but it can come from a place of knowing they owe you something meaningful and admitting that with no expectation of anything in return. Humbling oneself before another person is not an easy thing for many people, which is why there are so many useless apologies--but their rarity doesn't mean that they don't exist.

So yes, I think a real apology could be cathartic for you. Only you will know if it will be, though.
If you feel like you want or need an apology, then allow the apology to happen. But protect yourself and don’t do it in person.
It's very personal only you know. Over the years you have tortured yourself over it. If he is in a program you guys could meet at a court house or with a parole/probation officer. Just go about it in a safe way. 
Good luck. There are no wrong answers
Don't know what I would do in your situation, but I've heard a couple stories about perpetrators apologizing to victims that were healing for both parties, as part of a restorative justice program.  I imagine that some of these meetings don't go well, though.  Maybe research restorative justice and get opinions from others in your shoes.  These meetings always have a third person mediator, so I don't think it's a good idea to meet him alone.
You do not owe this person anything.

Say no.

You do not need to forgive something that is unforgivable.
I hope you see this. I had a sinking feeling reading your post. Do not go see him and ask this friend not to share any of your information with them. Some abusers blame the victim for going to Jail and do everything after to get vengeance. Please ask for a letter don’t share your address or any personal information. Praying for your safety. Also no need to focus on forgiving him. Forgive yourself for any guilt you hold against yourself. It was not your fault, you were not stupid to trust them, you didn’t know. Focus on your own healing.  Sending you love 💕💕
A very large friend
Good for you. I let my ex make amends in person and it totally set my recovery back. He asked what I need to make me "whole" then never attempted to do anything I said would help me (no financial restitution as an example). 


It was a clusterfuck of a 9th step attempt. But he appears to be sober and thriving so there's that. 
This is a really well written reply.
I just want to add a little note that, being triggered isn't always a negative consequences only type of thing During EMDR all you do is to be triggered, now the question is will OP have the resources that, if she decides to do this  she will have the right support there with her to bring her out of it, and help her get over this. If she is too trggered to do it in person I guess letter works for sure. 

It's such a complicated thing and I agree it's so personal, the important thing is that she listens to her gut and decides what will be better for her
OP is a guy actually.
:○   dang, I think I glossed over it :○
