TIFU by trying to bang a goth baddie, and my wife found out
My (31M) wife (32F) and I are in a healthy and happy relationship. That said, we’ve been together since high school, so we both feel that we missed out a little by being each others’ only sexual experiences. We’ve talked about this at length and decided a few years ago that we’re ok with having a few hall passes in our relationship, since we very much intend to stay together the rest of our lives and don’t want any resentment over missed possibilites. Plus it’s pretty rare that we could even find such an opportunity, as it’s a little hard to find hookups when you’re in a committed marriage and don’t go out much. We even gave each other advance approval in case a situation arises, so long as we’re safe about it and tell each other immediately afterward. We’ve both used one HP, each with someone we knew well enough but would never see again, and no issues came out of it. In fact, it’s only made us more secure in our relationship and how much we genuinely appreciate being with each other.

Recently, I had to travel to London for work. I don’t normally get to travel for work, so I decided to make a trip out of it and spend a few extra days of my own time in the city after the project was done. My wife couldn’t join because she didn’t have any vacation time left but was very supportive of me taking some time to explore since I’ve never been to London and she has. Being cheap, and being a pretty outgoing guy when I’m so inclined, I decided to stay in a hostel. I was interested in meeting other travelers since I didn’t know anyone in the city and love being sociable with new people. I chatted with several of the people staying there, and in particular a very attractive French girl (mid-20’s) who dressed super goth.

For context, I love the goth girl look. I’ve been sucked into the goth gf propaganda online, much to the annoyance of my wife. It isn’t her style, but she has been nice enough to cater to me by putting on a sexy goth outfit on occasion, since she’s knows it’s a huge fantasy of mine. Still, I pester her constantly to be more goth because I enjoy it so much. 

Anyway, I ended up spending a little bit of time with goth French baddie - we both went to the hostel’s happy hour event and hit it off there. I found out that she was recently single and was in London for an art show. It turned out we were both into emo music, and we talked about our favorite bands. I had the thought that she was acting a bit flirty towards me, but didn’t think too much of it, until I later found myself sharing a sink with her in the hostel bathroom. 

The hostel was co-ed, so each floor had a small shared bathroom with a communal sink, and a door that was meant to be kept open but which people frequently closed for the sake of having more privacy than just a stall to shower in. So I’m brushing my teeth while chatting up the real-life version of Shadowheart (who, mind you, is wearing an extremely low cut top), when she suddenly closes the bathroom door behind us. In my mind, my wildest fantasy is about to come true. It’s even more exciting because of the adrenaline rush of being in a semi-public setting, and a girl being so into me that she would make such a bold move. I can’t believe this is actually happening to me. I instantly get hard. Then she turns around and asks “Are you interested in learning about our lord and savior Jesus Christ?”

She had me cornered for 10 minutes trying to talk me into salvation, while I grew increasingly despondent and immensely disappointed, with the whiplash of going from what could’ve been one of the crowning moments of my life, to pure and utter dejection.

When I told my wife this story, she laughed for a solid hour. She said it’s karma for annoying her about wanting a goth gf. 

TL;DR life dream was to bang a hot goth girl. Thought I was getting the opportunity, but got cockblocked by Jesus Christ. god is real and he hates me.

Every woman reading this has a brand new weapon to get away from guys they don't want hitting on them.
Not the kind of missionary you had in mind, eh?
The lord giveth and the lord taketh away.
"Cockblocked by Jesus" is my new band name.
![gif](giphy|y2i2oqWgzh5ioRp4Qa)
Hahahahahahahaha oh my God, the fact Shadowheart is also very into her faith makes this story even funnier 😂
10 minutes? Why didn't you just hit on her, she would have stopped immediately and noped out!
"WIBTAH for pretending to be a christian evangelist to get rid of an annoying sex pest? For context i'm London for an art show...."
At this point i don't care if this story is fiction or not, its fucking great.
This is like those stories where the guy wants an open relationship and then strikes out and quickly realizes not that many hot women are into middle aged married men lol
"Goth French baddie" into "emo music"...

She was emo, dude. Not goth.  Unless she expressed an interest in Joy Division or The Cure or Bauhaus or some such goth originals, she was emo.
I’ll take “things that didn’t happen” for 10000
Ok chatgpt
You deserve what you got. This is what happens when you’re chronically online and watch too much porn.
Why do so many people believe this made up bs fantasy lol
"goth baddie" you're 31
Yea, this didn’t happen
Yeah this happened. Everything about thus story is totally real
Nice creative writing
Then everyone clapped
Fiction goes in r/stories
>Still, I pester her constantly to be more goth because I enjoy it so much

Wow what a great, healthy marriage. No red flags here.
That’s a fun way to quickly end the story. She should have said “I’ve been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty.” Next one
The title should be "TIFU by trying to band a goth baddie, and Jesus found out"
Wow, too bad. I hope your wife got to climb her mount Halsin at least.
This is really fucking pathetic
Alternative theory,  young lady getting hit on is uncomfortable and goes all jesusy to throw him off the scent.
This is gross from every angle
So many people would kill for a committed, stable, relationship. Why put it in jeopardy by both of you agreeing to something like this? I've read this story a thousand times, and it almost never works out.

Good luck OP, but...ah well, maybe I'm just being a party pooper.
Tbh as a goth girl this is some shit I’d pull. Yes there’s the whole goth gf goth baddie meme, but please don’t think we’re trying to be sexualised based on our fashion
Personally as a goth, I’d do that just to fuck with you. I hate when guys flirt with me because my culture is a wide spread fetish apparently
You have just given me the best idea for how to get men to leave me alone...
Couldn't think of a faster way for an erection to disappear
You ok bro? Tf

Honestly these kind of post are so weird.

Like, you find someone who is suppose to be your soul mate and then you just… want to have sex with other people….?

Like. These people are the ones who aren’t ready for relationships and are only in them because they found the one person in like 20 years who even looked at them.

Saying the “crowning moment of your life” would have been to have sex w a woman that isn’t your wife? Yeah… straight up 🤡
You didn't go with "Jesus has helped us come together"?
Besides this being total BS, open relationship people are weird.
Jesus didn't cockblock you guys. She knew you were into her and wanted to put you off lmao.
Men who agree to opening their relationship with all these ideas of the girls they gonna bang.

Then they realize that the women aren't really all that abundant.

However, there's hundreds of men that will seek out and bang your wife without her trying.


Good luck fella
> I’ve been sucked into the goth gf propaganda online

What does this even mean? I was a "goth" kid through most of middle and high school but I have no idea wtf people are talking about when they talk about some weird fetishized concept of a "goth gf"........ in general, goth girls are just...............girls.

Had a similar thing happen. Met a girl at a club. We chatted and danced for a few hours. Got her number towards the end of the night and spent a couple weeks chatting. She invites me to a bbq. I show up and it’s a fucking mlm pitch meeting…
This whole thing is made up. He simply wrote down his fantasy. And, your wife "didn't find out" you told her you dork.
Imagine forcing your wife to dress “goth” so you can fulfill your weird fantasy… Sounds like you wish your wife was someone else. Yikes.
Being okay banging random other people in a committed marriage is weird as fuck my dude.
Goth baddie LMFAOOOOOOOOO I’m using what she did in the future. Weird dudes like you are everywhere now😔
OP literally the meme about the most average whitebread dude lusting after goths yet offering nothing to reciprocate that specific attraction dynamic.
I'm glad i don't have your guys relationship.  Weird.
This happened to me the first time I ever tried to go on a date with a girl, as a girl. I thought we were going to be making lesbians and instead she plops down a fking bible and explains that homosexuality is a sin. I even got all dressed up and bought her flowers too :(
Had me in the first 3 quarters not gonna lie
How are people eating this story up? It's so contrived. And the marriage sounds broken.
Most made up shit I've ever read
"Tried to bang a goth baddie. My wife and I are in a healthy and happy relationship."  
  
Bailed right there. No, you're not in a happy healthy relationship, you're a couple of unhealthy people who use sexual promiscuity as an excuse to stay together. That's weird. But at least you learned a little about the Lord.
I thought you had a happy, healthy relationship? Why you out looking to bang a goth chick? If she's mad? I thought you had "prior approval" for this sitch.. I hope you suffer the consequences of your own actions. LOLOL
The hot goth girl appoach is impressively next level flirty fishing!
Hall pass situation gonna come back and bite y’all in the ass eventually
🤣 Thank you for this story, I needed a good laugh & new technique to say 'nah son'. 

-Sincerely, a goth girl who will 100% use this maneuver to ward off horny dillweeds
Your community college writing class is gonna love it.
I don’t believe a word of it
Ending sounds made up for sure
Sensationalist title
> I pester her constantly to be more goth

As a goth, you sound really fucking annoying dude. Nothing worse than a guy who loooves goth girls.
Open relationship equals trash relationship
Someday your wife is going to dress up for Goth role-play, and then just talk about Jesus.
[removed]
*dying pacman sound*
This turned out wayyyy different than I thought it was going to 😂

Funny all around
You didn't FU, you got turned down by someone who had no interest in sleeping with you. 

Your wife didn't "find out" you straight up told her. She laughed at your pathetic story. 

This is Today I FU. Not, I am a Big FU.
How often does one stay in a hostel on a business trip?
1. \**makes funny fictional story about relationship hall passes working in a relationship with a humorous twist*\*

2. \**waits for it to reach the front page.*\*

3. "See honey?  People do it all the time, and they're in healthy and happy relationships!  Now please let me hook up with Jessica just this once!"
Wow what a amazing and totally true story.
this is just like a fever dream of an ex-Mormon
You, understandably, gave her the ick. She came at you with the best old creep weapon out there. I applaud her, well done. 
Nice story, homie. Not quite believable enough though.
Hmm, a French goth who’s also a manic Christian? That’s such a rare combination that she must have been having you on.
bahah fabulous, serves you right for seeing goth women as your sexual fantasy!:)
I too have a devastating weakness for darklings. But then I've also been going to goth clubs for the past 20 years. It's a much more reliable way of meeting the ones that would rather share damnation with you. Have you heard the good word about the Morning Star and our lady Lilith?
Never in my life have I met a mainstream religious goth, the French are doing it different lmao
I had to tell my wife about the attractive lady that was super chatty on my flight home from a work event.  I explained that it was obvious by her body language that was interested in something more than idle airplane conversation.  The she invited me to join her at her hotel!   I was already to say no and do so.  And then she explained that I would missing out on an amazing job opportunity with her MLM team. 

I was devastated. I thought that old me still had it.  

She laughed and laughed.  She reassured me that I still had it.   And then laughed some more.
I don’t come here for fanfic.
That's a sign.

Don't fucking cheat on your wife.
My friend called me the other day and said Mormons just stopped by her house. She was explaining the resulting conversation, telling me how she made up a whole story about going home once a month to go to church with her parents, blah blah blah. I’m like girl why are you trying to justify yourself to these people, you owe them nothing. She was like but they were so cute!

The levels of nonsense some of y’all put up with from people you think are attractive is shocking to me.
Congrats on your degeneracy that has "made your marriage stronger"
Oh she’s actually shadow heart lmao
I hope your wife gets a Nun outfit one day to surprise you when you ask her to get into a goth outfit. My kind of humor would love that joke as I wouldn’t expect to live this down for a while haha.
Deserved. You sound gross and desperate.
FAAAAAAKE.   Karma farming.  Posted the same story six days ago and had it deleted.
Guys who talk about goth women in this way are so incredibly revolting to actual goths
You let your wife sleep around? What kind of low testosterone man are you😂
are you sure she wasn't a nun?
Sounds like you met a member of the "Jesus Freaks"
It's kind of an interesting group of alternative looking Christians. The ones I met were really kind and focused on the teachings of Jesus. As an atheist, nothing I can connect to, but I liked their freakish side.
Exactly what dogmatic Shadowheart would do anyway lmao
The way my disappointment would've been so tangible I could've sold it for profit to people who are too happy
Skipped the FA and just FO
The clickbait title was smart
What a wild ride. I absolutely thought this was going to go differently at the beginning. I love your marriage. You and your wife seem to have a great thing going.
Bruh.. You tried to bang Shadowheart and were surprised it turned into a religious lecture? What BG3 did you play?
Bro, if you have the green light and the situation arise:

You are literally an agent sent from god, to spread his word through your penis.
Is the goth equivalent of blue balls called black balls?
This happened to me as well except she didn't want to save my soul she just wanted it. We're married now.
Did you get a de-rection? Maybe if you open your mind a little bit talking about Jesus can give you a resur-erection
My man got Jesus zoned.
You did *not* have me in the first half, but goddamn was it funny at the end
I got nothing.
God is real and He was protecting you and your marriage lol. All jokes aside, this hall pass thing is playing with fire! It will bite you in the ass in the long run.

BTW, I married my husband at the age of 20 and he is my only sex partner. I don’t regret it! My husband did have prior experience, but he wishes he didn’t. We have been together for 34 years now.
If real, you both got a really good story to tell.. courtesy of her. She just thought it would be really funny, I'd bet.
Was this a real story? That was NOT the ending I expected and I was fully invested in you banging this goth baddie. 😫
As a goth, I’ll keep this in my arsenal the next time I receive unwanted male attention.
OH SHIT IVE BEEN WANTING TO USE THIS FOR SO LONG.


YOU GAVE YOUR WOOD FOR JESUS CHRIST.

Huh, that wasn't nearly as pleasing as it should have been.....
When I read shit like this I just really appreciate my marriage.
I feel like this situation was pre karma for your misleading title.
French goth chic: "Are you interested in learning about our lord and savior Jesus Christ?"

Oh, sure thing, because a French goth chic would obviously talk like a preacher in the US Midwest, right?
Plot twist: That was part of the foreplay and you misread the situation in the opposite direction entirely.
She sensed your intentions and this is how she broke you. So much schadenfreude for your wife lol.
I think your girl owes you a goth girlfriend night where she gets all decked out in dommie mommie gear and ruins you
I was almost expecting the ending to be her asking you if you knew that in 1998, the Undertaker threw Mankind off "Hell in a Cell".
But I say unto you, what God has joined together, let no goth baddie tear apart.
You all are brave. Opening up marriages and using hall passes is so risky.
It destroys a lot of relationships. That was really funny though.
It would be more believable if she said “I would like to talk about your car extended warranty” instead.
I'm glad I skimmed this garbage.  Reddit is just a tank of shit.
Classic tifu fodder.

![gif](giphy|OBuyIUMHO6yVq)
What an interesting creative writing piece. Testing the waters a second time with it?
I went looking for trouble…and boy, I found her.
I can’t decide if it’s more pathetic to have this happen or make it up to post on reddit tbh
Yeah this one is 1000% real. 
You losers don't even fucking try anymore
[removed]
People tend to forget some goth people wear crosses not just for a fashion statement but because they believe

That's the thing about Christianity, true Christians accept EVERYONE. And treat EVERYONE with love and respect. If they're being hateful in any way they're just a cultist
*I've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.*

– Shadowheart
This is an M. Night Shyamalan level third act twist lmao
I thought this was going to end with a goth baby.....10/10 ending lol
Oh my fucking hell the CACKLE i just had hahahahaha 😂😂😂 my man that is near worst case scenario 😂😂😂
This turned out to be way more wholesome than I thought it was going to be. Sounds like you and your wife have a good thing going. So congrats on that at least.
This was so good. I was so hopeful for your French experience! Damn.
Fucking for Christ.
Hey bro I'm a Christian and believer in Christ. I don't think I've ever read something funnier than this! I love God but I totally understand your frustration! 🤣🤣 Wow! I did not see that coming! Freakin' plot twist!!
>When I told my wife this story, she laughed for a solid hour. She said it’s karma for annoying her about wanting a goth gf. 

Relationship goals.
Holy he'll I'm dying right now
 You delivered that story perfectly. I did not read ahead I read it intensely like fuck yes he's about to get some.. LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO. Then pow! Get boned.
What a stupid story
As a goth chick... OP, I gotta say, I wouldn't hold your breath on that fantasy becoming a reality any time soon. I'm not even the girl you were hitting on and I still feel the ick from here.
Pathetic pos
You are 31 and you use the word ‘baddie’ Jesus Christ that’s tragic
[deleted]
For every trick we have to avoid them, there's 100 men who it won't work on 😭🤣
It's also how Mormons rope you in. I literally got baptised Mormon cause I was down bad & they sent some hot girls to "teach me scripture." The Sunday I'm consommated or whatever (you go up in front of the congregation and have all the priests put their hand on your head) I learned I would never see the hot girls again, except in passing at church. I left in the middle of the service & never went back.
This is a brilliant idea lmao thank you for pointing it out
My guess is that this woman WAS using this as an escape route to get this horny bastard off her 😂
"Yeah baby, I'm into it, let's be fruitful and multiply"


You're just going to end up getting a bunch of Fisherme for Christ, and rape vibe youth pastors.
Haha yeah, my first take was that she noticed OP was a bit too into her for her perceived safety and decided to play it safe by playing the jesus card to creep you out before going to sleep.

Not saying they were necessarily being creepy, but it's the kind of trick a baddie (goth or not) would use to deter further attention. Just a theory.
My first thought is that she wanted to ditch him.
In my 20s when I got divorced the first time a hot chick invited me to church. I said sure, went, it was 10 people speaking in tongues in a store that was empty. They passed the offerings basket like 4x. I still stayed till the end. I probably would have passed a snake if I had a chance.
I can't wait to use it 😂
now I'm gonna get this when I try to have normal conversations with them
The unholy cackle I unleashed, thanks for this.

Solid gold comment. Jesus this is funny, just a goth girl with a French accent is funny.
Brilliant!
Rock solid but then a little soft finishing comment.
He was looking for, "Sorry, Daddy, I've been naughty", but he got, "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned."
His cup doth not runneth over
More like the goth giveth and the goth taketh away
The Lord give goth and the Lord goth taketh away.
XD
"God is real and he hates me" is also an excellent choice. 
I prefer Jesus and the Cockblockers
Can I join
Back with another one of those cock-blockin' beats
Fr I thought this was another "AITA for having an affair?"

10/10 twist
Right? When it started off with "we have a happy and healthy relationship," I scoffed and said "no, you don't" because I thought I knew where the story was going.
The twist is what makes this a quality fan fic.
ayyyy
“Are you interested in hearing about our lady Shar?”
I know. I am currently playing my 5th Durge playthrough and on the BG3 sub everyone is lusting over her and I just generally think it is FUNNY AF that he uses her as a reference for hotness lol
My response to her would have been “S'il vous plaît, et je dis cela en tant que Sharran, cherchez Selune”

https://preview.redd.it/9jyr6cg0jvgd1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36da29e9c3e85861724c14ec6b7545c88340b112
I'm over here thinking genuine goth baddie and then he says Shadowfart and immediately I knew his day was ruined, and she's not Really all that Goth. Amazing 👏
Hahahahahaha ikr almost like it’s made up or something lol hahahhaha
I was completely stunned and didn’t know what to do
Or redoubled her efforts to 'save' you
Blood was not in brain-head…thinking difficult…confusion insurmountable.
I guarantee you, she did this because she could tell from a mile away he was going to hit on her and decided to have some fun making sure that would absolutely not happen!
She was into him, but then noticed the ring when they went into the loo to do the deed + quickly flipped the script.
She wouldn't have closed the door to be alone with him if she felt that way. She was the predator here trying to pull someone into her religion.
Guy (presumably American based on how he talks) goes to London FOR WORK but stays at a Hostel?


Doesn't add up, no business is sending youon a transatlantic flight then putting you up in a Hostel.
I swear it’s real, my wife my made me post it here lmao
I seriously thought this was building up to a two pump Charlie situation, so the introduction of Jesus caught me 100% of guard, and made me actually lol out loud. 

Hot Goth and Christian missionary is not a hugely overlapping Venn diagram, but with several billion people on the planet it's not totally impossible...  And even if it is a work of fabrication, that may just be the build up, where OP hasn't quite built up the patter he thought he had, but it does make for a excellent M Night Shyamalan tier twist
This happened in my EMT class. Guy and his wife go open at some point during class, he thinks it's great for him because there's a few girls in the class he wants to hook up with. Fast forward a couple of weeks or so where every girl in class rejects him and thinks he's lying about going open and is just trying to cheat on his wife, meanwhile he's telling the guys out of anger she's been getting plowed after opening the marriage and he's got nothing to show for it so far.

I didn't feel bad, he was really annoying. I stopped inviting him/going to his study groups because of the one incident where I was told he pulled out his conceal carry to just disassemble/reassemble it because he thought he was cool for having a gun. And he always found a way to interject into a conversation about how he has a big log cabin. He ended up failing the class lol
This guy knows nothing about goths. He’s just horny.
[deleted]
The goth girls I knew would have dropped that line about "our lord and saviour" as a coy pick up line.
Goth fetishization is gonna be the death of me. The way people talk about it is so foul
Right? Like he went to London on a business trip but had to pay for his own accommodation? And he chose a hostel?
What sorta 31 year old married dude gets sucked into "goth gf culture" and calls women "baddies"...


Made up shit i tell you
jeopardy doesn't go that high
Fr 🥱🥱
That and fetishizing Goth chicks. It's actually a thing and it's really fucking exhausting, lol
Even to go as far as pestering your wife to dress goth so you can fulfill your weird ass fantasy. Just say you’re not attracted to your wife & go man lmao
My first award 😭❤️ thank you!
exactly lmao
They want to because they're also creeps
Married man staying in a hostel while traveling for work…okay.
The whole thing is so cringe.
Thank god someone else stated. If that’s the 30 year old mindset we are doomed. Reads like a 15 year old anime fan.
For real. From the “goth baddie” to how he admits he “constantly pesters” his wife to be goth to appeal to his fetish, he’s really telling us all how annoying he is with this post lmfao
Allegedly!
My 35 year old roommate dropped “big titty goth gf” as a descriptor for a woman he met recently. Cringe, cringe, cringe. Way too old for that talk.
You know all those recent Neil Gaiman allegations? Yeah. Reading all this made me think of them. Can't put my finger on why...
My thought as well. Grow up man you’re well past adulthood at this point. Plus if they are both feeling they “missed out” the marriage isn’t as great as they think it is.
LMFAOOO this comment sent me.
THANK YOU 😭😭😭
So the thirty year old guy who un-ironically wields the term, “baddie” isn’t a true story? Rats.
yes in fact it is totally real, i'm the wife who's banging the mailman while my husband is out of town for work
France is one of the world’s least religious countries. The few percents of practicing Christians are made up mainly of older people. I can count on one hand the openly Christians people I’ve met during school. The idea that a Christian proselyte in their 20s would go with a goth look and open with the meme phrase “have you heard of our lord and savior” is laughable.

Edit : oh and I forgot, she closes the bathroom door, because if their is one thing women do when they are alone with an older man that they are not interested in is go talk to them when they are alone in a bathroom before locking the door behind them.

Edit2 : what job sends you on a business trip from the U.S. to London and requires you to pay for expenses so you have to stay in a hostel ??
Glad I’m not the only one that thinks this is utter bollocks.  Unless OP is referring to a London outside the UK then the sheer number of Americanisms in his post makes me doubtful that this is genuine.  Granted, if it is a London in the US or Canada then fair enough.
I especially liked the part where he said banging the hot random goth chick would have been a 'crowning moment in his life'. Wonder if his marriage to a woman he's supposed to love is above or below that in his ranking. Seems super healthy
[removed]
Can't have red flags if it's imaginary.
Right, I feel so sad for this dudes wife.
Eewwww
The resentment aspect of this confuses me. Did someone force these two people to marry? The expectations were there from the get-go, and everyone signed on the dotted line. Any resentment stemming from maintaining those expectations is rooted in discontentment, envy, and the objectification of other's bodies, and it should be discouraged.
Was going to say this, if this story is real, she was absolutely fucking with him. When I was a young goth, “normal” older guys hitting on me because they had a fetish was always a) really obvious, and b) absolutely repulsive. 

If this is a true story (and I honestly doubt it is), she’s laughing at OP with her friends right now and is going to be telling this story for a while.
Yup. The guy saying he pesters his wife “to be more goth”, yuck. I don’t like the idea that my style sexualizas me to married weirdos.
as another goth girl, i despise people fetishizing us and pretty much every detail in this story makes me uncomfortable
From another goth, yeah, if the story is real to begin with, she probably sussed him out pretty quickly and knew exactly what she was doing.
Where can I read about goth culture that you’d recc?
Not if you have a Jesus fetish. Man my wife hates when I try to get her to look more like Jesus.
I stopped reading when he mentioned "hall passes". Some people are pathetic lol
One of them will be single soon enough lol
bedroom ten dam cagey aspiring narrow advise deserted pause hateful
And then basically saying his wife isn’t even his “type”. That would make me feel so shitty
Almost as cringe as the way he objectifies women and compares them to video game characters.
Tell me you're not mature enough for a committed relationship without... You know the rest.

There's loads of other people in the world. You don't try to bang them all because you are scared you've missed out. That's so weird.
How is no one else saying this
Exactly! Idk and idc what this guy means by "goth gf propaganda", roleplay is fine, as is expressing what you find hot, but pestering your partner to change who they are day to day is gross. She wouldn't even be goth she'd just be hollowly dressing that way 🙄
When your business is making up stories on the internet I imagine as often as you need to.
Is it cheating if they agree on it and both do it?  Not something I'd want to do but I have no issue with others living their lives as long as its mutual.
Yeah I don't buy that any of this is healthy for their marriage
I've never understood this either. When my first wife started asking for an open relationship I knew the marriage was cooked. Shortly after that she moved in with her new man. If you wanna sleep around you don't need to be married.
Careful with that one, you might get a live one with a breeding kink and backwards ideas on women’s rights.
Sprinkle Sprinkle 😂
Shera! Sprinkle sprinkle
If a woman said this to me I would A get the hint but
B double over laughing my ass off that's so funny.
Ask if they’re circumcised or uncircumcised and then grimace regardless of their answer.
Definitely plenty of dudes who would get more turned on by the idea of the woman they’re trying to sleep with also being a holy Christian girl. Puke
Just try “I’m having an outbreak, I hope that’s ok…”
Only a hundred men, out of the 4 billion or so on Earth? I like those odds. 
Just tell them Lorena Bobbit is your hero
Years ago the Scientologists would use this same recruiting strategy.
Have you seen the ads they are running now or are they just for Spanish speakers inpuerto rico? Trying to rope in the simps with a couple hot girls speaking accented Spanish, lol. 

I mentioned to a gay friend if he is getting the same with men…. Got it the next scrolling session. But they weren’t as hot. Twinkish, but with dad bods at 18, lol
Trauma from the handsome tall mormon guys they send out to proselytize, seeing me in my house clothes.
AND Seventh Day Adventist. Had to awkwardly ask her to leave during my kids birthday after knocking on my door and leaning in the doorway suggestively blocking me from closing it.
Consommétion, that’s when they dunk you in broth
I feel like an easier way would have been to just.. not close herself in a bathroom with him? 😭 at least, i wouldnt have closed myself into a bathroom with a older guy that seemed super horny for me if i didnt have ulterior motives (in this girls case, preaching about jesus). I would in fact have avoided a closed room with horny dude situation at all cost
Then why would she close the door and corner him for an hour?
That is totally illogical lol
That doesn't even make sense

Found this comment at the perfect time.
I’m dead from these comment threads lmfao 💀
Lmfao
When you went to Reddit and there was only one goat post, that was when u/Jeffbx carried you.
🤣🤣
But his goth doth runneth? Or she dothn’t? Doth she?
His blue cup
Doesn't sound like the goth is gonna giveth before marriage.
That would be the debut album title
That seems like a good song name to me
Jesus and the Cockblockers. Debut album: cockblocked by Jesus (can call it self titled if you’re so inclined even though it’s not), and the first single is G-d is Real and He Hates Me. 

Cover art is a beautiful goth girl carrying a Bible.
No. - Jesus probably.
No
hurry! only 12 spots available!
“The darkness protect you.”
"Oh yeah whats she all about?"

"Just being plain-spokenly evil for the most part."

"Oh"
I lost it when he mentioned Shadowheart too. 🤣😂

Understandable.
"Our Lord and Savior expands myself unto overflowing. His holy love will fill your cup thru me. Come ye and partake."
Fat goth boners will do that
Translation: “For the first few minutes I still thought I had a chance to pivot into salvation sex…”
Did you gargle, rinse, and spit while she was proselytizing?
No one likes a cheater!
Feel like something like this is more likely assuming the stories true.  Or the guy was annoying her before and she got fed up.


No way an attractive 20 something goth girl closes the bathroom door and doesn't know the implication.  Also can't imagine that any missionary type would start preaching in the bathroom with the door closed or wait that long to give the spiel.  Those people hammer the Jesus on you within the fist 5 minutes of meeting them Everytime.
I dunno he sounds completely socially inept to me
And it's actually kind of believable if you're familiar with these evangelist types. Mormons and such will _absolutely_ weaponize hotties to lure people into their religion, lol.
If it’s like mine they’d only pay to put you in a not shitty hotel for work days but if you’re staying longer for personal travel they ain’t covering shit
claims to be 18+ but unironically says "baddie"
Dude, have you travelled for work for an American company? 

Did your company set you up in nice places?

Because mine never did, that shit was cheap as fuck.

If you want to go cheap, 99% would thrilled if you chose a hostel.  My company would have preferred a family member or just the fuckin street.

Cheap fucks everywhere.
He did say he stayed a few extra days, so that time probably wasn't covered by his employer and paid for the hostel out of pocket.
OP thank you for the laugh! I'll share a tale of mine. When I was newly widowed, about a year after I decided to try out that new thing everyone was doing, I think it's called dating? So, being all date site savvy I go on a widows dating site (It's a real thing!). Did you know that dating sites share data with each other? I did not at the time (I was with the same person for 25 years, get off my back lol). So I get connected to a BBC reporter! She's very cute, tells me I'm funny and she can't wait for me to fly on over to London....where we can get married in order to do the laundry list of unchristian things she's talked about for weeks! And of course join her church. And you know what? In a moment of absolute horniness I found myself looking up flights! Thankfully the rather large numbers in front of me settled my teakettle. It did not, in fact, work out.




Edit: I would like to take the time to apologize to any other very nice Nigerians meet Nigerians members who ALSO were unaware that their data was being collected. Because she had no idea and was QUITE offended her profile was on some ..rather unfortunate dating sites.
It sounds like you have a great wife.  Maybe the universe was telling you to stick to your wife exclusively.  If you are really nice, do your chores and romance her properly, she might just be a Goth Girl for you a little more often.
Imma be real dog, you don't talk like a 31 year old married man would.  Us millennials don't use gen z slang.  Nobody my age would ever say someone is a goth baddie.  Gotta get the slang right, it's crucial to building a believable character and story

  
Plus the French are catholic, we don't evangalize and we certainly don't evangalize like that.  The whole "have you heard of our lord and savior Jesus Christ" is some protestant shit.  In all my life I've never heard one catholic talk about Jesus like that
Daily reminder fellas, if your relationship is open, she's fucking way more people than you are
Exactly. Girl probably had pink hair and an outfit and he lost his nut.
True. All they see is an aesthetic, but don't pay attention to whether it's goth, emo, scene, or just depression.
No one truly knows what a real goth is. All we know is that they were typically very large meaty dudes with long hair, who kept Rome south of the Rhine, and eventually played a huge role in the fall of the western Roman Empire
reminds me of a post i saw that was like “i want a goth gf” sir she listens to my bloody valentine and loathe, she is clearly a shoegaze/nugaze head, you cannot tell the difference between tradgoth makeup and corpse paint she does not want you bro
Agreed, and it's that there seems to be no inhibition in expressing that fetishization, as there might be with any other.  My daughter is pretty genre-fluid when it comes to style, and typically goes more for the "skater girl" aesthetic than anything else, but occasionally goes with an all black, heavy eye, dark lipped look. I had to gently correct a young man's attitude when he referred to her as a BTGG.  I, a 6', 215 lb (and fit for my age), shaved head, silver goateed man with multiple earrings and natural guyliner, suggested that he apologize to her and not speak to any women like that again.  

Boys need to be taught manners by their fathers again.
If I go on a business trip and want to spend some extra days there, the company doesn't pay the extra days
Your expectations are far too high for reality my friend
An immature “man” that spends too much time on the internet
Fr. They're usually the types who say they want a goth gf but don't like goth music and get weirded out by hobbies. I want someone who is actually interested in me as a person and what I like.
Agreed. Back in the day people would avoid you if you were goth. Maybe even make fun of you. Now it’s everyone’s fantasy and fetish. I’m not even goth and I’m annoyed for them. lol
They don't even know what Goth is. I've been called a "goth chick" just because I wear chokers and heavy eyeshadow. Could be emo, punk, scene, alt - it's all "goth" to these dickthinkers.
Yesss so many people comment on my pictures saying 'mommy'

I am a sub I may look lethal but please stopppppp makes me uncomfy and the pics aren't sexual 😅
[deleted]
And he told the wife about the attempted adultery and she was just like “lawl, owned”?
Yeah, both statements had my eyes rolling.
TBF, he may have only stayed in the hostel for the extra couple of nights after the work trip was concluded.

If I need to travel anywhere for work, I'm sure my employer would be happy paying for the return trip a few days after my business was finished to allow me to have a bit of a break on their travel cheque, which they'd be paying anyway, but not so happy to spring for a hotel for an extra few nights - so I'd be on my own for that bit.
This guy sounds like a full creep and I’m pretty sure this story is made up
What age group do you think is saying things like this? Because it's not teenagers. I hate to break it to you but the cringe lines you associate with terminally online losers are mostly coming from 30+ online losers.
yup! it's giving "how do you do fellow kids"
I couldn't Imagine cheating on my wife because I wanted to try a different girl. What's the point of marriage at that point?
I think the part that gave it away is having a wife who's perfectly happy for him to go around fucking other men. If that isn't a fantasy then I don't know what is.
....well fuck. I guess I was wrong. Irrefutable evidence. 

Dammit.
+ super clickbaity title that misrepresents the story
I agree with what you said, except edit2, fwiw, I travel for work commonly and work only covers the days I’m there for them + flights. So booking a hostel for the extra days is reasonable
Also definitely a full grown adult married man, who calls girls “goth baddies”, absolutely NOT a chronically online horny teenager nope no way no how
> The idea that a Christian proselyte in their 20s would go with a goth look and open with the meme phrase “have you heard of our lord and savior” is laughable.

Except when she's doing it deliberately to get rid of the creepy guy. 😂
The hostel stay may have only been for the extra time they took after their work project.
He's clearly an American who traveled to London.
What? The story is very clear that OP traveled *to* London. Do you think Americans can't go to London on business?
There is a London in Ontario, Canada. Don't know if there would be hostels there though.
There’s too many creeps defending him. Here’s a pro tip for those desperate losers: people not taking no for an answer is the most unsexy thing. My number one turnoff and a lot of people’s as well.
Good he should never get laid
Women exist only to bring sexual pleasure in his world!
Definitely. If it is real I hope OP learned his lesson
100% OP sounds Gross, and I hope one day his love of “goth girls” (his perverse fantasy of women in dark clothes) comes back to bite him in the ass
As a goth girl, but also as a human, im sick of the sexualization like all across the board.
I am an older goth and the fetishization of our fashion and bodies (there is a special gross stereotype for my type) gets pretty old pretty fast.
Honestly, good for her; I know it would make for a great story lol
Lmao, that caught me off guard
Does she get cross when you try to nail her?
This got me as well. It's horrid, but then again OP is probably a horny 15 year old who made it all up.
And also acts like he's missing out on a key experience in life if he doesn't get to bang a Shadowheart lookalike.
Terms like honor, commitment and loyalty have no meaning anymore. People are becoming more and more degenerate.
This was my first thought. Anyone who is into this would be way worse than anyone put off by it
Diddnt work for my wife
plap plap indeed
Don't use the bible. Say you've been howling at the moon and praying to baphomet.
Sounds funny on Reddit but in reallife you will make a guy aggressive.
The people women are worried about would just show instead of tell if they're isolated, or pull the "you'll have to wait and see".
"I'm whatever you want me to be baby"
Nah. You cant do anything dick related. Women seriously get murdered even by saying innocent things.
Sell them something wilder, like Scientology or Mormonism. You know, the space opera religions.
Amputate and defenestrate.
Interesting, but it makes complete sense.

The Mormons have weird (but kinda smart) rules, like the girls can't enter a man's domicile w/o a chaperone. So, I would take them to the park & they would tell me how much like Jesus I was. They accidentally gave me one of their Book of Mormon copies during one of these excursions & I immediately noticed that inside the back cover was a laminated page on how to manipulate people.
So did Children of God, they callled it "flirty fishing". 
So did the Manson family.  'Flirty fishing."
twinkish, but with dad bods?

sir, im going to have to ask you to pull over you're clearly under the influence
I get ones for the Church of Latter Day Saints. The girls have crazy eyes like Alexandra Daddario.
UwU.
I refuse to be tethered by clothing. I have two sets of clothes, work clothes and everywhere else clothes. House clothes, I ain't changing clothes to leave the house.
[deleted]
Had twins come up to my house every Sunday when I was a teenager.  They stopped after I asked both of them out at the same time. They then sent guys to the house that stopped when I asked the guys out as well. My favorite was when we moved, My dad and I pretended to be a gay couple, and apparently, our house got blacklisted by the Mormons cause they never came back.
Maybe OP had been extra annoying the and the cruelty was the point? Like rejecting him wasn't enough, she had to build his hopes up first.

First 666, now 999.

HMMMMMMMMM
Now it's at 969 🤭
You oughta know.
I mean… she WAS god in the movie, and Jesus “is” the son of god, so…. Only makes sense they’d model it after her! Lol
That’s the hottest thought I’ve ever had.

Oh, so it’s a ska band
>And there she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses

Ezekiel 23:20
If anything my experience has been the total opposite somehow. I have to travel a decent bit for work, and I swear wearing a wedding ring makes the number or women who approach you at a conference, or in a hotel bar, or after a business dinner, like triple at least.
I mean i’m in my mid 20s and wouldn’t be surprised to hear it from someone my age
Thou shall rub one out before taking decisions of that magnitude.
Or she's really just not into it
Not every couple fits into that same mold that you imagine is the only true and valid way to have a happy marriage. These two seem perfectly happy with their arrangement.
I mean I absolutely would say Goth Baddie in the sort of jokey / going along with the current wave  way OP did.  I am 35. 

I agree Catholics don't do that stuff but not every person in France is Catholic.
He wouldn't have ever had a chance with a real goth chick.
[deleted]
They caused the creation of Venice! Kinda. The goths kept invading the mainland so refugees would pour into the shitty marsh and that happens enough times, ya get island city.
I've tried to explain to guys that the look does not match the expected persona.


Been with many goth women. They're mostly flat in personality and want to stay inside reading bad poetry. 


These guys think they're getting the mistress of the dark crossed with pornhub. 
Yeah it's a thing. It's why I'm not on any kind of popular social media, don't post pictures or anything about myself, and use generic, gender-neutral gamertags when I'm online gaming, lol.
I'd sleep on a park bench for a week if it got me a meal at Noma. Great tip. Unfortunately, our travel is all booked by corporate and the food per diem isn't covering a check from Noma. Do you have to use a corporate card or are you racking up cc points as well?
it’s not attempted adultery if they’ve talked about it and he has permission…
Why wouldn't she be?
Yeah, where even was the fuck-up here? The only negative consequences for the MC in this story were ten wasted minutes. At least post your writing aspirations in fitting subs.
Did everyone in this thread not read the first paragraph?
The fact that he pesters his wife to dress up goth all the time made me role my eyes.
Yeah, that's a specifically millennial 4chan user phrase. Maybe the zoomers have adopted it now, too.
And super cringy phrases like “goth French baddie”. 

I rolled my eyes at the “real life version of Shadowheart” part.
Yeah, a fair point well presented.  I dunno though, I’ve read the post a few times now and something just doesn’t add up for me personally.  Happy to be wrong and happy that OP has shared a story that people are enjoying.
She's always stigmatizing me 😪
Right? I don’t see how anyone even believes half the shit on here. I’ll see some outrageous post, ask the op something and they’re nowhere to be found 😂
SIGH  
*unzips Bible*
Hmmm, you might be right. 

How about asking if he knows any home remedies to get rid of tapeworms?
Sad you have to think & plan about that.
Almost any type of rejection can make a man aggressive... i know I'm generalizing but it feels true. 
The only honest take. So many guys need to be managed so we don't get killed.
Who knew insulting people would cause a negative reaction 🤯
Lmao. I laughed so hard at this. I was raised Mormon and I've never heard "space opera of religion" before. Ha ha ha.
"Ah my prophesied man is here as last. Praise Xenu. He shall now be pegged and sacrificed at your altar!" Then just witch cackle while staring at him with crazy eyes.
I feel like this should be embroidered on a pillow
Did you take a picture? Be interesting to see what strategies they use aside from using attractive people
I (female) got caught on a street corner once between a Children of God (male) and a Mormon (male). The two men were both trying to convince me to attend a meeting at their church, and then they started arguing about how their interpretation of “Gods word” was the only correct one throwing verses at each other, the works.

After a few minutes, I managed to sneak away and leave them to their “lively debate”.

Strangely I met the “Children of God” recruiter a couple of years later in London. He was then recruiter for Scientology…
You know exactly what I mean, lol. All blue eyed, rosy cheeked, eighteen-nineteen and blond hair, but with a noticeable paunch, lol
I like having house clothes. It's comfortable to come home, change into them and just visibly relax.
JWs need to step up their game. They only send oldies.
Gotcha. Just be gay? I can find a way.
Use dark mode you heathen. Lol.

It’s like numbers are sequential or something
Yo put me in the screenshot someone!
Ah, it burns! Turn on dark mode damn it!
One more down vote and it will be back.
That whole “cross I bear that you gave to me” lyric makes more sense now!
Well, blow me!
Man, the 1.0 version of the bible was crazy
vetted goods
As a woman, I really don't understand this. I see a ring or hear of a girlfriend, and straight away, I want nothing to do with him in that way. Granted, I'm in a long-term relationship, but even when I was single, taken men were immediately off the cards. I couldn't handle the guilt.
I think a big part of this is that married men are 'safe'. A woman can approach them and reasonably expect the married man to not hit on them. This has the effect that the woman is comfortable around and nice to the guy. The ironic part is most men think any woman being nice to them is hitting on them lol
This is actual fact. Women see someone was good enough to marry and want it. An older man without a ring clearly had undesirable traits if he is still single.
The universe or the wife? 
Yeah but practically all christians in france are catholic.  Like 2% of their religious population is protestant compared to like 52% catholic
Depends on what his level is on the Peter Steele-ammeter.
Especially if he’s out here trying to cheat on his wife. Goths don’t like cheaters
I was waiting for someone to say this. He just likes the aesthetic because horny, but the goths look out for each other most of the time. he had no chance.
Am goth girl, can confirm I am flat in personality and want to stay inside reading bad poetry. Also zero interest in dating middle aged married men who dress in basic jeans and a T-shirt. Who’d have thought?!
It is adultery. It's not cheating.
Remember the good ol days when the mods actually enforced that rule? Now more than half of the stuff in here is just "mild embarrassment" as the "something bad happened"
I think, at least for sure on Reddit, there's a huge majority of 30+ people on social media who think they are interacting with a younger crowd. They think they are in touch and keeping up with the trends.  

The kids are not in the comment section, my fellow elders. And the few that are here are the weird nerds just like we were. (No offense, weird nerds, I think being a weird nerd is great)
100% this is a dude who played BG3, got the horn for Shadowheart and wanted to write some fanfiction about her, only to realise that he couldn't post it anywhere so he added in the rejection bit so he could post it on this sub.
This gets funnier the more christian/mormon you were raised
I don’t know how well it works on guys, but I managed to scare off a clingy girl by talking about my forensics classes and describing in details the picture of a man who hanged himself and was left several days in the wilderness.
Sounds good but don’t forget to fart while you ask.
Pinworms. Some guys still won't care, but it should suffice in like 95% of cases.
![gif](giphy|IVSRbO85XbNqU)
And that’s when you get the answer Ivermectin from tractor supply.

Run
Just be prepared for dudes into that.
If you said all men you’d be generalizing. 

You said a man, which could be any given man but not necessarily all. 

Don’t feel too generalized to me
Really? because Battlestar Galactica has quite a bit of references, the 13th tribe Kobol/Kolob Qorum of the Twelve. Larson's (who was exmormon) original BSG had more elements of it than the Reimagined one.
I am personally a huge sci-fi geek so I meant it with all respect.
Wow, what a plot twist? This guy just loves recruiting 🤣
That's a dude-bod
Ugh gross. If they wanna lure gay dudes in they should've went with bearded priests who lift preferably in a priest robe with the tag line - call me daddy, I mean father.
My point was just house clothes are everywhere clothes if you don't give a shit lol. I change from my work clothes to my pajamas the second I get home and it would take a funeral or a hot date to get me out of them again. And in the latter if the person is chill the only thing getting me out of the pajamas would be the end of the date not the start of it.

Task completed.
I thought she said "cross-eyed bear"??? Like, this cheap bastard gave her a stuffed animal from the clearance rack and its eyes weren't even on right?
Ha ha! Indeed!
it didnt go thru as much QA, that's why it's so funny (?)
Lmao
This is less plain being nice to and more "I have a good bottle of wine up in my room"
This is only true for women who are chalked full of red flags themselves.
That's true, I didn't think about that, but he seems to indicate that goth is not his style, just one he appreciates and objectifies in women, and that he, too, is emo or emo-adjacent.  I would therefore assume he would need to be judged by either a Gerard Way scale, or by just how Weezer-d he is. 

I got lucky in my youth.  I was about a 7.5 on the Peter Murphy scale.  Now I'm more of a 9.8 on the Rob Halford-a-meter, just without being gay.
It's not cheating if the wife knows and is ok with it, IMO.
yeah, you’re right
Unfortunately, due to having a large family, I know a lot of high schoolers and all of them do in fact use reddit (at least the boys) and were surprised to learn that I (an elderly twenty something) also use it. It's hilarious and sad but yea. All of that to say anecdotally, your take is wrong. Not to mention every single one of my friends in our 20s use it lol the only people I know who don't use reddit are my 50+ yr old parents because they are addicted to Facebook and tiktok of all things
Bible covers with zippers are a thing.
You told her all about our lord and saviour Jesus Christ?
Sadly, this wouldn't work on me. It's not easy to gross me out because my dad showed me a lot of gore and violent movies while I was growing up (not the best parent). I didn't realise one guy was trying to turn me off of him when he introduced me to Rotten.com when we were 14 until much later in life, lol. I think I freaked him out in the end because I wasn't screaming and crying and was instead really curious. He hung up on me, and I never heard from him again. Oop.
What if she's into forensics and/or dead men?
That actually sounds like heaven. You single?
I’ve weaponized my special interests to shake people off before. I start dropping essays about toads or really gloomy music or a specific minor enemy from Final Fantasy that I spend all my free time researching, or whatever my special interest happens to be at that point in my life. It works great: either they lose interest and I’m happy, or they take genuine interest and listen to the album and now I’m interested.
And then be like “ugh the worm is so burpy tonight” lol
Farting isnt a symptom. Gotta scratch your ass and then sniff your finger.
Jokes on you, I fart when asking anything.
I've heard of the Mormon references in BSG, never seen the show though. I've just never heard it called the space opera of religion before.

If you enjoy fantasy/scifi books Orson Scott Card wrote a series with earth in the title, it is literally just a fantasy version of the book of Mormon (kinda like the bible) stories. Way, way, more interesting than religious texts. I think the names of the characters were changed, and instead of a god it was a nearly omniscient AI. But the plot points and story beats are the same.
No, I'm not offended, I've heard a lot of stuff, but it was a new one, and I can see where it comes from, which just makes it funnier. We had a pair of missionaries that we would feed a few times a month, one guy always had a slew of Mormon jokes and I always laughed. My mom didn't find them as funny, but you have to be nice to the guys. Lol
Uncle Joey def bought his gifts clearance

Shhhh! Let the weakest links play with each other and think they're special.
All you have to do to score a 1 on the Peter Steele-ammeter is say black four times and enjoy a certain shade of green. To score a 10 you need to be 8 feet tall, get pissy when you find out who the demographic of Playgirl really is, and be willing to re-create the Origin of the Feces album cover on demand.

No, that was Judas that was hanged.
No, he talked about our lord and savior Odin! Heathen!!!
How are you doing now?
Depends.

How well do you handle ramblings about how the ribcage kinda slide off the spine, so it looked like it mid way through the classic Sub Zero fatality from Mortal Kombat 1
Omg 😆
I hate this, damn that's funny.
You know there's a not insignificant number of dudes who would be like "I've never seen a tapeworm before, can I have a look?"
That would kill me 🤣.
His name is Nibbles. 'His Nibs' for short.
Are we not supposed to do that already?
Be careful what you wish for here lol
The homecoming saga is the series by Orson Scott Card you where thinking of.
I knew a guy - back in the day - who would tell people he was Steel when we went to goth and underground clubs.  He was 6'6" and had the hair, but his voice was a tenor. 

Girls believed it, though.   They saw what they wanted to see, heh.
In what way? lol
Well I mean once all of the connective muscles and all that jazz dry up and decentgrade, it's the only possible outcome. It's why reconstructed skeletons are held together by wires and all kinda stuff.

TIFU by doing "anything I want" with my friend if I won games of Mario Kart against her.
My friend and I would enjoy playing video games together, but on several occasions, she would want to up the stakes and make things more interesting.

Her proposal was that if she won a game of Mario Kart against me, she could do anything she wanted with me, and if I won, I could do anything I wanted with her.

Little did she know how good at Mario Kart I was.

The first couple of victories were harmless enough.  I'd win the race, and I'd say things like "you've got to talk like Wario for the next race," or "I get to borrow your DVD's," most of which was wildly amusing and diabolical for me to ask of her.

But the thing about it is that I kept winning, and being the dope I was, I thought I was on a hot streak getting all this free stuff from her and I played it up like I was some kind of pompous court jester gallivanting across the courtyard.

Every now and again, she'd put the same offer back on the table, and I'd keep winning, and she would make her frustration known the more she kept losing races in Mario Kart.

And it didn't help that I'd brag about my victories within our circle of friends, celebrating with invisible trophies and spraying imaginary champagne.

It wouldn't be until we were older and grown apart that she would disclose to me that she was a little upset by the whole thing, because she would practice playing Mario Kart for HOURS before racing against me in the hopes of winning.

And the reason she wanted to win was because she found me to be handsome and didn't know how to initiate this attraction she had.

The whole time, she was hoping that I would ask for a kiss from her whenever I would win, but me being the dumbass I was kept asking to borrow her Linkin Park albums and to draw buff kittens with sleeve tattoos.

So not only did I miss my shot with my friend, I also broke her heart every time I would clench victory from her on the final lap, performing the miracle last second overtake monouver or cackling like a cartoon villain whenever the spiky blue shell of doom would nuke her dreams.

TL;DR My female friend wanted to win a game of Mario Kart against me so she could kiss me but never won, and I kept winning and asking for anything except physical intimacy.
Do you still have any of the pics of buff kittens with  sleeve tattoos?
This reminds me of an old teacher joke.

Girl: I would do anything to pass your class.

Teacher: Anything?

Girl: Anything

Teacher: Would you, study?
Youth is wasted on the young
I get she was trying to be cute, and I approve, but she really should have just gone and asked for it after a few rounds of failure.
Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said, "Where did you get such a great bike?"

The second engineer replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want."

The second engineer nodded approvingly, "Good choice; the clothes probably wouldn't have fit."
Not a FU . A kiss is temporary, Mario Kart glory is forever
You missed out on your shot with Princess Peach because of how good you are at Mario Kart.
Just say anyone as terrible as her at Mario kart isn't good enough for you, don't contact me again.
My guy you couldn't let her win ONCE??? Yeah you are a gamer at heart lmaoo
BUFF KITTENS WITH SLEEVE TATTOOS 💀
ignore women, gotta stay on that mario kart grind
Oof. I had the same thing with this girl in the past and we made the same bet, except with Pokemon Stadium mini games. 

She was actually really good and whooped my ass the first time we played so I had to really work for mine. 

She was talking about going to one of those passion parties the night before and she picked up some warming lube, so as my prize I suggested she try her new product on me.....

And we spent years together after that. Over now, but still. Sometimes ya gotta pick up on the hint. If a girl is playing a game with you, and turns it into another game on top of that game for stakes, just know she most likely is using it to get you to make a move. 

I mean I would hope you know now lol
It seem to still talk to her so what’s stopping both of you to initiate it like today? 
You didn’t miss a chance with her. SHE is the one who missed a chance. Relationship work with 2 people and woman are not a prize we win. The relationship with her will be the prize..
Consider this, though: You didn't take advantage. It's kind of good that your first (or any) thought wasn't, "Well, she said anything, time to demand physical intimacy." What if that wasn't what she had in mind? Would've been a messed up moment to try to navigate. It's a double-edged sword for a guy (assuming OP is a guy, apologies if incorrect). Don't presume a woman is interested, but also always go for it if it even looks like a window?

Maybe all people should just communicate clearly, but that's just me. I had a couple ladies later in life let me know that I squandered opportunities, but I was just like, well, that's a shame, but I'd rather have missed that opportunity than to have ended up coming off like a thirsty creep to someone I liked.
Actually I respect that you didn’t try to take advantage to get sexual favours or intimacy. I would find that a red flag personally. Skill issue lol, there’s other ways to communicate your feelings like “if you let me win this next round I will literally kiss you. You can keep all your prizes, just FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DUDE-“
Bet you stole 1st place from her by doing the boost jump in Mushroom Gorge.
YOU broke her heart? Are you kidding? Literally none of that is your fault. She didn't communicate her interest or needs. That's on her. You are not required to be telepathic.
Notice to absolutely any guy reading - some girl makes this offer "you can do anything you want to me" over something as trivial as a video game, she's absolutely hitting on you. People only make that offer when it's sexual.
Just win again and be like okay I want a kiss
You didn't take advantage of a friend because she lost a bet. That's not fucking up. If you want to say you fucked up by not sharing your feelings, then that's a fair assessment, and same goes for her. But you don't force someone to kiss you like that.
If she recently told you this, she probably still wants that kiss lol
Man, that is entirely her fault. That being said, I feel like if I was winning 1 on 1 Mario Kart that often I would be letting the other person win sometimes regardless of potential kissing. It's just polite.
Girls 👏 should 👏 grow 👏 some 👏 balls
You didnt fuck up, not even a little bit. She fucked up for never just fucking saying something lmao. 


You were being respectful by not asking for something sexual or anything that could reasonably make someone uncomfortable. Most dudes would absolutely do the same. Also, most women are not as good at “flirting” as they think they are lol
You don’t say your age but this is not a fuckup.  Consent is critical. Unless physical bets like that were agreed to beforehand you would be the asshole for choosing that as your prize.   
You might have let her win a game or two but if she demanded physical prizes without consent she would be in the wrong as well.
Man, that's when you sandbag and let her win one just to see what SHE wants....
Meh, my assumption is that that means he is a good guy, and the thought of taking advantage of a female friend, even if he was attracted to her, never crossed his mind. 

She is the one who lost out, by not speaking her mind after the plan didn't work out.

Ehh, being the first to make a move is hard though... living isn't for the weak, and neither is love.
The real fuckup would've been if you had won at mario kart and then used that to try to pressure her into making intimate physical contact.
We’ve all been there OP! Ngl, my curiosity would’ve gotten the best of me and I would’ve let her win once to see what she’d do.
I woulda been afraid to absolutely lose my friendship by actually asking for a kiss or something when I won. How many horror stories have you heard where they read the mood wrong? She coulda said eww gross. Keep your racing glory man.
Bro… her telling you this was your second chance…

She is literally telling you she wanted to kiss you.  She still does!!
I kinda feel like when she said “you can do anything you want” that she *has* to know where a guy’s mind would go, and that *you* would know that she knows, in which case she probably wants you to do something like that. But at the same time, as often happens with these mind-reading games that women play, you could have kissed her and she would have been creeped out, offended, and you would have lost a friend. My luck was that I never knew if girls were hinting at something or not, and if I thought (hoped?) she liked me I found out I was wrong when I acted on it. I also found out some girls *did* like me but it was like years later and too late to do anything about it.
Given I assumed the TIFU would be written exactly _because_ you asked for intimacy and they ended up weird out, imma put this on them cause that's just them making you take the risk at the end of the day
To be young and stupid again....
To be fair if I had a bet like this with a friend of mine, I would be very very hesitant to ask for anything of that nature even if I was into them, because I would think that's a very quick and easy way to completely ruin our friendship if I completely misunderstood her intentions.

I know, I know, if a girl would phrase it as "You can do anything you want with me" chances are she was coming onto me... but what if she wasn't...? And then I'd be the creep trying to turn it into something it wasn't.
Guess she learned the lesson on being more direct with things she wants and to communicate that in the future. Or not, who knows.
If a girl put these steaks on the line for a game of Mario kart, I probably would have been too shy to ask for a kiss and just let her win to see what she wanted to demand of me.
No way man. Do you have any idea how much of a dirtbag it would have made you if you had used winning to, from your an aware perspective, pressure a girl into intimate acts? The fact that it never even crossed your mind and you had only platonic, silly, childish requests is so wholesome and such a green flag.

You didn't miss a chance to kiss a girl, you never knew there was one to take and you didn't take advantage of a silly bet between friends to act like a predator. That's on her for not expressing her feelings. I'm glad you're not a creep.
I would've at least lost one time on purpose just to see what she would want.

But yeah I get it, when you get challenged to Mario Kart and you destroy your challenger, you simply must show your might over your opponent. There is no other way.
Next time, let her win.
I kind of have the opposite story, I'm the girl in this situation!


I had my eye on a guy friend of mine for a minute and one day I brought my N64 over to his house. He was bold enough to make the bet of having a kiss if he won but.... little did he know how good *I* was at Mario Kart. I kicked his ass the whole race until I "accidentally" slipped on a banana peel right before the finish line! oH nO I lOsT! 😏 welp, gotta make good on the bet and we made out. We started dating shortly after and eventually got married. 

It wasn't until years later that I admitted to throwing that race so we could make out. He had no idea and just thought he got insanely lucky 😅 I'm like... you *did* 😏
Well invite her over for another round of MK and let her win dummy.
I assumed this would end with anal.  =/
To be honest, I thought the tifu would turn out to be you asked to be physically intimate, rather than not. 

You were a dick about winning though by the sounds of it, and in future should also try and let someone else win if for no other reason to keep them interested in hanging out/playing with you in future….
Gee dude, you should have let her win a couple times just to not be a dick...like maybe after the 5th time throw her a bone ya know?
Hey it stays that way I been married 30 yrs and they still suck at hints. Ask wife for sex just last night told me no because I refused her the night before.i said I really doubt that don't reckon I ever turned it down .she told me that she brushed her hand across my back sexually .what the hell kind of hint is that for a man to recognize. Brush your hand over my dick if that what you want my dam back not interested in sex at my age it really try to stay out of it .![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
You didn't fuck up, she fucked up by not asking you for a kiss or even ask you out outside of Mario Kart.
So not ONCE did you think about faking an L to see what kinda time she was on? Sheesh dude.
You didn't eff up.

Quite frankly, this idea of hers is toxic as shit. If you had asked for a kiss and she wasn't interested in you, you would have been treated as if you were the worst person on the planet. If she had won and you weren't into her and refused to kiss her, you either would have been called gay or treated as if you were disparaging her looks.

Honestly, she broke her own heart by not being honest and up front.
That's one of the cutest things I've ever read
She should have just told you how she felt. What if you had claimed your prize and asked a kiss and she was like:" hey don't be like that!" And then you lost a friend. And she would think you are a creep. Nah, this isn't your fu. It is hers
So, how's that autism diagnosis coming along?
Not too bad, my first thought was anal.
I am just confused how you didn’t once try to let her win, have you no curiosity?
Bro, no regrets. 


Love is fleeting. Linkin Park is forever.
Ok but if you did ask for more intimate stuff and she didn’t intend for that you’d look like a perv
i mean u did nothing wrong tho, its uber risky if u asked 4 physical stuff & she got offended & tell every1 ur a creep
If she hadn’t been a subscriber to the antiquated and dumb-as-fuck notion that girls can’t make the first move, she would’ve been satisfied.
Other than being an ungracious winner, I thought you didn't FU too bad. Your requests were so wholesome, innocent, and fun. Tbh, using it for something physical could have backfired and is creepy if you didn't think she liked you in that way.
But… buff kittens with sleeve tattoos…..
Naw man. You were being respectful and not trying to take advantage of her.
Nah you didn’t fuck up, like yeah there was a flag waving in front of you because she kept initiating but it’s better to read it as friendship than to mistake it.  That said, are you all single?  There’s no real reason to bring it up unless she’s still interested.
100% not your fault. 
There was me worrying you were going to make it weird and sexually harass her with it - turns out that's exactly what she wanted. 

I evidently don't undersand women.
Don't feel bad. It would have ended WAY worse if you ended up misreading her hints. 

No one's fault here really.
This is why the answer is *always* anal.
Honestly, you didn’t FU. Demanding kisses or other such things because you won would not have been a good look. You proved yourself to be a guy worth dating by not doing that. Her inability to say what she wanted was her FU and that trait would have hurt you in the long run.
To be fair it would have been worse if you made a move and she didn't want it. You did the right thing.
Maybe you were being too aggressive about your bragging, but this is 90% on her. She should have taken her shot instead of contriving this scenario that sounds like it comes from a bad teen sitcom.

And if anything, she should have been happy that you DIDN'T exploit your bet to do something inappropriate with her and stuck to harmless teasing.
I really thought this was gonna go super wrong the opposite way.
All she had to do was approach you for a kiss. This stupid crap of expecting intimate prizes needs to be reserved for long term couples
Kids, let this be a lesson to you. Talk openly about what you actually want, life gets so much better when you do.
I don't think this is your FU. Why would anyone's first reaction when playing a game with a friend be to coerce a kiss out of someone? You asked for normal, fun, friend things. If she wanted more than that she needed to initiate. 

I cannot imagine a world where I ask for a kiss from a friend as a prize, even if I liked them. If they didn't like you that could ruin the friendship.
most relatable tifu ive ever read
Things that didn’t happen for $1000 .. Alex
Men will go to any lengths of rationalization to not admit we are wanted.
Man I wouldn’t dwell on this too much. It’d have been kind of weird to ask for a kiss or anything sexual if it wasn’t apparent there was something there. She should have been direct at some point.
Bruh. You let her win once to see what she says. Lmao.
If neither of you are in a relationship it’s never too late.
Damn bro you never just let her win once?
I’ll never lose my virginity because I never lose
Why's it too late to do so now?
Not for nothing but the fact that she told you about suggests that the door isn’t fully closed. Don’t do anything stupid, but keep your eyes open if you’re both single and you’re interested.
It would be fucked up to demand something sexual from a friend. You didn't fuck up she did, she wanted something and expected you to read her mind this is entirely her fault. Honestly as an adult if this happened to me I would not be interested in someone who can't communicate or tries to play emotional blame games with me. What she did was emotionally immature while you acted like a gentleman.

Edit I used voice to text and said I love you rather than like a haha
Your FU wasn't making the move while playing Mario Kart.  Your FU was from not making a move when she told you.
lol, when a girl repeatedly finds reasons to do ANYTHING you want. I always clarify EVERYTHING on the table? Cause.. I have a dirty mind. Obviously not the first time.. but if they keep making the offer something is going on.

I know this because I am thick as fuck and I didn’t realize when my wife was doing this with me early on.. I was oblivious. So I feel you dood.. sometimes it be like that.. you just wanna play games and you don’t even realize you could play games while.. you know.
I think I probably would have lost on purpose early on if only to see what the stakes actually were.
This is because you're a good person. Ys sure 'signals' blah blah, but like any other guy with a brain, you imagined explaining to a judge that it didn't *need* consent because she said if she beat you at Mario Kart you could do anything you wanted with her. And then you quite rightly asked for something more appropriate. 

Also you clearly didn't fancy her otherwise you'd have let her win at least once anyway, so don't feel bad. She had a crush it happens.
She got to spend time with you and you didn't abuse your power you won being gross.

It's probably a good memory for her in hindsight.

Could have been better.

Still pretty good.
I was in one of those situations once with a girl except we were bowling. She proposed the bet. If I win I get whatever I want and if you win, so do you. I had the game in the bag but young me wasn’t sure if I was reading the signs right. So I threw the game and let her win. Put the ball in her court, so to speak. 

Her prize? She wanted to drive my car home (I had picked her up). It wasn’t even a nice car! Some beat up, used Honda. Courtship is hard when you’re young 🤣
You didn’t let her win, just once, to see what she had in mind? Even animals play-fighting will give their opponent a win from time to time.
Bro you were respectful of your friend.
You had a good time with said friend. 

If she had feelings for you that on her to initiate. 

Yeah sure it’s a dude moment where maybe you could’ve asked back then why she kept doing the same bet and in hindsight it makes a lot of sense but overall you didn’t fuck up. You were being a good non perverted person.

GG.
are you both 12 years old?
I wouldn't call this a fuckup. First, it's her failure. Second... I mean, it's a good thing you didn't ask for physical intimacy as a reward here. I understand that she was wanting, but she dropped zero clues and in normal circumstances it would be extremely creepy/uncomfortable to make intimacy the reward. You failed to be a creep and you should be proud of that. You missed on an opportunity that you had zero idea was available to you. Ball was entirely in her court and instead of making a shot, she placed a basket behind your line of sight. She could have asked if you make out as good as you race, you know? 
Your writing style is…underwhelming.
Jesus these posts are getting stupid.
I mean, it's easy to fix it. Challenge her to mario kart, win, and ask for a kiss.
Okay, but this story could have just as easily been “I lost my friend because I was a creep and coerced her into unwanted intimacy” so hindsight may give regrets, but they don’t really seem too warranted.

The only question I do have is why you wouldn’t throw the first round so that she could establish the informal boundaries just to get an idea of limitations and expectations, since she proposed it. Honestly, the oversight of such obvious measures heavily implies this story as being fictional.
this is not real. 100% an AI post.
How old are you?  15?
Your FU was not losing a round to see what she wanted.
You should have let her win once and see what she had in store.
Maybe your princess is in another castle
Don't worry about the missed opportunity because even as we get older, we still manage to miss out on obvious cues.
This did not go in the direction that my mind was taking!
... ... y'know you can ask her out now, right?
The first five seconds of reading this and I knew she was barking up your tree and you didn't realize it 🤣 if you like her and you're both single, ask her out. Maybe she didn't give up some sliver of hope.
Trust me, you did not FU...  Cherish the friendship.
Typical bro doing bro type stuff. Been there done that. Learn from it and be better.
This reminds me of when I was in high school. I had joined a game battles team for COD and was practicing with my team. This cute girl asked me to come over as her parents were gone for the night and I turned her down to keep practicing with my team. She tried hard and I was terrible with women and never picked up on their advances. She would buy me chocolate milk everyday and even grabbed my hand rubbed it down her leg to show me that she had shaved, I responded with "oh cool."  God, I was such a dumb kid.
Was she into you?

C. Can't tell
There is not enough F in the known universe.
I once made out with a girl when she asked me to show her how to French kiss.  Was in my car in the rain and everything.

"Whelp. That's how you do it!" \*skrrt\*

\*\*\*This was about 20 years ago.
I was about to feel bad but then I realized none of this actually happened
Most women will do anything other than initiate romantic interest.

Most men will be oblivious to the subtle hints and random clues.

Gamers will crush their enemies and hear the lamentation of the noobs.
Youth is not wasted on the young…it’s wasted on the dumb.
She _could_ have just come clean at some point instead of going home to practice Mario Kart for hours
Mate, she’s the one that fucked up. If she’d just be straightforward she’d probably have gotten what she wanted.
She should have been more direct with your dumb, clueless ass.  This reflects on her as much as you.
Based as hell lol
She did the FU then if she didn't just ask you for a date.
This should be a greentext. Go to 4chan
The T in TIFU is for "today."
This is way more wholesome than expected.
Not a fuck up. You showed respect by not taking unfair advantage and assuming consent. Although you missed your shot and upset her, it could have played out so much worse. Keep being that person.
Her fault.  She didnt want to look like a whore by asking directly what she wants
I always tell this story when I read similar TIFUs like yours.

When I was younger, and apparently dumber, there was this girl, who one time I walked to her house. 

She then asked me, would you like to come to drink a coffee? I replied - I don't drink coffee 

She: Then may be a tee?? 
Me: But it's summer! Way too hot for a tee.

She: A water?
Me: Nah, not thirsty. 

She: Do you want us to just chill and talk?
Me: Nope. I want to go home and play my PS2...

What a dumb fukc ....
Asking the real question.  I also want to see the buff kittens with sleeve tattoos.
Look up monmon cats, they are Japanese cats that are tattooed as well as being tattoo's.

I've been in this situation. Back when I was a grad student, I had a student in one of the classes I was teaching say this to me: "I will do anything, and I mean anything, to get a better grade in the class." And I knew exactly what she meant, but I just pretended I didn't get her meaning and gave her more study suggestions.

I even helped some other students cheat on a test and he praised me for how creative my cheating was. ( it wasn't very creative since he caught me). I thought it was hilarious at the time.

To be honest I probably would have been the same. I might have suspected something like she was fishing but who wants to inadvertently cross a line and fuck up a friendship?

Thanks old man at the diner in Pine Bush NY that felt the need to say that to me when he heard me crying over a boy. I went on to travel the world and build the life of my dreams. I don’t remember who I was crying over but I do remember you.
And ignorance is wasted on the dumb
Nailed it. She didn't have the guts to take that last step. It's hard to break out of the friend zone. You need to be direct.
Yes they both screwed up. 

A simple “A dvd? I would have asked for a kiss.”
Even if she won, I have the feeling she still wouldn't have pulled the trigger
She should have got the hint after he asked to borrow her dvd's... I mean dude was on whole other level of clueless.
I’m seeing a pattern where men are blamed for not recognising signs that a girl is interested, but also blamed for making a move and then ruining a friendship. 

Meanwhile the girl sit there doing nothing.
It's so much harder when you're young and less secure in yourself. I was madly in love with my best friend all through uni, and unbeknownst to me my love was reciprocated. There were *so many* moments where it *almost* happened, but we were both convinced that the other one couldn't possibly be interested. 

There's hope though - older, and more world-worn, but with more confidence and assurance, we managed to get it together a decade after those university days.
I would never have dared to do that as a teenage girl. I would have needed a backup reason just in case he wasn’t into me.
Kinda think of it was on OP’s radar he would’ve gone for it, too. If there was a spark that was only denied by a Mario Kart losing streak, they might be  one of those cute  “been married X years now” stories.

But since OP wasn’t into her, they went separate ways.

Tho confessing years later might’ve been a follow-up move…
Thanks for the laugh 😂😂

To be fair, less a hint and more smacking you across the face with a road sign…
RECHALLENGE INITIATED!!! Rainbow road only
My thought exactly, if she casually "Hahahehe you were so stupid" brought it up, she could be hinting again. Although, honestly, major green flags from OP, and at least pink flags for the girl bc it sounds like she might still be too timid to be straightforward about things.
Yea. I had a similar experience in the past (not involving Mario kart) where a friend admitted to having a crush years ago on me but was too shy to initiate anything back then. I just told her let's give it a try now and we dated for a bit. OP should really consider if this is another hint or not
Yeah she really tried to make herself a prize to be won.
>What if that wasn't what she had in mind?

And that's why you just lose the first round to see what's at stake, and then obliterate them.
Yeah, I feel like at some point (esp with the PRACTICING FOR HOURS?) I would just lose it like that. Although, she probably convinced herself him not asking for a kiss meant he didn't like her and the cycle of timidity continued....
I was scrolling the comments for a hot minute seeing if anyone else was saying this. OP done good by not being a creep. 
I don’t know why I’m reading these comments because they are unhinged (as always) but this one is good!
Yeah, like... most of time I was reading this, I kept thinking "okay, his fuck-up probably is using that to try to get sex with her", but apparently I'm also one of those "painfully bad at flirting" men who doesn't have an inherent desire to turn everything into sex.
Yes!! It sounds like this was when they were younger so with age comes maturity. And maybe they are living in a place that its baked in that the Man Has to make the first step. But hopefully in time that woman learns, yeah you can flirt, but if hes not getting the hint, try a different tactic at the very least, and ideally, just tell them.
The Internet loves to claim that "so many men are so bad at flirting".

If dating/relationships were dependent entirely on women, we would have been extinct a long time ago lmao.
You dont need to be wrong to break someones heart lol. Sometimes it just happens
She could have tried um, distracting him?  Or maybe she did, and Oblivious Man, er, Boy, wasn't picking up on that, either?

ETA: Maybe the heartbreak was finding out her crush was an idiot.
"What would you do to me if I let you do anything" tiktok meme.

The answer is sex Dorothy, it's always sex, you know it, I know it, you're not being as coy as you think.
Notice to any girl reading this - a lot of guys are not going to initiate off  something this vague for fear of looking like a creep or just being oblivious.
i think the risk of getting it wrong wayyy outweighs the positive. I could probably pick up on it but damn it's kinda playing with fire if I misread the situation
this is a very stupid way to hit on someone if you've not made clear what you're into prior, the other person knows there are boundaries and can't read minds.
Notice to any girl reading:  Not every guy in the world is secretly out to rape you, even when 'given permission'. Friends get treated like friends. The type of guy that would react the way you're thinking to that kind of offer is the kind of guy #metoo was about.

She might just be polite and want to enjoy a round of Mario Kart.

Except all the times its not, and its said in frustration, and then you are labelled a creepy incel for imagining it.

Its one of these many damn games where can we not just be honest? and direct, and actually communicate face to face.

Because every time you go to any of these "girls what did you wish guys understood" its always 50/50 "When i smile and act coy its because i like you" and "just because i smile and act coy doesnt mean i like you, and if you take your shot you are a creep"
Not always - please make sure you ask her still if x is okay when you win 😅 and that you are perfectly fine with getting a different price if it isn't. 

Context: I got attacked with tickles, out of desperation said "I'll do anything for you to stop" which DID result in him stopping, but then sexually assaulting me instead 😐 despite knowing I was in a relationship.
lol no guy is gonna take take that chance I’m so sorry. That’s a case waiting to happen.
> "you can do anything you want to me" over something as trivial as a video game, she's absolutely hitting on you. 

Except when she's not and you become a registered sex offender. So thanks but no thanks.
I’ll have to take your word for it, because women never hit on me, which I realize is a funny comment to make in a thread about male obliviousness, but trust me it’s true. It’s hard to miss signs when one is not being given any in the first place.
Wouldn't risk it. I'm the unlucky dumbass that wouldn't apply to
While I understand it, it's false and so fucking dumb in this era.

Men are already saws as sex freaks and potential aggressor. Nobody want to play into this harmful trope that if a men has the chance to do "anything" with someone they'll force a relationship.

And sometime there are people who are oblivious and aren't flirting when they propose such deal. In this case, forcing a relationship can be a really bad move.
Hitting on someone this way is really something only children would do. As an adult you should probably be capable of picking up on if someone is into you without these silly games.
Notice to absolutely any woman reading -- That's an inappropriate way to hit on someone. It blurs the lines between flirting and coercion, which undermines consent culture. And some people will inevitably misjudge where the line is, leading to one or both people getting hurt.

OP did the right thing. Instead of telling men to interpret this stuff as women hitting on them, we should be telling women to hit on men in more appropriate ways.
OP should drop a "Well how about a rematch?"
A year from now, tifu by listening to a story about Mario kart
Yeah, this is possibly her open to having her feelings heard and hearing some sympathy... But OP here doesn't seem to have learned too much over the years. Too bad she can't pick a guy with an ability to read social cues. 
Nah, Mario Kart is real in these streets. You gotta pry those wins from my cold, lifeless corpse.
There are certain Nintendo games like Mario kart, party, and smash bros where people don’t fuck around. Doesn’t matter if you’re a niece/nephew, child, spouse, or potential dating partner, on the track everyone is competition.
Not a chance in hell anyone will ever beat me at Mario kart
Not if you have a standing bet
This. Don't wait until years later to talk about way back when. This is her tifu.
No worries, some girls these days actually have balls.
Most normal people would still ask first, and I think “I said anything but not that” should be acceptable.
The thing about consent is it can be revoked at any time. Assuming they're both mature people that care about each other if one of them asks something that the other isn't comfortable with they could say no and the other would respect it. Everything doesn't have to be so serious, and I'm sure they know each other better than we know him. Hell, OPs fuckup is that he would have been happy to kiss her. Attraction and flirting are more complicated than a rule book.
All he had to do is let her win one game and she might have asked for a kiss.
I get what you’re saying but it’s very easy to say, “does anything extend to you kissing me” or something similarly cutesy like that. No one said just force her to kiss you.
A lot of guys don't want to seem like perverts and so, in this situation, would intentionally stick to innocent dares.


"I won! Kiss me."
"Oh, I'm sorry. I don't like you that way and you made it weird now."


And just like that, you have nobody to play Mario Kart with.
She can't ASSUME just because he's a dude he's into her. I hated girls that assumed all men were attracted to them, and it's always such beautiful schadenfreude to see them get turned down. 

But yeah, girls are taught by movies that being coy is sexy and cute, but in reality, what they think is obvious often isn't and major confusion ensues. Best thing I ever did my relationship communication skills was date a guy on the spectrum who I had to be VERY plain and open with. It's a great skill.
> she has to know where a guy’s mind would go, 

That's the thing though. Not every guy is thinking about sex all the time. They were playing Mario Kart for crissakes.

You'd think he'd twig afterwards though.
Absolutely same. I read the preview and assumed that, and was ready to be totally icked out. Then OP turned out to be wholesome AF and my faith in humanity grew two sizes today.
What gave it away? The fact that his requests included borrowing dvds and her Linkin Park albums? Or the fact that OP said they're now older and grown apart?

Obviously they were teenagers here, this is exactly the kind of shit teenagers would do.
The standard r/TIFU writing style is overused and insufferable even when the author clearly has at least some command of the written prose and a decent vocabulary.

I wish more people would just write how they talk / think. You don't need to spam everything with horribly unfunny "quips" and linguistic embellishments.

WAAAAAAAhh
I laughed way to hard at this
I Wahaha-ed at this 😂😂
Thanks for spilling my coffee through my nose
"I would do anything for grades. But I won't do that" meatloaf probably
Did she follow them?
Thank God you did that. That girl is........ ugh.
You did the best thing 🙌🏼
Yeah then she has sex with him and falsely accused him of rape out of spite.
This whole movie takes on a different feel after the allegations.
Hard like a blue shell in the third lap
OP could have hit it hard too, but didn’t
At 28, I finally get it
Or just let her win once out of curiosity to see what she would have asked for
Right?  I figured the story would be of OP taking it too far. 
... Or if like teenage me, wanting that kiss but being too afraid of possible rejection in the face of every green flag imaginable to ever express actual feelings or desire for that kind of thing.
Nah when I was a teenager I was too shy and not confident. I would never risk asking for a kiss though id probably think about that every night. Then find out she wanted it years later and think I was dense and dumb. Because I was. In highschool I never thought it was possible some girl was actually flirting with me so hard.
He's was sensible, if you call that wrong you lose a good friend and her labeled a perv
A man to my heart. I would probably do something similarly stupid.
I'm amused that someone would call making someone talk like Wario or borrowing their dvds "diabolical" lmao
Similar thing happened to me a decade ago with the same game (well, for the Wii U).


Didn't dawn on me what this girl was expecting when she proposed coming over to play Mario Kart until the next week where she completely ignored me at work until she quit.


I was in my early 20s. Can't believe this game is still being made and men are making the same mistakes.
I was given a couple of these opportunities in high school but I was always so worried about coming off as shallow or something that I never asked for anything beyond dumb shit like this lol
Because it would be extremely awkward if your friend was just having fun and you made it sexual.
I'm dense as shit emotionally and even I would've picked up her hints after the 3rd time at least. No girl says "do anything with me" as a prize without having some romance in mind.

On the plus side, OP probably gave that girl's girlfriends tons of amusement. She probably ranted weekly to them about how he's not getting a clue.
The instant you are no longer the future you're the past
Someone betting "anything you want" at a game they suck at should at least be asked "you wanna fuck" in all sincerity. 
Did you find it hard to play intentionally bad, or was the prize such a good motivator that no such difficulty existed?

I have found it rather challenging to intentionally do poor in some activities I'm skilled in
I’m 64. I have at most 2-3 decades left, but I’m diabetic with hypertension.
You’re the first person to point out my inspiration!
Plus how fuckin egregious would it have been for him to demand anything sexual from this
Yep, it's hard.
The only guy I ever genuinely liked was never direct about feeling the same way. If he was direct I would have absolutely dated him. Now I’m across the country and it’s never going to happen. I regret not saying something myself. Anyway it’s hard to be upfront about this kind of thing but I think it would be worth it so you don’t end up like this.
Yep. I did this, tho, and it didn't work out. I had to walk away from my best friend at the time because he was literally breaking my heart and I had to do it directly. Hardest conversation I ever had. But at least I don't have a case of the "what ifs"
tbh, when she admitted it, she still could have. Op didn't eff up all that badly. His friend, however..? horf.
Borrowing someone's dvds being described as "diabolical" has me cracking tf up. That's the most innocent shit I've ever heard lmao
a kiss live in concert dvd? awesome!!!
Yeah that's what I thought too. If after playing them for a lot, a lot of times, she never, ever, made a move, she wouldn't have made the move if she won. 

Also if someone tells you they "used to have a crush on you" they still have a crush on you. If I used to like someone and no longer do, I would keep it to myself.
Of course she wouldn't, if he lost in something as prestigious as Mario Kart he would be a loser and lose all sex appeal. Good on OP for maintaining the sigma grindset.
Maybe dude just didn’t want to assume, and possibly risk ruining a friendship and make it weird from then on?
Guys: girls are so confusing with hints...

This Girl: if I win at this, I can do whatever I want to you, and if you win, you can do whatever you want to me... 😏🥵

This Guy: So, how buff do you want these cats to be?

But maybe halfway in, she was pissed she didn't even get one round after all that practice and wanted to make him have some boner by dominating him in game? LOL
Yeh the whole thing "do anything with me that you want if you win" is a dead give away
This dude sounds great. The idea of any kind of sexual exploitation was never on the table in his mind. If that's stupid, then drop a cartoon anvil on my head.
Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Men aren’t the only ones who can take initiative
People want the people they're attracted to to like them back, and the people they're not attracted to to not like them. Because of how society has framed gender roles in the last... always, women are taught that they must be the passive receivers of affection and men must be the proactive purveyors of affection. It creates a twisted dichotomy in the minds of young girls (which they may later carry on to adulthood) where they don't want to make the first move, but want to send a signal to the guy they like that he should make the first move. 

If the guy they like is interested and their moves are overt enough, then nothing wrong. But if he's not interested, or she's too subtle, then he won't ever make a move on her, leaving her in a frustrated state of limbo where she can't get him to notice her but is too afraid to make an overt advance because that's just "not how it's done."

At the same time, men are taught that they must pursue, and are thus looking for signals everywhere. So if THEY are interested in a woman, they will read into her actions with far more scrutiny than they do with other women, and convince themselves that common courtesy and niceness are the "signals" she's sending because she likes him back, and then make a move, and get shot down. Happens all the time, because men aren't mind readers.

In summary, the gender roles we've ascribed to men and women about how they are supposed to behave in a male/female relationship/courtship can lead to complicated and frustrating behaviors in youth that can lead both parties to get frustrated and feel like the other one "just doesn't get it!"
Yeah, there was a long reply earlier where someone listed all the ways OP could have tested the waters before asking for a kiss. A whole giant paragraph, followed by "or you could just say you think she's cute and be direct".

Like, why couldn't we just expect her to be direct at the beginning, instead of playing this whole game and being disappointed in the result...
When I was a teenager, I had a girl buddy would pretend to go in for a kiss to make me uncomfortable. One day she did the usual and I just went in for a peck on the lips. Friendship over and she was too uncomfortable to speak to me again after that. One of my regrets.
Welcome to being a heterosexual male

Name...doesn't check out.
Fuck yeah! I'd rather lose honorably than have someone "let" me win. It's disrespectful! You don't see me as a worthy opponent/you think I have the emotional regulation of a teaspoon/you think i have no honor or manners/you pity me. I don't care which of these you pick; all are offensive! Like ffs never let someone win! It's just disrespectful!
They're friends not dating.

God damn that's so weird lol

Imagine if guys had their equivalent, hosting parties to test out a bunch of sex toys together. Shit would be the laughing stock of society, and rightfully so lmao

If some guys *are* planning on doing something like this however, might I suggest calling it a 'Smash Party'.
I thought it meant passion of the christ.
Instructions unclear. Racing again
She could have just been polite, there's really no way of knowing.
OP's muscles memory will still force him to win, she's gotta pick another game
Actually, she made OP a prize to be won. And then she always lost.
This is a hilarious way to learn “maybe I should just ask for what I want next time instead of playing games.”
"Why are you taking off your shirt? I'll adjust the AC."
one of my friends called me and was like “is my friend flirting with me? she took off her shirt to show me her tattoo that was on the side of her breast” and i was like—lmaoo
I will eat your ass
The meme of making them play video games with you is all we really want. OP finding a girl who will continue to play despite him always winning is really rare so I'd say he still didn't really lose here.
Yeah if I wasn't in a relationship with that person already I wouldn't risk it.... just be like I won, ehhh hmmm, okay I'm going to drink your last can of Dr. Pepper.
Oh definitely, I would have to be like a 100% sure because I would feel horrible if I made my friend feel uncomfortable and potentially ruined a friendship because I misread a situation.
So many women seem to be incapable of understanding that MOST guys are not willing to become a registered sex offender just because the girl may or may not want things to get spicy.

Want to go out, kiss or fuck? Just fucking say so man, hinting and "flirting" is absolutely leads towards the opposite direction versus "I really want to kiss you right now".
Notice to any one who's bad socially reading this - use your words and ask softly if you want to break this impasse without being overly creepy. A phrase like, "so when you say anything, how far are you willing to go?" is a lot smoother through the responses without saying explicitly "wanna fuck?" and helps protect boundaries of consent.
Also, most guys are not used to being hit on (and women are not used to doing the hitting on), so you're better off erring on the side of being direct.
Yup. It is an obvious clue but a clue isnt consent and it is incredibly easy for someone young to recognise the signs and get too enthusiastic and overreach.

Say they get overexcited on winning and ask for more than what the other person expected. Maybe OP's friend wanted a kiss and he asks to cop a feel. That interest can be withdrawn in a heartbeat and suddenly that clue wasnt a clue at all, and OP is being publically berated for being a creep and a predatory man.

People dont respond to games like this for a reason, it often isnt safe to commit off clues and hints. People have differing understandings of what those hints may mean, so we are cautious and conservative because the consequences can be high.

If you want someone, communicate it clearly, playing the "chase me" game is something we should all be cautious of and doubly so when other people try to play it with us.
Even if I was sure that was the goal I still wouldn’t do it. In such a scenario I don’t want to put extra pressure on then saying yes/no due to some fucky bet
Even if they literally said "you can have my cooter if you defeat me at [task]", I feel like I would not want that. That warps the nature of the whole thing from attraction to this icky dominance/conquest thing that I want nothing to do with.
I never said it wasn't stupid or immature or risky, it's still an overt come on.
This is the way. Me and my uncle would straight up play double dash for hours. The prize? The glory of using the wave bird controller. Safe to say we got pretty good lmao
Losing bets can also be fun, when it’s with good company.  You get to learn a bit about what that person thinks is funny prize and maybe get nudged into doing something you otherwise might be too nervous/anxious to try.  Plus being silly is just fun!
We call that a pleasant, but welcome bonus 🥴
Nuance, on reddit. GTFO, 24 hour ban for you.
eh, a guy can absolutely still be vilified for "making it sexual" and "ruining the friendship" because "all guys just want sex" and "men are pigs" because "is that really the only reason you're friends with me?"

A far better response would be "are you trying to flirt with me?" or "I didn't know you were that into me, that you would offer *anything*".  Flirting is all about a slow escalation of sexual advances where the first is shrouded in plausible deniability, and each subsequent response becomes less so.  By calling attention to her flirting without expressing his own desire, he shows that he's in on the game (decreasing plausible deniability) while still not technically admitting to his own interests (not dropping all pretence).  

If she didn't want him that way, she would respond something like "oh god, it does sounds like that doesn't it?" or "lol no, I just wanted to make the game more interesting", and that ends the situation without either party being embarrassed.  If she says anything positive like "what if I am" or "could be", then he can again respond with something like "well if you are, then I'd say you're a beautiful woman and I'd be a fool not to kiss you".  Again, both responses still technically hidden behind hypotheticals, but you can be far more certain now.  A final statement like "fine, if you win I'll kiss you" and then half sandbagging the game would absolutely be warranted.  That way, she can't really be upset about you asking for it, since she encouraged the conversation, and then by only half throwing the game she has the option to back out by throwing harder.
She decided to go through an 80's training montage with Mario Kart instead of asking outright.

No way she'd have had the balls to ask for a kiss even if she had won.
he probably considered it but it wasnt a risk he was willing to take.
I'm not sure what, " You'd think he'd twig afterwards though" means?  Can you please enlighten me?
What do you think we are, stupid?

Well in this case you're probably right lmao
Sure, but it sounds like this happened multiple times, and was even talked about with other guys. Somehow none of those dudes told him she was trying to get with him?
Thank you! I remember one I read where every single line was trying to make a funny pun or simile. It was distracting.
Had to scroll this far to find it, 100% AI.

 The last paragraph sealed it "I also broke her heart every time I would clench victory from her on the final lap, performing the miracle last second overtake monouver or cackling like a cartoon villain whenever the spiky blue shell of doom would nuke her dreams."

Bad AI at that.

W-What is currently sleeping inside of you?
I think so. (This was back when George W. Bush was president so my memory is a little hazy.)

She’d already passed the class before. She was retaking it for a higher grade.
Yeah, and I think taking advantage of a student like that is completely gross af.
Thanks. Leaving aside the fact that taking advantage of a student like that is completely gross as hell, it also would have put my whole future at risk.
While looking at the finish line
Poetic.
Idk if you can do it in later iterations but on Mario kart Wii I'd hold a mushroom get in first and then use it to boost from under the blue shell.
(Enter JB)

Remember fellas: You don't always have to fuck her hard.
Date her. Date her hard.
Yep, no imagination, curiosity, and even desire for variety. At least she realized he was a moron.
Why pick up the controller if you don't intend to win?
Maybe let her get on a hot streak so she can build up her courage. She might be too timid to come out the gate smooching.
This is what I would've done, at the very least to not be a cocky asshole just beating down this poor girl in Mario Kart 🤣 

play it hard like hit them with a shell to get ahead but then keep "crashing" into the stage hazards or falling off the track, keep it neck and neck until the last moment and then ease off the acceleration a little so it looks like a hard earned victory for her.
He could have done that but then this made up story wouldn't have had as many comments.
Seriously I was reading this one through my fingers
Yeah I was waiting for him to ask her to poop on his chest after the 30th game of Mario Kart
Also very valid
The strat here is to throw a game or two and put the ball in her court.
The most disappointing thing I've found about growing up was becoming distant with your friends only for them to then be comfortable telling you they had a crush on you. Like, SAME BRO, why couldn't this have come out years ago??

Okay, it's not the *most* disappointing thing about growing up, but it stung really hard after thinking I was unlovable/unattractive for all those formative years.
Yeah, that was my thought as well. It's not that OP missed his shot, it's more that *she* missed her shot with him.
Yeah, except when a girl states “anything you want”, multiple times, and probably emphasising the “anything” part then you should shoot your shot.
That’s why you let her win and make the call.  If she kisses you first, you’re not a perv and you don’t lose a friend…
Yeah,  the risk/reward is so much greater than just asking them on a date.
Please do not give me an existential crisis while I fight Sunday Scaries lol
If you're not streets ahead, you're streets behind. 
Nah. For a good while you are actually the present. In the immortal words of Homer Simpson:

>I’m a white male aged 18-49. Everyone listens to me...
Not really, at least for this game.  The mechanics are such that you can just button mash and do okay.   I reverted to that.   Mostly blocking, bad button mashing and throwing the occasional big strike in so it wouldn't be obvious.
They're still not wrong about this being the youngest you'll ever be again!
Dips on your stuff
I hope you're managing well with both conditions. On the bright side, now's the best time to be alive when it comes to life expectancy with hypertension and diabetes. I've had hypertension since I was 20 (genetic), so even the young aren't spared from that.
Yeah, when I read the title, I thought that would be the fuckup.
That's what I'm thinking. Sounds like he was appropriate and she was just too shy, no fuck ups here.
It's the Mighty Ducks.

Two inches to the right and he would've maybe had a lifelong partner/wife. Two inches to the left and the dude's lost a friend forever or at worst, he's caught a case.
That's roughly what I was expecting, the friend keeping to offer this bet with OP keeping to win, until OP jokingly asks for something vaguely intimate like a kiss in an attempt to put an end to this game through shock, and the friend going off like a bomb, ending their friendship on bad terms.
Yeah no. That's not socially acceptable unless there's already an established/at *least*  implied openness to that kind of thing. Imagine if he *had*  asked for something even remotely physical and it *wasn't*  her angle? Shit would go wrong real fast. He did the right thing.
It's a few situations 


1: what op did. She's into him he doesn't ask anything sexual. Outcome: ops embarrassment  (assuming he would have wanted the kiss or more)



2: she's into him and he asks something sexual. Outcome: lucky



3: she's not into him and he doesn't ask anything sexual. Outcome: good friendly fun 


4: she's not into him and he DOES ask something sexual. Outcome: he's creepy 



I would never ask anything remotely sexual incase of case 4. I don't understand why it always has to be the guys job. She was into him. She could have done a little more. I understand how scary it is, but it's just as scary for guys 


Normalize girls making the first move!!



There's also the case where he wasn't into her at all
Not "demand" in this situation, but it would not have been egregious to use it to initiate intimacy. She was obviously setting it up for him to knock down.

One part of emotional maturity is learning to understand what people are feeling and their motivations. If he had been more mature, he would have picked up on her subtle hints that she wanted intimacy, and that would have been enough to make the big-honking not-subtle-at-all "you can do anything you want with me" clear as day.

Then he could have decided if he had reciprocal feelings, and if he did then he could have started slow with the winner's prizes, backing off if she even appeared uncomfortable, regardless of whether she was capable of voicing it. Even if she did, if they had a good time, it could always be repeated on another day after they each had time to consider what they wanted out of the situation.

But they were kids, and they hadn't learned those skills yet, so he fumbled.
Shit, mine is too
That's the issue. It's expected from the guy, so you wouldn't want to initiate it. but guys now assume that most girls are just friendly and that if they make a move, now they lose a friend BC they took your friendship the wrong way.
So really it's no one's fault you just didn't want to lose what friendship you already had, incase they took it odd or didn't accept. But just sucks, it's like minesweeper asking people out on if you are friends or previous  coworkers.
That rough. You know where you stand and moved on though.

Good for you.
I thought the diabolical part was the summer of trash talking the poor girl with a crush.
Unless OP is known for losing things, then "borrowing" might as well be "throw into a black hole".
He's very rough with them, puts fingerprints on the shiny side
Yeah this is green flags! No one should be trying to exploit sexual favors or intimacy
Even if I suspected that garnering a kiss was the goal: No way I would try and get it like that.

The risk/reward ration here is waaayyy off
This right here, if you cross this line and that wasn’t the intention it’s getting real close to sexual assault, depending on how far you take it. Friendship Mario kart ain’t exactly a setting that screams romance me
>This Girl: if I win at this, I can do whatever I want to you, and if you win, you can do whatever you want to me... 😏🥵

Tbf, if that went wrong it could have gone reeeeeeally wrong
Not necessarily, like if someone has managed to avoid being terminally porno-brained, especially at a young age with no prior experience.
Yeah this was exactly what I was thinking before I even got to the point OP mentions her confession years later
Gender equality means women need to step up and start seizing the initiative too 🤩
> Men aren’t the only ones who can take initiative

No way...you're saying women's cell phone plans allow outgoing messages?
The solution is to abolish traditional gender roles around courtship. We should teach young women that if she likes a guy, she should ask him on a date, instead of just dropping hints. And same for adult women -- if a woman has carried this twisted dichotomy into adulthood, then she has a duty to fix the harmful attitude she's carrying.

The reason I'm putting the responsibility on women, is because men *can't* fix this. If a man tries to violate gender norms by waiting for women to make the first move, most women will just assume he's not interested. He'll stay single and nothing will get fixed. So women have to be the ones to make the change here.
It's not OP's fault he didn't do things differently regarding their games/bets. Whoever was interested in the other could have been more direct. OP's friend should have been more direct, or if OP was interested in her he could have been direct (but I couldn't tell from his post if he was even initially interested). If OP or OP's friend didn't want to risk their friendship that's valid too, but there's risks either way and people have to live with their choices
If she wasn't that much into him and he went for a kiss then people would say he abused the game like some total creep.
Why would you want to be friends with someone gets satisfaction from leading you on and making you feel uncomfortable? She sounds immature and you’re better off.
Friends the whole time. Stupid, blind friends who needed our heads banging together.
This man listens to mildly obscure pop punk bands. 
But the Peach been cheating 
and you know I ain't talking code.
Push her against her own thrown green shell. "you're getting nowhere near my banana!"
Maybe. But if I'm playing with somebody and just keep destroying them over and over and over, if I still want someone to play with, it be in my interest to let them win. If you're good enough you can usually make it pretty convincing.
Nah but for sure at one point you start handicapping yourself to let her get some wins too. Smth like not using power ups for a round.
Shtupperware.
Usually??
Just a bunch of bros sharing a fleshlight
She might have been Canadian.
And she was *literally* playing games in this case.
"Ah, we're getting serious huh?"

*Also takes off shirt to go faster*
"What, you think taking your shirt off will be enough to distract me? Think again, loser."

I have plenty of experience absolutely blowing the moment.
too subtle
Whoa, calm down Satan
Wow, drinking the last Dr Pepper is diabolical. The ultimate betrayal. Good thing you could NEVER beat me at Mario kart!!
Here's for all the guys who still wouldn't risk it, afraid of coming off as a creep.

The secret is escalation.

You don't go from 0 to 100 and just dive in. She says "anything", don't just up and ask for a blowjob. 

Escalate physically from the most innocent possibility, e.g. a simple peck kiss. and do it very slowly. Move in slowly, give her time to turn away and keep pausing to give her the chance to refuse at every step of the way.

Like move in until your faces are a few inches away from each other, then say "Anything? Are you sure?" If she doesn't flinch, go in very very slowly until your lips are almost touching... at this point if she lets you get this close, it means she at least likes you somewhat, she would've turned away much earlier otherwise. If she does turn away, just laugh it off, pretend you were joking, say you were just testing her reaction or something, and just act like it's all cool.

BUT if she lets you get that close, then her heart must also be beating a million miles a minute at this point, so there is always the chance she will turn away at the last moment even if she wanted it. 🤷‍♂️ Or she may just let you go all the way, and the slow escalation just made everything 100x more exciting.

Either way, these are the exciting parts of youth, better shoot your shot and enjoy the rush, than wondering what if decades down the line.
This needs to be shouted from the roof tops. We cannot simultaneously be expected to be the ones turning nonsexual situations into sexual situations AND also be crucified for trying to turn situations sexual. It can't be both ways.
There's probably a happy medium here. 

After the first couple times she could have said something like "here I was thinking you'd want to kiss me or something". Putting the idea in his head. And letting him ask probing questions if he wanted probably leading to the next game being for a kiss. 

It's absolutely possible to flirt and not leave it up to interpretation.
I genuinely had a girl say stop in the middle of making out right before things went further and said she had to leave soon but months later she said she was hoping I would just go for it anyway. I am still annoyed by the whole thing like 15 years later.
There’s a reason a lot of selfish people manage to always find relationships. They’re willing to go for what they want where others aren’t. And while many times it’ll offend someone, they’ll just drop that person and move onto the next and eventually it’ll work.
So.. why not ask to escalate, but do it without pressuring them? Like, you give them an out: they can pick one of two options, they can veto your choice, etc.
Exactly, own your own emotions, I'm not going to go out trying to win sex with a random ambiguously unwilling person, I want to have sex with people who want to have sex with me!
Overt: done or shown openly; plainly or readily apparent, not secret or hidden.

You have every right to choose your preferred method of communication, there’s nothing wrong with passive or direct. But that style of communication is definitely NOT overt.
Or change the challenge to the looser gets to choose

what would be the point of that? one class isn't going to affect GPA that much, and GPA doesn't really matter unless you're failing, right? unless it put her over a threshold for something.
"Completely gross af" is an understatement. Anyone who does that is a primitive, nasty, abusive chimpanzee only intent on self-pleasure through any means possible, including unethical ones.
Those are the ultimate betrayal of friendship
In fact, sometimes that's not right. To do.
As the great tenacious d once said “I’m gonna f*** you, softly” 🎶
We were all morons in some way at that age
The same reason you might sacrifice a pawn in chess: the immediate game is not the game you’re playing.
I find that when I win all the time people don't want to play against me anymore.

So I usually hold back, and if a win is inevitable I try to make it seem close.

I remember playing Scrabble against a friend and she said that she was pretty good and challenged me to do my best.

I said are you sure?

And I ended up beating her by over 100 points.  Knowing all the 2 letter words and how to play words to use them can add up really quick.

I still remember the look on her face.   And we never played Scrabble again.
Layers bro, layers.
Did I just find my wife's reddit account? 

Not only is it *always* about winning, but sometimes it's that she didn't win by enough points to make her happy.
*zips up* disappointed!!
> thinking I was unlovable/unattractive for all those formative years

You keep people apart for their entire formative years, making sure girls and boys are never alone, never have privacy, never have a change to explore love and lust, even the TV shows all have an episode about how having a crush on someone is super embarrassing and them finding out about it is the worst disaster that can happen. Then you suddenly turn around and start asking where the grandchildren are. By the time I finally turned 18, my self-esteem was shot, I had trauma from failed relationships, and the beginnings of a drug problem. But I definitely learned my lesson. I no longer have sex or let anyone find out that I'm attracted to them unless they're a close friend and I know there's no chance of a relationship. The upbringing worked.

Sorry to rant, but I've been thinking a lot about formative years lately, both in terms of gender segregation, and the constant lack of sleep from early school start times. After learning in rehab how much lack of sleep can affect your mental health and everything else, I can't help but thinking that we're seeing problems that are so widespread we can't recognize them or identify the source.
Well, whoever is interested should just ask. In this case it was not the guy's fault at all. It was her idea and if she wanted it she shoulda been clear. That's... What is growing up imo.
Don't say that to OP, he would have bought a nerf gun
Nope, too risky. We could be married for 25 years with 5 kids and I'd still be like "maybe she's just like really nice or something".
If she wanted it that bad she could've just asked for a kiss
Seriously, it sounds so much like a come-on, if a girl actually meant it innocently and freaked out and called him a perv, I'd be like, "It sounded like a come-on. You screwed up." Assuming he backed off.
If you were a regional champ easily stomping everyone and she won many times against you... It was probably obvious. That or she's really dense haha
I’ve got a son a daughter and a future son-in-law. Get in line.
I was diagnosed with hypertension after I turned 30, and with diabetes at age 50. I’ve got my numbers under control. 

But thank you for your kind well wishes.
Exactly! I can't imagine requesting a kiss via something like this. It'd just feel wrong
Same. Happy to have been wrong lol
Same. I thought that was where this was going and was relieved it went the opposite direction. OP may have been a sore winner, but honestly he took the gentlemanly route.
She should have said   

"okay how about this time the loser has to give the other a massage?"  

And see how that suggestion goes down.
I mean he def wouldn't have any case as a kid who just asked for a kiss lol
That’s why OPs biggest fuck up here was not at least letting her win once so she could set the tone  and she where she wanted to take things.
There's also a *lot* more social risk on the guy's side, especially at OPs age.  The girl kisses the guy and he's not into it, and he's almost certainly just gonna say "no harm no foul" and nobody thinks anything of it.  The *guy* reads the signals wrong and makes an unwanted advance?  Hoo boy, now "he can't be trusted," "all he wants me for is my body," etc etc.  She tells her friends what happens and they're going "Giiiirl he *assaulted* you!" and suddenly he's got a reputation across campus for forcing himself on girls.

There's a reason so many guys err so far on the side of caution as to not take the shot even when she's supposedly giving all the signals these days.  The consequences of misreading the situation can be *dire*.
I definitely understand where you’re coming from. The reasons I didn’t initiate anything were pretty complicated though. I was going through personal issues at the time. I lost my dad to cancer after caring for him for months. I am also not a very trusting or outgoing person, and wasn’t very experienced when I knew him. I couldn’t have really handled the possible rejection or loss of his friendship at the time. I think he felt the same way, especially since we were so similar. I should have tried harder at the time. He made it clear in his way how he felt but not clear enough for me to be sure. It’s just a shame things went this way.
Yes. And the next person I met romantically, I ended up marrying him 😊
Fair! lol
I mean, the wording of “you can ask for **anything** you want” should’ve been a hint. She wasn’t going to be “exploited” here; she **wanted** him to make a move. 

But even so: like, say you’re worried about making your friend uncomfortable. There are all sorts of ways to test the waters, see how the other one feels, without awkwardly jumping right to “can we have sex?” You could challenge them to a staring contest. Ask to hold their hands. Flirt with them. Challenge them to say the thing they’re most afraid to say. Ask them what *they* would pick if they won. Do a “ok, ok, you absolutely have veto power over this, but if **I** win the next one, we both have to take our shirts off. What do you think?” and gauge their interest so they have a chance to say “no”. On and on, so many possibilities.

Or, better yet, you could just be direct and tell them that they’re cute and you like them.
Exactly what I was trying to say, but said better, and more succinctly.
Definitely. Especially if they're a really close friend.


But I think there's a solution. During the initial proposal one could always ask: "Everything? So if I asked for a kiss then I could have one of I win?"


That might have been an appropriate and not too awkward question if you suspected her goal was to lose and for you to put moves on her.
If your heads are what's banging together you're doing it wrong. 🤣
What’s the reference?
Yup. If you really are that good, then you should be able to tone your game down a bit to make it actually competitive. I do this when I play pool with my fiancée. I would never tell her, but sometimes I purposefully miss a shot or try to set the ball up for her so she can get a good shot in. She knows I'm good. I can usually get a streak of 3 or 4 balls in one turn if the table is set right. But I'm not masterful and sometimes miss what should be an easy shot. It's not difficult to make it look like I missed when really I'm trying to make it easier for her. I want her to be able to win as well. Losing all the time isn't fun. Watching her have fun makes me happier than winning all the time.
When I'm absolutely destroying someone, I usually suggest a handicap for myself to make it harder for myself, like "what if we play \[game\] except I can't move forward? maybe that'll be fairer"
Yea every so often some poor girl gets held down and dildo'd by her friends.
Is THAT why guys get together to play "Smash Bros?" TIL
Dark days during midterms and finals prep.
"You won, you can do anything you want to me"

"How about if I -" (waggles eyebrows suggestively) "- asked you to call me Keith"
If she said that I'd 100% think it was a trap and think to myself "yeah right, like I'm that stupid." and that she was just trying to find a way to make fun of me.
naw, that wouldnt work. Youre still tryna play games.
Shows played exclusively for dogs: all music played is 20k hz and above
She was retaking it for a second chance of fucking the prof haha
It can change how competitive you are in med school applications. When I was a TA it was always the pre-meds that cheated or tried to barter for a better grade.
Dude blue-shelled himself
Sometimes you gotta give her some love.
Bravo. 
But to an oblivious man, the immediate game is the only game. He's going to try to win the only game he knows he's playing. 

- signed an oblivious man.
Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.
This is why no one plays games of any type with my older brother. He’s a sore winner, and pretty good at shit. If he loses at something he makes it his mission to train to obliterate you the next time you play. 

Dude is 52 and just started realizing you can have fun just playing a game
My wife called me a fucking bastard our first and last game of scrabble for this exact reason lol.
The trick is to have some games that you've put 0 effort into getting good just so your friends will play with you. I don't even look at the move list for injustice or soul caliber just so I can play games with my friends.
The Ender Wiggin School of Scrable. Destroy your opponents so thoroughly that you win this battle and all future battles with one victory.
Ogres have layers…
How does she approach the inevitable reality of losing at something, no matter how rare?
This is so funny to me. The anticipation cracks me up.
Just wanted to hop in and affirm your thoughts, you are not alone in them, and I think things are even worse for the youth. At my niece’s high school graduation this summer, the valedictorian had a demeanor that was pretty uncanny to someone on a heavy dose of psych meds, and I’m no stranger to them. My sister who’s a psychiatrist felt the same way. The girl was truly barely making it through her speech. 

I experienced such incredible burnout in college after working so fucking hard in high school like my life depended on it, I’m still in recovery tbh hope all is well with you, friend!
Brilliant, I could see that….

“She told me if I win again, I have to shoot my shot.  So, unbeknownst to her, I went out and bought a nerf gun.  After I won again, she looked at me in anticipation.  So I shot her in the face with my nerf gun.  Lmao.”
Are you now, or have you ever been, an insecure teenager?
4th in line, not too shabby.
Idk man, if a girl I knew was like "If you beat me at this game, you can do *anything* to me." I'd feel someone would have to be dense to not at least ask the obvious implication of "anything to me."
I feel like this is where you just make the ask and be prepared to give her an exit ramp if that's obviously not where her mind is at

Big difference between that and pulling a "no take backsies" to manipulate the situation to cross boundaries
Although I agree and my thoughts went to the same place, one missing context here is age. Teens? Oh yeah this could be the start of a porn. But like, two 8yos? Yeah kissing sounds about right. And the oblivious boy too.

Also it kinda sounds like if she had won she would have asked for the kiss, which would have made this a beautiful story for the wedding day or something, but it sounds like OP was too good and never lost when the bet was one.
Oh lmao I completely missed the age he listed
Fuck that real gamers don't quit 😤
There's always an asterisk next to these statements. 

I normally am all for making fun of clueless OPs, but this one is really on the girl. She very easily could've made a tiny gesture that would've clued OP that she liked him.
> I mean, the wording of “you can ask for anything you want” should’ve been a hint. 


Orrrrr


In the case she wasn't into him, it would be seen as mistaking what she meant and he's a creep 


I just wish people could be more direct and rejection to be respectful on both sides 



Also people are forgetting.. what if he wasn't into her at all?? I think he was given this was tifu. But it very well could be he wasn't into her
>Challenge them to say the thing they’re most afraid to say.

Fuck that.  Knowing my luck I'd either get a murder confession or they'd drop a hard n-word.
Nah, all of those options are complete danger and creepzones to someone who is hella clueless and not daring to take a chance on a friend
[Pow](https://youtu.be/VtylVwuAEpc?si=kD0hTa3ZnbWyMr7t).
Yup, my sister did passion parties when I turned 18. So of course that was my birthday party. It was co-Ed because I’m dumb, but yeah I had to try a bunch of products because it was my sister.
Don't even start looking into the world of competitive smash bros, there's so many weird sex scandals they are really the worst fanbase.
Genius idea. Wanna be our manager/booking agent??
This is the way.
Pre-meds are always either the kindest people you will ever meet or the absolute most toxic “grindset” individuals and there is no in between lol
That's a thing now
And ruin the tour by making an ill timed joke.

I mean..... And fucking give her some smooches too!
Encore.
The story of my life.
This was the hard part for me. I'm fairly autistic, struggled a lot with friendships as a kid, but also tend to be good at most things I pick up, very quickly. 

As a kid, winning was my way of "fitting in," and doing something everyone else did, but I was also a miserable loser. 

Now as someone who's been gaming all my life, I've come across quite a few kids that are how I used to be, doing things like "playing edge" in Brawlhalla, essentially decimating you before you even have a chance to react to anything. 

As we played more often, I had to express that the more you play like that against people who aren't good at something, but perhaps either want to get better, or play just to play with a friend, the less those people will be encouraged to play with you. 

Winning isn't always winning. Sometimes, the best way to win, is to lose.
Usually not really well. She's gotten better over time, and I still love her.
Need fun 😂
Dibs on 5th in line!
I mean as an adult who's never had a gf, 


If this happened to me now I still won't assume what "*anything*" means.  At best (if I was feeling brave) id playfully ask "what do you"*mean* anything? " 



Because if she reacts in a grossed way you understand she didn't mean *anything* lol
Yeah I would've pushed a bit to see exactly what the parameters were here. It's very leading language, but I would've had to make sure I was right before asking for a kiss or fondle or whatever.
Correct. OP isn’t an asshole here, a little naive, but that’s also a loaded statement that can very easily go badly fast. I’m okay with him playing it slow.
Yes, but I'll need to hear your lyrics first. They must be family friendly, as there will almost certainly be puppies in attendance
Sometimes you got to squeeze!
En Passant.
>Winning isn't always winning. Sometimes, the best way to win, is to lose.

This is the way, my friend. This carries over to most aspects in life,  from relationship, to friendships, to the workplace...
"to me" is the defining factor, unless she wants a punch in the face, it's pretty clear english

Thats f*cking teamwooork!~
TIFU by not telling my doctor how many Tic-Tacs I eat per day 
So I'm absolutely fucking obsessed with the Fruit Adventure flavor of Tic-Tacs. The flavor combined with the soft *smush* they make between your teeth when you chew them makes my brain very happy. I've been buying them in bulk, where each container has 200 candies each, and they come in bulk packs of 12 containers. I tend to eat them by the handful while I'm working or gaming, so in a day I can easily slam through 1-2 containers. 

Now keep in mind that on the nutrition label, it says the serving size is 1 candy, and is listed as having 0 calories, which I thought was awesome because I could have as many as I want! 

Over the past year, I found that I gained about 40lbs, and nothing about my eating habits had changed as far as I was aware. I told my doctor about it and she was a bit worried, so she had me do a bunch of bloodwork to see if there was a reason why I gained so much weight in a short period of time. Everything came back normal. She referred me to see a weight loss doctor who would also have me see a dietician. 

I had been working with the dietician for a few months now, and we have me keep a food log. I had a virtual visit with her today and during it, I was fiddling around with an empty container to keep my hands busy. She saw it and asked where I got such a large container from, so I told her about it and how I eat 1-2 of those per day. She asked why those weren't on my food tracker and I said it was because they're 0 calories so they wouldn't count. 

Apparently I was very, very wrong about this. She explained to me that food companies can label something as being "0 calories" if the food's serving size contains 5 or less calories. In reality, each individual Tic-Tac actully has about 2 calories. So essentially, since each container has 200 pieces and I typically have 1-2 of those, I've been eating 400-800+ calories *per day* of Tic-Tacs, in addition to all the other food I've been eating - which is very likely why I've gained so much weight. 

TL;DR: Didn't realize that tic-tacs weren't actually 0 calories and gained a ton of weight because I eat so many a day. 

Edit: Just wanted to clarify that I'm aware that sugar will in fact make you gain weight (I'm not *that* stupid), but I never actually read the product ingredients. I assumed they must have been made with something like Xylitol or some other artificial sweetener to make them "0 calories" so it never crossed my mind to check!

Edit 2: Dang y'all are brutal lmao. But at least some good came out of it since apparently, like me, a lot of people didn't realize about the "less than 5 calories per serving" rule can legally be classified as 0 in the US. Personally I wish we could have the model they do in other countries where they list calories per X amount of grams. 

Edit 3: MY TEETH ARE FINE 😂 I actually just had a dentist appointment two weeks ago. No cavities or decay, gums are healthy. Despite my candy habit I do take good care of my teeth!
![gif](giphy|tMpbNVfBvDGFi)
Tic Tacs are small enough to legally be labeled sugar free even though they're almost pure sugar.
I'm pretty sure there's an episode of House on this
In Europe, you gotta have calories per 100g of product as well - really helps to avoid these kinds of situations. Glad you finally figured it out OP
The sentence involving "I had been eating 400-800 calories of tik taks a day" Makes me chuckle lol hope you're doin better thou
I just finished a diploma in a medical field, we were warned about people like you OP. I wish I was joking.
Once you really start looking at nutritional labels you see that many of them are very deceptive.   Very tiny servings, rounding-down measurements, loopholes in interpretation, etc.    Essentially they can completely lie while technically telling the truth.
Reminds me of when I went to a friend's house and watched him take the pump off a bottle of spray butter and just dump it into the mashed potatoes. I asked him why he didn't just use butter or margarine and he said it was because the spray butter was zero calories. I had to explain the whole concept of "per spray" and did the math to show it had almost the exact same calories as margarine. His wife had gained about 30 lbs since they'd married the year before, and it was apparently because most of his diet hacks meant she was actually eating more calories than ever.


ETA: Remembered another one. He was buying low calorie bread, but never compared the calories to regular bread. Just assumed it was much, much less. Instead of serving her 2 slices of regular bread each morning (190 calories) he was serving her 4 slices of lower calorie bread (240 calories - slathered with "zero calorie" butter spray, of course).
People really do be living out there without any common sense, huh
Honestly, it's all critical thinking. Idc what the fuck someone eats, if you are slamming 200-400 of literally fucking anything and feel a significant change in your health, then first thing you should question is that thing you are overconsuming.
First rule of eating, eat anything in moderation. Too much of anything is bad for you.
This could only work if they were sugar free??? Ok but if they were, you would be having a lot of diarrhea potentially…. Depending on the sweetener.

Karl Pilkington, is that you?
I can understand assuming the labels are accurate if no one has ever told you they’re inaccurate but I still don’t understand how you could think “I can have 200 servings” of *anything* per day or not logging it for the dietician. Like if I’m paying for a specialist I pretty intensely keep track of anything they MIGHT want to know just in case it’s relevant and I let THEM decide if it matters or not.
Tic tacs are funny. LESS THAN ONE GRAM OF SUGAR PER SERVING!!!!!! But a serving is like one or two and they weigh so little it’s under a gram. (Less than a gram of pure sugar is still sugar)
I know this wasn't the intent, but this low key makes me want to try some fruit adventure tic tacs. Like, if someone out there is casually eating 200 - 400 of these bad boys each day I mean, they gotta' be pretty good lmao
Just because one of the few things I remember from a diet and nutrition course I took, I did some math. 
3000 excess/deficit = 1lb gained/lost
So from high to low calorie intake, one could replicate this in between 150 - 300 days. Crazy how tictacs could really change someone’s body in less than a year.

>and is listed as having 0 calories, which I thought was awesome because I could have as many as I want! 

404 common sense
>I assumed they must have been made with something like Xylitol

&#x200B;

Oh, you would have noticed if that were the case.

&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|Q2sgo9efR3n5m|downsized)
My friend ate so many tic tacs in HS because she was so paranoid of having bad breath and then it turned out the tic tacs gave her bad breath because of all of the sugar. 

Go figure. 
Hope you’re heading to the dentist next, OP!
There is only one thing that has 0 calories and is meant fo eat/drink and thats plain water, period. Everything else, even vitamin water has calories. 

Its astonishing to me that you really thought 400 candies don't have any calories, lol. 

Oh, and if you are already surprised about the weight gain due to eating so much candy, wait till you see your dentist... lol
You ate 2 PACKS per day? Like 400 tictacs?? @_ @
Hold up
Tic tacs are expensive as shit how do you pay for that

Like a big box here in europe is like 5 euro with 100 (?) in there
It’s always shocks me to find that people who are this stupid are just living amongst us and have made it this far in life.
Holy crap, that’s almost a pound a week in extra calories you weren’t tracking. I’ve researched a lot about food so I’ve always known that about calories and serving size. That’s what kills me when people crush those artificial sweeteners because they say 0 calorie…yeah because the serving size is smaller than 5. I used to wait tables and people would put 5-10 in each drink thinking it was calorie free. No one cares when you tell them because they’re more likely to believe packaging than someone who’s done a basic google search.
Really interested to hear what your dentist thinks.
Oof. I think in my region they made that illegal. The packaging here says "8kj (2kcal) per mint"

Made in Australia
they also say 0 sugar, conveniently for the exact same reason. there is, in fact, sugar in tic tacs.
I’m not trying to be a dick, but you consuming TicTac‘s in mass quantities because you think they had xylitol instead of sugar is the most “I’m fucking begging for cancer” sentence I’ve ever read in my entire life.
Oh wow 😳

Just fyi, consuming too much artificial sweetener can mess you up, too. You may want to look up the Amazon sugar-free Haribo gummy bear review!
I’ve been rewatching House and you sound like one of his clinic patients. Not trying to be mean, you sound nice person, but it’s hilarious how accurate those bits apparently are. 
No idea that people could be such idiots
i’m sorry about the gaining weight part but i totally understand the addiction omg. whenever i buy a container i go through it in 20 mins tops 😭 thank god i saw this before i even thought of buying it in bulk, they’re so good though
TIL that, in the US, unlike in the EU, food companies are allowed to lie to customers.
Keep in mind, this person votes, may operate a motor vehicle, and will be supported by your tax dollars eventually and there is not a damn thing we can do about it.
I'm surprised your bloodwork came back normal and not woth crazy blood sugar
I am blown away by your naivety and stupidity. My god.
Where do you live that they are allowed to say on the packaging that it contains zero calories when it's actually closer to five? Where is that sort of blatant lying legally acceptable? Here in Europe all macro-nutritional information needs to be presented per 100 grams to avoid this exact situation.
The hubris. The stupidity. The consuuuum. This is so 'murica!
You should go see a dentist.

I’m sorry but this is the funniest thing I’ve ever read
To say it nicely, if that story is true, you are dumb as fuck

Like you can be dumb and not realize you're doing something stupid once. But then spending a year trying to figure out the problem, getting fat, and going through many appointments with doctors and dieticians, and still not making the connection ? That's more than being dumb.
Haha. That whole "per serving" shit is so dumb. I'm glad we have per 100g over here.

That said. You should have been warned about the "per serving" lie on your first appointment with the dietitian
If it says 0 calories, always look at the grams of sugar
not to be an asshole here but duuuuude how did that not click sooner cmon
Not a dietitian but I work with some, and OP, this is HILARIOUS. That dietitian will remember you forever 😂
40 lbs!?!?   You are like 20% tictac !!!!
This may be my favorite post of all time
“This thing I’m putting in my mouth and swallowing all the time can’t possibly affect my diet” - fat logic

Extra bonus wtf points for “my dietician probably doesn’t need to know about my super unhealthy obsession with candy. No I only eat one meal a day why am I gaining weight?”
This is both insanely funny and crazy sad.

I want to let you know that I am genuinely confused here, but I do hope you’ll get better with your weight soon.
I was sick for a couple weeks and the only thing I would eat are those fruity chewy mentos. I also bulk bought them and ate everything. 

My actions ended up leaving me in the fetal position for another week because of the pain. It was horrible and constant. I couldn’t walk straight when I was able to walk. I thought I might need to go to the ER. Then I realized that I ate an egregious amount of mentos and Yano that probably fucked me up. Switched from looking up burst appendixes to buying laxatives. 

How did you eat literal hundreds of tic tacs, gain weight, go to specialists and STILL not realize it was the tic tacs?! When you eat candy like that, it fucks you up so hard. Like your poop should be multicolored, how did you not realize 😂
This is such a helpful post. Kudos to being willing to share it. I have a feeling a lot of people make the same mistake trusting dishonest labels. 

Sugar free is another one I hope more people educate themselves about. Artificial sugars can wreak havoc on your metabolism and other systems.l when eaten in excess.
im sorry but ???? 

how?
Does anyone else read stuff like this and feel angry that you have to share the world with people who are this stupid? this fucking knuckle dragger can vote and procreate.
My sister (we are European) lived in Texas for 1 year. Sometimes she sent chocolate with 0-calories and no sugar. The chocolate itself was sweeter than any chocolate I ever ate in Europe. This was apparently possible because the manufacturer listed a very small serving, so everything could be rounded up to 0. Very misleading indeed
Imagine eating 200-400 tic tacs a day and thinking that’s normal.
I'm concerned about your teeth.
You've been roasted enough, so I won't say anything on that.

But my guy, you've got to seriously look into why you're eating so much of one thing period.  That should be an immediate red flag.
OP: I'm not That stupid

Meanwhile.....

*gestures at entire post*
Jesus H. Christ. This shit makes me glad that I left the USA years ago. If it's even 1 calorie it should be labeled as 1 calorie.
I'm sorry you actually have been eating 400 tic tacs a day and didn't occur to you that it might be an issue???
US food industry is way to powerfull. Making people fat.
This chip doesn't count, it's only one chip
Karl Pilkington, is that you?
Secret bulking technique revealed
I know this isn’t the point of the post, but I do really love those fruit adventure tic tacs and everyone I’ve told thinks I’m crazy for loving them so much. I can’t buy them often because I will eat the whole container in one go.
This bait. No one is this dumb.
man I can't blame you dude, I love those too lol
Also, don't forget that eating excess amounts of artificial sweeteners can give you terrible diarrhea. Not a fun side effect.
Maybe your next visit should be to the dentist..
I love your “edit” to this post where OP states they are aware that sugar makes you gain weight because OP is not THAT stupid then the next statement is “but I never actually read the product ingredients.”
If they were made with xylitol, you'd be spending half the day on the toilet shitting your brains out.
You got issues OP
fun facts:

The first ingredient in a package of *Sweet'n Low* (0 calories) is dextrose.

Ditto *Equal*.

Ditto *Splenda*.
Oops. She’s probably seem worse, though.
This was a funny and lighthearted story. 

But good *god* that's a lot of tic tacs
Bless your heart.
Sorry to be judgey but I think there’s something incredibly precious and adorable the way this is written. Self awareness is the first step. Nothing wrong with a few tic tacs. I’m still chuckling because this is so relatable. Like,  I’m working out now I get to eat anything anytime then having an epiphany learning about counting calories! 
If they were actually sugar free you would have known.  You'd be having those Haribo Gummy Bear shits lol

Also, I'm sorry everybody is flaming you so hard in these comments.  This shit is funny tho.
Dietitian here. Who is very thankful you met a dietitian. This isn’t unfortunately common knowledge lets alone well known fact.
I mean damn you are really stupid
"I am not that stupid" yes yes you are.
Now go and TIUF yourself by stopping to eat these candies
Always check the nutritional info per 100g and not per serving. Companies can make the serving size whatever they want to make the food sound more healthy than it is. Plus if something says it contains 90g of sugar per 100g of product you now know the product is 90% sugar. The per 100g nutritional info is basically just a percentage breakdown of what's in your food.
How can you eath that much Sugar per day and not have some serious intestinal problems
No offence but what were you thinking 😅. Tic tacs clearly contain sugar so that means that it would also have calories even if it’s a super small amount per serving. One or two wouldn’t mean much but an entire container would definitely add up. The reason why it’s marketed as sugar/calorie free is because it’s size is so small so the calorie intake is considered negligible even as a kid I knew not to each too much of that.I would have at least mentioned to the doc that I took 1-2 containers of tic tacs a day when I mentioned my food intake.
Wait until you learn about 0% beer. It isn't 0%
Hope you're taking care of your teeth as well, that's probably a bigger concern, you can lose weight, but you can't grow new teeth.
Don’t forget to track the calories of all your non water drinks and don’t forget how many calories come from oils when cooking.
>I assumed they must have been made with something like Xylitol

You'd most definitely notice if you were eating that much xylitol daily
Spray butter id the dame, says it's calorie free
Doesn’t surprise that someone who eats 200  tictacs per day would be this stupid.
Eating 200-400 of those sugar pills a day is psychotic, and it has nothing to do with the calories…
OP I'm sorry, but that is just complete and utter idiocy. Did you really think that eating 200 - 400 Tic-Tacs each and every day for an extended period of time wouldn't fuck up your health?
I understand that labels can be deceptive, but how TF do you eat 400 tic-tacs a day and not connect the dots with your unusual weight gain, not tell the dietician
https://youtu.be/pmLpSY5w6u0?si=wPpKFYGp9VqYJ1rV

Hot Dog Timmy would like a word
calories or not that is sooo many tic-tacs. You OK?
OK, aside from the product mislabeling - believe me, I could preach sermons about product packaging - I don't know how you swallow Tic-Tacs by the handful without barfing your brains out. So get some more medical insight into your dietary habits, head off diabetes early. By the way, a similar US law allows packaging to claim "0% sugar" when there's still a percentage of sugar.
"in fact make you gain weight (I'm not that stupid), but I never actually read the product ingredients. I assumed they must have been made with something like Xylitol "

You know you had to look up xylitol to make yourself sound a little smart
I thought that the TicTac shenanign was a well-known one.  Same as how they get away with "0 sugar" even though they are technically loaded with sugar.
I don’t know man, surely you saw theres sugar in these? Sugar cannot be 0 calories, just common sense.
The European tic tac commercial says “So much freshness in just 2 calories.”
Literally a house episode
How the fuck didnt you think eating 100s of tic tacs arent good for you

  
?????
If it had Xylitol you'd be too busy shitting to worry about anything else.
For the record too much xylitol isn't good for you either.
You're an idiot or this is a joke post.
How are people this stupid?
The problem here is not nutrition labels. The problem here is eating 200 tic tacs A DAY.
To be fair, you fucked up by eating so many tic-tacs, not by not telling your doctor.
LOLLL! Yes, entire tubs of candy have no calories whatsoever.
Sorry, but I can’t even feel bad for you. You may just be an idiot.
Only on Reddit could I read a story about someone's Fruit Adventure Tic Tac addiction.
I’m sorry people are mean. Honestly, the bigger issue is the sugar content. Tik Tacs are fairly high in sugar at 0.5g per Tac. So that’s about 200g of sugar a day for you. Daily recommendation is about 24-25g. I hope you can get off em a bit!
If you were eating two packs a day of mints with xylitol as a sweetener you may actually have lost weight from the constant diarrhoea you'd have.
Bruh 😂
This is an important thing to remember about cooking spray as well. 0 calorie cooking sprays DO in fact, have calories.  And the amount of time per soray is like .5 a second, if like me you spray for 5-10 seconds and make a visable layer, you are adding calories there too. Only know this stuff from my nutrition chemistry class from UNIVERSITY.
You're eating 400 tic tacs A DAY and you say your blood work is NORMAL????? How lax is the sugar level in the USA?? I just have random (normal sized) boxes of hard candies, 1 every few days maybe 2 times a month and a few chocolate bars and the occasional cake and milk tea/ sugary drink and my doctor already wants to get me on pre diabetic meds since my sugar is spiking too close to reaching above the normal range.
![gif](giphy|xT8qB4aZaGbQAmHefu|downsized)
Perfect lol
Bro ate 40lbs of tictacs
I have a client who slams one of these large containers every day. He is a diabetic. He’s in his 70s. And there is absolutely zero way for me to convince him that these things are made of entirely pure sugar.

I’ve tried twice and he just keeps saying no read the label so at this point I gave up.  His health is in shambles in a dozen different ways so I doubt this will be the thing that breaks the camels back.
So if you make a packet of chips 50 servings, then you can legally label it zero calories per serving?


I know I'm over exaggerating but... is that essentially a loophole for food companies? Or at least its the one tic tacs have used...?
Same thing with Splenda. It has the nearly the same amount of calories as sugar.  
Edit: update, I thought it was stevia, it is in fact Splenda. 331 calories/ hundred grams. Whereas sugar has 387 calories/ hundred grams. 
My favorite movie is Inception.
I don’t think so but there should have been. I think there was one where person was eating a lot of gum which acted as laxative which is similar. I don’t think the patient mentioned it to House and he noticed it like this. 
No, it was masking the patients bad breath symptom
They thought OP had lupis.
That's a way better way to label, but it makes it harder for disingenuous companies to pull one over on people, so it won't happen in the US.
And in Ireland/UK, Tic-Tacs advertised themselves as being "only 2 calories!" **because you can't call it zero** in the EU.
I've seen a similar loophole exploited in Germany: You can buy vegetable broth cubes (mix of salt and vegetables/herbs). They report the nutrition facts per 100ml of soup, which corresponds to 2g of cubes. One brand didn't even put the total weight of the cubes on the package, just how many liters of soup it corresponds to.
I've also noticed a lot of the tinned food I get from Europe has decimals and will say like 0.83g of whatever when a US label would either list that as "0g", "1g", or "<1g".  The US labels for a lot of things are super frustrating because of that.
Yeah, that kind of tracking wouldn't fly in Canada either, but this is on OP to some extent as far as critical thinking goes, since the USA tictac containers do list sugar as an ingredient; seems like a failure of the education system to teach people adequately what sugars are and how you metabolize them. I learned this sort of thing in grade 8 in gym class.
I had no idea this wasn’t a thing in America - that is so sneaky.
Gotta love loopholes and the different ways companies try to use it
In the US, you have to label a single serving nutrition but if it’s a container that is commonly consumed all at once, the package nutrition is also listed. Like for a small bag of chips. 


No one else in the world eats tic tacs like OP lol.
Ok in America’s defense we didn’t know it was possible to eat 800 calories of tic tacs a day for years. That’s our bad.
> I've been eating 400-800+ calories per day of Tic-Tacs, in addition to all the other food I've been eating - which is very likely why I've gained so much weight. 

Very likely? How about 100% lol
Это случайный текст, который будет перезаписывать комментарий.
I work in college career advising and recently had a session with a student who was frustrated he wasn't getting any jobs. Via our job platform we can see how many jobs students are applying for, and indeed it was like 100 a week. His resume didn't look awful, either.

Come to find out--he hadn't been reading the job postings or even titles. At all. He had a major in business and was applying to be a dentist, a philosophy professor, a landscaper, whatever. He thought that's how jobs work: You just go to college and then you can get a job. Any job.
I knew a guy who was dumbfounded when he found out potato chips weren’t healthy. He truly thought, ruffles are made of potatoes and potatoes are a vegetable and vegetables are healthy. Therefore, potato chips are healthy. 

I shit you not he really thought that. A was in his mid to late 30s and held an agent position at a huge company. He only learned they weren’t when his doctor said he was diabetic from being over weight and referred him to a nutritionist. 

I had another coworker who couldn’t believe it when she found out pasta and Alfredo sauce wasn’t healthy.
I always remember the scene from whatever that fat exploitation show is, maybe a “my x00 lb life”, I’ve only seen the clip probably here

Where the girl’s mom told her drinking a Diet Coke cancels out a regular Coke
I believe this is a made-up story around the fact that the food industry is allowed to ~~lie to their customers~~ muddle the truth and OP just learned about it or used it as a writing prompt.

I hope you'll use your diploma to solve actual crimes.
All that aside - eating a "handful of tic tacs at a time" is absolutely insane.
Kwik Star (Kwik Trip in most states) has the serving size for their donuts as 1/3 of a donut.  But ofc the calorie number is much bigger (the actual size of the typeface, not the number itself haha) than the tiny serving size font, so many people probably don't notice
I've seen some kind of spray oil list the serving as like 1 millisecond of spray so they could pretend literal oil was 0 calories
Yep. I use "Low/no sugar needed pectin" to make blueberry sauce I like to put on oatmeal and French toast. The nutrition information says 0 calories per serving. But the pectin concoction lists three ingredients, and the first is dextrose, so it must be *at least* one third dextrose (very similar to glucose). According to the label, a serving is a quarter of a teaspoon, so I'll eat probably three quarters of a teaspoon at breakfast: I use one heaping teaspoon of the pectin per pound of frozen blueberries, and I usually end up eating most of that. The pectin still isn't contributing a really substantial number of calories, but it's definitely not zero, and it bugs me.
One thing I don't understand is how my coffee creamer powder says 0% sugar, whereas the very first ingredient of it, is sugar. So, one serving apparently is made of sugar more than anything else, and has 0g of sugar. Idk. It must be a round off thing as well, but it seems impossible.
That's why the EU regulates how you are allowed to present that data.
Look at popcorn boxes (pop secret, or even the "simply" brand). The first column is based on "unpopped" - because someone is eating those kernals, I'm sure - and the actual servicing size is something like one cup, popped. Super sneaky
Two Oreos is a serving size. Who the hell eats just TWO Oreos?!
I love when the front of the package has one unit of measure and the nutrition label has a different one. 

Or, stuff like popcorn that makes it damn near impossible to figure out how many calories are in the bag. Many times it’s precooked weight vs cups after cooking depending what part of the package you look at. There are a lot of people who would be pretty miffed if they knew their “healthy, low cal” snack is like 400+ calories not the like 100 they think it is. 

I know the answer is to weigh your food but ffs I have enough shit to do already I shouldn’t need an advanced degree in math to figure out what I’m eating.
This is why many studies conclude that sugar-free and diet foods and drinks actually cause weight gain in many people. It has nothing to do with the diet products actually causing weight gain and everything to do with people eating more because they think they’re saving more in other areas.
Wow. Hope they dont have kids 😬
This reminds me of the "fat free" craze in the 90s lol.  I used to eat an entire box of cookies at a time, since hey they're fat free!💀
Apparently Common Sense is not a flower that grows in everyone's garden.
And take a look at the ingredients to see what you are eating. Yes the zero calorie label is misleading but the ingredients are listed also and the first thing on the list is sugar. That should be enough to understand you can't be slamming handfuls of them.
At least OP has critical thinking to realize they fucked up after a year of drinking candy and not understanding how they could possibly be gaining weight
Reminds me of the Mitch Herbert joke, “rice is great when you’re hungry and want to eat 2,000 of something.”
Honest to god I’m beside myself with how he couldn’t connect the dots. All 400 of them.
And furthermore. If you’re going to go so far as to spend your time and money on going to multiple professionals to figure out what the problem is and then are asked to track everything you consume, wouldn’t you THINK to include everything you’re consuming?
Funnily enough Tic Tac CAN and do claim to be sugar free while being 100% sugar.

[Source](https://vinepair.com/cocktail-chatter/sugar-free-tic-tacs-are-a-legal-lie/#:~:text=It's%20a%20mint%20that's%20often,claim%20that%20it's%20sugar%20free)
Xylitol is definitely one of the ones that gives you the shits. 0/10 would not recommend.
Splenda also has some calories. But is negligible as it is very small and you only need very little of it.
Yea when OP said he thought they were Xylitol...hew lucky they weren't or he would have crapped himself to death at the rate he was eating them.
**CALORIES 0**


^ingredients ^sugar
I'm sick of companies putting down these ridiculous serving sizes. Like obviously OP's handful at a time is outrageous also, but who's actually just having 1 tictac at a time.
notice it also says zero carbs.
Just googled the German nutrition labels for TicTac, and some give the calories per 100 grams (which is around 400 calories). And some even have the nutritional value for single TicTac, which is around 2 calories.

The complete label reads (for orange flavor TicTac, **per 100 grams**):

**Energy**: 1698 kj/ 400 calories

**Fat**: 0,7 grams  (of these are **Saturated fatty acids**:  0,7 grams)

**Carbohydrates**: 96.7 grams (of these are **Sugar**: 93.3 grams)

**Protein**: 0.1 grams

**Salt**: 0.028 grams

So the "0 calories" isn't the only bs stat in the above label
>Calories 0. 

>*actually has calories, but don’t worry, it’s not much if you only eat a single piece. Don’t think about how much the whole pack has, though, it’s irrelevant. Nobody would be so trump to eat the whole thing in one sitting, right?!
Also the ingredients are actually listed in higher quantity to lowest quantity so sugar is the MAIN ingredient lol.
lol @ *trivial*

Go'T cupboard under't stairs
Oh but (he’s not that stupid) lmaoo this is the best part of the post I couldn’t contain my laughter
Right! You log water and medication with them which are both “low calorie” so not including your major tic tac consumption is crazy to me
.49 grams per tic tac. Under .5 grams can be considered sugar free.
Yeah, I’m gonna try some of them too. Will report back with any changes to my weight or IQ
these ads have gotten too elaborate s/
I can say they're pretty damn good, I was munching on some when I saw ops post, but I did already know they're fattening, I just don't care enough lol
The crazy part for me is that someone guzzling hundreds of candies can remotely think that this has no impact on their health and body
3000 calories excess/deficit = 1lb gained/lost. Right?

Which in this case could be an additional 1/4 of a pound per day, almost 2 pounds a week.
It is a metric fuckton of tic tacs we’re talking about. Seems like the doc should have been a bit more clear with explaining labels and things. But holy hell who eats that much sweet stuff and thinks it’s just in and out nothing retained??
3500 calories is the generally accepted surplus to gain 1lb or deficit to lose 1lb.
3500 calories is one lb of fat isn't it
3500 calories but close
Exactly, people underestimate how little extra calories it takes to gain weight. One 12oz soda is about 290 calories, if you exceed your daily calories by 290 every day you'll put on over 35lbs in a year.

Edit: I'm dumb I was thinking of the bigger 20oz size soda
404 tictacs
800 calories of pure sugar.  OP may as well have been eating it from the sugar bowl.
  
My god.
Yeah it takes a special kind of smooth brain to think that eating 200 to 400 tictacs adds nothing to your diet.
They replied that they thought it must be artificial sweeteners. They put those in everything now, even Doritos.
I don't believe this whole thing. I've crushed one of those 200 packs before, and let me tell ya it's very clear you're eating just straight sugar.
Yea, if you were eating 400 xylitol pills a day, your bowels would empty themselves the moment you ate something.
My God, how many hours did OP's teeth spend bathed in sugar and acid. I hope they get regular dental care.
I didn't think they had so many calories, either. I assumed when OP said they FU'ed, that they had made themselves sick with overconsumption of xylitol, which is typically used in mints as a sugar substitute and doesn't cause tooth decay. Turns out, tic-tacs actually contain sugar. I really think they are taking liberties calling their product mints.
I remember always hearing celery is negative calories because there’s less calories in it than the calories you burn in the process of eating it. I wonder if that’s just a myth or something
That’s where I thought he was going- he Fd up with the dentist.  It’s not going to be good.
Zero calorie sodas?
My first thought was the dentist, too! Those sugar pellets being smashed between his/her teeth all day everyday.
I'm guessing if you buy the packs in bulk, they're cheaper. Grocery stores are buying those tic tags from a wholesaler, OP is probably getting his from one too
Drug addict.  What you just read was an addict that found a legal drug and is now dealing with the consequences of addiction.
sable memorize mourn hat knee quack snatch public dinner handle
You're asking someone who eats hundreds of pieces of candy a day and think they are 0 calories. I'm willing to bet they also have the deed to a few bridges in their house, too.
Check out the Mexican Aspirin girl on r/bestoflegaladvice. We've gone negative common sense on the internet today
Reminds me of the whole "only 30-50% of people have an inner monologue" thing that was popular recently. I have no idea how the hell that is possible. Do people just act on instinct and not consider/evaluate their actions before/after?
They have an equal vote too.
10 should taste disgusting! Even three is too much for me. I use it because it’s better than sugar and not because I think it’s ideal. 
Erm they’re right, artificial sweeteners don’t have calories. If tac tacs were sweetened with xylitol/sucralose/aspartame then OP wouldn’t have gained the weight
I went through a tic tac phase one year of high school. 9 cavities. Haven't touched a tic tac since
In fact, tic tacs are MOSTLY and OVERWHELMINGLY sugar. You FU so badly, OP.
Tic tacs are almost pure sugar
The worst part is that my work is reading chart notes all day long and submit diagnosis codes for these lmao. As my best friend always tells me, "you're very book-smart. For common sense though you're a fucking dumbass."
Well it is the TIFU sub after all, and it’s a pretty good one
I know the feeling. And then I remember some people think the earth is flat, and some think racism is good, and then I reason that maybe OP's level or oblivious is not so bad
I'm glad that people feel comfortable to share and use the subs for their intended purpose without fear of being judged.
You must be new to the interwebs
Yh it can say 0 calories but it just doesn't pass the smell test here. 
On some level you gotta know if you're shoveling in hundreds a day that its probably not 0 calories..
Doctor should be sending OP to an IQ testing service.
💰
Everyone is. America hates consumers
It's cute you think that; they just lie to you in other ways.
US, probably. I’ve seen the ‘0’ label
'Murica, of course!
r/AmericaBad
I remember being so confused about half and half when I moved to America! I just couldn’t figure out the purpose of it!
Yeah, I don't think it is anything more than a silly story highlighting how American companies exploit FDA labeling loopholes.

Sure there are a lot of idiots out there so consider this a convoluted PSA of sorts.
Thats the best part, the label also says 0g of sugar on it. Because in the US they're allowed to round it down  to zero since each individual mint contains less than 1g sugar.
yeah it’s kind of infuriating
You’re glad you left USA because OP is foolish enough to think eating 400 tic tacs a day wouldn’t affect his diet/health?? It shouldn’t matter if it says 0 cal or 1 cal, you should be smart enough to not eat a ridiculous amount of them everyday. And then he’s foolish enough to think “hmmm why have I gained 40lb this year”… MAYBE it’s the 200-400 tic tacs you’re eating per day… just maybe. This post has nothing to do with poor regulations in the US and everything to do with OP being a smooth brain.
Here's the UK nutritional info for comparison.91g of sugar for 100g of product.

https://preview.redd.it/q68srd1n6lwc1.jpeg?width=1096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06d18ba72c4e087c416c081d55f804c565ac3cc6
Apparently calories per 100g is not really a thing in the US (might depend on the state etc though)
Not a thing in the US. I actually just mentioned on the loseit subreddit how I wished that there was a calorie density number. Like a ratio of calories per volume that I could just pick the lowest number. Turns out they already invented that in Europe.
[removed]
Well sugar is less calories dense than fat so working for the basis that a tictac is 2 kcal and weighs half a gram and op gained 40lb body fat then it ate 35kg of tic-tacs or 77lb worth.
That’s only the excess, so probably more
It has to be a reasonable serving or something. Cooking sprays get away with it too, even though avocado oil spray is obviously not 0 calories.
Yeah but it’s also 600 times sweeter than sugar, this plays a pivotal role in its use as an low calorie sweetner. 
The active chemical in Splenda is [sucralose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose) which itself does not have any calories. However, because it is super strong, it is 'cut' with [maltodextrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltodextrin), which does have calories. In total Splenda has about 1/3 the calories of the equivalent volume of sugar. 

It is possible to buy 'straight' sucralose, but using it powder form is difficult because it is 600 times sweeter than sugar. To put in perspective, I make 12.5% sucralose liquid with water and put it in a squirt bottle. To make one gallon of Kool-aid using the packets you would normally combine 1 packet, a gallon of water, and a cup of sugar. To make a gallon of Kool-aid I use one packet, a gallon of water, and a squirt of the sucralose liquid to achieves the same sweetness.
Mmhm. 

Addiction does funny things to the brain. Like, he _could've_ written "400 tictacs (0 cal)," but on some level he had to know that was wrong? Mental gymnastics.
My background is in dietetics and you have to be very detailed when you explain food diaries. A lot of people leave off liquids (water and others, I want to see it All), sugar free candies, non-nutritive sweeteners, seasonings, and cooking oils. Some even leave off any fruits or vegetables because they don’t understand the importance.
There’s a sex joke here somewhere
there was kind of an episode, the patient didn't have a medical issue related to the tic-tacs, but was using a shit ton of them to cover up bad breath caused by the actual issue. I think it was the episode with a guy named Harvey who had a dominatrix tbh.
They do this here in Japan but often they only put calories per 100 g or 100 mL without also putting in how many are in the full container, so it makes the 500 mL drink look like it has way less until you go check another part of the label to see how big the container is. Their labels are a hot mess in general too.
Same thing with litres/gallons per 100 miles. Instead of rating vehicles in MPG, you'd rate them in gallons for a fixed distance of 100 miles. It really shows you just how bad the fuel economy of shitty US "totally for work" trucks really are. And why we need to do away with the emissions exemptions or lower standards for them. They might as well just be burning raw coal.
Tbh as a European I like the US nutrition facts better. Sure, they have stupid exemptions like what OP is talking about but they always clearly state  what the serving size represents visually and the amount of calories in it. A lot of EU nutrition labels either only state the amount per 100g or when they say the serving size they just give the weight instead of a clear visual indication (for example, they might say "X calories per 42.3g serving" leaving you guessing how many candies that equals).
The FDA does actually require companies to list both the per serving and “entire package” caloric contents but it’s only for foods that could be “reasonably consumed in a single eating occasion” I.e. a bag of chips or a soda. I’m guessing no one at the tic tac factory was planning on someone eating 2 bulk packages of tic tacs a day (which is probably a reasonable assumption).
I mean, is this disingenuous in this case or just assuming the vast vast majority of people aren't eating 200+ Tic-Tacs a day?
From the post I expected a single Tic-Tac to have less than one calorie, which is then rounded down to zero. But being allowed to round four to zero is just absurd.
Ads for tic-tacs in the US also used to say they were like 1.5 calories each, but they just don't have that on the package.  I also haven't seen an ad for tic-tacs in years.
The last time I heard that commercial was like 20 years ago, and still, the first thing that came to my mind was "TicTac - only two calories"
Yeah there are some guidelines and it's usually to reflect actual edible product.

Sometimes you see rice listed as ~300 kcal per 100g or 100 kcal per 100g. And that's because one lists raw and other boiled, but it might not say or it says in fine print.
You know they have those rules to get away with shit like this. "Boohoo EU regulations" they're there to protect customers.
OP needs to cut back their Packs per day
Yeah I think it's bonkers that anyone would eat these by the handful and not think "Hey maybe this is bad for me and the reason I'm gaining lots of pounds."
This is completely on OP. Idk what kind of intelligent adult would think they could stuff their face with candy every day, and everything would be fine.
> Yeah, that kind of tracking wouldn't fly in Canada either,

Incorrect sir, we have the exact same "<5 calories = 0 calories" labelling loophole in Canada:

Yeah I mean I learned it from the sides of cereal boxes in grade school and ever since have consistently been woefully shocked repeatedly about how little most American's know about nutrition.  Tic-Tacs are .5g per tick tac and they have 2 calories. One gram of sugar has 4 calories.  It doesn't take a lot of advanced math here to deduce that tic tacs are about 99.9% sugar.
I had a friend who used to eat multiple packs a day. I showed him that it was almost 100% sugar and he refused to believe me mocking me because I couldn’t read the label that said 0 calories. God I hope he gets diabetes soon.
Op didn’t notice sugar as ingredient.
Most cooking sprays I've found at the store list their serving size as something like "¼ of a second spray" so that they can technically say each serving has 0 calories.
It’s only not a thing for a few products like this. Most items will have a per-serving and “per container” calorie listing.
If anyone cares about the math 450 excess calories is around 2 ounces of weigh gain.
Well, that confirms my biases about business majors... 
Well they did tell us that a college degree would guarantee us a job. That's seriously what my teachers told me in the 2000s.
And terrifyingly, that moron’s business degree will almost certainly get them in charge of something important
I see you've met my dentist.
My 300 lb friend in 5th grade thought pizza was healthy because tomatoes are a vegetable (or fruit, w/e). His family would often just do donuts for breakfast. His father was one of George Bush’s neurologists.
Then also not understanding what's making you fat when you are eating sugar pellets all day lol insane as
Yeah even if you think they're actually zero calories like maybe you'd still think "I started getting fat around the same time I started eating 500 tic tacs a day"
It absolutely is
And then not logging it on the food log at all lol
man's shoving fistfuls of candy into his face all day, several hundred pieces, and it takes him months with a team of medical professionals to figure out why he's fat
Yeah, I think there's a huge element of common sense that was missing out here.
I remember I had a bag of chips once where the serving size was like 6 chips.

Who the heck eats just 6 chips?  Teach me that kind of self control.
Who eats only a third of a donut?
When food lableing was getting started Burger King labeled the whopper serving size as 1/3 of a whopper.  It is much bigger than a big mac AND the big mac serving size was 1/2 a big mac... So Burger King made the whopper look like it had less calories than a Big Mac by saying that 1/3 of a Whopper had less calories than 1/2 a Big Mac... Just like the FDA intended to inform customers.
Yeah basically all spray oil is like this, the servings per container is something like 4,000
Dextrose isn't just similar to glucose, it literally *is* just the standard kind of glucose found in nature.
Is it 0% added sugar? A lot of stuff I have says that but it does contain sugar, just as part as one of the other ingredients like fruit or whatever.
The US regulates how that information is presented too, but we let the lobbyists from the food manufacturers decide the best way to list it. So it’s heavily regulated, but in a way that makes it totally possible to obscure the truth.
They don't gain calories when you pop them. That's just so you can measure before or after.
Does putting something in the microwave make it gain calories?
Take a slice of cake and cut it in half. Now it has half has many calories so you can eat twice as much.
Actually diet drinks have been shown to trigger apatite. It's not just that you think you're saving in other areas, and so you make a mistake and overeat elsewhere. The artificial sweeteners actively trigger a hunger response.
Some peoples gardens are just a flower pots filled with sand.
My kid had a neighbor/friend over the other day, my husband makes the kids wooden swords/daggers/Thor's Hammer, that kind of thing.

And neighbor was so excited to play with them, so I run down my usual "no pretend stabbing other human people, no touching other people in any way with the wooden weapons, no swinging wildly if you can't see where everyone else is at that moment, etc",

and this 8 year old is like "Well I think those are all common sense, yeah?" and I'm like "not to my kids, honey..."

They are LoopHole Hooligans, got to lay it all out or they're like "well you didn't said..."
They didn’t do any critical thinking though… if they weren’t fidgeting with the tic-tacs on that virtual visit and the doctor noticing it, they’d still be gaining weight. It’s okay to tell someone they are stupid.
*only in the US with their rounding loophole.
There are a bunch of very legal, straight-up lies about food ingredients in the US. I learned that a lot of 'honey' is just partially or fully cheap sugar syrup from some Netflix doc a while back.
>negligible as it is very small

Isn't that how this whole thread started in the first place?
*adds a trivial amount of calories*
Bag of chips

Suggested serving size: 3 and ¾ chips.

A trivial amount of calories.

This reminds me of Nesquick putting something like "now with 33% less sugar!" on the container simply by making the suggested serving size smaller. Product was exactly the same.
Gonna have to disagree with this one. TicTacs are like gum. Having one at a time is very reasonable. Keep in mind they usually come in minty flavors which most people don’t go and consume 15 of purely because it’s not palatable.

Honestly if people actually did consume serving size quantities, they wouldn’t be fat as hell. A serving size of chips is like 12-14, not the bag.
Me. It's also why I don't buy them.
I mean I don’t eat tictacs often and I eat at most two at the time. They are more about the crunch and not the taste 
> but who's actually just having 1 tictac at a time?


Me. One is the normal number of tic tacs to eat. Yeah, obviously nobody is eating half of a donut or 1/3 a bag of chips, but a single tic tac is normal.
Don't buy any confetti....

Go t'cupboard under t' stairs..
*"THIRTY CRATES??"*
Used 'em in cat litter
Their poor teeth
OP says “I’m not that stupid”
Well yeah, except OP said they gained about 40 pounds
Yes, I came here to say the same thing.
[deleted]
Pretty sure a 12oz can of Coke is 140 calories and Pepsi is 150 calories.


You may be thinking of the 20oz bottles which are more like 240-260.
A can of coke is 140 cals
404 pounds
Yeah super surprising the blood work returned normal after gaining 40 lbs of weight from sugar.
People like this should pay double for insulin.
And an even smoother brain to think it’s not worth even mentioning to either your doctor and/or nutritionist who are following you for the past months to know why the sudden weight gain. Like no, no, literally *nothing* changed in my diet. Oh what ? those **four hundred tic tacs** I’m eating every day ? No that’s nothing…
[removed]
If Tic Tacs had a warning label on them that said something like "Do not dump tic tacs into a bowl and eat them like cereal" people would complain about stupid warning labels, but here we are.
I do find it somewhat fascinating he had a food diary which is literally write down everything that enters your body and he didn’t bother to write down fist fulls of tic tacks because the label said no calories
And to *not* tell your dietitian about it
Yeah like who wouldnt look at the nutrition facts at least once if this is such a large part of their regiment?
If it was artificial sweeteners, they would have died from diarrhea.
Nah, OP is very dumb this time
Tic tacs are about 90% sugar, how anyone could see that and think "well sugar surely has 0 calories" baffles me.
... I have bad news for you. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol and has 2.4 calories per gram lol.

So you kind of contradicted yourself thinking they didn't have many calories,  but also thinking they got sick from overconsumption of xylitol.
>made themselves sick with overconsumption of xylitol

[Obligatory](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/review/B000EVOSE4/R2JGNJ5ZPJT4YC)
>I really think they are taking liberties calling their product mints.

Not sure I understand your point on this one? "mint" doesn't mean sugar free, never has done.

Their original brand name was "refreshing mints" so everything they make is a "mint" even if not mint flavoured.
According to the nutrition course I took in university it's a myth.
Not only is that a myth, but Celery isn't even that exceptional among vegetable on the Satiety Index.
Would you die of starvation if you ate large amounts of celery and not much else?
If you see a starving person and you give them a stick of celery would it outright kill them or help them?

Would say celery has calories...
I need that link right now haha
wtf?   Normal pack is 1.99 euro  in the netherlands and germany and the big jumbo pack is 4.99 euro

Thosr prices might even be higher at this point
Good on you for taking it in good spirits!

Please do some thinking though, in case there are other areas in your life where you might have similar misconceptions or misunderstandings. ☺️
Pretty sure there was a similar story with prostitutes and blow jobs 🤣  5-25 calories at a time.
Well we don't know what else op believes haha
Especially considering how sweet they are
And the only reason it doesnt contain 1g of sugar is because the mint is only 0.5g. it's still almost completely sugar.
How many packs of tictac is that?
Isn’t one regular pack like 20 grams each?

That’s around 1750 packs of tic tac 💀💀
“it ate” 😭
"it"
If 1 Tic Tac is a reasonable serving, then 1 Chip is reasonable as well lol
>some even leave off fruits and vegetables 

oh bc a food log is for the _bad_ foods, right? bc I can’t have too many /s
Also a dietitian. If I had a nickel for every time I explained a 24 hour recall, told them to be as detailed as possible, include anything they ate or drink, and as much detail as possible regarding portions/etc. for them to just go “chicken”…. I could retire lol.
I like to travel.
This must be so infuriating for you. Diet is everything.
If I wasn’t at work I’d google the calorie content of different sex juices, but it’s definitely not zero.
Yea it was , guy was played by John Cho too , good episode loved early seasons of House.
They do this exact trickery in the US too, though usually it's not a 5x as big difference. Super common to find a bottled drink that's labeled as 2 servings per bottle, but only shows the calories for one serving. I mean, you expect that sort of thing on a family sized box of cereal. You don't expect to need a calculator when grabbing a beverage while checking out your groceries...
I'm sorry but this is just laziness on your part of not doing simple math.
Who is stupid enough to believe that a 1000ml milk bottle only contains 100ml? Or that a 300g bag of sweets only contains 100g? Even if you don't look at the label, you can see and feel the difference
I recall there was some cereal in the US where the designated serving size was something ludicrous like 7 pieces. I think Colbert (in the Colbert Report era) did a few bits making fun of it.
It used to be worse, it used to be distance per tank so companies would just put bigger fuel tanks on to implicitly lie about fuel efficiency
So MPG^-1 × 100? Like... It's the same number just presented differently.
I don’t see how it makes a difference if you describe the efficiency in volume/distance or distance/volume. The former just means small number is more efficient and the latter just means big number is more efficient.
Liters per 100 kilometers (or perhaps per 1000 kilometers) is definitely more useful for understanding fuel economy. Kilometers per liter is also useful, but for a different purpose: planning where to stop for fuel on a long trip.
It doesn’t take rocket science to understand that a truck that gets 13 mpg is worse for the environment than a car that gets 40 mpg..
There is so much shady shit with American trucks. Ever ask yourself why there are so few foreign made trucks? Not American pride, but prohibitive tariffs that stifle competition. I believe it was called the chicken tax or tariff that set it.
I mean, in all honesty, I hope that they're just young and don't have good interpretation of things we might find obvious, but 18kg is a lot to gain from sugar drops...
I agree, but the worst part (in my opinion) is thinking that they don't even count on the consumption log.

"Write everything down that you consume in a day."
"Surely you don't mean these things that I munch by the hundreds, right?"
Even if they thought it was Xylitol, eating an entire package is still a bad idea. Haven't they heard the jokes about eating a whole pack of sugar free gummy bears?
help me lose weight, here's my daily food log

\* breakfast:

apple, yogurt

\* lunch:

\* dinner:

But I think we all know how stupid the average person can be.  And just googling it there's dozens of Reddit posts and other forum posts from people going "TICTACS ARENT 0 CALROIES?!!?"

So forget about morals, is that the path to a good country?  To allow companies to exploit the dumbest citizens in your country for profit.

Is it going to make them buck up, pull up their brainstraps, and decide to be smarter, or is it just going to lead to a bunch of diabetics with decreased economic output?
I've gotten into way too many arguments with my mother about this. She uses cooking sprays because they have "no calories," and she's always looking for ways to make lighter meals. It's extremely frustrating, because she is doing the work, reading the labels, counting calories, but the company has adopted an unscrupulous labeling policy so all the hard work goes out the window.
One pound every eight days, 45 pounds  a year yep math checks
Sometimes the stereotypes make themselves
Well those are all businesses aren't they? /s
Today I went to the job factory and did a business
Ahem...a dentist office is *a business!!* /s
Take a business statistics class it's insane the complete lack of actual statistics that is taught
I was working in a drive-thru for a while - was burnt out on my previous field and wasn't ready to start a new career.

Got into a friendly argument with the barista about Georges Braque and analytical cubism. Even Picasso said, *"we must not forget that Braque came first,"* but my man on smoothies was not having it.

High schooler overheard our argument and Billy Joeled us. "Man, what are you doing here?" Asked why we don't both go to college and get degrees etc.

I politely informed our young coworker that half the people on the line had their bachelors at least. See that girl in the dish pit? Ivy. See that assistant manager? Masters degree from Wash U.  

I didn't mean to scare this poor kid, but I don't think they were ready to learn that about the world.
I mean they said that to us too but no one I know took that to assume you could just go be a dentist without training
Nah, no one takes undergrad business degrees seriously.
That moron can now go get his MBA and advance to ultra-moron with ultra-power!
[deleted]
The labels are intentionally confusing...But it's still pretty goofy not to mention something that you ingest by the handful every day.
In the edit OP says “I’m not that stupid!” ……And I just….. beg to differ.
You would be surprised how oblivious people are to amount of food they eat everyday.
Sugar pellets all day long actually made me laugh out loud.
Going to the point of not just seeing your doctor but then being referred to a specialist who refers you to another specialist AND writing out a log of everything you’re eating and STILL nothing ever clicked in their head to mention the 400 candies they ate a day. I don’t put this down to being insane or misinformed, this person is remarkably stupid.
Also the fact they think don’t magical 0 calorie food exists at all - much less one that tastes like that. Even celery has a few calories and it’s mostly water…
I do that pretty regularly.  half a serving of chips, and a full serving of whatever dip.  I've been tracking intake for almost a full year now, and significantly reducing my weight.  It's .. been.. eye opening, for sure.
Soooo many people just taking parts of a donut and leaving the rest "for others."
Yup it’s literally hydrated glucose 

Dextrose monohydrate is the hydrated form of D-glucose, meaning that it is a glucose molecule with an additional water molecule attached. Its chemical formula is C 6H 12O. H 2O.
Nope. First ingredient is sugars. And in the government nutrition facts box, it says 0g sugar, 0% daily intake per 2g of powder.
Lobbyists try that here too... Luckily Europe is more diverse politically, culturally and lingually in parliament and so bribing and convincing is a lot more difficult.
I think it varies person to person. I love my zero coke and it doesn’t make me hungry.
Yes, sorry forgot to mention that part. In the UK (and possibly other countries..?) everything shows the per 100g so its impossible to hide.
Honey is a fun one. 

There is a very clear set of FDA guidelines on what is and isn't pure honey and how it should be labeled.

The issue is that there is no force of law behind those guidelines so anyone can ignore them as they choose without fear of penalty so of course that's what they do.
we're not telling you how many though
Calculating the exact amount is left as an exercise for the reader.
Lol this is absolutely baffling wording. In the UK we have "trace" which means it's so low they didn't bother to count. It's completely the same thing—yet somehow it sounds far less patronising and conspicuously deceptive as "trivial amounts"
I mean, it is trivial for people who don't eat dozens or hundreds a day.
[removed]
There was accessory for instant noodles that claimed to cut 50% of sodium content. In the manual it said "use only half of the flavor package".
>Gonna have to disagree with this one. TicTacs are like gum. Having one at a time is very reasonable.

Me who always chews 2 pieces of gum at once and sometimes adds a 3rd she it starts losing flavor.

I will chow down on tic-tacs though. If I buy a pack (normal size packs not those maga packs OP buys) it's not lasting the hour. I honestly love the wintergreen ones and the creamy minty feeling in general, could eat mints all day if I didn't have to care about the calories.

But even when trying to conserve them, I have at least 2. 1 simply isn't enough to realistically freshen the breath as much as a mint should imo.
I bet you're a great shape!

Well yeah, that would be around 6 months of this new viral TikTak diet.
Honestly, that's why I decided to lose weight. How the fuck am I gonna go and steal medicine from people who actually need it due to my own gluttony and greed.
I'd say his addiction to tic tacs is a bigger issue than gaining weight. There has to be some underlying issues there.
I can only assume this is reddit fanfic because this is about the 4th time I've seen this ridiculous scenario come up in the last few weeks.  This is a reddit morality tale designed to make you angry at the label or angry at America without ever considering the possibility that the person who eats 400 tic tacs a day might have a real problem.  The danger of a tic tac fueled obesity epidemic is only real on this website.
If I eat as many tic-tacs per day as OP, I'd definitely feel like shit all day and get sick. How tf do they even think that it's alright to overdose on sugar like that?
They even taste like flavoured sugar lol
Tic Tacs also get to advertise as 0 sugar because the amount of sugar per serving is below a set limit. Sure op isnt the brightest bulb, but not the stupidest thing I've seen on reddit
Well good thing about xylitol is it will give you bad diarrhea before you can over consume it.
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/03/24/586958.full.pdf

basically you do technically still gain calories from celery

> If we assume that SDA is equivalent to 25% of meal energy (including the cost of chewing) and the woman loses 5% of meal energy in her urine and 30% of fiber energy in her feces, then a celery meal of 5% of body mass (3 kg) would only provide the fuel to cover a little less than six hours of her resting metabolism 

so if eating celery is so miserable that you spend hours chewing it, you would technically expend more calories just from your basal metabolic rate alone, but said BMR is independent of the eating process (and if BMR was considered as part of the equation, eating *any* food slowly enough would make it negative calories)
Well it isn’t for black coffee (no sugar of course). If it’s not a regular coffee drinker! 

Caffeine has some calories, but it will make you burn a little more than the actual calories in it. It’s not magical tho. Is just a couple calories. And only works from small periods if your body is not used to it
You won't die of starvation but eating just one food and nothing else can kill you in other fun ways depending on what you're eating.
Trying to gain 40 lbs?
outgoing grey march follow dog illegal apparatus crowd brave threatening
There's what now?
Keep in mind, OP has been buying in *bulk*
Bro has the bulk size packs, so his 500 estimated packs eaten is way more normal packs
He says they 200 each, which would mean he buys the large packs, at like $5 a piece.
It's no longer a person, it's a tictac..
Probably not if their slogan is "bet you can't have just 1" hahaha
From my cursory look, one teaspoon of sperm contains around 5 calories, and the average "load" is between 1-5 teaspoons, which means you consume somewhere between 5 and 25 calories per suck-and-swallow.
That was one loophole the FDA was trying to close 15 or so years ago. Pretty sure all smaller than 2 liter canned and bottled sugary drinks have to state the entire caloric content on the label as well as the recommended serving size. Part of the reason most pop bottles are standardized at 500ml or 16.9 Oz. now. You rarely see the 1 liter bottles in gas station cold cases anymore because they fall under the threshold and no one wants to read a label and realize they just consumed more calories in a single bottle of drink than the USDA recommended amount for an entire day.
Amount of calories per server: 180


Servings per bottle 3


Get the fuck outta here with that shit, I hate how slimey it feels.
Ramen is one of the more ridiculous ones to me. It shows you calories per serving and also calories of the whole container(which a lot of things do in the US, at least on food). Who the fuck is making either half of a package of instant ramen or making the whole thing and saving half for later? Who?
2.5 servings per bottle of soda because you can't let the math get easy.
They probably aren't looking at the serving size and focusing on the numbers for each category.

In the US it is not unusual for a snack bag of candy to be labeled as just a small portion; say 2 pieces, 5 servings per container. The serving size will be in a smaller font while the calories and other numbers are both larger and bolded.
Yeah, there isn't any difference really.
I fail to understand why using liters per 100 kilometers is in any way more useful for understanding efficiency than kilometers per liter.
Both are just as useful when trying to compare the relative efficiency of two vehicles. Whether you do distance/volume or volume/distance, you just take the larger number and divide by the smaller number to get how many times as efficient the more efficient engine is.
I just learned a sizeable amount of people --like a third, if I recall correctly-- are functionally fucking illiterate in the US. From a 2023 study. I was like wow. This makes so much sense due to the state of *gestures wildly about everything*
The great irony being that the Ford F-150 was the highest selling car during Cash for Clunkers because it just barely qualified for the minimal subsidy based on its MPG (15 city/25 highway at that time).

Then again that was a stimulus program masquerading as a environmental program that hardly achieved either result, but did ruin the used car market for a bit.
[deleted]
Yeah I did a rotation with a dietitian and ran into this ALL the time. Ppl would swear up and down they logged everything they ate and gained weight despite eating only 1200 calories a day. Like lady you’re either physically defying the laws of physics and the government should be putting you in a lab to see where you’re obtaining this mass from, or you’re lying on your food diary. 🙄🙃
I miss the old amazon reviews of the gummy bears, apparently the formula finally changed in recent years so they no longer have the same explosive effects. The old reviews were hysterical.
Thats so funny.
I heard someone recently describe their job as working at an email factory. I think it fits here. 
Tell me this was 2010 without telling me this was 2010.
HA!  This hits so close to home… as an older millennial my parents pushed me towards college “just get a degree- any degree, and you’ll be good”.

So since I liked to read and write, I obtained an English  Lit BA from an expensive liberal arts college (graduated in 2006).  It probably won’t be a shocker to learn that I never did use my degree.  I had such a hard time finding a job that I even worked at a credit card call center for a few years- HATED IT… Went back to school to be an RN.  
I don’t fault my parents - it’s just a different world than they grew up in.  I think high schools need to do a much better job directing students to professions that would match their interests/ skills.  There are so many jobs that I know about now that I had no idea existed back then!!
I never thought someone would actually do that. My teachers just said to major in anything, didn't matter what, and you'd get a job.
Made with potatoes. It’s basically a salad
TBF, plain vodka actually is the lowest calorie booze you can choose. I think it's like 45 or 60 calories per shot. Every other alcohol is a higher calorie count.  

Not that that makes it good for you or anything, just a little less bad than others. 😉
It doesn't have a nutritional label on it so it must be calorie free.
Russians drink it like water and they're solid af. I'm sure it's fine
When you think of things like this, remember Ben Carson.  Brilliant neurosurgeon.  Complete dumbass in most other topics.
I haven't been able to control my incessant snacking so I stopped buying it.... until I go to the store hungry.
Another argument for remote work.  Those people are monsters!
To round down I assume they need .4g or less or serving. Which means that in two grams, sugar must constitute less than 20% - so it may lead on the label but still be less than that. ~20% sugar, 19% powdered milk or something, 18% next thing, etc with preservatives and such to flesh out the last bits to 100%.
The US is so backwards
As it should be
^but ^no ^more ^than ^5.
Trace sounds like they're telling you as an obligation to you whereas trivial amounts is like "sugar? forgeddabout it!"
They use the billions they make to ~~bribe~~ "lobby" politicians.
Round is a shape. I'm not sure if it's a great shape.
Underlying issues hinted at with the bit about fiddling with the container "to keep his hands busy." (putting on Reddit-keyboard-psychiatrist mode) Methinks there's some obsessive behavior, perhaps anxiety, and I'm picturing a hoarder's household with a mountain of empty tic-tac containers next to a game battlestation.
This is a really old tifu story
Yeah, it’s not really fair to OP that they manipulate the label. Like, sure, they should have known that something sweet probably has sugar and if it doesn’t they should read the label. But a lot of people did not get taught about nutrition. I didn’t learn shit about nutrition until I taught myself. I remember being 18 and thinking pixi sticks were fine to eat by the dozen because they didn’t have “fat”. A lot of that is the war on fat that was going on back then. But the rest was simply having very little knowledge about nutrition.  To this day, my mom thinks a giant McDonald’s orange juice is good for you.
heck yeah 😎
So I'm absolutely fucking obsessed with blow jobs. The flavor combined with the soft smush they make between your teeth when you give them makes my brain very happy. I've been giving them in bulk, where each container has 200 blow jobs each, and they come in bulk packs of 12 containers. I tend to give them by the handful while I'm working or gaming, so in a day I can easily slam through 1-2 containers.
I one liter bottle of soda would be about 400-500 cal. (Coke would be 430) Still way more than you probably want to drink, but less than a quarter of the USDA recommendations (2,000 cals)

I do like the "full bag" labeling. Oh, these chips are just 150 cal per serving, wait, 1 bag is 450 calories! As a kid (<30) I wouldn't have cared, but now as an obese half-centurion, its an easy way to talk myself out of overindulging my cravings
I remember getting a frozen pizza that once listed a serving as 1/5 of a pizza. I cannot fathom what sort of maniac cuts pizza into slices divisible by five.
My friend didn’t know how to calculate the cost of gas needed for a road trip in her own car
Reminds me of when the 1/3 pounder bombed in McDonalds because people were too stupid to realize it had more meat than the 1/4 pounder. They saw a bigger number and assumed more meat.

Middle of that decade. Just out of curiousity, what about it says 2010?
> I think high schools need to do a much better job directing students to professions that would match their interests/ skills

Preach! I got no direction and was told "you're smart, you can do whatever you want!" Uh, that doesn't mean I'd actually be any good at what I ended up choosing because I thought it was "cool".
A big part of the problem is the fact that so many of the degrees you can get literally do not have a career that they are applicable to. The only career path is in academics, teaching the degree itself. 

Another large portion of degrees actually have a legitimate career path, but colleges over-produce graduates to fill that niche, and students don't find out until after they've graduated and discovered there are 100 applicants for every 1 job opening.

Even back in the early 2000's there was a joke about Truckers and their biology or history degrees. In the 2020's it's 10x worse.

And wine is made from grapes, which are a fruit, therefore, it's healthy.
That's like 23-30 tic-tacs per shot!
Pretty sure white tequila is the lowest cal alcohol (source: am obsessed with calories and I specialize in drinking the lowest cal drinks in that will get me the drunkest)
> a little less bad than others

In terms of calories and carbs only!

As a long time heavy drinker who has tried all kinds of ways to be 'healthier' about it over the years (I'm certain I'll quit one day, just not in a hurry yet), I have found that beer is *far* less bad for my digestive system than vodka.  Even vodka heavily diluted with water does worse things to me.

Beer has more calories & carbs, yeah, but when you're using it as a meal replacement...
Because quality vodka is just pure ethanol and water. It doesn't get much lower calorie than that. Ethanol has 7kcal per gram, so the only difference between vodkas for calorie count should just be alcohol content.
I feel so attacked by this comment right now
Ya, it could be, but, it's still stupid. I don't think they should be allowed to round down to zero. Because people will think there is no sugar, and so they can take asich as they want, which is false. Perhaps for other reasons too, but there is sugar, is the point.
Only if you view it from the consumer's perspective.

The US sees everything through the lens of Corporate Freedom and rapacious consumption.
You know, it’s two fold. Let’s pretend Congress did actually do something about it and enforce proper guidelines for food packaging. We would hear nothing from the press but how stupid it is that Congress is looking into it, when *clearly* we should all know that food companies are going to lie a little bit about their product and we shouldn’t be so stupid. It would be the McDonald’s lawsuit all over again where people thought the woman was being petty because “of course coffee is hot!” when it was, in fact, 190F and they had been warned already.  

So, I agree that it is absurd that our elected officials let this happen, but the press also has a say in what people think.
I think the dodecahedron is a pretty neat one to be honest, don't be too hard on yourself
ADHD hyper focus? The way they describe how the flavor and texture are super satisfying plus the fidgeting sound super familiar to my own ADHD behaviors. I once went through an obsession with Riesen chocolate caramels and put on like 10lbs. Thankfully I was 22 and it fell off pretty fast lol.
I have to say you are most likely overthinking this one.

The man had 800 calories of pure sugar a day for god knows how long and you think hes fidgeting because of mental health issues?
I wish I could be who I was 2 seconds ago before I read this.
I think you mean half-centenarian, unless you’re half an ancient Roman officer
I mean me either, because the costs change so heavily depending on where you need to get gas. Over by the cosco is a few dollars cheaper for me than by my house so how should I know for a whole road trip
Just after 08 when a lot of millennials were graduating college, so it was common for them to struggle finding even entry level jobs when they were competing with people with years of experience - since those people were also trying to get jobs after getting laid off 

More of a stereotype that had a lot of ripple effects that didn't resolve until covid caused a lot of people to retire (or uh... die.) 

Side note, in some industries with smaller head counts there's a knowledge gap issue going on - older folks retire, and there weren't/haven't been enough younger folks to replace them (between older workers staying put and younger workers not breaking into the industry)  so a lot of institutional knowledge gets lost, which hurts companies (more mistakes) and workers (less training).
Not them, but it was a shit time for degree-related job prospects if you were fresh out of college or had more degree than experience. You were fighting people a decade or several into their career for the same positions.

Look up the info on getdrunknotfat.com that's where I did my initial research, long ago. I'm not sure how accurate it actually is, but it was nearly impossible for me to find calorie counts on any alcohol whatsoever until I found that site.
Lucky for me, it doesn't trouble my system. I usually mix at a ratio of 10:90 liquor:zero calorie mixer. I found that this mix produces a nice little buzz that I can sustain at my natural rate of consumption without getting too intoxicated. It's different for everyone, though. I can't drink beer, it makes me gain weight like crazy. I don't drink to replace meals, though. I just try to be conscious of what I'm eating and stick to healthier choices.
lol I've rotated around beers during my functional alcoholic periods and I always land on good ol' Miller Lite.

I don't drink liquor because it's harder to keep track of and it tears up my stomach. Seltzers seem to give worse hangovers and Tweas/lemonades are just way too sugary. Craft beers also seem to give me *much* worse hangovers.

Miller has treated me well over the years, but it's catching up to me as I get older. I can feel my organs now. I think it's time to slow down.
Oh my god you’ve cracked it, the US is so much understandable from that viewpoint. What a horrible way to live.
Lmfao. I forgot my user name. Hahaha..
You're just growing as a person.
It’s very sus. I think he might be lying about his age.
Nah, I reckon they meant half centaurian. That’d be it.
No, even without that variable; she couldn’t comprehend an equation that would give her the answer. She didn’t need to calculate it down to the penny
Ah, yep, I feel ya. I graduated into that recession, but was lucky to be heading into an industry with major economic lag. So I got to work in my major for about 5 years.
> it's time to slow down

Yeah, I've been telling myself this for years.  Good luck to us both, haha
It sure is. We're working on changing it without murdering the stupidest 1/3 of our population. These are trying times.

TIFU by freaking out my GF’s coworkers by taking her out to lunch. 
Last Friday I had the day off work and decided to surprise my girlfriend at her job by stopping in to take her out to lunch as her shift was about done. She works at a very large and popular wholesale store that has hotdogs. She told me beforehand that I could come see her at work any time and there would be no trouble. 

I walked in the front door and walked past the card-checker girl. She did a double-take and asked if I work there. I replied  “no, I do not. I am here to see an employee, however. I’m looking for ——— in ———.”

She sheepishly got her radio and said, “management to front entrance; non-emergency”

A manager with the largest tablet I’ve ever seen strapped to her arm walked up and I explained again why I was there. She called for my GF on the radio but she was not near her radio. I apparently kicked the hornet’s nest and I could hear chatter on other employee’s radios. 

“Who’s that guy here to see ———-?“

“Are we being audited? He looks important”

“GUYS, LOOK BUSY” 

I caught glances from just about every worker nearby and I could feel them trying to figure me out

It was at this time my GF got back to her radio and heard the commotion and stepped out of her office and made eye contact with me. She wrapped up her work and we went out to lunch finally. I asked her why there was such a ruckus. She said that I dress nicely and I’m very polite which are characteristics of a corporate rep who comes in to fire people. That’s when she also admitted to me that I sometimes have asshole resting face. I guess I need to smile more. 

TLDR: I surprised my GF at work and her coworkers thought I was there to perform an audit or fire somebody. 
Bring a clipboard next time. Don't even put anything on it, just a clipboard
Now i'm curious how to dress as nicely to trigger that behaviour on random workers lol
I did that to a bunch of Starbucks stores on the regular a while back. I had a job where I did cellular signal strength surveys. Part of my job at each site was to make a freehand drawing of the layout of the sales floor and back room. I used to swivel my head around and make the drawing on my clipboard while waiting in the line to get a coffee and find out who the manager on duty was. When I explained my business to the baristas, I usually saw relief in their faces. Often they told me I looked like a guy from corporate doing a surprise audit.
Take the compliments and run with them I guess.

"He looks important."

"You dress nice."

Next time you stop by you can give them the ol' business smile and calmly explain that there is nothing for them to worry about lol
“She works at a big box wholesale store that sells $1.50 hot dogs, chicken bakes, $5 chickens and refuses to bring back the supreme pizza”. 


We may never know where she works.
::writes down note to self:: Ask wife for asshole resting face tonight.
Asshole resting face is a gift... Use it wisely.
Many years ago I worked at a bank. My boyfriend at the time had a very stereotypical gruff biker look (long hair, full beard, lots of heavy black clothing). One day he came in to take me out to lunch. He was hovering by the check-writing stand, waiting for me to finish with a customer. When I was done, I greeted him and we went to lunch, not thinking anything of it.

Afterwards, my coworker told me that she thought he was either some creepy stalker the way he was watching me, or he was there to case the place. She had a whole description written down to give the cops. I think she eve tried to get a photo of him on her cell phone.
As a woman in construction, this is what it's like walking on site and having everyone assume you're the safety lady. 
HARD HATS GUYS!
Mikey put your hi vis on I won't ask again! 
Jeff get a taller ladder, don't stand on the last rung.
Jimmy that's a near-miss, I wanna see paperwork on my desk in an hour! 
And then me like..... Hi... I'm here to pull some wires?
Gotta lean into that stuff ! 

My wife works in IT sales and her CFO's office is right by the receptionist when you enter the building. I went in to pick her up one day and decided to have some fun with it as I was wearing a suit. I gathered by my "BD Energy", walked up to the receptionist and loudly stated, "I am NAME from COMPANY (where I really worked) and I am here to see Ms. WIFE" (we did not yet share last names). Their CFO overheard and came out, there were handshakes and introductions, offers of food and drink, etc. When my wife came out I walked up to her and said, "Ms. WIFE, it's great to finally meet you" and then pulled her in for a kiss.

When she found out what was going on, she was absolutely mortified. She still hates it when I tell the story 5 years later.
Show back up with a solid white hard hat and a clip board.  Be vague and ask to see their service logs...
Many years ago I used to work in a call center for a major telco.  In our district there was a regional manager for basically "corporate security". He was the guy that if someone was getting fired would show up and escort the employee out, arrange to have their stuff sent to them.   That kind of stuff.    

I had worked there for just about forever and had known him for over a decade and we were work friends.   Every time he would come into town he would let me know and we would meet up for breakfast/lunch to catch up on life, kids, whatever.    

Whenever he was coming in to fire someone he always wore a salmon-colored tie.  It was pretty obvious after a decade of people seeing him come into the building and people leave and him wearing his tie that it was his firing tie.  We had talked about it at lunch one time and he said it just kind of happened that a few times he had worn that tie to an employee meeting and it just became his standard issue when he had to do that.    

Every time he walked onto to floor of our call center, wearing that tie, it was like watching a herd of cats on a glass floor.  Everyone popped up in their cubicles, people started whispering, it got tense.   The amusing thing was that 99% of the time it had nothing to do with our unit and he was just passing through and would stop at my desk to say hi or arrange lunch later, but that didn't negate the power of the tie.    
A few years before they closed our office and laid everyone off he showed up one day in a pair of slack, a sport coat and no tie.  He was finally retiring and wanted to say so long before he left.   Some of the people around my desk heard he was retiring and came up to say bye, good luck, etc.  As they were saying good-bye more than a few commented on and chuckled about the tie and he said he had retired it to the back of his closet to never be worn again.
Your idea of fucking up and mine are not the same. That's "a mildly amusing thing happened today"
I'm sure all the other employees are going to ask your GF who you are if they saw you two leave together. She should make up a good story for the next time you show up.
I used to be an auditor at one of these clubs and know for a fact you put every department manager in a panic and the regional manager may or may not have already been on their way to greet you lol. Next time you just need to wear a badge/nametag and hold a brief case and they'll clock you from the parking lot
You have resting corporate face!
The real fuck up if this is factual is that you were able to hear the employees saying 'look busy'.
I hope you took her to the food counter and bought her a hot- dog for lunch.
Ask for the TPS cover sheet.
That's hilarious. I've had similar experiences for the same reasons of my outfit + resting sour face. Externally I look like an authority figure, internally I'm as stern as a golden retriever.

1) I was waiting outside of a club at one point, my gf was in there with her friends and I was just hanging out until they were ready to go. A small group of inebriated but friendly guys came up to me to show me their IDs, thinking I was the bouncer/doorman. 

I gave them a raised eyebrow (internally: the fuck? 🤔 ) which they interpreted as declining them entry. One pulled out a few bills with intent to bribe me. By then I'd realised what had happened, and said "that won't help you here mate". Feeling guilty, I then told them, "you'll behave yourselves won't you? I'd hate to have to come have a chat with you". They all eagerly agreed, and I was left trying explain to the next group of people who had pulled out their IDs that the door check was inside and downstairs.

2) I was having a beer with a mate, went to the bathroom, and as I entered a guy exited the cubicle with well powdered nose and wide eyes, because he thought I was a cop. Then he realised I wasn't, and told me so. To which I laughed. All good...

Followed by a nervous, "you're not are you?", "do I look like one?" 👮"..yes. It's my birthday. Friends bought it. uhm..did you want a bump?" "Is it really your birthday?" "Um..yea..Yes." Then he showed me his ID. Really was his birthday. So I just said "happy birthday" and went to take a leak.

Afterwards, bar tender said the guy had bought me and my mate drinks, and when I nodded over to him, he did the whole "omfg, that's the guy! that's the cop!". I like to think we both got a fun story out of that interaction.

**tl;dr** I apparently look like a cop, bouncer, auditor, and a professor (so far of history, nursing, and architecture). Mostly due to my staring off into space with a look of sour skepticism.
I love these kinds of TIFU!!
For future reference you can say you’re there to pick up a prescription next time if you don’t have a Costco card. It’s illegal to refuse you.
You must be tall as well
Im actually quite surprised they were willing to just give up that information about an individual employee. Unless you've stated and we confirm they know you, we do not give out names, shifts, hours, etc. 
Too many reasons why these days
Bring doughnuts next time as a peace offering
Ah yeah I too dress so nicely that the poors often think I am their better. Thank you for sharing a story I can finally relate to.
Change nothing you intimidated them good very good
Showing up to audit people is actually really fun.  The first thing I always ask for is a tour if I’ve never been there before.
" “Are we being audited? He looks important” "

&#x200B;

Yeah, ok
If it was Costco which you are making it sound like, I find it hard to believe anyone supervisor or up thought you were auditing or anything. Anyone from Costco corporate in a warehouse on business will always have their name badge on and they're easily recognizable because corporate name badges have pictures on them. Anyway, hope your GF enjoys working for Costco, I do.
For all you commenters: calm down satan
I think it's called "resting bitch face." Wouldn't a resting asshole just look like a gaping hole?
You got me at 'asshole resting face' -- thanks for the laugh brother.
Totally get it. I have the worst RBF. In no way shape or form do I really care what any other person is doing at any given moment. If I talk people think I talk to much, If I stop talking for a single second people think I am mad. There really is no winning.
"and stepped out of her office"

&nbsp;

People don't normally have offices in retail, so yea when someone who looks like a corpo comes to talk to someone in RETAIL who has an office you know shit's about to go down 

&nbsp;

Now if your girlfriend was one of the many other people in retail who do not have an office (cashier, or just about anyone else really) there would've been no issue, simply because why dafuq would a corpo come all the way out to talk to a cashier?
Reminds me of the two idiots my employer once had.

State Police car pulled up, right outside the lobby doors, and the receptionist quipped "Oooohh, someone's in trouble!".

Someone else gets on the radio, asking if anyone's expecting police. There's a bunch of chatter: A suggestion that they're there to arrest the floor manager for the war crimes he'd committed in the men's room, a comment that they had to be coming for Dan (a man so nicknamed because he looked a lot like the sketches of D.B Cooper), etc.

A couple of minutes pass and the trooper finally gets out of his car and walks into the building. The receptionist pipes up again and says "Sorry guys, it's just me! Hi, Dad!"

He was there to take her out to lunch.

About an hour later someone noticed that Ed and Frank, two of the machine operators, are missing. They're still clocked in, but their cars are missing, so the cameras get checked. As soon as the radio went off with "Is anyone expecting police?" they both put down their things and made a dash for the back door.

They weren't fired, but they were given a few days off to "Get their shit straight".
This is a perfect TIFU. Thank you 
I’ve been in Pharma Sales for 14 years, and wore a suit everyday for about 10 of those. I would get confused for all kinds of people all the time and lawyers was a common one. People genuinely freak out when they think a lawyer on in their store. Now that I wear scrubs every day, I get called “Dr.” a LOT, and I’ve even been thanked for my “service” during COVID. My response is always “I’m not smart enough to be a Doctor, but thanks.”
They were probably used to her other boyfriend taking her to lunch
That's hysterical.

On a different note if you want to break into any office during office hours just show up dressed nicely with a contractor's clipboard. Most people will let you in and won't question you being there.
I drive a silver Crown Vic. The first time I used it to pick up my mom from work, they all thought a police officer came to get her. I am not a police officer.
Surprisingly it’s very easy to do this. I have no idea why but even just dressing casually nice makes people think you’re important. It Makes me think of the whole people not noticing that Superman and Clark Kent are the same person.
“She works at a very large and popular wholesale store that has hotdogs.” 🤔 could it be ostcoCay? (and if I’m wrong even funnier)
Is it Friday? Is he wearing a tie? 

Someone’s getting fired.
You should walk into another office building and announce a company-wide layoff.
You done wanking?
This seems like an odd flex.  "I dress better than people going to a warehouse store."
Cute story! She sounds like a keeper!
Need to see the outfit!
Test your power in different settings. Let’s see what kinda trouble you can get into 😀
Well they can see it as a firedrill how to respond when a real one shows up.
Show up. Walk around and point at random shit and say hmmm....
take a calculator next time, look at various people, input things into the calculator and carry on
Good read.  I thought they were going to think you were a crazy person or a stalker.  So much funnier.  "Act busy!"
Business suit with a clipboard or maintenance jumpsuit with a ladder and tool bag can get you into a lot of places.
Resting asshole face or not, you seem like a sweet person. Don't get discouraged :) maybe come riding in on a Segway next time
Wholesome and hilarious, well done and thanks for sharing
That’s the cutest tifu I’ve ever seen
Are you one of the Bob's?
The formal socio-economic classes might be over, but the self imposed classes are definitely alive.
I’m so sorry 😂 I cannot get past the part where he had to specify that she “works at a popular wholesale store that has hotdogs” do the hotdogs come up later in the story? Are they having hotdogs for lunch? I’m so amused. 😂😂😂 okay now I shall finish reading the story lmfao 😂
Ok hear me out.


You already dress for the part.


Send them a *tailored* resume.


Don't let her know.


Show up, she'll say "lunch?"  


"Audit. Let's get started".
Many years ago when I was single, I really wanted to try this nice restaurant in downtown Jacksonville, FL (Matthew's Restaurant in San Marco). They had a tasting menu and I wanted to treat myself to a nice night out. I was a bit nervous to do something like that solo, but figured wth, it'll be a good time. I had tickets to the symphony for after dinner.

I wore a suit and when I arrived, I could immediately tell the staff were going out of their way to be extra cheery to me. It was odd. The waitress was so nervous serving me, at one point she knocked a half-full glass of water into my lap. I was there for a couple of hours and it was honestly one of the best meals I've ever had.

At the end, I asked if she was new and told her she did a fantastic job. She said that since I was dressed well and dining solo, they assumed I was a restaurant review critic that was there to do a write-up for the restaurant.

On a side note, if anyone is nervous about fine-dining solo like that, just do it. It's great because you can eat at your own pace, really enjoy whatever it is you're eating/drinking, and you don't have to feel forced to make conversation with anyone if you don't want.
Carry a whistle but make sure it doesn’t make a sound when you blow it
Rare I see a relatively wholesome post in tifu
Pretty sure you could get anyone there fired now.  Just show back up and give the word.
Funny story but whats tifu here?
I would trade this experience for my own, any day!! I used to work at a popular “jesus chicken” place, and the boyfriend I had at the time would come in and sit from the start of my shift to the end of it. It was embarrassing and awkward. So much so, that after enough coworker complaints, our operator actually asked him to leave and verbatim told him “it was weird to sit there my entire shift”. We had other guests that would stay for extremely long amounts of time, but when coworkers found out it was my bf, it gave them all the heebies (myself, included, but this was a young version of me that was swayed by “religious submission”) I felt so vindicated when another grown man from a decidedly Christian establishment stepped in and voiced concern.
This is familiar! I’m a marketing guy and sometimes do ride along with sales reps to see how my materials perform in the field. The reps love it, because their clients always think the rep is being audited so they get unusually nice vibes from everyone those days.
“Guys TIFU by going to my girlfriends work and everybody thought I dressed so nice and my girlfriend thinks I’m so polite and dress so good. They all thought I was a corporate boss because I look so good!”

..cool bro
“I’m here to inspect the hotdogs..”
My family tells me I have resting sad face. They are always asking me "are you ok?" "What's wrong?" I'm like "I'm fine. Everything's fine. Stop asking!" So I know how you feel.
Oh! Stuff like this used to happen to me when I was an office manager. I dressed up neatly, oftentimes with a vest and either ties or bow ties.

Whenever I had to go shopping after work, either a "wholesale large store that sells hotdogs" or their smaller counterparts, man, people would treat me SOOOOOO differently. It was funny to witness how clothing had a huge impact on social interactions.
This is great! Had something similar happen to me when I went to visit an old boss. She was showing me around the new store, it was the same location but now a new department store instead of the office supply store I worked at with her.

One of the employees was in the break room and was like “is he from corporate?” And we had a good laugh. She was like you’re just dressed nice and Manager was showing you around I thought you were doing an inspection like a district manager or something. I was in jeans and a plain blue oxford untucked and sleeves rolled. Looking back I was dressed nicer than some of the district managers I’ve had in the past so I guess I saw her point lol
Oh, that has potential for some long term hilarity. You and your gf should take this ball and run with it. Show up once a month and maybe bring a clipboard or a moleskin notebook. Take a note here and there as you look around. Maybe gesture toward someone with thw back of your pen as your girlfriend comes out to meet you. 

All innocent stuff, but you can really have some fun with it.
dress llke a shark and watch the fish scatter lol.
Well, if you take her out to lunch again, I’m sure they will all recognize you!
This is hilarious man
I bet in addition to your face walking in with authority had a huge impact. Walking past the front door person without even paying attention to them gave the impression of importance.
I love this 😂 

My clients tell me that I knock like a cop, so I am ultra careful when visiting them, or I scare them into not answering
I had to carry a folder for a job, and I noticed I was getting seriously good service when I was writing stuff down in the folder as I was eating lunch at places. 

Funny how it works like that.
You could use this to improve the workplace "no free coffee and doughnuts? Oh boy oh boy" *scribbles on a notepad*
Bring a clipboard and keep asking folks for their names
This is the first time I've heard that someone has a CEO presence, let alone fucks up for having it
I completely get this. I had to learn how to turn it off/on. It’s nice that I’m not the only one with this issue at times.
At least she was kind enough to tell you that you have Asshole Resting Face. All who suffer from this should be aware so they don't scare children and horses.
The comment thread here is solid gold.
ROFLMAO
Asshole resting face 😂 dead
Asshole resting face lmao.
I'm trying to imagine what that looks like.
They were probably used to her other boyfriend taking her to lunch
Bro. I've got resting douche face, too. 😭

Something similar happened to me over 10 years ago. Started an internship at an oil company, was told to wear a labcoat in the gantry, and had everyone panicking thinking I was a boss/manager.
[deleted]
Tell me you are a white man without telling me you are a white man
How on earth does this get 8k upvotes this was the most mundane story I’ve ever heard. I fucked up today by making people think I was someone else without doing anything but standing there LOL
How is 5 minutes worth of confused Costco employees a "fuck up"
How is this a fuck up? Dumb as hell
LOL. I had sort of a similar situation some time ago. I went into a bank to cash a check. I caused a bit of a stir by the I was dressed and by my manner. I had just come from a job interview and was dressed in a suit and tie. (Not what the average person would normally wear in the Phoenix, AZ area in the midst of their endless summer.) Also, I have always "walked with purpose" and that only became more pronounced after being in the military.

The teller serving me asked, rather nervously, "Are you with the Secret Service"?
Bring a tablet with next time let them know you're from the better Business bureau lol
Who cares
Come on, it's resting bitch face. There's no need to rename it.
This not TIFU.


This OP flexing.
“Are we being audited? He looks important.”

I don’t believe you. I know people that work at Costco. I don’t believe you.
Did you take her out for a glizzy and a drink?
What a shitty ass story. Why did you even post it in this subreddit? You fucked up by looking nice and having a resting bitch face? This is not a TIFU sir..
[deleted]
Very nice story but NOT a TIFU because it doesn’t sound like there were any consequences for you or your girlfriend. No one got fired, no one even got in trouble. You just panicked a few people who are now having a good laugh about it. This is the wrong board for this. I do enjoy the story though.
Lmao, i love how he throws in the hotdog comment to make sure we know its costco
Bro, trying saying a girl has resting &&&&& face into days climate. For f’s sake, ask a girl to “smile” more and watch the female incels come for you with pitch forks
What if you were her abusive asshole ex-boyfriend there to stick a knife in her?  You want her place of business to let just anyone just walk on in, past the "card-checker girl".  What you did wasn't appropriate.  Unless your girlfriend owns the place, it's private property, and you don't have a right to just walk in, especially when what you did made people uncomfortable and potentially feel unsafe.  Shed your entitlement.
OMG this is hilarious.

This workplace is very protective of its employees, which is why it's one of the better options in that realm. I'd be thrilled that they took someone trying to enter to see a certain employee so seriously! They may have even only pretended to think it was an audit to get a read on the situation.

(Remember, there was a gunman in one of those stores a few years back. Gotta be careful, unfortunately.)

I'd say either get a card or don't surprise her there in the future. 😊
[deleted]
I'm still confused why you would go out for lunch at the end of her shift. I mean it's cool but I never would have thought a company would be cool with that. 
Sounds like your GF needs to find a new workplace.
Lame ass story
They were probably used to her other boyfriend taking her to lunch
😂😂😂
Maybe look at my watch and shake my head a lot. 🤣
Print out a really big picture of your gf (A3 / A2) and stick it to that clipboard
When I was in a management role, I made sure to set aside 15 minutes a day for "walking around looking angry with a clipboard time".
[draw this picture and leave it sitting out for a snoop to see.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SipsTea/comments/18dlrok/our_exterminator_left_his_notebook_at_our_house)
My dad was drafted into the Army back in the days they that in the US.

He told me he learned real quick to grab a clip board as often as possible. He said if you had a clipboard everyone assumed you were already busy and wouldn't assign you for anything else.
And answer every question with another question.

"How can I help you?"

"And you are?" *Taking notes
I had a job as an assistant once where I had a clipboard with space inside to keep forms that I needed quick access to. I also would keep a couple blank pieces of paper on the front sketch when I was waiting. 


After a couple days I got told that I was freaking people out because I would stand around concentrating on my clipboard and appearing to rapidly write stuff down. 
have an appropriately coloured lanyard hanging out of your pocket. Just the lanyard, nothing else.
If he brings a clipboard, he won't even get stopped - they're more likely to salute or bow.
A clipboard, a lab coat, and resting bitch face can get you into just about anywhere.  If you get stopped, ask the person’s name and the name of their immediate boss, then scribble something on the clipboard while saying, “Oh good, I’ve been meaning to speak with them when I’m done here.”
Or, even better, one of those leather document holders. Make sure you keep it closed; keep them guessing as to what might be inside.
The best advice I ever got was to carry a clipboard. 

Also, to walk fast and look worried. Bonus points if you carry a stopwatch.
No, bring an even BIGGER tablet 😄
I've gotten into so many concerts for free by looking harried while holding a clipboard and wearing a hi vis vest.
Pretty much every Deviant Ollam youtube video.
I worked as tech support in a factory and tried that, all the section managers came around real quick to ask me what was going on.

Then they called me an asshole.
For maximum douchebaggery you need an iPhone and apple watch that you swap between impatiently while waiting.
Don’t forget to also wear a whistle.
Better yet bring another friend and start pointing out changes that need to happen
r/actlikeyoubelong
I’d put a piece of cheese on it.


“Fuck, he’s got a clipboard with a piece of cheese on it. Everyone, pull the cheeses! Put fresh cheese out!”
yes the clipboard will add gravitas. And glasses.
Do crosswords on your clipboard. Silently mutter the word you are filling in
Paper and a red crayon
I do a lot of inspections in the construction world and the power of a clipboard is hilarious.
Print out a bunch of nonsense and drop the clipboard down on the desk without anyone being able to see it.  The sound alone still sends chills down my spine.  Worked food service 20 years and if you heard the metal clipboard hit the counter, it was the first warning that the health department was there.
There was a guy who escaped from prison with nothing more than a clipboard. He stole a clipboard somewhere and dressed in his best jeans and a white shirt, got his hair cut, and started from inside the prison telling the guards he was from the state prison commission doing a spy inspection. The guard on the inside radioed ahead to the guards on the way to the exit to have heads up because a state inspector was on his way. With nothing more than a clipboard and a cocky attitude the guy walked out of prison without anyone knowing he was gone.
Op: I am here to inspect the falanges.

Emp: what's a falange

Op makes a note on the clipboard while saying "staff is unaware of falanges, wouldn't be surprised to not find any falanges in this site"
Worked at a warehouse for a US EV manufacturer, the fucking clipboard is magic. Dress nice and even if you drive a forklift you can go wherever you want. Construction barriers? Walk right through them to check out the progress. Want a break? Grab a clipboard and just walkthrough the warehouse with an inquisitive look on your face. People move out of your way and ask if you need anything.
Everyone should keep a clipboard in their car at all times.  There are dozens of times that it can come in handy, and this is just one good example.
Oh no, you need a few papers and a form on it. Something to flip through checking off "boxes". Look at your watch a lot and check another box.
A pink and black striped polo shirt, grey jeans and a grey pea coat. And asshole resting face
Sounds like that workplace is full of triggers like that.
Me and a Co workers used to always to to Costco for lunch - we dress business casual. We used to get full samples there, I imagine they always thought we were from Costco Corporate lol.
As a former Starbucks barista/manager....QASA (quality assurance something or other) audits were literally the bane of our existence. They always happened by surprise and are way more intense and detailed than any state health inspection I've ever encountered. I imagine the relief those employees felt is similar to what I felt whenever my store had an audit happen when I wasn't there to suffer through it 😂
The sky is sure to fall after mentioning the fact there’s nothing to worry about
> He looks important

People sometimes have a look like they belong.  A long time ago I used to be a nightclub doorman (check IDs, make sure people pay, hold the guest list, etc.).  Years later I was just standing in front of a bar waiting for some friends with my arms folded and people just started showing me their ID.
Bruh, when someone says there's nothing to worry about, THAT'S when there's something to worry about!
Hey, just between you and me. *You* have nothing to worry about.
Some of the other things that they definitely said in this real story:

"He looks well endowed"

"I bet he makes a lot of money"

"I'm not gay but I would"
It guy version of that:

Wrinkled polo and jeans, carrying a laptop and a backpack with a mild look of annoyance. They'll welcome you with open arms to fix whatever and then some.
OP: do not be afraid (:

Employees: _mass hysteria_
"It's just a casual visit today. Those rumors of layoffs are completely baseless."
Don't forget "Past the card checker girl".
🤫
I am 97% sure it's NASA/JPL, but POSSIBLY... on the Berkhut oil rig off the coast of Sakhalin, Russia.

Can't imagine anywhere else.
Where is the fucking onion crank machine?
I got my degree there. The employees even tell you they love you!
No supreme is why I go to Sam's mostly now.  I need my sausage pizza fix!
Bro this was edited to say she works at a wholesale store that sells hotdogs and I knew it was Costco and I don't even have a Costco within an hour of me.
I want my combo pizza back.
[deleted]
Facts bring back the combo pizza! COSTCO I KNOW YOU KNOW WE WANT THE COMBO PIZZA!
Wonder if that place also has samples of food available while you’re shopping.
Damn, I thought that particular unnamed club-based wholesale store treated its people pretty well.  They pay much better than walmart, at least

> She said that I dress nicely and I’m very polite which are characteristics of a corporate rep who comes in to fire people. That’s when she also admitted to me that I sometimes have asshole resting face.

That makes it sound like a relatively toxic environment, if people are this jumpy about losing their jobs...  is it usually like this?  Has it been an unusually rough year?
Damn, that made me laugh. 😆
"Yes, please."
I've already got that date.

With my wife, not yours. High five!
Guys get away with "Resting bitch face" (rbf), by just looking scary or angry to people. I too have to remember to smile.
It’s great, only the bravest of salespeople approach me.
I'm a warehouse manager. Started as a clerk. Heavy lifting over the years has given me a thick build, with a permanent "lifting something heavy grimace." A couple weeks ago, I was in another department and spilled a soda making a small mess. I barely swore at normal volume. Just a "Aww shit." Everyone got real quiet and wide-eyed. I didn’t know what to make of it.
You should tell your coworker that people casing the place wouldn't make themselves look so obvious, lol
I did that to my now-wife. I'd had a day off and was working on my car so I was in a sleeveless shirt and cargo shorts that were honestly probably a little too dirty to be wearing out in public but she had texted and asked me to bring her some food since I was off so I washed my hands and jetted off. I brought her the food and was giving her a hug before I left when her manager came out of the back and let out a shriek. After we got her calmed down the manager said she thought I was attacking my wife.
That’s hilarious. And I have so, so many questions about what’s it’s like as a woman in construction.
That’s awesome.

In college I did low-volt wiring (security, phone, home theater, etc.) in new construction and most of the people would be like “who’s the nerdy kid?” up until I started hauling spools of cat5 around 😊
Works the other way around too.

When I was still with the guys on construction, I was technically the site supervisor, but still dressed in the same filthy cargo pants and shirts like everyone else, and made sure to do as much actual work as possible.

It was kind of fun to tell the new guys to please just work according to spec, only for them to call the project manager to complain, and promptly getting ripped a new one for not listening to me.
Feel ya pain
That’s hilarious, I was in construction sales at one point (safety equipment) and everybody assumed OSHA was on site
That’s hilarious. I’m a sales rep, and when I show up to a job site in a suit but also wearing my hard hat and safety glasses, some of the contractors think I’m some executive from the construction management company or even an architect lol.
[deleted]
That’s hilarious and brilliant.
That's hilarious and sounds like something my husband would do. And I would react exactly like your wife, LMAO.
Uh yeah, because that is super cringe. Playing pranks and kissing in front of the CFO? Showing off at HER place of work? Grow up.
Or to get on the roof. 

It’s such a far out ask, they won’t blink an eye, because why would some random person ask about the roof? And he has a hard hat? Right this way sir! You’ll need this key!
I read that as service dogs
Lol right?!
She told me she joked with a few of them that I was her personal assistant. 😆
lmao I love the idea of picturing the regional manager panicking from a hour away trying to get over there.
Or just walk in through the exit....they never challenge you since customer service is right there, and you might be coming in to sign up.
I didn’t know that. Good to know! 🤔
Or just say what you’re actually doing. No need to be vague about it like OP

If he just said he “oh i’m soandso’s bf, she works here, and i’m taking her out to lunch today” then this post wouldn’t exist

But he responded like a corporate person, being vague about needing to see an employee by the name of “soandso”. so he got the correct response

Some people are just very awkward at social interactions I guess. Cause there’s no way I would have ever said “but i am here to see an employee” that’s just very very weird to say
I’m 5’11. Taller than many, shorter than some. 🤣
To their credit, they didn’t give me any sensitive information. I already knew she was off at 1:00pm, I knew her position and department. They didn’t lead me anywhere until they heard from her.
That’s exactly what I was thinking! We have a lot of young women at my workplace, so if someone asks where so-and-so is/ when they work, we just say we don’t know! We never give out that information!!
May not be a bad move. Place them at the door and back up slowly. 😆
Somehow this is a fuck up…and real? lol 😂
Yeah holy cow. Either they’re trying to get me to traumatize these poor workers, or I’m trying to flex, or I’m a dickhead for violating the sovereignty of the club. I even saw a racist comment in here. Yeesh. 😆
Prolapse. The word youre looking for is prolapse
If you’re in Pharma Sales you well know being smart isn’t a prerequisite for being a doctor….
I love crown vics. Underrated automobile
That could have been a better TLDR 😆
I was wearing a pink and black striped polo shirt, a grey Pea coat and matching grey jeans!
Certainly saying “look busy” over an open radio would be the wrong move. 😬
What would you say you do here?
A younger Tommy Lee Jones. Something like that
Walked in the door with several monogramed shopping bags for the membership store, when asking about my card I pointed to the monogramed bag and said guess you missed that?
Card?!
🙄🪪
Your guess is as good as mine.
Because I caused a disruption and inadvertently made people think their jobs were at risk. I didn’t intend for that reaction. Therefore, I fucked up by doing what I did.
You cared enough to comment. 🤔 you should work on your negativity.
is it really a flex if your gf works at a grocery store
Yeesh. You doing okay?
It seems...  _Unlikely_ that the CEO is going to personally show up to fire a floor level employee on the other side of the country.

Management external to the store?  Sure, I can see it for people with more than 2 years in.

The CEO of Costco?  I have some doubts.
You’re right. I fucked up. Is there a sub you’d suggest I post this in?
I arrived about fifteen minutes before her shift ended at 1:00pm. What she does in her own time is none of their business. I would be concerned if they had a problem with that.
Thanks for reading! 😘
Look for that cheap stopwatch coach used to carry in gym class and clip to the empty clipboard as well.
They approach you, ask if you need something/someone/work there...

"Thank you. No. I'll look around myself." Look at them, raise an eyebrow "hmmm", pretend to take notes and walk away without saying anything. 

Manager approaches you and offers help or asks what it's about. "Hmm, no. You're not in trouble, but I'll be going now" 

Refuse to engage conversation further. Stride out of that place. If there is a display near the exit, point at it and exclaim loudly "AND THIS TOO!!"
Start counting the number of people in line at the checkouts. Perhaps with a stop watch open on your phone.

Look up at the ceiling as if you're checking for burned out lights.

Look at people's name tags longer than usual, as if you're committing names to memory.

There's hundreds of other ways to fuck with them too.
Carry your tablet in with you. That'll really set them off.
Be sure to be watching an employee while doing this.
"And while we're waiting, what's your name?"

Write that down.
Choose the watch carefully. Maybe get a $30 Timex to show how down to earth and non-threatening you are.
Pretend to time them like you're using a stopwatch. And do it for trivial things, like one of them walking down an isle or folding one shirt.
Please go back and just start picking off individual staff on to a list


Make sure to have a left column and right column
 

Then leave the list near the most likely to freak out a share the list

https://youtu.be/pVnEcsOdnmY?si=rDVdsqEYfXBJsns8
Ask everyone their name.  Make sure to ask them to spell it.  Then write it down.
As soon as someone stops you, step backwards, look at them, write down their name, look at them, write something, look at them again, ask them how long they have been with _____. Write something down, then thank them and walk away.
Also buy one of those clicker/counters. Just look down a hallway and sigh *click* 
Someone uses the stairs *click*
YES DO THIS!!!
When they start to do something you start a stop watch.
[Ask for a match.](https://youtu.be/ZSD5VoFBDWs?t=49)
I used to work at RadioShack. My clue that someone was a secret-shopper was them using phrases directly out of the most recent product highlights training video. I always break out phrases from the latest ad when I want to make sure I get great service.

Shaq, in training video: "Your customers will be looking for the latest, great cellphone tech, but make sure they get a full accessory package for it too! They want to be able to use their new kit wherever life takes them!"

Dude, dressed in his dad's suit: "Say, what's the latest, great cellphone tech?" ... "And how much is the full accessory package? I want to be able to use this kit wherever life takes me!"
I had a similar experience many years ago. Went to see a friend's hockey practice. Was dressed formally, and had my laptop out to do some work. Apparently people there thought I was a scout because of the way I looked at everybody. I wasn't even paying attention to them just thinking of work.

My friend said everybody was playing as hard as they could that day to impress me!! I felt bad.
Then to really fuck with them begin asking them for their name and following up with “oh, right! Nice to put a face to the name” then walk away.
Look random people dead in the eye and then make a note on the clipboard.
Pinch the bridge of your nose while tilting your head down and frowning.
They know you are truly the White Tiger King and they had to hide all the black Tigers upon your arrival.
Look up on YouTube the guys who posited that they could get access to almost anywhere if they just showed up carrying a ladder.
No start texting. That will really scare them
I bet you could even lead the employees in one of those pep talk / humiliation rituals.
and be holding on of those organ donor coolers
I'm dead. This is so funny. Lmao.

Tell her not to say anything about who you are and next time, find your gf's manager again and tell him she's a quality employee and definitely deserves a promotion.

🤣

If they think you're a higher up, do her a solid. Lol. But, I'd just do that playfully and jokingly so she didn't actually end up in trouble.. If you could pull it off it'd be fun. Lol
And have some ominous background music playing from your phone in your pocket.
This is America, we don't do A sized paper here!


*Star Spangled Banner intensifies*
And circle her face with a fat red Sharpie?
I wasn't management, but I took a clipboard with me to the other building, they had really good coffee.
I was an employee who stocked the shelves at Staples when I was 14 and this somehow worked then too lmao
This is better than the "have you seen this man" drawing Deadpool had.

For industrial sites, wear a *pristine* hi-vis vest and white helmet. Zero dirt or decals and it'll be like the Red Sea parting.
The best choices:

Clipboard and lab coat (in appropriate colour for the role, so *probably* but not necessarily white)

Clipboard and suit

Clipboard and white hard hat (or green or blue if you want to play around a bit more)

Tablet, smartwatch, and suit

Clipboard and hi-vis vest

Large inconveniently shaped box and hi-vis vest with shorts

Wheelchair


**Note: I do not condone the use of any of these to do anything illegal. Please be responsible, folks.**
I’m rolling
Too good. This whole thread has me feeling personally attacked. Lord have mercy, I must be satan incarnate at work.
matching jeans and pea coat, that's what did it. Probably some bonus points if you have nice quality glasses or shiny black shoes. All you need is a small chain dangling from your pocket and I'd be convinced of your importance too.
[removed]
Does it matter who's asshole typically rests on my face or is this an all-inclusive thing? 
In which directions do the stripes run, vertical, horizontal, or diagonal?
Add a pocket watch with a chain.
Resting asshole face. Your face has a look like that of a rude person...not asshole resting face, the face of a relaxed Butthole.....


It comes from Resting Bitch Face... Not Bitching Rest Face
It’s the face bro. Lmao
*Q.A.S.O.O
Absolutely 🤣

Unless you lead with "I'm X's bf/gf/partner, so I'm here to see them." No amount of reassuring will actually be reassuring lol
"And how long have you worked here, Mr.....?" 🧐


😨😨😨😨
“If you’re doing your jobs correctly then there’s absolutely nothing you should be worried about.”= time to be very worried.
"Guys, Guys no one is getting fired or laid off."
There's nothing to worry about. Pretend I'm not even here.
I used to volunteer in a hospital ED. The way I carry myself had people (including acutal doctors) think I was a MD. These days, I dress better than my boss and carry myself the same way. Everyone thinks I'm the director.
[deleted]
I’m just a normal dude, but when I’m alone I walk with purpose and nod at folk who catch my eye. I hear waaay too often, “Wtf? You didn’t text me you were here, did… did you just walk in? Past the guy at the door? HE ID’ed ALL OF US, HOW TF DID YOU GET IN WITH NO BADGE?!” I’ve gotten in locked down buildings, backstage, in closed stores (non-criminal, usually meeting up for event setup), once a museum, event spaces I wasn’t working, etc.
I did this on St. Patrick's Day. Bar was super crowed so I waited outside while my friend went inside to get beers. I was standing by the door and people started showing me ID's. The bar had an outside beer table set up and they looked at me as I was doing it. I shrugged, they laughed, and handed me a free beer.
Yeah exactly! In corporate talk nothing to worry about is just as likely to mean that half the company is getting laid off tomorrow
THEY'RE CLOSING DOWN THE BRANCH
Can confirm xD A scruffy backpack and laptop with a casual button up shirt under a wooly jumper is 100% an auditor trying to dress down to not panic people. Its basically official camouflage. Extra points to look for is if the backpack has a bit of loose string around the top strap from where they had airplane tags attached and just pulled the tag off when they were in a hurry to leave their hotel in the morning, major warning sign if they have two mobile phones and also if they wear relatively nice shoes.

(Hosting directors are usually cool with auditors dressing casually to blend in but they tend to judge casual footwear a lot, so auditors will usually have jeans but with tan leather shoes of some kind that are always clean and in good condition.)
Bold of him to pick her up for dinner from there, I'd be full from all the free samples by the time I made it back out of the store
So, not costco but I went to a Sam's Club recently and the lady at the door was off to the side a bit, so I was like, okay, maybe they're not checking IDs today, maybe she doesn't care. After all, you have to show your ID to the machine in order to make a purchase so who really cares?

she screams, "MEMBERSHIP CARD! MEMBERSHIP CARD!"

she was a little old asian lady with maybe not the strongest grasp of english, just repeatedly yelling that phrase until my girlfriend and I stopped walking, pulled out the phone and showed her...jesus.
How do I get a job as a card-checker/receptionist on an oil rig?  
I'd never have to do actual work again.
I was told you ask for them now.... and the one by me never has them at the counter when I ask. BRING BACK THE ONION CRANK!
r/whoosh

C'mon bro lol
He was joking, but I actually didn’t know the store he was referring to (never shopped at Costco before), so I appreciate you spelling it out.
About losing their jobs, no. (Well, at least where I work. But I'm in one of the union stores, which is only a very small percent of them, so i don't know a thing about how that works in the other stores.)

But it has definitely been going down in recent years.

The money is nice for what it is (where else am I going to be making like 27.50/hr and nearly 42 on Sundays in retail) but it gets worse every year. They expect more and more but want it done with less hours/ workers.
![gif](giphy|HX3lSnGXZnaWk)
Same, but I have a sad resting face so they usually don't want to make me more depressed xD

I'm (usually) not actually sad though, I can't help my idle face.
The power of a glance...
.....how does a hug look like any sort of attack?
Personally I love it! I am a bit of a special case tho as my dad is everyone's direct supervisor and essentially drives the bus if ya know what I mean :p plus most of my coworkers have known me since I was a kid but I have fun with the new guys and the sparkies on site every now and then!
[deleted]
If it's anything like aircraft maintenance in the Air Force she's either an actual badass at her job or she does half the work but gets praised like she does twice as much as everyone else.
Its ok, he's French
Agreed. This is one of those stories that sounds cute in a movie. But in real life having the person you're dating show up at your job, get all the attention of your coworkers and boss, and then conjole you into a public display of affection in front of those people sounds like a nightmare.

I love my wife. I would really enjoy it if she showed up at my work for a surprise lunch. But if she walked in, got the attention of the office and then kissed me in front of them I'd be pretty embarrassed. I'd rather just introduce her to everyone like a normal person.
"oh i made sure that corpo wont annoy us anymore ;)"
My Costco recently started to really crack down on that. I was trying to go in to start a pizza order that I was going to pick up once I finished shopping, and they still made me walk through the main entrance even though I have a membership and my card was out.
[deleted]
For sure, that's good. And they probably would be more alert if anyone had a weird interaction (like shutting down being hit on) that might lead to someone trying to stalk or something. 

Not meant to scare, just be aware! I've had to bring it up in the past at public-facing jobs and ive been glad i did. 

But now that they know you, i think you should purposely dress up with bad disguises and show up with a clipboard, only to ask to take your partner for lunch 😂
Prolapsing asshole face.
Most comfortable ride i have ever had or drove. Currently at 300,000 miles. Got it at 60,000 miles
I deal with the god damn customers.
???

How is a bag a membership card?
Did your monogrammed bag have your memberships expiration date prominently displayed? Cool story about being snotty to someone for trying to do their job though.
I really don't. It was a stupid story that didn't need to be shared.
Yes this is a bragging story about your gf coworkers thinking you are corporal and not a tifu
Watch a random worker intensely while clicking the stop watch on and off randomly and taking notes. Then do the same while watching an office plant.
100% get one of their radios (don’t borrow one from the GF) set to the same frequency and just loud enough for people to know you have it.

That way when they start talking, they will panic because you can hear EVERYTHING! *Dun dun DUUUN*{music}

Imagine, some people radioing questions, others trying to silence them, the panic, the confusion, the extra importance of impressing this stranger.

Maybe ask for a coffee straight after you say “Hi I’m looking for blah, can you radio them, and is anyone available to bring me a coffee”

Mwahaha!
But take the batteries out
Dont forget the cheap whistle also.
Who n Ed’s a stopwatch, just use a beeping thermometer.
Knee socks and mustache
And a counter like the girl at the door has.   

Hey, in fact, sit outside for about ten mins looking at the clipboard where your phone rest, watching yt or scrolling Reddit. Be sure to look at the door a bunch and get noticed.   Then walk in like you own the place, like last time. Call your gf by her full name.  Don’t forget.
Take me to the fire exit on the south east corner

"...I'm not sure what direction the building is fac"

THE. SOUTH. EAST. CORNER.
Make sure you don’t even have a pen and paper. Just pretend to hold a pen and move your hand along the clipboard
LOL!
Walk an aisle adjusting product lines *just so*. Maybe wave a tapemeasure about.
Use one of those count clickers, I loved those when I was a kid.
Infrared thermometer and walk through the food section.
find a potted plant, take a picture of it, then a close up of one leaf.
They have pretty big tablets. I should strap on a damn 27” monitor to my arm to flex on them.
Glance at them, take a note, sigh heavily, take a note, repeat.
"And can I ask, how were you trained in this process? Uh huh... uh huh... And who trained the person who trained you?"

Then for good measure...
"And where is that documented?"
Then ask them "what would you say that you do here?"
Casio calculator watch or nothing
If you had some disposable income, it might be really funny to just go back and single out a few employees to pull aside.... then take them out to lunch and let them in on the joke.
Make one of the employee follow you around and make THEM write shit down.

Nah it was definitely Q.A.S.A. Quality Assurance Standards Audit.
Might as well just let their imaginations run wild. Perhaps even give it a little prod
So now the rumors will begin that X is in a relationship with someone from corporate. Shade will be thrown, hr will get involved asking X to sign some kind of form to prevent a harassment lawsuit...

Sounds like fun, unless X needs/loves this job. You then may find yourself being X's ex.

“Since the beginning. Ms…..(stares at name tag)(scribbles note.) As I said before, nothing to worry about.” *Trails off* yet

So how do you carry yourself? 🤔
I also have resting retail face apparently. While I was working in retail I got stopped all the time at other stores. I’ve had an office job for several years now but just last week someone asked me to check stock for them.
Depending on the store, I help people. Makes me feel useful. Lol
Had this literally happen at the last job I had. We got a new corporate president and they said he was coming down at the first of the year. "Nothing to worry about" blah blah blah. 2 hours into shift, they call the whole plant of 500 people to meet in the middle of the building and he announced they were closing our plant at end of the year. 

The crazy part was I was in a group chat with Quality Assurance, IT and the Education and Development department because it was our "outside work" chat. Our IT guy was the only one there that day because the rest of us had COVID. He sent it to group chat that they were closing the plant and it took us 2 hours to actually believe him. And that was only after my boss got in touch with the plant manager to confirm.
Free samples? What is this place? Don't tell me they make sure you are also the card member holder as if you are not sharing membership.
Damn, every time I go in the body language of the card checker says “Dude just go in I don’t give a shit”, and I’m confident I could hold up any object and get by.
I have never shown my card to get into my local Sam’s, sometimes there’s a dude there and I wave but usually there’s nobody on the door. Costco asks (not a member, but I frequent their pharmacy and they always let me in with a simple “pharmacy.” Then I have some samples and pick up my scripts. Lol
Maybe it’s the asshole in me talking but I feel like if you’re working a customer facing job, a solid grasp of the English language is not too much to ask

Super cool! It’s neat seeing more women getting into the trades.

I’ve only known two women who worked in construction… my butch lesbian aunties with vocabularies that could make a sailor blush. My dad did a ton of manual labor in a small town and they were a regular part of the gang. We lost one of them a few years ago to breast cancer and a bunch of the old crew got together and paid tribute to her, hard hats over their chests. It was really moving.

And a small camera. Not a phone with camera bring an actual camera and let it dangle from the wrist holding the clipboard.

I'm a company rep. I use my phone for 99.9% of any pictures I have to take. That 0.01% that I use a real camera for are the pictures that will probably end up in court. They need to be on their own memory card and a couple of other rules.

"Ahh yes, I see."

Then don't elaborate.
I'd always face shelves going thru stores, I was asked politely to let the employees do their job, to which I replied "Well, maybe if they did a better job at it, I wouldn't need to pick up the slack."

I would be very surprised if the guys from corporate ever strap a tablet to their arms. That's for highly placed peons at the local warehouse.

Buy one of those 90" TVs at the front, unpack it, and strap it to your arm.
>A manager with the largest tablet I’ve ever seen strapped to her arm walked up 

When I read this I could only imagine a crowd of anxious employees suddenly standing aside in a pair of orderly rows like trained soldiers to make way for the manager with a tower shield of a tablet strapped to their arm to sally forth and do battle with the corporate representative.

A polo and a peacoat is the west coast version of a suit
Would blend in perfectly in C-level at the fortune 500 company I work at.
Pink and *black* striped polo. It’s the matching colour scheme on all three pieces.  The pea coat really brings the other two up.
I don't know. I work in a fairly large organization and our c-suite dresses more casual than I do. When I met our COO he was wearing an untucked polo and jeans that were a size too big without a belt. A lot of US corporations these days have really embraced dressing down.
It's the fact he was standing there and waiting.

I worked in a grocery store and corporate always stopped a few paces inside the store and waited for a manager to come speak to them and begin what ever they were there for.

Also, almost all of them dress business casual. I met the CEO several times and he was always in a polo and slacks. It's the alcohol vendors and sales people who dress the nicest.

Which is rather important to know when you're printing out things that originate from outside the US. Manuals, sewing patterns, that sort of thing. Helps to keep a stash of A4 around if you can get it.

The dream of the 90s is alive at Costco.
In the late '00s (in my last year of HS) I found a ["watch" at Fossil that was actually a little sundial on a wrist strap-](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fossil-Sundial-Watch-JR9886-Leather/dp/B001TMGC46) solid chunk of metal with a little rubber wedge on it- no mechanics or electronics to be had (the product description linked that claims "movement: quartz is a bald-faced lie, and the "display type: analogue is...well, it's *not wrong* lmao). Thought it was neat (and it was on clearance) so I bought it. 

Took it to college with me, and lemme tell you, the hipsters (early '10s, remember) I met there fucking *frothed* about that sundial. I had offers up to $150 for it, several trade offers including an only-few-month-old iPhone 4s, a few attempts to get me to put it up for a bet, and a couple failed theft attempts. My one friend half-jokingly *did* steal it several times, but he'd always make it a point to wear it around me afterward, leave it sitting out in his room, and would give it back if I called him out. 

Looking back, I can't help but feel like it was kinda dorky. Very emblematic of the time, a bit embarrassing. But I'll be goddamned if I'm getting rid of it now, if for no other reason than because I managed to hold onto it. Even into my thirties it's still sitting on the window sill in my bedroom, collecting dust.
You’re lucky they weren’t wearing tank tops shorts and sandals lol
Well dress codes aren't that common in EU and especially not nordics. 


Still winter and cold in some places so even a thicker coat makes sense. Then short sleeves because offices are hot af.

TIFU: By asking a MILF for her number
So I was at the mall with my son, whose a toddler. Anyway my son was playing really well with this little girl.

Like they where two peas in a pod playing together, just having a blast.

I'm a big dude, Lotta people say I look scary type look.

Anyway my son is playing, I'm eatting my lunch and I decide I need to figure out who this girls parents are.

I figure it out, she's apparently a hot mom.

So I walk up and go "Hey our kids are playing together, maybe I can get your number and we can setup a play date" she looks at me and goes "um, married" I was thinking that's nice, my son wants to play with your daughter so I said 

"Me too, my wife would love to meet you, our kids are playing well together, do you wanna set up a play date"

At that point her husband walls up and she goes "this guy is asking for my number after I told I'm married"

At this point I'm thinking fuck it, not worth it. I apologize and sit down and wait for my son to finish playing.

Tl:Dr son was playing with a little girl, tried to get the girls parents info so we could setup a play date. Her mom thought I was trying to pick her up.
Should have turned to the husband and said the same thing.  “Hi, our kids are playing well together, can I get your number so maybe we can set up a play date?”
I ran into this constantly, and still do. My wife’s work schedule means it has been 90% me taking my kids to all sports and activities. It was always uncomfortable because the kids are right there, playing, you know what/why I am trying to talk to you, but I was always shunned because I am a dude, and it’s almost always women that are taking their kids to play or parties or wherever. It has sucked for my daughter because they all group up and then there is me standing 3-4 feet away  because you are 6’4”, 230, you start talking and laughing to make everyone comfortable, and then you are flirting making people jealous. Fucking sucks. Like I just want my daughter to have friends. To add it’s always the class school birthday parties and swim parties and we all go to the same school. It’s not like we are complete strangers either.

Edited due to do because strunk and white got me.
Being a dad can get awkward sometimes. I feel this frequently. Kid and I were at the pool and they were playing with another kid. I floated around about 6ft away letting them be their own person while I’m still close enough to help him swim. Other kids mom and I start chatting and husband comes in out of nowhere defensive and chest puffing. 

One thing that I’ve heard others do is setup a family email along with a family phone number. We already do the email thing since it makes it simpler with school and activity communications.
I’ve done this a few times on the playground with my son and I’m also a big “scary looking” guy. My move has been “my wife would kill me if I didn’t get your contact info so our kids could meet up again at the park sometime.” Word choice matters!
Did you chat them up before asking for the number or was it simply our kids play nice let me have your number? Parents need to vet each other. I feel like you may have better luck feeling the parents out for a little longer. Like the ladies seems a bit cold it, but at the same time if I got a sentence and a can I get your number from another parent. I’d laugh and be like let me get to know ya first bud.
[removed]
So funny. I’m and expat with a young daughter and when I run into kids that my daughter gets along with I’ll try to talk to the parents and see if we can communicate.  I’ve gotten a couple moms number that way and then at some point my wife told me that she was starting to question my motives ;)
bro couldve just asked the lady if she would want his wifes number to set up a possible playdate
Is trying to set up play dates with total strangers a normal thing? Our kids are still too young to really do that anyway, but that concept seems absolutely bizarre to me
I don't care if my child was playing well with some child at the mall or not, I'm not giving some random person any details about us, to set up any kind of play date.  That just creepy AF.
I believe the only FU was probably the wording in the questions and the straightforwardness of it. “hey our kids are playing together, maybe I can get your *number* and we can set up a play date.” Casual conversation about the kids first may have helped.
Maybe just me but isn't it a bit weird to try and set up a play date with some random kid and parents in the mall. They could live hours away and just be passing through? Aren't playdates for people you know or are likely to have some ongoing connection with if you happen to have just met them.
I mean, thinking about her as a milf and a hot mom makes this whole situation weird. I get your kids played together, but after she declined you the first time that should have been it for you. Your son can make other friends.
I’d love to hear her accounting of this. Sounds like you’re an off-putting looking dude who put minimal effort into connecting with someone (who you describe as a ‘hot mom,’ not something suggesting you might recognise her as being primarily a human being), and got rightly rebuffed.
Bro, if you approached her a started off with “let me get your number so we can set up a play date” then yes, that totally sounds like a pick up line lmao. At least have a conversation first before asking for contact information??? 

Talk about your kid, ask about hers, share some funny anecdotes about you and your wife’s experience raising the kid, get to know her a little bit, and then maybe talk about exchanging contact information. Did you even know the name of the little girl before you walked up to the “MILF” and tried to set up a play date?
I mean, maybe calm down with the hot mom and milf shit if that’s not what you want her to think your motivations are and you’re married?

Otherwise, why didn’t you ask her husband the same thing?
Starting off your post with MILF in the title is a sign of your thinking. You go on in the message to call the mom a hot mom. Those are really irrelevant and shouldn't be in the message and including them is weird and degrading to me. You don't think of that child's parent as a parent but as a MILF.

Without conversation or knowing anything about them, you asked for their private information and to invite yourself into their lives. She could have come up with excuses and lied but she may not have been thinking that way and felt cornered. Based on the fact that you think of that parent as a MILF, I'd say they made the right choice in what they did.
I stopped calling girls MILF’s when I had a kid.
You call her a hot mom. You call her a milf on your caption. You were probably giving off ulterior motive vibes and she was probably wisely picking up on that.

 Aside from all that, I’m a mom of toddlers and even I never immediately ask another mom for her number because people don’t usually like to immediately give out personal information.
Real question is would you have approached if she wasn't attractive
Hey there. In this post, you called the woman a MILF (Mother I'd Like to FUCK) and a "Hot mum". None of that has anything to do with getting a kids' playdate. I will assume your intentions were genuine but if your approach was as poor as the wording in this post, I would understand why she was sus of you.
As a former stay at home dad when my first was a toddler, I was around moms constantly. I purposely never asked for a number. If they wanted to schedule a play date, I let them ask me for mine. Worked out great and had lots of nice park get togethers. Best of all no angry dudes to worry about.
Calls her a “MILF” and not just a woman. OP- I say you WERE trying to pick her up. LOL. If she wasn’t termed a MILF by you, do you still ask for the number? Ima bet no
By backing away when the husband arrived you inadvertently confirmed the wife’s interpretation of your behavior. Next time, tell the husband the exact same thing you said to the wife. Hope it goes better next time.
This is one of those awkward social situations that we wish wouldn’t be a thing but totally is, and actually makes sense to be. 

Women face sexually aggressive men literally all the time. I get that your kids were playing well together but the woman doesn’t know if you’re being genuine or you’re going to be hitting her up constantly. 

Personally, I would not ask a mom / woman for her number just because our kids were playing good together.
Ok but maybe don't describe her as a MILF and then pass it off as innocent
SMH. You should have said it in a different way to her. Just straight up asking for her number is kinda creepy.
Kind of weird that you sexualize her by calling her a MILF, and 'hot mom'. 

For your intention of being harmless and asking about a play date, you sure sound like a creep.
"MILF"



"Hot mom"


"Thought I was trying to pick her up"


*"My Wife"*


Dude, you aren't just built like a brick shithouse.
Calling her a MILF shows intent to F
"Play date" is a loaded term in some circles.
But still, woman was an ass after you clarified.

Not a FU, you did a good parent thing. Never stop trying for your kids!
Normally it would be a perfectly normal question, but it becomes kinda suspect when you refer to her as a "mother I'd like to fuck" in your post.
A girl in college was on a machine at the gym I wanted to use. I asked if I could work in with her, you know, alternate sets. She thought I was hitting on her…
tbh. the setup did sound like a tactic
If you're being serious about wanting to setup play dates with random women my wife taught me to give the woman her name and number and they are usually receptive.
Hahaha. My husband is a stay at home dad and I get texts sometimes from random numbers for playdates. He is a big dude, and I would like to say pretty good looking 😄. His approach is to give women my number to set up play dates, even though I am working all the time and rarely able to facilitate. It makes it super clear what his intentions are though.
You wanted to fuck her and yet you say you “fucked it up”. And you come here and say, “No I didn’t mean it like that, she misunderstood”. Stop being so dramatic.
Are you sure you didn’t say the MILF part out loud?
when she called him over and gave him the wrong information. you should have turned to the husband, corrected the wife and continue the conversation with him but instead asking for playdate, just apologize and state you thought the kids would have fun together but you don't want issues and tell them to have a good day.
Why would you describe her as a MILF?
In my book, OP, you f*cked up by telling us right from the bat you'd like to f*ck this mother. That's what milf means. From there on, you have difficulty convincing ME (a sympathetic coReddittor) you only want a play date for your child. Let alone HER. I know you didn't tell her you wanted to f*ck her. But I'm betting she smelled it anyway.

Moral: if you want to f*ck somebody, they're likely to feel it, whatever words you use.
You kinda went from 0-60 there.  You gotta chat her up a bit, get her to notice how well that your kids are playing, mention your wife a few times, then give her your number while expressing that if she wants to get the kids together that's cool, if not, that's fine too.  Maybe also throw in your wife's number.
As a dad with kids who goes to the playground, I would have said "no" as well. Asking a stranger for their number in this scenario is weird. It's great that the kids played together well, but everyone understands it's a 1-time thing. Somebody leaves and you say, "bye" and that's it. That's what the mom is accustomed to and probably why she assumed (incorrectly) that there was more to it.
"Why does this MILF think I want to fuck her?"
WHY DID YOU CALL HER A MILF BUT THEN ALSO SAID THE MOM WAS PARANOID ABOUT YOU HITTING ON HER


redditors and being unaware, a tale as old as time
You describe her as a MILF in the title and then claim it was completely innocent?
But it sounds like you were after her for romantic reasons? 

Calling her milf and hot mom?
This is why I never ask for numbers when my kids make friends. 

Not because you effed up, but because I don’t trust other people to be decent. Nice try doing something good for your kid! Not an fu.
Who the fuck asks for someones number in the first 5 seconds. Like introduce yourself first and have a conversation.
Maybe ask her name first or engage Ina little mindless chit chat b4 you go in for the kill?
If it were me and some random dude came up and asked for my phone number I wouldn’t be giving it to him no matter what reason he gave.
I (39m) had a complete opposite experience where my daughter was playing with two other kids at chic fila. Struck up a friendly conversation with their mom who is married. Found out we lived in the same neighborhood a couple streets from each other and got her number to keep in touch when they would be at parks or chi fila again since our kids.played well together.

Have met up at parks and chi fila a few times now a long with the other spouses and it's been a nice experience.

Sucks reading the other experiences guys have gone through.
Hahahaha elite. Look probably just your initial phrasing seemed sus, right?
Suggestion: never walk up and ask their number if you don't know them for more than a few seconds. Instead, offer yours. It's a lot less intrusive, and makes you seem like you're less of a creep.
Should have banged the husband in front of her. Establish dominance.
I always offer my wife's number and then my wife tries to fuck her.
Dude. I wouldn't assume you were hitting on me, but nope to giving any random man my number either. Why on Earth didn't you offer YOUR number? My husband was the main caregiver to my son from age 1-5 yo, and then did the pick-up after school after early shifts (I started later and did the drop off), so he was usually the one hanging around with the other mums and few dads and grandparents waiting for the kids to finish school. Numbers were only exchanged after the kids had established friendships and the parents got to know each other well enough to feel safe to do so. She was a complete dick, but you have to understand safety comes first.
You didn't fuck up at all. Don't let it get you down.
I would’ve said, “This is about the kids not you, drop your ego.”
I guess your problem is that she probably didn't know the term "play date".
Nop, she f-up. To be precise, she IS f-up. Clearly ahe wanted to start drama, you dodged a bullet.
You asking a second time made it weird. She made her boundary clear and you ignored it.
If OP is married and really just wanted to set up a play date, why is he so hung up on the mom’s “hotness”?  He put MILF in the title and ‘hot mom’ in the body of the message.  OP’s a bit skanky.
I didn't run into that very much as a new dad, I think mainly because my daughter made more preschool-aged friends from organized activities like beginner cheer and dance classes. I just showed up a lot, and my girl was obviously happy to be out with me, and soon the moms started inviting us over to play or to birthday parties, and eventually the dads would invite me to come watch football whenever a big game was happening.

The thing to remember is that women get hit on an awful lot, and their guard is always up around new people. In this case she misread you, but acting that way has protected her in the past. I was more successful I think because I wasn't very forward. If I said anything to them, it was stuff like "Oh, your daughter Krystal knew that plié is French for bend, that's pretty smart for a four year old." When the moms got comfortable enough with me  to know I wasn't eyeballing them or hitting on them, they would invite me into the girls' club.
Maybe don't use porn categories to describe women. Even through text you come off as cringe and desperate.
MILF, hot mom...

Yeah, just wanted to set a play date...

In your bedroom or in a hotel, huh?
So like. Maybe introduce yourself and have a conversation about your kids before asking for a phone number.
I mean, TBF you did refer to her as a MILF… maybe your nonverbals betrayed your innocent facade?
Seems like you dodged a bullet there... Sounds like a self-centered b$#@!.
She reacted pretty properly. You came up to her and just said "our kids are playing give me your number" she said no and you pushed it. If you actually wanted to do this right you'd have talked to her and been friendly about the kids and then offered your number to set up play dates. You didn't help by saying "my wife would love to meet you too" because that just sounded worse
Sadly, if she's so prone to misunderstandings like this, she's probably NOT someone you want your kid to be around.
You approached this in a stranger than normal way. I'd at least talk to the parents before asking for a number! People don't just give a number out after a couple words.
Once I was at an estate sale and there was a super model younger woman and her equally hot mom. Both were very friendly to me but the mom was a bit over the top and being quite flirty. Yes I know it’s a sale and like a stripper she was tryin to get my green backs.. but after the purchase we were chatting about our shared love for plants and she invited me back the next day after the sale for a private tour of her plants in the back of the house. I’m like hell ya, that would be a perfect opportunity to try and score this milf, when I arrived the next day she was cold as hell and produced a husband who was now gonna take me on the tour, sure didn’t seem like she was married the day before..didn’t introduce him as the husband either, just kinda shoved us on each other and walked away. He seemed as perplexed as I was and I just said “so you’re the husband?” And with a disappointed and embarrassed look he’s just like ya..that’s me. He knew exactly what had happened, I could tell it wasn’t the first time. Poor guy..he’s obviously trapped. I just ended up going home as I hate to see women embarrass their husbands like that.
Sounds like the Milf's husband is a total jerk. She deserves someone better. Maybe a white knight who likes he for her personality and not her looks. But if something happens then it happens , right? Lol 
Sure, but did your spouse believe that story?
Yea you messed up. I’m a big guy that gets the “scary type” as well. I would not have just walked up to a strange woman and asked for her number. It’s not like the kids were begging to hang out again so honestly it sounds like you wanted to see the hot mom again. But if not, I would have just struck up a conversation about how well the kids were playing together and then offered my wife’s number to the lady if she was interested in getting them together for a playdate. I never give my number out to women.
Missing the important details. SMH.

Was he a DILF?
Done this before but the safe option, if you are married and that’s how I’m reading it absent the title, is to offer your wife’s number. 

Give her the power to call and put the ball in her court with another female. Unless you get the video they’re swingers and then it’s a whole different play date.
Just give her your wife's # next time
I would rethink your approach… maybe see if you can meet there a few times in a safe common area with the kids before you ask for a phone #. My recommendation is that you say our kids are playing well together are you here most Saturday days. It would great for my son to play with your daughter again.
I'm saddened that in general we're all so scared of, and threatened by, each other. I wish we could all feel secure, want the best for one another, and assume good-hearted ness at first.
Not defending her but I've been the  "milf" in this situation and some men will act all friendly then immediately start asking to fuck because they're married and since I'm married it makes total sense....
Don't worry, her husband is gonna hate fuck her real good tonight. 

She knew what you were doing. She just wanted to make it about her.
Next time, just assume the mother has a husband and just ask if her and her husband would like to arrange a play date for the kids.
People are out here setting up play dates with randos? My wife and I are apprehensive of setting up play dates with acquaintances to evade the awkwardness of socializing with parents we don't know super well.
Well, even better, what's your husband number lmao
You didn’t fuck up. Sounds like she was just kind of a jerk. 
That was certainly weird of her to respond that way, especially after you clarified your intentions. However, I've also never thought it was appropriate to get contact info for any parent my kid randomly plays with in public. Maybe if they share a class together, but not a random person.
You need to establish a relationship before asking for contact information. I’m a mom and if another mom came up to me at a mall and asked for my number so our kids could hang out, I’d be weirded out. You talk first, make sure they are local and get a feel for each other. It sounds like you went right for the contact information before establishing any rapport. Awkward.
Kinda creepy asking someone at the mall for their number just because kids are playing together. Man, woman, hot or ugly, single or not… who asks a complete stranger to arrange a meet up without some small talk to feel what the vibe is?
If you were just trying to set up a play date for your kid, why are you referring to this woman as a MILF? Might wanna check what that stands for...
I think you had bad intentions, since you called her a MILF. You deserved it. Just because your kids played together for a few minutes didn't entitle you to ask for her phone number.
Dude, not a good move…
Crazy the "Hot Mom Milf" thought you wanted something else lol
was you REALLY just wantin a playdate or are you lying to gain sympathy and demonise her, 1. in the title you sexualize her by calling her a milf, 2. in the second sentence you bring up how hot she is, 3. instead of trying to clear it up with the husband like any NORMAL person does you immediately cut and run,, NORMAL people dont want other people to go on thinking theyre creeps free to go around telling everyone theyre a creep without some form of trying to set it straight, the mom clocked you as the predator you are and you knew once the husband was involved it was all over for you and your plans would never work out
I mean, (true or not) if a woman thinks you're hitting on her and you back off as soon as "her man" arrives, it kinda makes it look like she was right...
You admittedly refer to her as a MILF but get weird about her thinking you’re trying to pick her up by asking for her number, way to play the victim here…😏
Would you have asked for her# if she wasn't a milf, but she was a 350# ogre?
You're weird. I'm a dad of three girls. Throughout their lives there have been plenty of playdate opportunities from interactions they already normally have at preschool or school or neighbors or friends. Those all come with a built-in parent vetting, so I have an idea that the other parents are normal and they have the same for me. There's no need or reason to reach out to other random people, at a mall for goodness sake, on the off chance that the parents might be compatible as well as the kids. Indeed by making this weird approach you're already giving a good indication that you as a parent are not compatible.
Yeah you fucked up by not immediately asking the husband for his phone number. You let yourself be talked for... That shit gets you killed. Not like oh in prison or anywhere else. Like historically and statistically every situation, every environment that humans subsist in.
[deleted]
Slick way to play it off champ but you gave it away when you called her a hot mom and a mother you'd like to fuck, kinda gives away your intention of talking to her in the first place lol.
Imagine it's your wife, and the situation is reversed. 

Your wife says, "Honey, I exchanged phone info with this random guy I never met before that had a child playing with ours".

Your reaction is: ?
You are at a mall asking a complete stranger for a phone number. Kids have nothing to do with it. Are you really that socially unaware? 'Hot mom' seems like an odd detail. I am a single Dad, and I am reading this thinking surely this guy can't be this clueless. Your size has absolutely nothing to do with it.
Calling her a milf implies you want to pick her up. Like I'm sure u weren't but then why call her a milf? Do u know what that means?
I’ve had this happen. Both in the “yeah here’s my number WINK WINK” and also “I’m married don’t bother me” and I’m always like “it’s….for….the child……. What the fuck!!??”
You need to learn how to build rapport first. Start with some small talk, you definitely came off way to strong. You asking to set up a play date with the mom before even striking up a conversation is the equivalent of going to a bar and asking the hot chick, “hey you wanna fuck back at my place?”
So if the kids play date was your goal why didn't you talk to the husband and get his number?

Right.....
TYDFUAT

Today you didn't fuck up at all

Good job being a normal dad.
Why did you have to slip in that you’re a “big scary looking guy” lmao
Kinda weird that you commented twice on her appearance if you were just looking for a play date..
[deleted]
Reading these comments I guess it’s just my area, but here generally people keep numbers of same sex parents. I’ve met mothers of children before and generally I just give them my wife’s number. But if it was an issue with this lady she should have just given you her husband’s number.

We have a ton of family friends and I have all the dad’s numbers and my wife has all the mom’s numbers. Just yesterday we were at a pool with a bunch of friends and the one mom was sending me something and just sent it through my wife. 
[deleted]
My husband is a sahd and this is one of our problems setting up playdates. I'll usually contact the mom and be like, oh, by the way, I work full time and my husband will be the one there. Then I never hear from them again. Luckily my older one met a kid who is really similar to him and the parents are really friendly and outgoing, but this has been the only kid we've consistently been able to do playdates with the last ten years and it's really frustrating.
You didn't say anything wrong, but maybe your body language was giving off hit on vibes because she was hot like you said.
She could have just said I’ll give you my husbands number.  I once did that and that’s what the women said.  Lol
Should have just explained to the husband that your kid and their kid gets along and could be friends. If any of them had common sense, they'd be able to tell you're not hitting on her.
Milf(n.)
"Mom I'd like to friend"
Usually I let my wife handle play dates planning for this exact reason.  One alternative is to say "hey can I give you my wife's number so you guys can set up a play date with the kids?"  That might also come off as too forward for some but might be more amenable. 

It can be seen as unusual to ask a married woman for her number as a married man in a situation like this.
Never ask for a number again in that situation.
Just get a t-shirt made to wear when taking your kid out:
“I’m not hitting on you. I just want my kid to have a friend”
As a stay at home dad I get shunned by all the moms everywhere i take my daughter it's so weird. But I guess I'm also big tall scary bearded man.
Nah that's when you get REALLY condescending.
yeah I hate it but also I get it.  happened to me on many occasions, when I was trying just being polite or to help someone just being turned down bcs they thought I as hitting on them.

it is very annoying but I just shrug my shoulders and move on. I guess attractive woman have to go trough so many people trying to hit on them every day, that they sometimes just go to auto mode
Eh, I had no desire to meet strangers for my kids to play with when they were little. I’ve had this scenario happen but I knew scheduling would be tough on overnight schedules, I didn’t know the other family and I didn’t want to host or meet somewhere in the middle of it turned out they lived the same distance but the opposite direction of where we met. 

Maybe her reiterating that she was married was a way of saying no. Also maybe her husband is a dick and she was preemptively putting it out there in front of you to protect herself later. Maybe she has a bunch of other kids at home to manage or just isn’t very social. 

She knew what you were asking, she just was disinterested for her own reasons. (I was never one to have “mom friends” because I am not a very social person). She had a round about way of saying no but like, if it’s not a yes, then it’s a no. Asking twice was not necessary.
You should’ve said hey I’m sorry we seem to have gotten our communication mixed up. I’m asking for the number of the child’s parents not you as a woman so if you feel more comfortable, I can ask your husband for his number and we can set up the play date that way.
Dad here. 

Shoe on the other foot; if a mom came up and said the same thing to me, I'd think she 1. Doesn't understand social boundaries, 2. Is hitting on me.

Yeah, I'd say ya fucked up
It was a similar situation, but I told the mom, “Hey, can I give you my wife’s number to set up a play date?”.
This is one of the most pallid posts I’ve seen on this whole site. What, you FU’d by assuming the woman you’re trying to pick up doesn’t have a husband? Or a boyfriend? Christ what an enthralling story. So self serving at BEST
I agree with the majority, shoulda made a move on the husband

/s
No dude,,, no lolol ask the husband, we know why you didn’t lol (apparently a hot mom) lololo
This is a classic example of the sexist stereotypes our society has created about men. It's something that seldom gets spoken about and in some cases can be incredibly harmful.sadly there isn't much you can do in that situation except walk away, people are quick to assume and slow to understand.
I have been in this situation and I just give the other kids mother my wife's number if she wants to set up a playdate.
Should have been like, don’t flatter yourself.
Seems like you wanted her to me.. you called her hot
I'm a stay at home dad. 50% of the moms are extremely cool with me and I'm in a couple of chat groups. About 20% are polite but more reserved, some are extremely Christian moms and I still get along with them but I can sense hesitation at first so I usually just stay cordial. Another 20% are just clicky and think they're better than other parents, regardless of gender. But there's that 10% that're just ridiculous like in your example, and are either very protective of their role as "MOM" and cannot accept a dad in a caring role, or just very off and conclude you're hitting on them. Either way, that last 10% are a red flag and I steer clear.
Damn that's sad on them. I feel the pain of these guys I'm a uncle and boy do  you get some nasty looks. Had one come up at me during hockey practice saying my brother's kid doesn't have same skin tone as me my instant reply was "damn your detective skills are showing" little did I know that was officers spouse.
I had this situation with my son and a friend he made, but made more awkward by the fact that it was at swimming lessons. My wife suggested we find a way to get the boys together for a playdate, not even considering the optics of me asking his attractive, swimwear-clad mum for her number.
Don’t sweat it, some people are literally not worth the hassle.
I was a full time SAHD until my kiddo started kindergarten, and ran into this all the time. Heck, I still run into it. My wife’s a bit of an introvert, and will often tell me to go up and ask strange women for their number. It’s like, can we please talk to the parents together so I don’t feel like a pervert again?  Wingman me a little here!
 I've found the absolute worst thing about having kids is dealing with  other kids parents. Man they suck
>"this guy is asking for my number after I told I'm married"


I don't understand how she wouldn't have been embarrassed if she were actually listening. Should have turned to the dad and asked because mom seems to be there for decoration.
Should have just explained the situation to the husband. “I’m also married. Our children play well together I was trying to set up a play date in the future. However, your dim wit wife already seems insufferable, so hard pass.”
Who cares? She’s not obligated to give her number.
You literally just said she was hot and a mild then you approached her
You should have doubled down and asked for his number.
They're trying to find out if you are married with that comment.
Yeah, seeing these comments make me realize why certain parents feel isolated now
Dude you're a freaking clown. I'm pretty sure she sensed your grossness. And from the vibes you gave off she was definitely creeped out by you. Just the fact that you refer to her as a milf instead of a human being is telling.
More like TIFU by being a weirdo who goes up to some stranger and does that then proceeds to post on Reddit calling them a milf and a weirdo lmfao you are the weirdo
You approached a woman who seemed to be alone with her daughter, demanded she give you her number twice. When her husband shows up you back off.

Not a good look.

If you want to set up a play date, you give your number and if they want to they can contact you.

Nobody owes you their information, whatever reason you want it for.
[deleted]
Definitely should have tried to fuck the husband instead.  Always end rejection with a power move.
[deleted]
So you walked up to a woman you already thought was hot and a milf, and asked her number for a playdate. And there were no signs or indications she was there with her husband? Her dress, the belongings with her, etc. You asked her number, didn't offer yours instead. Don't blame her a bit. Now be honest. Was the FU that your intentions were good but it backfired, or that you didn't get the woman's number?
Strike out with the wife, hit on the husband, total Chad move
This would have been better. But I just gave up
As a single dad setting up playdates has always been hard, get the kid's mum's contact details is hard, the assumption is you are looking to date.  I always try to get the dad's number, but I normally find reticence in setting up future playdates.
Husband:  "Dude, I'm married."
You are blessed with a great presence of mind! I would have reacted exactly like the OP!
I always offer the moms my wife’s number
Problem is you have to keep seeing the other parents then. Clearly they are avoidable people.
I'd have seriously overemphasized the ***PLAY DATE*** portion.
Her husband is probably just as much of a dingus but worth a shot.
Is exactly what I would have done tbh. 

Shoots down her ego trip and let's the husband know exactly what just happened.
Assert dominance, fuck her husband
Maintaining strong eye contact..
Bro u wan sum fuk?
He would have but the husband wasn't hot.
Nah, fuck that. A woman like that will turn everything you do into trying to pick her up.
I’d have just asked “you going to eat that cornbread “
Lmao perfect that's something I would of done
That’s a little too quick to ask as you hadn’t even spoken to them yet.
Bite lower lip and bat eyelashes for emphasis.
Clearly the mother is going to be a problem regardless. Better to just leave it.
The husband:

![gif](giphy|j2Z8ktYcHlTplAuIQf|downsized)
Yeah that's actually the correct answer.
His first mistake was labelling a women a “mother I’d like to fuck” as a married man.
The fact that OP didn’t makes me wonder if his story is really what happened
I know how you feel. I I'm almost always the one that takes the kids to all of the birthday parties. I take them to most of the sporting events though my wife does some of that. I dropped them off and pick them up from school unless there's something going on in my schedule where I can't. She justifies the party stuff saying that I am better with people and everyone knows me. It is true that I am very well known in the community and most people in our small town if they don't know me personally at least know who I am. 

In any case, I'm usually the only dad at these birthday parties. I've had a full range from being kind of ignored to being hit on. That is actually happened probably more than being ignored in these settings.

Taking kids to the park I have always felt awkward though because I look out of place and I feel like people are watching me and thinking I don't belong there. 

Another awkward one was doing "mommy and me" swim lessons with my daughter. I was the only dad. That was an interesting experience
I always get this too, got too boys and whenever I’ve been the one taking them to Jo jingles or whatever play group I’ve managed to find, I’m always kinda shunned as I’m a guy.

I’m not religious but our local church set up ‘satadads’ that was a playgroup just for dads taking their kids once a month which was really good, made some good dad friends there
This makes me feel so much better, I always feel so alone when this happens, especially when I take my daughter somewhere.  I thought I was the only one stuck in the corner while everyone else were in their groups.
I was going to say something like oh surely wearing your wedding ring should send the point home, but even that's completely missing the point, good heavens you all have children, why would the first instinct be "is he hitting on me?".

Society be crazy.
It’s ridiculous as a single dad. I find my daughters don’t included in things because I’m not one of the mothers.
If you think it’s awkward when they’re your kids, imagine being a stepdad, or a guy who is only dating/engaged to a mom, and you’re the adult responsible for them in public. Since they don’t look like me, I had one woman looking at me like she was debating calling the police for kidnapping, despite the fact that the kids and I were happily interacting, and I had not even attempted to speak to her. Even after a couple years of being married to my wife, and many of the other parents knew who I was, taking the kids to school events without her was a socially isolating experience. Thankfully, more of them know who I am, and are willing to include me in things.
I'm a stay at home dad while my wife works (her decision not mine) but I've been for about 4 years now taking care of our austisic daughter. I get the most evil looks ever dropping off my daughter to school, at the park, at the grocery store. It doesn't matter where I'm always getting that look and I absolutely hate it. I just don't even acknowledge the other women. If a kid wants to play next to mine great. But I don't tall to the parents hardly ever. And don't get me wrong there are nice ones not everyone is like this. But I feel the daggers especially at school drop off
I have tried to explain this to my wife. She (and her friends) don't understand when I say I am viewed and treated differently in public with my son. I am nervous to just interact with him because of stares I get. Trending videos try to paint it like men are all praises in public. In reality, we are all treated like potential predators and creeps.

The usual response is "don't be creepy." ... Which is just a way to further blame us for just existing.
entertain squealing dime mysterious resolute mindless important sparkle whistle governor
Exactly
Yup. Not uncommon.
Yep just as bad being a single dude that loves kids. I remember back in the 90's taking a local kid to the park, with granny's permission, and got into a big water fight at the wading pool with over a dozen kids. It was a blast except for all the glares from the circle of moms around the pool.
As a straight guy, I find that sometimes the best way for me to befriend a woman that I'm genuinely not romantically interested in, whether they're single or not, is to "gay it up". Even just a little bit is enough to break that wall down. Maybe try giving it a go, just don't over do it.
I'm aware it's not the same situation, but I think the theory could still apply to this situation.
There was one time my daughter was playing well with another girl. The other girl was there with her dad and I was talking to him. Nice guy! As guys guys tend to do, we ended cordially when it was time to go and began to walk away from each other. My wife ran up to us and said, "Wait, can i give you my husband's number so you two can setup some play dates together for the kids?" He hesitated, but numbers were exchanged. Neither has ever reached out to the other since. Very awkward! Having mom around too isn't always beneficial!
I was a SAHD starting way back in 2000, when such a thing was rare. Thankfully I was in a military community where people automatically knew I had a wife, and mothers were, in general, much more welcoming. But I learned quickly that I just had to lean into it and put myself out there as looking for play dates for the kids.

Still, it was about 2 months of going to open gym, and talking to the mothers there while they discussed play group before I was invited to play group.

Then it was about 3 months of play group with them discussing their next Girls Night Out before I was invited to that.
This is why I'm the popular Dad. I don't get to sit and chat with the Mom's, so I play with the kids (well, my kids and then all the other kids gravitate towards us). If my wife ever leaves me, I'm going to be drowning in milf or would be if I was even a little bit conventionally attractive lol.
Same here! My schedule is much more consistent so I do a lot of the driving for my 3 daughter’s activities. It’s always all the moms hanging out and talking and then me just sitting there by myself. I also don’t want to be the parent that just sits there on their phone the whole time so I guess I just seem like the super attentive dad, which I don’t have a problem with.
Upvoted for Strunk and White reference haha.
I'm sorry, it should be normalized for men to be able to be parental as well as emotionally intelligent. 

Sadly people SAY that they want that, then get pissed at you guys for being weak. You're a good dad, keep it up. 👍
Dude... this exact thing happens to me. My son is super outgoing and plays with any kids at the pool. I want to encourage him making friends. But so many times it's just he and I and some other kid and the mom. 

Exact thing happened at out pool. Dad shows up immediately wanting to create space by dragging his wife and son to the other side of the pool. Totally fine, but we had all the cool pool toys. His son kept wanting to come back and play.
lol dude just described a land line home phone...
Yea I wasn't trying to hit on this lady at all. When I saw how attractive she was my first thought was "crap"
Even just being a guy. Yesterday afternoon I was going into a dollar store, a woman with a stroller and two other kids was leaving so I hold the door for them as there is not enough room for us to pass each other in the doorway. She looks all weird and says out loud "Kids stay close, we need to stay safe". 


Normally I would think shes worried about her kids running around, but she looked at me like she thought I was going to harm her or her kids. 


I'm sorry but the last decade or so this behaviour has gotten worse. Hate to break it to ppl but dudes that are going to do nasty things will do it and not hold open doors or ask if your kids can have a date. 
The family phone number is kind of genius. I have no idea how to set that up, though. I wonder if I can do that in Apple? It really would solve a lot of problems if I led off with “here’s our family number that goes to my wife and kids.” thanks for the idea.
[deleted]
I'm just a lowly serf, but my owner would like for her kids to play with yours.
Great line. I'm taking this.
I agree and this is the reasonable approach. 

I especially was careful with approaching women in this situation (kids playing, don’t know parents). 

I wanted to be respectful, but also discovered I was iced out many times, even when I was. Dads were a little easier to approach for what I see as more obvious reasons. 

I was fine with any of it. I can’t control how protective or sensitive a stranger might be. They don’t know me. 

The only time I was raw (and occasionally said something about it) was when parents approached me wondering whose kids I had. Sometimes they were blunt about it. e.g. “where is their mom?” - well she’s a raging abusive bitch and they don’t live with her anymore? Sometimes more subtle. Didn’t happen TOO frequently, but pissed me off to no end.
Yeah it seems like OP just walked up to her and immediately asked for her number. What parent is just going to give that information out to a total stranger?
Yeah... I'm not going to start interacting with some randos because our kids played together for 30 mins and no one cried. I'm just confused why you'd expect there to be any other interactions after this? My son finds a new playmate every single time at that park .. that's what kids do. I'm not trying to have a relationship with these families... That's what school/work/church etc. acquaintances are for, not randos at the park.
Great question. This guy came in hot rather than grease the wheels and then set up a play date. His approach was tactless so no wonder she was on the defense.
True. I live in a small town, and my wife worked at Dollar General for awhile, so she got to know just about everyone, which made it easier when my oldest started wanting to have friends come over.
I would agree apart from the fact he referred to the miserable twat as a MILF.
“Uhh play date… kids play, we play. Win-win”
This is fucking weird dude
This is how I have handled it.
The problem with this is you'll get a barrage of "why? Do you think it is a woman's responsibility". 

You can be hosed as there is no real answer except show up, be attentive and loving to your kid, be friendly, eventually you'll be accepted.  

The easiest solution is get the kid to make the ask, but that can be seen to be manipulative.
It depends. But at least for me, the opportunity was fairly rare. Happened most frequently at preschool for me. When they’d start playing with the same kids on the playground over and over. 

Every now and then there were quick connections made at birthday parties or parks. But they were more rare. Sometimes resulted in a convo with the other parents, but rarely anything beyond.
No it's not. Play dates are for people in your social circle. Not randos at the mall.
I’m with you…odd setting up play dates with someone their kid just met. Between school, neighbors, activities and such there are a lot of options for play dates with people that you’re more familiar with.
maybe saying "so our kids can play together, because they're really having fun" would be more obvious than "playdate" I know parents have their weird ass phrases but maybe don't expect everyone to understand them (at least I wouldn't but I don't have kids so take that as you will)
Also if someone misunderstood you, it's better to rephrase instead of repeating exact same sentence
Agree with this. Kids play constantly with other people around them in play areas. My kids will play with other kids at the park, mall, library, gym, etc. If I was going somewhere consistently and my kid was always playing with the same kid at that place, then I could see setting up a play date. Especially if I had talked many times with the parent.

If someone asked me at the mall about a play date when our kids were playing for the first time and I’d never met the parent, I would find it weird. If I was an attractive women and it was a man, I would absolutely think you were hitting on me. The clarification doesn’t really matter, a guy could still be hitting on a woman just because the pretext is a play date.
Wow, that to a long time to find. A mall has way too big of a service area to really bother trying to make a friend. What happened to kids making friends at school? At least then you know they're close.
He said she was hot...that's the reason.
you can’t have an ongoing connection with people without…establishing a connection first. Do you think friends blink into existence? You have to go make them
Dude was trying to pick up and got turned down so he came here to make himself feel better
Not you at all, I had the same thought. I would never give my info to some random just because our kids played together at the park once. Id say, "nice to meet you, have a good day! "
Took me way too long to find this comment. Playing it off like the mom is the asshole while specifically calling her a MILF and hot seems to support her (and her husband’s) reaction.
Yup, I also don't think it's likely this guy asks every parent of a kid that gets along with his, for their number. My kids find a new best friend at every park and playground they go to, that would be completely exhausting. Highly likely her being a "MILF" played a large part in his decision making.
Yeah as OP’s wife I wouldn’t want him thinking of other women as MILFs and trying to get their number
Not sure why this isn't the top comment. It's obvious why he crossed a line by the language he's using in this post.
Exactly. Dude said: 

> I figure it out, she's apparently a hot mom. So I walk up and go...

He literally says that he approached her because she was hot.
I think he did the subreddit equivalent to clickbait
Not only that but mentioning his own wife was this afterthought that only gets mentioned half way through the post after he already called this lady a hot milf
Lol yeah this is funny. "I approached this bangin' hot MILF at the mall (for a playdate ofc) and asked for her number, but then her husband showed up and I had to go away. My kid will be so disappointed!"
Right like he made it a focal point of the story that she was hot, and quite literally, would fuck her by using milf lol like…. Super unnecessary and really weird behavior imo, it’s worded like one of the main reasons he approached was because she was hot. I thought he was a single dad until he quoted the conversation
Former SAHD here, yeah OP was way too forward right out of the gate even if it is just a playdate. He think's its a simple thing and he's just doing it for his kid but on top of saying "MILF" and "hot mom", he didn't think for a second about how he would be perceived. Regardless of intent, it was a dumbass move. You gotta talk to them a little bit first. Why on earth would OP be surprised at the reaction of straight up asking for someones number right out of the gate like that? lol
This, finally! OP’s behavior was reproachable. I feel bad for the family having to deal with his 💩 
Yeah I don’t think you can use that term anymore when you’re in the same stage of life lol
I literally call my wife a milf, AITA?
Yeah OP is a 🤡. Gives himself away by making this about "milf'. Like dude you're a creep, I don't care that our kids who literally play well with almost ANYONE... Had fun for 30 mins. You're a random dude. Take your kid and move on.
Exactly. Then his kid would have played for 30min with the random kid and that's it. 
That's what kids do, they find playmates wherever they go.
Alternate title for this post: “I sexualized this woman and I couldn’t believe she was upset because she thought I was sexualizing her. The nerve!”
It’s a loaded term? In this context? Eh?
> "Play date" is a loaded term in some circles.

If you’re literally talking about your kids in the same breath, I think the meaning is pretty clear and not loaded.
... No its not. Parents use this all the time. Maybe lay off the pornhub some yeah?
What the fuck are you talking about.
Uhhh, not in this context? This was the common parlance when I was parenting at that age anyway. Wasn’t THAT long ago.
And I do mean play date. No hanky panky non senee
Bro they were at the mall not the local bdsm dungeon
I can’t believe this isn’t the top comment. Literally the title of the post makes OP sus. Either he was being creepier and flirtier than he is admitting here, OR he made up the story entirely
LOL seriously... no self awareness
Exactly. I’m surprised there aren’t 10,000 upvotes to this. I’m a man so the dynamic is different but if ANYONE approached me and asked for my number so our kids could play, 100% dismissal from me. Easily. I wouldn’t give my phone number to some stranger because our kids get alone for 30 seconds. And this person asks again?? Yikes.
She read him just fine, I reckon...
Did she misread him tho? He’s here on the internet publicly calling her out and calling her a milf and hot mom while people reply cheering and telling him what a bitch she was
You can say 'bitch' on the internet, it's okay sweety.
Yeah what a bitch for... *checks notes* not wanting random-ass dudes who think she's hot asking for her phone number
why is she self centered tho

op literally called her a milf 

of course she has people hitting on her like crazy 
Because the husband wasn't fucking there until the end when he decided ot wasn't worth it?
Yup. Same. It was one of the more disappointing things about being the primary parent (single dad) and it limited some social opportunities for my kids as well.

Doesn’t help that I love kids. My mom was a lifelong teacher and I used to teach as well. Wish I could work with kids more, but not happening.
Doubt he's even married. 
Otherwise he would have discussed this with his wife.
Instead of trying to get validation of other men by twisting and turning the story.

One moment she's a hot mom and a milf. Other moment it was just for a playdate...but he immediately backed down when the husband arrived...instead of asking the husband to setup a playdate.
Play Video Games with the Husband. Possibly Halo or some other cool rad dude game with him. Possibly be his lifting partner for the Gym to help him max out his swoleness.   Be a total bro to the bro.
Drink some natty ice, play some game cube, listen to some DMB, see where the afternoon takes them
"No, I was asking for your daughter's number."
There are high chances the husband will fuck him sooner and better. In fact, he wouldn't even need a play date for that.
Then have an affair with the husband, ruin their marriage, tell her you’re not even gay, revenge complete. Victory.
yeah, wife sounds like a idiots or bitch, husband deserves better

you can be better
Lol
Any holes a goal.
I don't want to fuck your wife but I'd love to grill some hot dogs with you while the kids are playing
Probably her ego to automatically assume she’s being hit on
Assert dominance early on
Instructions unclear, ended up in a 3 some.
Make love to the husband while maintaining eye contact with the wife who is sitting in a chair watching.
wish i could get this on a tshirt
You did the right thing. The mother was already hostile. The father could be moreso.
It can be tough in the the moment, I've also been told I always look mad or intimidating and it can be frustrating when you're literally trying to be polite.
Would have been better yea xD   but it could have been soo much worse... Imagine you clarified you werent interrested in her, but in her little girl...
Sounds like the mother is a moron.
I wouldn’t want to leave my kids under their supervision. Probably best to not make friends.
Probably not. If they react hostile like that immediately and don't even listen, then honestly don't bother bringing them into your life haha
Not worth it. Even if he wasn't a dick, you don't want to get stuck hanging out with them anyway
Probably for the best. Either she was being an obnoxious diva, or he's a jealous and potentially abusive dude who overreacts to her talking to men and she felt the need to protect herself by making you the bad guy. She sucks, he sucks, or they both suck, you're not going to make it better for anyone or have a good time on that play date.
Good call.  Why would you want your kids hanging out with people like that?
I remember my son and I would walk back from school the same way as another kid in his class and his mother. We would chat and have a laugh while they ran on ahead. This went on for months.

Then at a school event this mother met my wife, and it was literally minutes before she offered her number to my wife. It was at precisely that moment I realised how hard it is to be an active father.
I've had the opposite experience somehow. Not single but I'll often be alone when I take my toddler to the park, and hit it up with other parents there. I'm sitting on maybe half a dozen phone numbers and I haven't gotten the nerve to text even one of them afterwards. Lol. 


For some reason I can talk right then in the moment with anybody, usually moms because they are more common at the park, but later I'm like "How do I start this text conversation to set something up without sounding weird?" And so I don't. 
I think asking for the number right away is where he messed up. You gotta chat with them first. "Looks like our kids are having a great time playing together. Do you guys live around here/come here often/go to X preschool, etc." for a few minutes. I've had a few dads ask to exchange numbers with me after talking, but it seems weird to jump right to it. 
why not give out your number and ask them to contact you? way less like you're trying to pick them up.
Toddler girl:  “I have a boyfriend”
At this point the husband’s husband walks up and he goes …
OP:

Awesome me too bro
This is the best way.

Either a play date for kids or a swap party.  A win either way!
This is the way.
The problem is that you keep winking every time you say "play". 
She clearly misunderstood what kind of play date OP was suggesting and who was invited.
Not at all. You don't want your kids mixing with stupid people.
Idk, I think it's likely she's been hit on at parks before and had unpleasant experiences.  No, it's not fair to treat every guy like they're doing this, but people unfortunately usually learn to be this way from a negative experience.  No, I don't think she's right to act this way, but I don't think it's difficult to understand why they may act that way.
Anyone can fuck, I'm gonna ***woo*** him
> doing "mommy and me" swim lessons with my daughter. I was the only dad.

respect
That’s so odd, and completely sexist that they call them “mommy and me” swim classes. We just moved and have switched from parent and me swim classes at the YMCA to the JCC by us and neither of them categorize it as anything other than general parent with kid swim classes. Every class has a mix of Moms and Dads with their kids. My husband has taken over swim classes at this point because I’m super pregnant and can’t physically handle it. This is so gross to me. What if somebody is a single Dad? Or a male same sex couple? Ew this place needs to get it together.
> In any case, I'm usually the only dad at these birthday parties. I've had a full range from being kind of ignored to being hit on. That is actually happened probably more than being ignored in these settings.

If this gets annoying, you should try becoming less attractive.  It's worked for me!
It’s funny how people (mainly women) get upset over many dads not being involved in their kids’ lives, then people (mainly women) get upset when they see a dad taking care of his kids without the mom being within 5 ft.
Even when my wife is with me at the park mom's still don't want you there. It's fucking pathetic and ignorant but bitches do be bitching.
I always thought it was great to see Dads being involved and not assume that he was there for something else unless he became a problem.
I did baby swim with my kids, too, though there tended to be at least one other dad there. Now, the 'mommy and me' dance classes I did with my daughters were a different matter. Never saw another dad there a single time 🤷‍♂️
I'm a youth basketball coach.  My daughter is 10.  The girls range between 9 and 11. About 20 girls.  I interact with the moms WAY more.  They are way more involved.  Every one of the players parents are married.  It's just interesting that the dads will come to practice or a game or whatever and not really interact with me.  I mean we will say hey what's up, but the moms are way more involved. Texting me, planning, the whole deal.  And I feel awkward texting them all the time.  I just thought the dads would be more involved.  

I've also been a part of library groups when my kids were under 6. And the moms were cool as fuck.
We’re going to baby swimming next weekend as a family. Husband is going because in the future swimming with the little one will be his thing (he was a competitive swimmer, I don’t like it nearly as much).

In hope it’s not mommy & me but am supporting it might be. What tips can you give us & him in particular?
I was a young father and my daughter is special needs. I'm glad I stuck it out for her, but I'll never forget how I didn't belong.
I was the one that took both of my daughters to functions. I was lucky in that I was accepted by most of the Mom’s. I did get side eye from some though. I think most women, especially attractive ones, get so much bad attention and disrespect from men that they have walls up. Over 1 in 5 women have been sexually assaulted. I don’t blame them one bit for being wary of a male stranger. I indeed teach my daughters to be this way. There are too many boys and men that were not taught how to treat women with respect so they should assume every man could be that 1 in 5 until trust has been given. The bad men ruin it for all of us. We as men, should shame and put more blame and punishment to those men who are offenders. We are part of the problem.
Same here. I tend to lean on the DGAF side though. If another parent thinks it's awkward, they're the ones making it awkward. Me? IDGAF, I'm here to support my daughter.
At first Ithought Satadads was a play on Satan instead of Saturday and got confused why your church would allow that LOL
Nope! There are more! I then play on my phone and look busy because it’s awkward. 😂 I keep trying though. I have taken to finding one that knows me that is comfortable and that can allow me to participate. Not always easy though, and it takes time.
LOL sorta related but my stepdad would pick me up from school as a kid, since my mom was always working. He’s a nice guy and has kids of his own. One day some guy noticed us waiting for the bus stop and immediately started shouting “Pedo! Fucking pedophile! “ cursing and screaming at my stepdad over and over until a bunch of people ended up staring at us concerned. My stepdad just replied “Fucking dumbass that’s my daughter”. And the shouting guy just mumbled a quick “oh my bad man sorry” and shuffled away. We still joke about it to this day lol
I can’t tell you how hard this made me laugh. WHY CANT I BE THIS FUNNY
The flannel shirt wearing kind, or the hairy one that eats raw salmon from streams?
He's talking about his feelings here instead of talking to a tree, so probably not...
>single dude that loves kids.

I'm not a lawyer but you should never say that out loud.
I've had the opposite problem. I've gone to my friend's kids sporting events with them, and I always get hit on by women with rings on. It's like they see a middle aged guy with no ring on and turn into sharks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-lQHuPUPWc

I feel you. Around the same time I'd take my kid cousins out and the glare from moms was brutal.
It kind of clicked for me while reading your comment: A lot of moms see these open gyms/etc as social opportunities not just for their kids, but for them. I can totally picture some moms giving men the cold shoulder because they expect those to be "women's spaces" as much as they are "kids' spaces." Or some are so nervous about crossing boundaries that they end up being straight up unfriendly. Not saying it's right in the least, but I can picture the mentality.
[deleted]
With an answering machine email. I mean, full circle right?
Yup. We’ve thought about sharing a google voice number.
Damn that's crazy tech, you're saying even the kid can answer!?
I just want to say I wish there were more people like you! Childless, but I get so frustrated holding doors for anyone and never get a simple "thank you".
Get a VoIP line. I pay like $12 a year for mine, and have an old-school landline-like house phone from it. 

Now my kids' friends don't need to call *me* when they're looking for him – they call the house like back when we were kids. I can easily reroute the calls to go to a cellphone, as well (in fact I did so this morning for the Summer as a test to see if he can have a cell – gave him an unactivated old cell phone of mine that I passed along; it only works on WiFi to make calls through VoIP and from anywhere to call 911; has no cellular plan).

VoIP even supports SMS via that number (email forwarded if left in landline configuration, direct to softphone software on cell, otherwise).

For anyone interested I use the Linphone softphone app on Android with voip.ms as my VoIP provider).
Google Voice would work for this.
LANDLINE, 

I swear, kids today! *rolls eyes*
Google Voice?
fuckn A, leave some milfs for the rest of us
I'm a straight guy, but can you be my daddy too? Need some of that dad love that I'm missing in my life
Apparently what you're supposed to so when that happens is to keep yoir wits about you
🤣🤣🤣🤣 hfs 🤦🏼‍♀️
Lord I've ~~seen~~ read what you've done for others...
Ugh, reminds me of when my (white) wife took our (1/4 Indian) kids to the park without me and got asked by a lady if they were her biological children.
HEY. KIDS PLAY TOGETHER. YOU GIVE NUMBER. 

Also, I know we’re all different. But I’m not trying to set up a play date, even if I chatted with her first. The kids played well together, that’s sweet, it’s a nice moment in time, that’s it.
OP is also referring to her as a MILF...
Exactly.  That's creepy as hell.
Well it sounds like OP is a bit naive when it comes to parental social interactions. But if it's your first kid and your kid is shy (probably like the parent), I don't see why OP shouldn't be stoked and want to be friends with the kid's parent. 

Maybe you're more experienced with socializing your kid so you're not as excited when your kid plays well. Or maybe your kid gets along with everyone just naturally. But for a first time parent or parents of shy kids, yeah it's exciting. Not a big jump to go from "oh wow they're playing well together" to "hmm maybe I should connect with the parent so my kid can have more fun times".
Same. As a father of a couple young kids who go to the park often I have learned to not get excited about them making friends at the parks. It's awkward to force a friendship beyond that. 

At the most I would tell the other parents we go to that park often and we will hopefully see them around. I tried getting parents numbers a couple times when the kids were younger and it just never works when they're strangers. You'll message them or they'll message you and they'll be busy more often than not and schedules don't line up. Now that they're in school it makes more sense to get them together. 

When my kids have a good time with another kid at the park they ask for a hug and say bye to them. Maybe have a convoy with the other parents and that's about it.
I am a single dad, and I feel like the guy is very socially unaware. Kids are not a free social pass to collect phone numbers. I would always wait for the other kids mom to initiate that.  Kid or not, without any other social connections with that person you are still a complete stranger asking for a phone number.
Thank you. I’ve ended up meeting some cool folks while our kids played together at the park and at most we shook hands and said nice to meet you. Typically I just make sure my son isn’t doing anything dangerous and give a courteous nod to the other parent/s
Seriously lol I don't think I ever spoke to other parents at the mall play place. I might have made small talk with another parent if the convo happened organically, other kids love talking to random moms lol, and that's usually when the mom will step in to be like okay honey go play, and you'll be like sorry he is just so chatty! And then you just talk about their ages and kid stuff. but it would be weird as hell if the other person I had never seen before was like let's meet up. That's something you do after seeing them around several times.
My sons BFF is a rando we met at a jump place last year and I (mom) wrote down my ph# and gave the mom, and started having playdates with. 

I feel like asking for the other parents ph# is weird tho. But offering up your own as a "ball in your court" way is fair. 

I am not hitting up every parent that he befriends the kid of.
yes - we've made some good friends this way :)
Kids play, we date. Play-date!
For real. Why did he even use the world MILF?
I was going to say, this is still weird like if you were just trying to set up a playdate with her kid why even mention that she’s hot? He made it like a focal point of the story lol
Do you give your number out to random people so they can establish connections with you? Or would it be more normal to talk to them first and exchange numbers if you hit it off?
I kinda agree. Do you have kids? Because my daughter would find 3/5 kids a day and it would be exhausting to set up play dates with all the people she encounters.

She was a twat, but the request is a little weird, invasive, I'd say.
Yes you meet people first then some time later, once you've established whether you are each others kind of people, you start organising things like playdates.
And "Maybe I can get your number" immediately upon meeting. 

I'm a dad who has exchanged numbers with moms so our kids can play, including when the mom has had other motives for doing it. I use phrases like "Exchange info." I also offer my ex's number as well if they accept.

Finally, I don't do it in my opening sentence with a stranger, because I assume not all people are normal and they may be people I don't want my kids or myself around.

Attractive people have to deal with weirdos immediately asking for their number, which OP did, so he got immediately put in an easily recognized category of creeps.
Yeah her reaction is absolutely justified. He approached her and immediately asked for her number like he was trying to hit on her. The way he describes her is how you talk about someone you're interested in when you're single, not married and looking for the parents of your son's playmate.
I think it's both people. He said why a second time and even said he's married, and she ignored it and said what she thought to her husband. Both sides handled it poorly. Given the number of other guys here having the same issue now for decades, and having experienced this, guys with kids are always 100% suspicious and it's shitty and sexist. I've watch mom's gather at the park near my house to talk but man as a guy you are not welcome to that group.
It literally does not say that at all. Where in that sentence is the “because”? He approached her because he’d figured it out. Read what it actually says and not what you want it to say.
I bet the woman could sense his thinking too which probably explains her reaction
GILFs is still fair game though
Yea anyone that's a parent knows what I mean.
Alright but MILF is *definitely* a loaded term.
and then, to make it super clear what his real intentions actually were, once her husband turns up he leaves! he could've easily explained to the husband, and gone for a third try (would it be weird? yes. would it be any weirder than the second try? not really.) which would make it clear he wasn't just trying to get the milf's number.
And he immediately backed off when her husband arrived...confirming he just wanted her number...not dad's...to setup an actual playdate.
He literally led with a remark about how their kids were getting along well, and she immediately went to "no, I'm married". Like... Really?
And he clarified saying it was about the kids playing. What're you missing here?
Slowly learn his interests, start buying him gifts and making him nice meals.  Take him on dates.  Fall in love.  Break up his marriage.  Go back to the mall and get his wife's number.
Build him an art room….
Or date him? Why are straight people so allergic to that possibility
Turn to him on the couch: “your wife was a real bitch when we met huh?” … “yeah”
Is that Axe body spray?
Popped collared shirts and “live strong” bracelets? I mean the Phish farewell tour? That was like an all you can r**e buffet.
My time has come!
*spits* wish me luck
It’s like telling a bomb joke to airport security. It literally can’t go wrong.
Dr.Moreso Atrorney at Large.
Or he’s exhausted
As the greatest Jaffa who ever lived liked to say, indeed.  Better to apologize and withdraw than attempt to clarify and potentially lead to a violent confrontation.
This is me sometimes. I'll be trying to be nice but come across as scary or something
I mean, he did call her a MILF /s

Maybe she just gets hit on a lot
I'm a single dad and my kid's mom is basically non-existent in her life. I've had to have my sister be the one to reach out to parents to help my daughter actually be able to be involved with her friends. 


Its ridiculous how difficult it is to be an active father these days, and it's super frustrating for me because my own father was always the one who did this kinda thing when I was young. He worked nights so he was the one involved in all daytime activities like playdates and whatnot. It makes me feel bad that I can't give my own kiddo the same kind of experiences I had at her age because people have some weird hangups about men being involved with kids. Its like fuck me for trying to be a good dad, right?
It's called sexism and it's rampant
My parents took our twins to rhyme-time at the library and made friends with 2 mums, they even shared numbers!

They’d come back and tell us all about them. One day, I had time off work, and took them to rhyme-time myself and met these two mums and their kids. We even had lunch!

Not a single mention of swapping numbers for play dates.
You are missing a wonderful opportunity for the chance for your kids' to have those early social experiences, enriching playtime and to develop friendships. Don't think too much about feeling awkward. It's worth it to reach out! 

You'll strike out and it might feel like "dating" in the sense that you are asking people out (NOT sexually or romantically !) but do it! 

The one or two friends you'll help your kids make is worth it. 
You can do it!
Yeah even setting aside flirting suspicions or no, look, if our kids are having a play date, I have to hang out with the other parents. If I don’t think I would enjoy spending time with them, I don’t want to - certainly not when my kid is just a toddler and in this situation. Other toddlers are not quite interchangeable to them, but also this is not like a five year old’s best friend. This is just some random other toddler in a play area. 

OP I don’t think you were hitting on her or doing anything wrong, and her response was the wrong one, but I also think it’s a lot to assume a play date is happening in this situation.
Giving out my number is my go to move for picking up women.
Or, save on babysitters and do both.
And the finger quotes don’t help either.
And something about “….the implication….”
which is exactly why you say the same thing you said the second time to the husband. make them learn it is not about them by leaving you have conceded and they feel they were right in the situation and will continue to be hostile idiots who dont listen to the words said to them and assume they know what you are going to say and stop listening.
So just because she's had bad experiences before, it means she has no ears to hear what was actually said? Does she become totally dumb because of her trauma? 

These kinds of reasons never make any sense.
Yeah, huge respect.  I've been the only dad at swim lessons when my daughter was younger, it's totally awkward, but oh well.  At least in my case they weren't advertised as mommy and me!
I did those with both of our girls. My wife signed up and expects me to go because she doesn’t like to swim. Meanwhile, I dislike public pools because I view them as giant urinals.

Jokes on them when I show up in a yellow banana hammock.
That was kind of a funny experience. There were a couple of "wardrobe malfunctions" caused by a baby/toddler grabbing or pulling on a swimsuit top. That made things a little more awkward for me though no one said anything about it.
Yeah, I'll put on some weight and let my hair get long and shaggy...![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy).  I am in my early 40s now and have people try to flirt with me way more now than I did when I was in my twenties. I'm really not trying. In the case of the moms at the parties, I think it has more to do with the fact that I'm involved in doing things that their husbands will not do then it has to do with physical appearance but who knows.
We wonder why casual misandry is so prevalent in literally every facet of society to the point where most people think it's normal to just treat males like this, and this is one of the places where it starts. Kids grow up seeing the way their moms treat and talk about every man they encounter, and grow up thinking that's healthy and normal. 

"WhY iS tHe MaLe SuIcIdE rAtE sO hIgH? wHy DoN't MeN tAlK aBoUt ThEiR fEeLiNgS? iT's PrObAbLy ToXiC mAsCuLiNiTy"
I have really not had the issue when I've been with my wife. It is primarily when I am by myself. I feel like I'm usually more or less ignored in that situation. On my own I usually get one extreme or the other. I'm either getting I'd distrustfully or they are trying to flirt which is not totally uncommon. I am clean cut and in good shape. Also at some of the parties where I have taken my kids too I get people making comments about how their husbands would never do stuff like this and how lucky my wife is. I don't really see it that way, it is just as much my job as her job and it's not like she's just sitting at home watching soap operas and eating ding dongs.
Usually get the last laugh in these situations. I'm right up there on the jungle gym with kiddo having a blast with her and end up with a swarm of kids following us around wanting to join in. The mums get to sit there looking like they just ate a bag of lemons while dealing with their kids asking why they won't play with them like that dad does, and kiddo and I leave exhausted and happy.
Don't overthink it. If they do call it mommy and me don't worry about it. I know the name alone made me feel a little weird at first. That was on me. If there are any odd comments just ignore them. Focus on working with the baby. One of the reasons I was better for it than my wife is I and more willing to push the kids comfort level. Find the balance though if the kid is completely terrified don't traumatize him or her. You are not going to make a competitive swimmer out of the baby. The point of the class at this level for the most part is to get them comfortable with the water and have fun.
Yeah. I tend to agree with you. I really don't care what people think. I'm going to be there for my kids and if you don't like it tough I'm not doing anything wrong
Dadurday is right there for the taking smh.
The church is dumb, Dadurday is the correct term
Haha

To be fair it’s not my church, just a church local to me. It was good though!
I'm 38, 6'3", and 230lbs... single full time father of a 6yo girl. Man, it's so hard some days trying not to feel like a total creep. I just want my daughter to have friends and play with others. I take her to every birthday party, chat with the parents a bit, then just hang back on my phone. It's a tricky one to navigate for sure.
The one women would be more comfortable around.
You’re joking, but this shit is exactly the problem
And I bet her husband was pissed!!! 🙃
Honestly, I don't know why more people just use a shared google voice number in general.
It's common sense to me, you see someone struggling, perhaps they have kids and a stroller, they're overloaded carrying heavy bags, elderly folk using a walker, it takes 10 seconds of your day to be a decent human and hold a door. The odd time ppl react weird but idc, I'm still going to do what's right.
You're doing a great job holding that flashlight, Champ.
Think there’s a subreddit for that - dad for a minute or something like that. 

Probably need to make sure you get the right subreddit name first or it will be porn.
Yeah. Always interesting to me that folks just can’t have a thought, but fail to contain the verbalizing of it until after they actually know someone first, in which the thought is often incorrect.
This made me laugh way too much.
They’re toddlers who played well together at the mall. Not classmates, not neighbors, not even children who can actually talk yet. Just toddler strangers at the mall. 

I’m a dad and the only way I want to have a play date here is if I think we would get along well with the other parents.
Yep this story & the events could all be relayed without sexualizing the mom. In fact, a lot of other dads here have commented their own experiences of being iced out without mentioning the mother's looks at all.
You made me realize i did this with people at the dog park when i first got my dog... so many random people in my contacts that ive never communicated with outside of that one time.
>At the most I would tell the other parents we go to that park often and we will hopefully see them around.

This is how you do it. Then, if you do actually start to see them around & your kids are still getting along you can take it from there.

That smiley at the end gives it a whole new meaning.

sure, if you assume honest intent which op most likely had, but we know humans love to make excuses to approach with different intentions and it is probably just a defensive mechanism she has learned from experience.

the word choice of op seem weird, seems like a bait post to hate on women tbh since there is no fuck up. just a failed negotiation. he offered, she declined. that's it.
Literally how I played The Sims. Winning condition is to break up every single family in the neighbourhood.
Too many steps to undertake a menage a trois. Directly ask if you want to be the third after a couple of playdates 
Become a father to the young daughter after breaking up the marriage. When she is of legal age, ask for her number to set up a play date with your son. Your son and the girl marry. You realize your love for the girl is stronger than a paternal instinct. You ask for her number, but this time it ISN'T to set up a play date. It's to set up a real date, with yourself. You end up marrying the daughter, and your son leaves for Mexico as he is disgraced. One day, your son returns for revenge. He poisons your soup, and as you lay choking, he appears and says "you should have left it at a play date.", puts on his sunglasses and leaves. Your TIFU is complete.
This plan is diabolical

I don't think you came across scary or anything.  This is how some people are.  The whole I have a boyfriend thing is ridiculous.  Sounds like you're a nice person, and in a moment when you're dealing with somebody who's being unreasonable, it's hard to come up with a good response.  Probably dodged a bullet.  She's probably going around saying this man tried to hit on me at the mall.  Feel bad for the kid.
No it's not you. She was a bitch. I've been in her situation exactly. Me and the dad set up the playdate at a local park and our spouses met up there too. If I had to guess she was trying to use this situation to get her husband's attention and validation.
It wasn’t you bro, it was her. 
I don't think the /s makes sense their lol, that's exactly what he said. Weird way to describe someone in this context
Just don’t say that last sentence to the kids
Oh don't get me wrong, he has lots of friends he already knows by name. He goes to daycare, Gymboree, weekly storytime at the library, and toddler soccer. We're doing everything we can to give him a happy and balanced social life.

There's just something different about reaching out to a single family individually right now. Honestly, probably because I can't realistically imagine trying to get two families to have open time in their schedules! I struggle enough to see local family that have their own kids.
Yeah, the hip thrusts were also a bad idea in hindsight.

The one time my husband and I tried the local pool he did one lap and then was asked to leave. Turns out it was the "women only" session. You would think they could have flagged it when we were buying our tickets!

Thanks daddy!
Sounds like they have an open door policy
Nah clearly they wanted an orgy with other parents.
I'm not going to argue against your second point, because that does seem like a valid assessment. However, as a father of a young kid, if I saw my child playing well with another kid, I'd want to try to see if their parents live nearby so we could arrange regular playdates, if not at either of our homes, then a consistent meetup at a neutral place like a park/playground/play place.

That is far too much effort, just make the other men take care if your kids. Keeps your game simple, and spreads your kids through the entire town. Does make it harder once you get a couple of generations in though.

I was and still am the enthusiastic mom who starts a social conversation with other parents at activities so i can get that contact info. 
Then when I take my kid somewhere. I send the new ppl a text to see if they want to join. Usually a park and i say
"we're going to the park from 1-2:30, or if you'd like to join we're open to a time that works."
If they respond but can't join, i send another invite soon. I usually do 2 then don't try further. Ive made about 8 friends this way over the last 5 years of being a widowed mom of 1 small kid (now not so small) 🙂 
Just shake off the awkwardness, someone's gotta do it!

There was a comedy sketch that I heard or saw one time talking about a fat lady sitting at home watching Jerry Springer and eating ding dongs and ho-hos while collecting welfare and for some reason it stuck with me and became a saying basically referring to someone sitting at home and being lazy. I was just stating that my wife does not just sit home and act lazy and expect me to do everything. I was just trying to make sure I did not paint her in a negative light...

TIFU: By flowering while showering into my 20s
This happened many years ago, when I was but a young man in college.  But the story actually starts about 18 years before that, when I was a baby.

Like most kids, I hated getting soap in my eyes in the bath.  Even the gentle “baby shampoo” would send me into a rage.  My dad, being the intrepid problem solving sort with a penchant for over engineering, came up with a sort of 360 degree visor that my hair would stick through.  Then, they could wash my hair and the soapy water would just roll off.  It was great.  It kind of looked like a flower on my head, so my parents would say I was “flowering while showering.”

Eventually, the OG visor got mildew and was disposed of, but my dad made a few over the years.  He ultimately stopped when he decided that I should be able to wash my hair without getting soap in my eyes, but I wasn’t having it and started making my own.  Over time, “flower hats” for this exact purpose became mass produced and I switched over to just buying them as needed.  Never got soap in my eyes!  It was great!

Well, by the time I was 20 and living in my own apartment in college, I still hadn’t kicked the ol’ flower hat.  I was flowering while showering every day, living my best life.  Cue a cute girl staying at my place and suggesting we take a shower together before fucking.  She asked me to wash her hair and brush conditioner through it, which apparently felt really good to her and was a major turn on.  When I was done, she offered to wash my hair.  I didn’t think that would do anything for me, but I said “sure!”

I then reached out of the shower for the drawer where I kept my flower hat and put it on.  At first she laughed and thought I was joking, even after I explained what it was.  But then I think she noticed how it looked kind of old and used and faded, and that it would be strangely elaborate to keep a flower hat in my bathroom for the occasional joke.

To her credit, she washed my hair while I wore it.  We didn’t end up having sex that night—I can’t remember her explanation—but after she left the next morning she didn’t return my calls or AIM messages.  

I didn’t stop flowering while showering immediately after that.  I would just say, “oh, I washed my hair already” if the situation came up again.  But when I met my now-wife, I knew it was time to give it up.  So I no longer flower while
I shower, I just live with the occasional pain of getting soap in my eyes.

But you better believe that when we had kids, I immediately got them flower hats.  My wife thinks they’re brilliant.  She has no idea of my dark past.  And every once in a while I look at my kids’ flower hats, and I hear them calling to me, beckoning me to don them.  I haven’t succumbed yet, but I think it’s only a matter of time…

TL;DR:  Flowered while I showered; got a good hair wash but nothing else.

Edit:  [A general idea of what my flower hat looked like in college.](https://imgur.com/a/gRU8Mk4)
Your wife comes home unexpectedly. She calls to you, but you don’t answer. She hears that you’re in the shower and calls your name. You don’t answer. She lightly knocks on the door. Still no answer. 

She opens the bathroom door and finds you…wearing the flower hat that she previously believed was reserved just for your kids. She stands there for a second, mouth agape, watching in horror as you gleefully dance around in the shower…flowering. 

You spin around and your shampoo-less eyes meet hers. You both stand there for a second in silence. Finally, you blurt out, “it’s not what it looks like!” as she slowly backs out of the bathroom and closes the door.
My friend, have you tried... Leaning backwards?
Just close your eyes? Tilt your head back? Rinse facing away from the shower head?
Brother whatre you doing wrong that you get soap in your eyes so frequently ? Tilt ya head back so the water drains away from your face, and close your eyes while you rinse.
I never in a million years would’ve thought it would be that difficult as a grown ass man to keep soap out of your eyes while showering
So. Do you wash your face??
This post is fucking wild. Guess it shows everyone has different weaknesses.
Everyday Reddit shows me that no matter how dumb I think I am, I’m a genius compared to some of the population.
The real fuck up is that your dad didn't mass market them first.
I DO NOT understand this. I haven't gotten soap in my eyes since I was a small child taking baths. Wet your hair, squeeze shampoo into your hands, CLOSE YOUR EYES AND KEEP THEM CLOSED, shampoo your hair, rinse your hair, and once the shampoo is gone, OPEN YOUR EYES. How is that difficult for an adult to do? LOL!
Hey OP! Quick question.

When you close your eyes, what happens?

1. You turn invisible.
2. The world disappears, possibly forever.
3. Your eyelids form a protective layer, keeping liquids and solids from hitting your eyeballs.
4. Both 1 and 2.

Unless you were given a small ring and a big mission, the answer is probably #3. Obviously, you solved this enough to start a family! But this could also be an opportunity to teach your kids (and yourself!) easy and fun ways to wash themselves without fear. Thanks for the story!  


***~~AVOID THE MAIN ROADS~~***
This should be required reading for anyone down on themself.
I put on my robe and ~~wizard~~ flower hat.
Not going to comment on what seems to be the consensus, but I gotta say this was much tamer than I expected. Was kind of afraid of what I was going to read when I clicked because I figured "flowering" was code for something else..
What the fuck did I just read?
Have you heard of eyelids?
Sir, I use my nails to scrub my eyelashes with soap to get makeup off and do not get soap in my eyes.
How do you wash your face? I don't get it. I have soap run all over my face and it doesn't get in my eyes. Just keep the fuckers closed until it's washed away. Jesus it ain't rocket science.
How aggressively are you shampooing???
Why is it so hard to keep soap out of your eyes? Is your head dented in a way that flows water into them? Have you never washed your face in 20 years?
I use to have my kids wear swim goggles while I washed their hair in the tub. Also helped them getting used to putting their faces under water in the tub, so one less barrier learning to swim in a pool. I guess since this is Reddit I gotta say this was when they were very young, Like 2 or 3 not teenagers.
I don’t even REMEMBER the last time I got soap in my eyes while washing my hair. It’s very easy to wash your hair and avoid this-without a shield. Jeez-this must be a joke.
I've had long hair, I've had short hair. I've bleached my hair, I've dyed my hair, I've washed it countless of times, and I can't recall the last time I got either shampoo or dye or anything else in my eyes.

I've gotten water in my eyes while washing my face, that's it.
On the bright side....sorry there is no bright side
Do you have autism? Like actually clinically diagnosed autism?
Have you tried using your eyelids? They exist for a reason.
Dude, wear the flower hat with your kids. If you can’t be silly and immature with your kids, when can you be? Embrace the shower flower - it will be a core memory for them.
[deleted]
The key is gently closing your eyes so the water runs off, if you close them tightly the soap collects on your eyelids and seeps in.
[deleted]
>So I no longer flower while I shower, I just live with the occasional pain of getting soap in my eyes.

How TF are you so constantly getting soap in your eyes? I'm 53 years old and I honestly cannot remember the last time I've gotten soap in my eyes while in the shower (or anywhere else).

I think a better title for your post would be, "TIFU by not knowing how to wash my hair my entire life".
Lmao. I'm 32 years old and I don't think I've gotten soap in my eyes in 20 years while showering.
Here I am, anxious about whether or not to start a family, and reading about how people like OP reproduce. Wild.
Why is "flowering while showering" cringy as fuck?
[removed]
Okay, I know everyone is flaming you for still not being able to keep the shampoo out of your eyes while showering (though please look at those comments, OP, they’re good tips if this is still a problem), but like. Man, don’t let anyone pressure you into stopping something that’s harmless and ultimately works for you. If you want to keep wearing the flower hats, you should be able to! I’m sorry you had that bad experience in college, but hopefully your wife should be more accepting
I just close my eyes until I wash all the soap out, have you ever just considered not opening your eyes?
Have you considered tilting your head back and closing your eyes? I literally can't remember the last time that I got soap in my eyes in the shower.  I feel like this should be a non-issue for anyone over the age of eight.
I legitimately don’t understand how a functioning person consistently gets soap in their eyes while showering.
Do you not have eyelids?
Close. Your. Eyes. Until. You. Rinse. Also tilt your head back. Damn.
I have the product for you. For the low low price of *closing your eyes* you can move on from that life altering issue today!
just... close your eyes?
If wearing the visor makes you happy then do it. If a date used one of those to shower it would not bother me. It's not a big deal. Different. Quirky. Ultimately harmless. Obviously there's a demand for these or they never would been commercialized.

To everyone saying just close your eyes. I do that and still get shampoo residue in my eyes sometimes. I deal with it but it sucks. Takes awhile to rinse out completely and burns the whole time. OP has decided no, this will not stand. More power to 'em!
I couldn’t even finish reading this I was suffering from that much second hand embarrassment
When I was a baby I also hated getting soap in my eyes. Then I learned how to close my eyes.
I employ this trick where I close my eyelids.
I -NEED- to know why you keep your eyes open!  Has it never occurred to you that you can close them?  After reading the comments and learning that you can do this, are you going to try closing your eyes?
Lmaooo. What?! Don't people just close their eyes when rinsing?
obviously the girl wasn't going to have sex with you after she saw your skull condom. wtf

this just might be one of the weirdest fucking things i've ever seen on reddit, and that's saying a lot.  dude.  your parents should be *charged with a crime* for letting you keep up that weird ass behavior for so long, and now you're making it inter-generational!?!?! no no no no no

i can't remember being bothered by soap in my eyes beyond about *age 4*.
 "We didn’t end up having sex that night—I can’t remember her explanation."
Your first instinct while showering with a girl that wanted to smash was to get that thing out the drawer? 

Man, that would get a good laugh out of me to be honest.
Yep. I would not fuck a man who wears one of those.
There are these things called eyelids they're pretty cool
>I just live with the occasional pain of getting soap in my eyes.

I can honestly say I have never gotten soap in my eyes a single time in my adult life. You know if worse comes to worst you can just... wipe your face with a cloth after you rinse, right?
I stopped getting soap in my eyes when I was a kid. Never thought of it as a problem
How do you wash your face?
OP born without eyelids? Wtf did I just read
You do you with the flower hat, I hate water and soap getting on my face too but know how to not get any in my eyes etc, I am intrigued on how you are shampooing that you have this issue…. which way you face in shower, how head is positioned, how you foam vs rinse etc…
As a kid i just had a wet washcloth over my eyes and later i did what every sane person does… i closed my eyes and lean back
Surely shampoo goggles would be easier? Which still sounds insane to me, just less so
Just close your fucking eyes dude
We all have our own learning curve in life don't worry
This may be the softest story I’ve ever read. Close your eyes dude!
Is this one of the posts we will reference in ten years and feel special because we were part of it?

I did miss out on sex for dumb reasons but this tops all of them ngl.
Lmao OP getting ripped to shreds and it's entirely deserved, how do you not once think about tilting your head back? Or closing your eyes?
It could have been worse. She could have seen your poop knife.
Just close your eyes?? That's what I've been doing. Am i showering wrong?
What's it like living without eyelids? I think I'd go absolutely crazy if I couldn't close my eyes.
What...the...fuck? 

Reddit blows my mind every now and again. First, it was people standing up to wipe their ass, now it's flower hats. What will be next? Can't wait to find out.
lmao just close your eyes dipshit, it's not complicated
YOU MEAN MY AUTISTIC ASS COULD HAVE USED A SHOWER FLOWER FOR THE SENSORY NIGHTMARE THAT IS GETTING WATER ON MY FACE???
I could probably count with fingers the number of times I have gotten shampoo or soap in my eyes as an adult (3 plus decades).

Did you get an F in Showering 101 or something? How is this even a thing?
The number of posts on this subreddit where people admit to being completely helpless, overgrown children is astounding.
I'm 34 and take showers almost daily.

ONCE have I ever got soap in my eyes. What are you doing, OP??
Fucking hell, this is just depressing. A deep blow in the death of a thousand cuts of your soul.
r/todayilearned a new definition of flowering. My mind is blown that this “problem” needed a solution other than closing one’s eyes.
Okay, maybe I’m crazy, but do people not hang their towel over the shower so you have easy access to quickly wipe your eyes when you wash your hair?? I’ve done this since I was a kid, and I kind of thought it was universal. 

I’d say give that a shot. It’s a very normal thing that basically does the same thing as your fun flower crown.
They sell those. I know because I flowered while I showered until I was about 14 years old. I get it.

Edit: [the product](https://images.app.goo.gl/P6ay5UMtTxbS771u6)
Lotta people in this thread dunking on OP but I get it, it's really tricky to keep soapy water from going in your eyes and being afraid of that kind of ruins the whole vibe and makes showering unpleasant. A visor just works, otherwise you're better off taking baths instead and slowly tipping your head backwards into the water. 

Wait, no, that's my three-year-old daughter I was thinking of, not me, and her hair washing visor is my hand. Which she recently learned to no longer need, through the magic of (a) closing one's eyes on command, and (b) wiping one's wet face with a hand before opening them.
I just don’t get how closing our eyes while showering is hard

Edit: Not even the entire shower, just shampooing and rinsing
Dude dried the girl up while still in the shower.
you know you have eyelids that close, right?
OP that thing is the most unsexy item of clothing I have seen in my life.
[removed]
This has a very distinct ‘sometimes the tism’ energy.Wear your hat if it makes showering more doable, friend. Sometimes ND stuff doesn’t make sense to other people- that doesn’t mean it’s ineffective or that you don’t actually need it.
Today you didn’t F up , by writing a story that was an easy read >>>

Dude really? Ive never heard of a grown person using something like this because they dont want soap on their eyes. How about just closing them or something? Jeez
Posts like this are only giving the boomers more ammunition.
You're a keeper
You're autistic though, right? If so, nothing to see here
She caught me in the shower

It wasn't me

I was looking like a flower

It wasn't me
I lost it at "shampoo-less eyes". I'm genuinely laughing out loud.
[deleted]
I dunno, OP's wife sounds pretty cool and she might actually be into a little mutual flowering-while-showering...
I was hoping this would lead to her getting excited and reaching into the back of the closet to pull out her own stashed flower hat
Her eyes slowly pan down and notices Mr. Spunk Hunk is harboring a mini-flower of his own. In shame you mutter “bar soap also irritates my urethral portal.... BUT! The mini-flowers come in kid sizes!”
Fuck hahahahahhahahahahahaha
How dare you write so well. I pictured this so perfectly, that as I was eating my dinner, hit "gleefully dance around in the shower... flowering" and got noodles absolutely everywhere.

She posts to /r/relationship advice with what she saw, or really, any subreddit at all. As usual, the overwhelming majority of advice is “Red flag! Divorce him and run!”
This post gives me the same reaction as the one where someone said they hated taking showers until they learned that they can wait *outside* the shower until the water warms up.

Edit to add: I don’t have a link. I believe when I saw it, it was a screenshot of a tumblr post. I first saw it years ago, I have no idea how to locate it.
And you know... closing your eyes?
Sometimes I do this thing called "closing my eyes" until I've rinsed my hair and face thoroughly.
As I say to my kids " look up at the ceiling"
My husband leans forward washing shampoo out of his hair. Once, I was in the shower with him and stood behind him merrily squeezing more shampoo onto his head as he rinsed, bewildered by the never ending bubbles. Didn’t stop him though 🤦🏼‍♀️
Or just like....closing their eyes? Does OP not know you can just not open your eyes while you're shampooing?
Or even, closing your eyes?
One of my early and still sticking memories is a Sesame Street item explaining just that.
![gif](giphy|11Ph1yb20GoOOY)
Most times I’ve showered with men they rinse their hair by facing the water and tilting their head, so it runs all over their face. I’ve had to teach them to turn around and magically no soap in their face. Like how is this something grown adults can’t figure out? I’m baffled.
I had this conversation with my 2 year old and now she leans her head back while I wash the soap out.
Too easy a solution for engineers.
or....closing his eyes??
![gif](giphy|26gspvTRJXosDwi1a|downsized)
Sometimes I do this thing called "closing my eyes" until I've rinsed my hair and face thoroughly.
Rinse with your head back facing the spray with it running over your head? Like, so many solutions. I don’t think I’ve gotten shampoo in my eyes in years and I have a crap ton of wavy hair, and even had bangs for a while.
OP is reading this thinking “wait I can turn away from the shower head?”
Seriously! I think I was 13 the last time I got shampoo in my eyes, and that was because I slipped in the shower and opened my eyes in surprise. This is not a difficult task for anyone over about 4. My 2 kids never had a "flower hat," and they got the hang of closing their eyes for shampoo before they got the hang of wearing underpants in bed.
I think y'all are missing the fact he started this at 2 years old and just got in the habit.
You don't even have to do that! Close your fucking eyes and you can lean forward and rinse the shampoo off without having to even lean back. Just close your eyes and rinse for like 30 seconds or a minute and it'll all be gone. None of it in your eyes. 

Also, if you lean forward enough, it won't go in your eyes anyway. Itll just drip down. Has OP never washed their face? Cause that's pretty gross too, imo.
Why do things the right way when you can throw a disgusting piece of germy fabric into the mix?!
"what do you mean you aren't supposed to wash your eyeballs?" 

OP, probably
How is he supposed to see the top of his head to wash it if his eyes are closed? Checkmate.
I bet he has no lines around his eyes from tightly closing his lids while washing hair for 40 years. The shower flower has kept him young forever. Plastic surgeons hate this one trick.

Damn if only my eyes could like close and shit on command
dude, same.

I can't remember the last time I had gotten soap in my eyes whilst showering.
And these people really be out here reproducing.
It's posts like OPs that serve as little reminders that half of people really are below average intelligence.
I'm impressed he made it to college
OP… you close your eyes!
I do not remember the last time I got soap in my eyes… how is this a problem for some people.?
Only on Reddit.
It's because he didn't learn it as a kid. Now he's passing this inability to his kids.

When my kids were little, we got them swim floater things that have a styrofoam pad on the front. The kids loved them, because their faces didn't get wet.

A couple years later, it was a real struggle for them to learn to swim, because they hated getting water on their faces. Getting their faces wet was a new and unpleasant experience rather than an expected part of being in water.

In retrospect those floaters were bad training, just like OP's flower cap.
You flowerless snob.

This was my first thought! As a grown adult, I am able to wash my hair without getting soap in my eyes, but I’ll be damned if every once in a while I do get facial cleanser in my eyes because I’m using it to, you know, clean the skin area directly near my eyes.
I most definitely thought that was the direction this FU was going, and I'm kind of concerned it wasn't addressed...
Or, it's creative writing.
Every time I take a crap, I think about the TIFU guy that told his gf her o face looked like someone taking a phat shit and good lord do I feel superior. I don't even *have* a girlfriend.
It’s like finding out that those people in infomercials that are unable to open a milk carton without somehow setting fire to their cats are actually representative of the average person.
I'm 51 and my mum bought mass marketed round visor hat things to keep the soap out of my eyes when I was a toddler because I hated how much it stung my eyes. I doubt they were a new thing in the early seventies when I had one, so unless OP is a lot older than me, I think he just didn't realise they were already mass produced items because his dad home made them.
I just noticed yesterday that Amazon had a baby visor for washing hair. I thought it was brilliant
I’m almost certain I saw one of these in an episode of Sailor Moon in the 90’s. Which means they were around years ago before then for the animation to have been made and the translations, English voice actors, yada yada. I think they just weren’t a big thing in America but I guessed exactly what this was from the title and recalling that episode. I don’t think OP’s dad could have taken credit since it was already a thing.
I don’t even have to shut my eyes…I tilt my head back while I shampoo, then I back into the water to rinse.
I suspect this is an exercise in creative writing
Usually when I close my eyes in the shower someone murders me.

If OP is anything like me, I don't think he has them, it's not common but it happens. All the other people I know have eyelids, but every time I look in the mirror and try to see mine, it goes dark

found OP
I do, and I haven't gotten soap in my eyes since I was a child. OP is just weird.
This was my first thought. But I'd bet OP has NOT been diagnosed with anything 

As a person who has decently intense sensory problems myself, this strikes me as not actually being about the soap at all. I feel like the only reason you'd wear a 🌼 cap into adulthood is an avoidance of the sensation of water in the eyes.
OP is probably a gecko.
Dated someone like that. 

Though thinking back on it it was probably his neglectful parents (7 kids, homeschool family, the last 2-3 were basically feral) yelling at him to not waste water. 😢
She's already his wife, it's time to live his best life.

What's she gonna do, divorce him over a hat?  It's basically proof he won't cheat, or at least stay over with anyone
First good reply I’ve seen on here.

It’s his life. Who cares? Some of you people are so damn judgemental
37 here. Got soap in the eyes last week, but only because I'm a moron. Was shampooing, had an itch in the eye, and just went straight for it. Until last week, I had considered myself a smart man. No longer.
Why did I have to scroll so long to find this comment? It's a harmless thing OP did. Why does everyone even care?
"her brain functions properly" is the explanation.. lol
I admit that she caught me red-handed

flowering in the shower by the door

when she found me, i was buck naked

looking like a rubber band store
This gave me a chuckle
Most underrated comment 😂
She even caught me on camera.
Same, idk why my girlfriend didn't laugh as much as me to this comment, the shampoo-less eyes just sent me
Fucking same lmao
Exactly the same moment for me too
Same, in class nonetheless :D
Actual cannibal Shia Labeouf?!
I read a post recently where this person hates showering/bathing because “the water is cold and you use the same liquid to wash yourself as you do dishes and it makes me feel like a dish and I hate it”. They use fucking dishsoap to shower. And they clarified they keep the water cold on purpose. I’m like my man, you are making showering suck on purpose and then complaining it sucks.
This also reminds me of the one where the dude hated using electric toothbrushes cause they got everywhere until they learned they can turn it on after it goes in their mouth.
I think about that post like every other day at least
There was also another one where the OP found out that you can use hot water every day in the shower. When he was a kid he somehow misunderstood something his parents told him, and thought that using hot water was only for special occasions like your birthday or graduation.

And then there was the guy with the ice soap
Fucking hell, that just reminded me of my last housemate. Holy Christ but the absolute rage at his dumbfuckery, asking me to always turn the shower head towards the wall when I'd finished so that he could step into the shower cubicle when it was his turn and switch it on, turning it back away from the wall when it had warmed up, ***instead of switching it on first, THEN stepping in when it reached temperature FOR FUCK'S SAKE JULIAN WHY ISN'T THIS OBVIOUS***.
Oh god my mom just figured out she could put on a towel after getting out of the shower and be warm a couple years ago.

She’s 83
I dated a guy who got into the shower before it was warmed up, and said the exact same thing. I was like 'dude why not just wait til the water gets warm' and he replied 'Oh I never really thought about it'. 

He was a pretty intelligent guy but he was so fucking useless at practical things. He was very good at building stuff/electronic stuff/made his own guitar pedals and instruments. But he didn't know how to tie shoelaces or tell the time on an analogue clock. He didn't know rice expanded when you cooked it, or how to load the dishwasher. I got the feeling his parents just didn't teach him how to do basic tasks.
or [the chick that didn’t like sharing bars of soap](https://youtu.be/VXagwtlvzyY?si=PJum27QPXrsduGGO) because you stick it in your ass/bits to clean and was blown away by the concept of lathering up your hands or a cloth and washing yourself with that…

or [the guy that “caught poop”](https://youtu.be/gexjlM-jjEc?si=wOa0a5iVJKVMHsVD) with toilet paper in his hands and then placed those in the toilet. i still don’t believe that one was real.
This reminds me of one I saw where the person was complaining because they'd had a new water heater installed and the person set the max temp higher than the old one and they'd nearly scalded their crotch when they got in. Motherfucker, who told you to check the water temperature with your dick?! Put your hand in, oh that's a bit hot, and turn it down!
Wasn’t there one where the person was holding their breath in the shower?
Come on.
The number of people I’ve astonished with this information in my life is ridiculous.
I vividly remember this Reddit post and now I can't not think about it as I wait for my shower to warm up.
I need a link to that please

I had that same revelation some time in my 20's. I'd turn the tub faucet on to heat up the water but there would always be that split second of ice cold water that sprayed out once I turned on the shower. I just never tried turning on the shower head before stepping in. I guess I figured water would get everywhere or something? I brought it up during a random conversation with some friends & got laughed at so hard. I deserved it lmao
This one! I think. It's one of my favorite askreddit responses. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6u5twe/comment/dlqgh29/?xpromo_edp=enabled
Reminds me of the guy who thought the toilet seat was only for women, so when taking a shit he would sit on the bowl until he went toilet shopping and his wife and the sales guy were like ????????
Lmfao I went to shower with an ex and she's like why are you starting the shower? I didn't say anything till it was warm and k showers ready hop in.. She was sooooo impressed with how smart of an idea it was, got a great shower BJ.

Miss that sweet summer child sometimes.
Can someone please link this post? I’m over here cry-laughing at how absurd it is
I literally stand in the corner of the shower until its warm enough lol
Dude my sister is 36 years old and just had this revelation.
I don't think this was me, but... this was me. I don't know why I never thought of it - I swear I'm quite a smart man in most ways. But until my late 20s I would get in, turn on the shower, then shiver and cower away from the cold water until it warmed up. Fucking ridiculous.

It was a thread on Reddit that finally taught me the (blindingly obvious) proper way to do it.
I realized the other day that I take my showers with my eyes closed basically the entire time haha. I just know where the soap is and the washcloth and I just close my eyes to wash my face first, then never open them again while I do everything else 🤣
Just imagine this dude without his “shower flower” with soapy water running down his forehead into his eyes while he grits his teeth like those angry wojak memes. 

I’m in my thirties and I can’t recall the last time I got soap in my eyes. Just tilt your head back.
give them a little rinse before re-opening, voila!
I don't think I close my eyes when I rinse shampoo off, leaning has always been enough. When I rinse conditioner off im also rinsing off face wash so I do close my eyes then
Soap still burns my eyes even when closed, like they don't close enough or something. Still, I lean my head back and rarely ever get shampoo on my face let alone in my eyes
Clearly OP never listened to Somebody’s Watching Me.


"When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair


'Cause when I open my eyes I might find someone standing there"
Okay wait hang on now, you have to be incredibly brave to point your eyes *upward* - that’s precisely where the water’s coming from you crazy fool! Point your head down, that’s the secret trick and I’ll keep trying it till it works

I used to tilt my head backwards until I realized tilting it slightly forward is way more effective at keeping shampoo out of my eyes. Plus, it makes this super satisfying but obnoxiously loud splashing sound while the suds impact the floor.
My husband does the same thing and I am sooo going to use your prank on him tomorrow. Thank you so much for the idea! 😈🫧🫧

Update: I did this to my husband this morning and I got “Why do you keep putting shit on my head?!!”
I'm imagining OP staring into the sprayer like a meth head looking at a solar eclipse.
It gets dark when I close my eyes and I'm afraid of the dark.
actually, for me anyway, if soap gets in the tear duct area, im getting some of it in my eyes no matter how hard I squeeze them shut. Its mostly just mild irritation, but irritation nonetheless. Thankfully, as others have mentioned, I can just tilt my head back and Im all good.
Seriously, I have no idea which direction I hold my head because I can close my eyes and rinse the shampoo out with my eyes entire closed the whole time. I'm like fucking Houdini.
Then how would I keep my eyeballs shiny and lush?
"Don't get soap in your eye, 'cause that'll make you cry"
I just don't really care that the shampoo runs down over my face 🤷‍♂️ it washes off
Why do men do that??  I’m pretty sure every man I’ve ever seen shower does that and I don’t get it!
Think it depends on hair length and height. For a tall guy leaning back doesn't work that well with the way most shower heads are designed and how high up it is.

Leaning back can be pretty tough and like doing limbo in the shower and pretty risky honestly. If you have long hair it's definitely best to do it that way though.

If you have short hair then leaning forward isn't that bad, though the water running down your face can make it a bit hard to keep water out of your nose/mouth unless you hold your breath
I do it this way and it's never really an issue, I just close my eyes
The only time I've gotten soap in my eyes as an adult was because something in the bathroom startled me, and I opened my eyes like wtf. I don't understand OP at all.
I've literally rubbed soap into my eyelids just recently after a hefty Saturday combining yard work (dirt and grass) after garage work (oil and grease) to get all that cleaned off. Don't remember any stinging.
I'm an optometrist and this is a conversation I have not infrequently:

Me: are your eyes often this red?
Patient: oh no I just showered so this is from the soap

They're not complaining about it and I'm on a schedule so we just move on lol
Yes but now he’s saying he’s living with the pain of sometimes getting soap in his eyes, so he still hasn’t figured it out.
I think you're missing the part where his dad told him he was old enough to not get soap in his eyes and OP decided to just get his own anyway.
Even then, they say they just deal with the occasional pain of soap in their eyes now. That means that they are still somehow getting soap in their eyes. I genuinely cannot remember the last time I got soap in my eyes in the shower.
but then refused to get out of it when his father told him he is too old for them lmao
Yeah, turns out there's a lot of stuff I did as a 2 year old that I don't do any more.
Never put soap on your eyeballs, that’s what loofahs are for
I prefer just to open and close my eyes on demand. I’ll leave the shitting to my butthole.

How about the guy that didn't properly wipe and thought it was no big deal.  His girlfriend would clean his ass for him in the shower "as foreplay" before any sex.

What was her reaction ? Omg that comment section has to be glorious
Yeah as far as I know it has been a thing in Japan for a least 30 years, though they don't do adult sizes, they mostly target from baby to like 10 years old.
Same. I only close my eyes sometimes.
Like OP had the phrase "flowering while showering" randomly pop in their head one day and decided to use it as a prompt to write a story around.
I can't believe I had to scroll this far to finally find someone with enough sense to see this.
[deleted]
For real though. Glad that OP has his life sorted out, but this seems like being mildly on the spectrum. Nothing wrong with that, just interesting.
XTREME!1!1!!1!
Idk this guy probably pees at urinals with his pants around his ankles and shirt pulled up.
Right? Let the man have his hat. I’m lmao at the pic here. What a turn off that hat is. Personally it wouldn’t bother me otherwise because the hilarity makes up for the quirk.
How could I forget she 

was leaving work early

All the time I was lathering 

She couldn't take her eyes off me
Yup. Eating *all* the bodies.
I use dish soap to shower sometimes. Dawn is great when you're black with grease after having been under a car all day.
There was a redditor who didn’t know you use a towel to actually rub on your body to dry off, they thought you wrapped it around your waist and just....waited to dry. They hated how long it took. 

Like an after shower robe you wear only while waiting for your body to naturally dry off. 🤣🤣
Ugh! I hate showers too! Especially the part where you have to take a weed whacker to your bare shins! It's so painful! Why do we do this to ourselves!?
I literally saw a screenshot post on tumblr earlier where the OP stayed with their Dad and brother. It was a photo of a shower with a scourer/sponge and then a type of washing up liquid, I think. Absolute madness.
Oh my god, that post. It was really sad. If you looked into their post history a bit, I’m pretty sure she was actually a teenage girl with this problem. Rly bad depression and no idea how to clean her body.
It’s like hating burgers because you hate wood chips, and you go out and buy wood chips and put them on your burger willingly. 

Then keep saying that burgers suck because wood chips are dumb
I got my first electric toothbrush as a fully grown adult and did exactly that the first time, of course in front of another adult human. Honestly, we both just laughed it off but I was like “idk, I’ve never used one before!” I still think about the shocked face I saw myself make in the mirror and his very clear secondhand embarrassment for me.
I just did this for the first time after successfully using an electric toothbrush for nearly two decades.
....sigh
I don't believe this for a second, but the mental image is fucking hilarious
And the guy who didn’t know until he was an adult that men sit on the toilet seat to poop. 🤦🏻‍♀️
I think about that post \*every\* single time I turn on the shower.
I think about that post all the time! It blew my mind. And made me feel a lot better about my own airheadedness.
This is highly amusing. Can anyone find the link? I'm not turning anything up in my searching.

Edit: [This one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/aelh9q/i_just_realized_i_could_let_the_shower_warm_up/) It's gotta be, the thread starts put similar to how this is going. Haha...
what is Ice soap!?
Ice soap? Like was it the guy that put liquid soap in the freezer?
I dont understand why it was your responsibility to turn the shower head. So he would call you everytime he wanted to shower to point it at the wall, and you did it? You know it's okay to say no.
IT’S NOT HIS FAULT JULIAN ONLY HAS PAWS AND CAN’T REACH THE SHOWER HEAD! STOP SCREAMING AT HIM!!!
I had a roommate seriously suggest we buy more utensils when I was complaining about how quickly we were out of clean ones. I looked this grown ass man in the face (he's 6 years older than me) and told him "no we're fucking washing the dirty ones". Tf man
What did she think towels were for? Does she use a towel after swimming or washing her hands? Was she just standing in the bathroom air-drying for an hour every time she showered? *I have so many questions.*
Dude seriously I’m with the other guy- what? What was she doing for 83 years? Just dripping dry?
What I am coming to understand more as I get older is that people who are super smart but only at like one thing are just not actually smart. If you can beat a video game faster than anyone else in your city, but you can't cook microwave popcorn or learn a few basic phrases is an unfamiliar language...you're just an idiot with a gift. Which is fine.
My Dad use to get a fire going by turning on the gas, then striking and holding a match inside the fireplace as it exploded into flames. He'd burn off his arm hair and eyebrows almost every time.  
One day, I asked him, "Would it still work if you put a lit match in the fireplace, then slowly turned on the gas?" 
He looks at me, surprised (I think, cause he's got no eyebrows) and is like, "Huh. Yeah, that would work."
My Dad was literally a rocket scientist.

My favorite was the guy that used the shower basically as a bidet or something and compared his wife having to clean that out to him half to clean her hair out of thr drain.

I've never wrapped my head around what he was actually doing to begin with.

Wahh? Why? Did they think they were being water boarded?

Just tilt your head down and mouth breath 🥴
Clickbait or not, it was posted on Reddit. I remember it.
But how will you know if there's a ghost standing behind you?
I started showering with the lights off when I was ~14. Never looked back. It's relaxing af. Its only gotten better since smart lights came out and I can wait to turn them off/on while in the shower already.
I did this before I got lasik, since I was already essentially blind.
Yeah I haven’t gotten soap in my eyes since I was like 5 years old.
Maybe people are different, but soap only gets in my eyes if I squeeze my eyes shut. Just closing them keeps water out.
Yeah I hate water in my ears so I always point my head down

Seriously, what is this big problem everyone's trying so hard to avoid? Lol. Literally just close your eyes and mouth, don't breathe in for 3 seconds, rinse your head/face—everything washes off because that's how water works.
it’s because men are on average taller, and shower heads are often at an awkward height where they would have to limbo if they wanted to lean back far enough, so leaning forward is easier. also, it’s not as big an issue with short hair.
If you lean forward enough (which isn't very far) the soap doesn't even get to your eyebrows. Just straight off the forehead. Way more efficient than hurting my back trying to lean backward.
I wash my hair with my head tilted forwards and my eyes open, and no problems. I don't know, it just works. Maybe same for other guys?
Sadly, he never developed this skill during his formative years. Now it’s too late. It’s like a senior citizen trying to learn a foreign language.
The only time my wife or I get soap in our eyes is when we're showering together. One of us scrubbing our heads will unknowingly flick the perfect splash of soap into each other's eyes.

Since I'm about 6" taller than her I'm usually the clumsy one who accidentally soap assaults her.

I'm going to order her a flower-shower cap. It'll be her very own little battle helmet to help fight against the chaos of our showers.
Exactly, does this guy not wash his face, which should include your eyelids?
I know I spend too much time thinking about how to sequence everyday tasks, but it's baffling that there are grownups that just seemingly can't stop and think through the most basic activity to make sure it's safe and comfortable. It's not exactly a large cognitive load to handle.

I remember this one. Dude really said “my mommy girlfriend scrubs my asshole because it’s part of her foreplay.”

The woman wouldn’t let him have sex with her without **supervising his shower beforehand**. To this day I cannot believe she stayed.
She was mad at him and gave him a silent treatment. I didn't catch an update, if there was any
It was. OP was also in denial and keeps insisting it was just a joke and things will be fine even though she gives him the silent treatment.
It never stopped being weird evey time I read this expression. TBH I though this would be a story about a woman who only got her first period in her 20s while taking a shower (possibly at someone's house and causing a mess of sorts, hence the 'tifu')
I slip into the formless void and lose my soul for a while
That's an understandable reason for them to stick with the first thing that worked forever.
I love reddit for these things

*Yeah, it was me*

Did I do it for an hour?

Did it make me feel empowered?

Can confirm,  I'm a duck who survived an oil spill thanks to dawn.
Dawn is also great when you've been pepper sprayed. Nothing else touches the stuff.
When you said "dawn is great when you're black" I thought that sentence was going somewhere else entirely.
I used to to use dawn to strip the last bit of dye out of my hair before switching to another colour.
Not even for the ‘covered in grease’ level of grime — the regular Dawn liquid (NOT the Powerwash!!!) is absolutely magnificent as a clarifying shampoo to cut through and remove hair product buildup. I found this out by accident one time when I’d forgotten to buy more clarifying shampoo for over a month (the old style that was hard on your hair used to work so much better), and out of desperation figured I’d try liquid Dawn because my hair was past the point where it wasn’t laying right anymore. It’s absolutely miraculous and much easier on your hair and scalp than regular (especially old style) clarifying shampoo. 

For those who don’t know, clarifying shampoo is not meant to be used frequently, and especially not every day. Also, I need to mention again that I’m not talking about Dawn Powerwash! The Powerwash has some kind of alcohols or something in it that will destroy your hair; use Powerwash on your dishes and countertops only, never an animal or human body.
That's the absolute truth.  Dawn works wonders on automotive grease if you don't have and Lava/Gojo handy.  I usually wind up buying the generic Dawn, but it works just as well.

As an aside, Dawn is actually my go-to when it comes to cleaning the shower itself as well.
I love air drying myself, or rather, not putting clothes immediately after showering.

I do dry myself normally, but then I just like to hang around in a towel and at some point put on clothes.
I just can't imagine living my life like that. You know it's not even that he was taught wrong or something, he just didn't have the imagination to think "there must be a better way" or the confidence to do something that might make him look silly. Just imagine how many other mundane tasks he continues to do wrong.
My mom recently figured out that some people wear robes fresh out of the shower like a wearable towel, and not just as a nighttime blanket-jacket.
I have to wonder where these people's parents were when they were growing up. Like, did you not notice that this was a little strange?
Tbf, air drying is gentler on your skin, and if you've got a routine then it might just happen without you just waiting around. Like I will clean my ears, blow my nose, brush my teeth n such, put on face moisturizer n stuff, and then I'm pretty much dry. And a little dampness is better when applying lotion, too!
Link pleaaaase!
I just saw a sharper image ad for a stand on dryer for use after bathing or showering. It’s funny because I was just wishing that drying tubes from science fiction were a thing and this is close.
For real! I hate the part where I have to boil myself like a lobster until I have burns. It hurts! Isn’t there another way??!! Why must I have to do this?!
The Waterpik we got for my son when he had braces was fun. He basically used it to wash the mirror instead of the wires in his mouth 🫠
I still do it sometimes. I am basically a zombie first thing in the morning, when getting up to an alarm clock.
I have questions about this one
Every time I turn the hot water on to brush my teeth I think of all the wasted years I had used cold water. I will never get those back.

He wanted me to turn the shower head back to the wall after I'd finished showering so that it would be ready for him to shower.

I demonstrated the alternative system as described but he couldn't get his head around it.

The house belonged to him so I just considered it a house rule and picked other battles.
Julian _definitely_ had opposable thumbs.
She was air drying some and putting on lotion and getting kinda distracted (she’s I think kinda adhd). I had no idea, I felt bad but now she enjoys bath and shower much more

She’s just always done things her own way
She follows her own lights I love her to death it’s always something unexpected with her
i actually prefer an air dry. ill towel off in the winter but summer is all about the air dry.
It's not that either, it's just whatever people have done more of and how often they leave that comfort zone
I think there are different kinds of smart.

There is academically smart and common sense smart, or logic smart, or whatever. I have a friend who is very creative and academically quite accomplished, but she can't figure out how to open a jar by herself, or - the latest example - she was staying at my house and couldn't remember how to open the shower door. And the thing is, she wouldn't try to problem solve, she'd just.... Shut down and give up. Whereas I would say I'm probably a bit 'slower' at learning things, but I don't give up until I find a solution to a problem, or at least try until I realise I need help from someone else.
Yes exactly. She didn't think about just opening her mouth face down. So she always made a little step to breath or sth XD
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW, their shower habits are none of my business.
That's the beauty of the out-of-sight system! You need *never* know what horrors are cavorting behind you as you ablute.
Worse, if you don’t wear your glasses in the shower, how will you know if a mad scientist replaced your shampoo with a clearly labeled bottle of acid. You gotta protect yourself.
I have a little night light. So much better than the bright overhead lights.
I did that while having bad vision already then a friend came to visit and notified me how dirty the shower was. I hadn’t noticed cause it was dark but there was a spider taking up residence in the corner, soap scum on the shelf, etc. I just literally wasn’t able to tell because it’s already a fairly dark room and I obviously don’t wear glasses in there so had no idea. So be careful with the dark shower only routine - put the light on sometimes!
when you say lights off, do you mean just relying on natural light or are we talking pitch black? because the latter seems so chaotic evil to me
How does he not feel more being added 😂
It’s this. I’m 6’2 and my shower head is at like 4’9 - zero chance I’d be able to matrix my back into that contortion when I can just close my eyes and take 4 seconds to wash it out.
Finally, being 5'2" pays off
OP claims to be a lawyer in a past comment. Idk, do lawyers do a lot of problem-solving or is it mostly just following known procedure? 

Problem solving is a real yet intangible skill that is hard to teach. Many people are in need of them.
Is that what Van Morrison's Brown eyed girl was about???
Did you read it? He has kids
Not that time, but dude tucked up his shower crown for personal time and still felt ok going out looking for sex knowing he has this dark shame hiding inside him. 

Like I couldn’t ask someone out till I was making better than minimum wage
I was called this once and I had to google it made me feel good and sad at the same time 😭
True but he implied it was just this shameful little secret he kept from all these other ladies he was banging.

I’m honestly impressed with the irrational confidence, I couldn’t bring myself to even try dating let alone mating until I had all of my shit down and this dudes flowering in the shower (which honestly sounds like suctioning his asshole to the slick porcelain and just kinda plungering until it prolapses) but still felt like “yeah, why shouldn’t I get to put my penis inside another person?!
Rattles a bit when the rice is cooking, but, y'know... still a lid.
Maybe she is as stupid as he is
OMG I'm dead
It gets a good resolve
Jesus *wiped*.
Gonna need some shampoo in the eyes after that one
But your hopelessly lost yourself..., stranded with a murderer...
I'm a fan of your TV work
Most of those ducks didn't survive. By the time they were caught and cleaned they had been exposed to too much oil through their skin, lungs and orfices and died slowly over days. And the oil dissolved with the surfactant to remove it from their feathers got washed back into the ocean where it continued to poison the ecosystem. 

Those commercials were PR stunts designed by Exxon to create positive public perception of using surfactants to dissolve oil spills instead of more expensive and labor intensive containment booms and actually removing the oil from the water. They got away with it completely and the fishing industry near the Valdez spill, the only industry of any kind that existed in that part of Alaska, is still completely collapsed 30 years later.
Most of those ducks die.
And poison oak.
I'm going to tuck away that little tidbit! I'm not bothering to fact check it because let's be honest - I'm not getting pepper sprayed anytime soon. Or ever, probably. Hopefully.
it's a rare place where you're glad they *didn't* us a comma
No lie, I thought I was about to be gifted some secret wisdom.
The sleep study tech recommended using Dawn to get the sticky sensor goop out of my hair. Worked like a charm!
I once accidentally dyed my hair black (like blue-black) when I was going for dark brown and was recommended by a friend to wash it with Dawn for a couple days in a row. It didn’t completely get it out at all obviously but it definitely faded it and made it look a bit more lived-in as opposed to super inky and dark. I still had to grow it out but that made it a lot more bearable.
When I was a kid, we got lice. The shampoos weren't working so my mom slathered our heads in hellman's mayo, plastic bag over our wet goopy heads for an hour, slowly combed our hair. When we finally got to shower, dawn was the only thing to degrease our hair. Also? Mayo is an amazing conditioner. My hair was super soft, even after the dawn wash.
Can you explain what you mean by not laying right? I can never get my hair to do what I want it to do so it usually grows into a giant poofy mess
I actually use Dawn as handsoap in the shop over Gojo. If you mix it with Boraxo it's unbeatable.

But I've also found that good, fat-rich "artisan" soaps from the local craft market kick ass at cleaning greasy arms and such. Especially if they have oats or herbs or some other abrasives in there. But I think the key is the nice fats to help cut the grease.
Are you 70+? I think you might go to my gym
Oh yes climatizing. I find it an absolute necessity. There's no way I'm getting a bra on if there's any sort of moisture on my skin. I do the hook in front/spin around method, and Lord does it stick if you're wet.
If not towel, why made of towel?
Well they don’t work well like that because then you are wearing a damp robe, so it’s not as comfortable as using a towel first and then putting the robe on after you are at least 90% dry.
My parents were neglectful and left my brother and I to manage our own hygiene as soon as we were each old enough to shower alone. I learned about using shampoo and conditioner because some girls at school bullied me for having greasy and frizzy hair. I learned to use deodorant for a similar reason. No one ever taught me to floss or do makeup or use a blow dryer or straightener. I learned hygiene as a young adult, on my own. Not everyone has parents who parent.
I had one of these moments so I guess I can relate? Lol. 

I honestly didn't know that you could get your eye glasses wet and like wash them in the sink with soap and water. I only used those microfiber towels or those little alcohol things that they use on your arm before you get a shot and they'd still be greasy or streaky sometimes. 

But I have legitimately never thought about putting them in the sink and washing them. When someone mentioned that the lightbulb went off and I was like wow that's a great idea! Lol.
B/C you like the hurt, maybe?

Suggestion: agree with yourself on a safe word…when it’s too much, say the safe word, k?

If it makes you feel any better, this was my son's first 30 seconds of owning a waterpik. I too forgot to tell him the timing of the power button is important. 🙃
I have a beard and recently had to use a waterpik after some dental work. The amount of water that just pours out and camps in my beard is honestly impressive. I only needed to get between the teeth and under the dental work and it was terribly messy. 

I can understand how it would get on the mirror if the water needed to be directed to the faces of the teeth to get behind the braces & wires. The splashback from the fronts of the teeth would be extreme.
I need this link
That's the post I think of every time I use the stove.
Holy shit this just made me actually lol
My favorite is the guy who thought the racks in the oven were basically like a grill, so you put food straight on them. And he was upset about having to clean the oven all the time, because he didn't know that cookie sheets (or whatever) exist.
The real win is comparing one’s self to lower standards, not actually winning.
Exactly. I still often think about the Redditor who didn’t know until he was an adult that males can and do use the toilet seat to poop or other Redditors who somehow missed basic parts of living when I’m reminded of their various boggles, and now I’m going to be thinking about this Redditor who spent decades not thinking about closing his eyes or turning away from the shower head. Sigh.
I just read that and the comments are absolutely amazing!
I just read that one and there was a Rick and Morty reference in it. That thread is 9 years old. Which made me realize Rick and Morty turned 10 years old yesterday. Rick and Morty came out when I was 15.... What the fuck?
I remember this being voted as one of the worst things to ever make the front page. That and 2am chili
I remember that! That was one of the very first reddit posts I saw, before I even made my account!
That’s actually Not a bad idea but homie could have found other ways much better tbh
You demonstrated it and he still didn't get it? How is that when possible??
I mean, the dumb motherfucker could have also just looked with his stupid eyes to see where the head was facing, and adjust it as needed for his "must be in shower recess to operate shower" pea lizard-brain method...  there are layers of stupid occurring here.
Ohhhh right. Yeah, that does make it harder to say no to.

>had

Did he get near a wood cutter twice?
Dude, you *have* to buy her an electric towel warmer for Christmas or her birthday.
>She follows her own lights 

I love this phrasing!
I think in the case of my ex it was most likely his parents' fault. They were really nice people, but they treated him like a child even when were going out. He was 8 years older than me (26) and yet he still lived at home, couldn't drive, never cooked, never did chores, he got 3 home cooked meals a day if he wanted them. He never lifted a finger around the house. His room was a fucking pigsty. I remember one really mortifying time, he said his mum was tidying his room and found his porn because she'd put it in a new box cause the old one had broken. He was addicted to porn. He didn't really have a clue how the real world worked, he said he'd never learned to cook or clean because when he was at uni he lived with 3 older female students and they all just fed him and stuff.

He just wasn't taught basic life skills by his parents. They were simultaneously really protective of him (I was never allowed to sleep over) and also really negligent (teaching him basic skills like cooking/cleaning/hygiene), he was a pothead as a teenager and they didn't stop him, it was just a very weird situation. I'm 99% certain he still believed in Santa and he slept with a security blanket (it was a old towel).

I broke up with him cause he was too immature for me. He was a nice enough guy and a good first boyfriend but I needed someone a bit more independent and competent. I remember once I set a pan of chili to defrost and popped to the toilet, I asked him to just keep an eye on it and stir it. I came back a few minutes later & he was panicking and frantic that it has started to bubble and he didn't know what do to. I believe a lot of it was weaponised incompetence/learned helplessness.
But... you're their shower habit.
Ablute??!! What is this delicious word
When I was little I would hide under my blankets from the door to the attic (which was in my childhood bedroom's ceiling) using the logic that even if there was a monster in the attic, if I couldn't see him, he couldn't see me.
Mad but well organised. That's my kind of scientist.
And you've got to see the spiders when they join you. Has it happened only like 5 times that I remember? Yes. Is that 5 times too many to voluntarily be blind in the shower? Also yes.
I use one of those star/colored light projectors while I shower. It's ambient as fuck and really makes showering an experience. I can't go back now.
Wow, I'm the opposite! I hate showering in the dark or in dim lighting. I use a transparent shower curtain liner with no curtain specifically so that it's brighter in the shower.
Or you know...clean the shower once in awhile like a normal person.
That's uhh, never been an issue for me. I do also take baths in the dark and I'm obsessively clean for those enough to cover the issue I suppose.
This is why you should never put your contacts in before you take a shower.
I keep forgetting to shave my feet for this reason. I’m not wearing my glasses and my feet don’t look hairy at all when I have glasses on.
I've taken many hotel showers on my knees because of this.
Hey, where did we go?
Maybe he stole them.
Lmao ikr? 

Confidence is one hell of a drug but homie ain’t there yet all the while he’s wearing the flower crown of shame in the shower😂


Tbh when I read flowering in the shower my mind went to hes either legs up airing his hairy butt or he’s having “personal time”. Didn’t even think about the other possible meanings👀
God please no
I hear it’s not all it’s quacked up to be
Speaking of that ad.  Last week I woke up from a dream that I didn’t remember, but my waking thought was “How would you even bathe a duck?!” because in my dream brain logic, they float and water rolls off their backs, so it would be difficult to bathe one.  But then my more awake brain kicked in and I go “with Dawn dish soap.”
Well that is super depressing..
Fellow Alaskan? Cheers neighbor. Fuck Exxon.
They also test on animals iirc, so kinda cancels out the duck washing stunt
That sucks. 

I do have to hand it to Dawn though, after working on something oily & greasy it does clean me off…. But anymore I wear disposable gloves.
OP never said he died, so the only logical conclusion is that he is a zombie duck.
Thanks for the tip. I'll make sure to have some poison oak on hand to rub in my face the next time I get pepper sprayed.
And poison ivy.
What, when you hear the call “to the barricades!”, you’re going to pretend to be busy?!?   We’re doomed, I’m afraid…
I use a few different things in my hair after I shower and when I’m styling it, everything from leave-in conditioner to curl enhancing gloop, anti-frizz gloop, slickening gloop, styling crème, and so on, even various holds of mousse and even hairspray, depending on what I’m doing with my hair. As the coating starts to build up in places (and completely leave other parts of the strands of hair), my hair starts getting more and more uncooperative; when I say it won’t lay right, I usually mean that my fringe or layers looks terrible and is clumping together and/or separating in random places, and styling products plus heat aren’t able to get a solid curl or straightening everywhere any more. My hair can look greasy in some places, frizzy in others, and in general look as if the hairstylist who cut my hair was blind with dull shears. At that point (or a few days before), it’s time to strip away all the buildup and start afresh. All of a sudden, my hair starts looking uniform in texture again (after I apply whatever products I decide to use), glossing products work again, and I don’t look like I cut my own hair by using a weed whacker. I have learnt to make every effort to use clarifying shampoo (or Dawn liquid) before a haircut so that my stylist isn’t seeing buildup and thinking it’s my real hair texture.
Too much product buildup
Nah, the 70+ guys don’t even bother with the towel…
My safe word is "AAHFUCKINSHITFUCK"

My dad always left the toilet seat up when I was little. Once, I proudly told my mom that I'd figured out that he probably did that because his butt was so big and the regular seat was smaller. Now that I think of it, she must've told him about that because at some point he stopped leaving it up.
And the culmination. The 2 am ice chili shower.

_sigh_

I just... I just don't know.
That's a lot more common than you'd think. 

Some people do things one way for years, then someone else shows them a more efficient way and either in their mind or out loud they go "I've been doing this for years and it works, so I'll keep doing it my way".  It's scarily common in certain trades. 

And other people get it but don't want to admit they didn't realize sooner, so they just keep pretending like their way is better.
you know this is a really nice idea! she loves the blanket warmers they have in the hospital I think she'd be into this!! THANK YOU!
tbh the security blanket thing makes me think there's more to it than just incompetent parents. Sounds like neurodivergence in some way, not that being Autistic or ADHD or something else gives you a pass from at least attempting to be self-sufficient. Just seems a shame no one tried to help him develop those skills, or skills to manage himself
Are you familiar with ablutions? In the UK, that's the name we give the washing area at a campsite.
I use one that looks like a little glowing mushroom. It changes colors every few seconds or so till it goes through the whole hue.

It’s very relaxing
Welp, adding to my wish list
I think you’ve just changed my life.
I have a very sheer curtain so I can see if there's someone in the bathroom with me. 

And I lived alone for YEARS. But those intrusive thoughts and irrational fears just get in your head. This fixed that.
Reddit disgusts me
 I hate hotel shower heads that are at neck level. What absolute and total moron thought that would be a good idea? "Hey, you know what hotel guests would really enjoy? Getting their shoulders really clean." 

 There was one particularly bad hotel shower, I still have the photo I took so I could show my wife...
Yeah but you see their name in the bill
Yep! Everything is awful! Have a cookie :)
Fuck em! I'm from California but I'll fuck em anyway

Thanks for the actual lol

True that. If you're sat down, do not take your eyes off the floor. Stood up, eyes always eye level or above unless you want a eye full.
Thank you so much, I love this one too. These kind are my favorites; mundane activities, but you can see everyone having the time of their lives ❤️

Maybe in their mind they're thinking, "If I'm running the shower and nobody's in it, I'm wasting water." Turns out if you're in the shower, and the water's running, *but* you're not showering, you're *still* wasting water.
I feel like my old roommate and yours would get along 🤣
My aunt was super perplexed for awhile about why my cousin always had BO even though he swore he was using deodorant and the deodorant was clearly being used because he needed new deodorant frequently. One day, she had to use the restroom and my cousin was showering, while she was in there, he asked her to hand him his deodorant. HE HAD BEEN USING IT IN THE SHOWER 😂
I consider myself fairly intelligent and I was well into my 20s when I learned how to properly open a new deodorant. Apparently you don’t have to struggle trying to pull the protective cap off with your teeth, you can just raise the deodorant, remove it, and lower it back down. 

I often wonder what kind of life blindspot I’m leaving my kid with….
You're welcome, I'm so happy your mom is gonna be happy!
just  be very careful and buy an elderly friendly one. 
they only heat to a lower temperature and time out after a while. 

otherwise they can cause burns to delicate old skin and be dangerous if left on after being forgotten by absent minded 83 year old ladies.
I have thought about this over the years. I really don't think so. I think he went through some trauma as a younger teenager that he really should have been protected from by his parents, and he had access to stuff he should not have been allowed to have.

He basically floated his way through uni and I think ended up in his mid-20s with zero life skills because nobody turned around to him and pointed out that some of his behaviours were toxic, immature or weird. He dated younger girls (I was 8 years younger, his previous ex was 10 years younger) who wouldn't know any better.

His parents just let him live and act like a spoiled little 15 year old and no surprise when he acted like that. Honestly you should have seen the state of his room, it wasn't so much untidy as a health hazard. If a woman his age had seen it she'd be turning around on the spot.

It is a shame, but thankfully he's sorted his shit out and now married to a lovely lady his age. We still chat occasionally and he seems to have got his life together.
I got a filtered shower head recently that lights up red, green or blue depending on color temp. I love it but unfortunately my current master bath is small and gets too steamy. The fan is connected to a light.
Yeah, but they had to paddle hard to get that.
Loaded with sugar, which will give you diabetes and eventually kill you.
Well..that made me feel a little better, thanks
Right on! I don’t think I’ve ever met somebody from Outside before that knew about the BS they pulled with the birds/wildlife, and held the grudge like we do. Thanks for that. 

So many people spent SO MUCH time and extremely hard labor working to clean oil off of the wildlife on a volunteer basis for months and months, bc they felt helpless in the face of the scope of the catastrophe and it gave them a sense of being able to actually do something to help. And then had to cope with the emotional fallout of slowly realizing it was all not just a failure but an intentional lie, they had been used to benefit the company that had stolen everything from them, and their selfless good-faith efforts may arguably have contributed to making the long term problem worse. On top of everything else. Unforgivable.

My friends landlord didnt own oven mitts and would just burn her hands taking stuff out of the oven on a regular basis.  He blew her mind using a towel to take something out of the oven.  I'm not sure how she would have reacted if she saw \*actual\* oven mitts.

I should add this was in Quebec and she baked a *lot*.

TIFU by yelling into my Teams meeting "Jesus Christ, check my fucking calendar!" - I was not on mute.
Title covers it, thought I was on mute and was not. Someone was messaging me on the side asking if I could meet at certain times (my very limited free time is on my calendar). I yell in pure frustration "Jesus Christ, check my fucking calendar!" The meeting got really quiet and I realized what happened. Just gave a little sheepish "my bad, thought I was muted" and went silent. The person I was yelling about messaged me on the side and apologized, which made me feel even worse.

I apologized, and said it was very unprofessional. I tried to explain how I am really stressed with deadlines (I am) and was venting but I still feel like a total ass, which is accurate. This was a smaller group of decent people so I don't think anyone will complain to my boss or anything like that, I just get to live with my embarrassing FU.

TL;DR: Yelled at/about people in an online meeting thinking I was muted.  


edit: grammar
We had a guy do this. Another inane, redundant, time-sucking unproductive initiative is announced. One guy bellows out “Awwwww, JESUS CHRIST, PEOPLE!!” 

Meeting goes silent….. he stutters, “oh sorry, I just watched my neighbor wipe out on the sidewalk in front of my house with his snowblower.” We all pretended to accept his explanation. Quick thinking, Sean. Proud of you.
I treat zoom meetings like firearms, always loaded - as long as the meeting is on, I'm not muted, even if I am. Camera can see me, even if it's off.
On the plus side, maybe that person got the hint and will check your calander first next time.
Coworker was on night shift, at about 2am, gets 5 emails about server issues from the CEO, after the 5th one he shouts "God fucking damnit CEO, I'm working on it"  only to hear from across the open office "sorry" and CEO popping his head up.
Realization of all our dreams and wishes... 
Thank you for the sacrifice
Oh. Similar story.

Was in a training call on teams. 
Look at my mobile. See that I have a missed call from the doctor I was desperately waiting for “Oh fuck me!” 

The trainer on the call ‘what, catsumoto? Any question?’ 

Me, dying inside because I wasn’t on mute. 

They continue and I am absolutely in a cold drenched sweat, because… drum roll please…the meeting was being recorded. For the stragglers and for the training platform. 

‘Oh god, oh god, fuck me’ -me, for the next hour of the training, but this time only internally. 

Then got the message that ‘the recording is now available’. I run to check what can be heard. It even has a live CC transcript. 

‘Oh what’ is what can be made out for my ‘oh fuck’ exclamation. 

Well, thank fuck for the companies ultra shitty headset that didn’t pick up my audio well enough. 

But man, did I sweat it for that hour.
Better than the one guy in my division's quarterly meeting. ~ 200 or so people on the call and some dude goes "yeah. Yeah, im on a work call....they don't know I'm watching porn"

Very awkward few seconds until some mid level manager goes "uhhh...I know who that is. I'll talk with them"
I was once on a zoom meeting with several other people in the room with me. I was not manning the zoom mute button. After hours of inane training the host of the zoom meeting finally asked if anyone had any last questions. 

I, thinking we were still on mute, scream: "Fuck no! Not at this time!"

Everyone got deadly silent, and the zoom host says: "Well that's a no from graciecakes89."
I feel like anyone who uses Teams frequently makes this mistake at some point. My supervisor frequently uses Teams calls for video while simultaneously calling on the phone for audio. He can hear me in Teams, but he likes talking on the phone for some reason. He's also a reputed micromanager. 


One day he Teams called/phone called me, and it was literally for the 6th time that day. At the end of the call I hung up my phone, but didn't hang up in Teams. I hung up my phone and loudly said, "Jesus tap dancing Christ, leave me the fuck alone for once". Of course, in the call chat in Teams, he typed "you're still in the call". Oops.


He still calls a fuckton, and the incident was never mentioned after thankfully.
Some times you need to scream into the void to maintain your sanity. You just have to make sure the void is actually empty.
I yelled "don't bite me bitch" to my cat, unmuted, on a teams call with over 20 people. Honestly it was pretty hilarious. We still talk about it.
This happened on one of my teams meetings, everyone in my role at my corporation on the call with yet another added manual task to train us on out of the blue that made zero logic and not one but two! "ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?"s came ringing out. The call was dead silent. These people were in stereo from different states. They both quickly left the call.
I once tuned a guitar in a meeting I had no business being in but was forced to attend.  You can imagine my shock when the little "You have been muted by another participant" popped up in Teams.
I once shouted "I swear to god if you poop on the floor I'm taking you to the RSPCA (animal shelter)"

The people on the call asked if I was having trouble with my new dog, I laughed and said I was talking to my kids.

Still makes me chuckle today when the dog is misbehaving when I'm on teams.
There is a large 50 + Team weekly meeting that I'm optional in. Even though I don't attend, I still get the text chats. Sometimes they do surveys and mini quizzes on policies (we work for the County of where I live) that attendees answer through the chat. One day I keep seeing chat messages of "Over 60", "Over 30", etc. Without any context of what was happening, I just HAD to respond with a gif of Vegeta's "It's over 9,000!"

  
And that's it. I didn't get in trouble, no embarrassing consequences (that I know of). Just a few laugh reacts.
I was being told to hurry up on a call, by my manager, and I put my hand over the phone and said "I've got someone on that doesn't know what he's talking about." 

I'd talked to that guy a few time in the past and he said "CptBlack, I do know what I'm doing and I have working here for 5 years."
That happened to me recently in an union meeting-call with about 70 people.

I was working on the side and uttered "god, you're fucking pissing me off with this shit".

Shortly after saw a popup message "You have been muted".
To be fair, I feel that needs to be yelled on at least two meetings a day.
I guarantee you, everyone on that meeting will check your calendar from now on before scheduling anything with you. And they might end up checking other people's calendars as well. You might have just improved your whole company.

FWIW, my response to "let's have a meeting" is always "check my free/busy and throw something on there, thanks" every single time. I don't initiate scheduling 90% of my meetings for this very reason. I'm not playing calendar tag with anyone.
In defense of your coworker, I have workmates that will block out chunks of time on their calendar as busy just to make sure that they are not inundated with useless meetings.  However, if you do need to meet with them for something important, they are totally available during the "busy" time.
At a startup I was at long ago, I was in a meeting where one of the Product Managers was getting grilled by the CEO quite aggressively.  This PM forgot to stop sharing his desktop when he finished his presentation.  Immediately opens up Slack with the entire company watching, and proceeds to type out "Who the fuck pissed in his coffee?" in a group chat.

It didn't end well for that PM.
This thread is making me reconsider how I work... I've always thought it was more polite to message someone about why I'm asking them into a meeting and if the time works for them... apparently everyone hates it when you do that.
Yeah, I let fly on Teams over a hot mike last week. I've been troubleshooting these wireless devices for 6 months. The vendor was sure it was our network causing the issue. Months of OTA, AP, wired packet captures. They kept pointing to all this latency their server "was detecting". I was pointing out that if their theory was correct most of our sites would be screaming and I'd really like them to share the server resources screen. Oh, look at that, CPU and Mem pegged at 100% usage. They got a "Oh for fucks sake!!" at full volume. I have a call with them in 15 minutes, should be fun.
I have one that keeps me up at night sometimes. I was in college and this girl in our econ class asked the professor what percentage of the grade is the final, and I thought I was muted and said “if the final is 250 points out of a 1000 its a quarter of the grade dumbass”. And the entire class went silent, my professor goes “Hey, your mic isn’t muted” and instantly I go “I’m sorry” and left the zoom. Not my best moment hahah
When someone in my org emails me the dreaded “please let me know some dates/times that work for you” I always say “my calendar is up to date” and if they insist on pursuing such an ineffective and annoying approach, I offer to show them how the Scheduling Assistant works and basically shame them into never doing that shit again. Definitely one of those petty pet peeves that gets me riled because it’s always when you’re busy and no one is ever trying to schedule a spa day.
Never “think” mute is on, always confirm.
Lessons were learned by all that day.
Ive been in the same boat.  We use a CRM that has a calendar and the sales people should have all employees highlighted so they can see everyones calendar.  Ive went over this a million times with them, but they dont do it.  "but I only need to see my calendar."   Obviously you dont, bc you asked me if Im available when you should know I am not.
Life is full of people who won't check your calendar. We have a PMO manager who is responsible for organising meetings... She finds it impossible to find free time between 4 people, which I know there's plenty, as I used to book the meetings, and I can see everyone's calendars.
Sucks but it can also get worse. A manager at my previous work was taking a #2 and wasn't muted. Somebody had to mention for everyone whose not talking to mute. 😂
It was my first week at a new job, I was in a training session with my boss and about 20 other people. I was literally halfway through a sentence when my cat decided to launch himself from behind me up onto my shoulder, onto my keyboard, and bounced off my desk. It hurt, my screen went black, and I automatically shouted fuck out of surprise and frustration. Turns out he’d disconnected the monitor somehow but I was still in the meeting, and was now getting harshly told off for inappropriate language (not fired, fortunately - boss had multiple cats and found it funny after I explained and apologised).

When I told my family about it later, my mum told me about her recent all day training zoom. When the trainer said, “we’re coming up on the end of our session”, she said “thank fuck” before realising she was unmuted. Apparently the guy just paused for second and carried on so maybe he gets that a lot?
please schedule vacation and take it.

feelings like this are one of my indicators that I'm getting burned out... even though the adrenaline of hitting goals.

the work will always be there
Oh look they’ve booked the twice weekly meetings out for the next six months all at twelve on top of my calendar item that specifically says lunch. DECLINE
My brain is broken…when I saw the words “Jesus Christ, check my fucking calendar” I immediately pictured an exasperated Jesus saying “Bruh…it’s EASTER Monday, I’m off today”!
An understandable FU and one that I feel every. damn. day. I've made it clear several times that my calendar is both up to date and visible to everyone to see blocked out times and yet the same people still send me "give me times and dates" I'm sorry, I can't, I'm in yet another fucking meeting, use the damn scheduling assistant and find an open slot. I don't have time to do it myself...
Last week I was on a teams meeting with my department. My partner was also home that day. I thought I was muting myself to talk to him and then unmuting myself to get back to the meeting, but turns out it was the other way around and the only feedback they got from me for a while was anything I said to my partner and not in regards to our current project. My team is super chill and totally laughed about it but was still embarrassing
Done that. We had an IT group that was constantly changing an online appraisal application that we use daily. These were mostly minor changes, but the changes required deleting and repopulating active projects every time. It was eating at least a day’s worth of work every week. After a month of 1x-2x changes a week, they announced another change in a meeting. I let out a loud and long disapproving groan. My mic was on. In the other hand, the continuous rollouts stopped. I still got a talking to by my supervisor which I accepted, and apologized to the IT team. But I know they were sick of the constant updating too.
Anecdotally….I had something very similar to me, happened during a benefits meeting, my headset was cutting in and out, and I thought I had disconnected the USB and plugged it back in after a few minutes but I had actually unplugged my mouse. As they were discussing the benefits, I exasperatedly stated “this is Fn horrible”. 

I only
Realized my
Mistake when i got a number of WTH and WTF messages in skype….

I apologized
To HR that afternoon and explained what happened… The benefits package they had out together was
Actually outstanding…. We had a good laugh about it every benefit meeting there after… and they would ask if I approve..
I could have 17 differeent indications that I'm on mute and I still don't think I'd ever trust it.
"I'm sorry, did I stutter?"
Once had a rough meeting with a partner company and at the end my coworker goes “Jesus Christ” right before disconnecting… the meeting was being recorded and eventually his expression got turned into a gif we would send around to each other
But I mean, like, you're not wrong. They should check your fucking calendar. I mean we cover this basic shit in school.

Hey teach, when is the next test?  
"Read the class schedule."

Hey professor, when is the next homework due?  
"Read the syllabus."

Hey u/ospreyguy, can you meet at this precise time?  
"Jesus Christ, check my fucking calendar!"
how do people STILL not understand scheduling assistant in outlook. 


like seriously, add everyone you need to a meeting, and click scheduling assistant, it will find open slots FORYOU
Had a person say "oh just F me right in the B" in a full company meeting. Your scenario is not that bad.
My calendar is always up to date. 

If you don’t have a job title that is three letters long and begins with a C, your request will be rejected without comment.

If you ask me my availability, I will tell you the same thing: “my calendar is up to date, pick a time.”

I’m not generally rude, but Outlook is not rocket brain science surgery. 
I was recently in a WebEx room with like 60 other people during a new job orientation. When we went to break I thought I was muted, but instead everyone got to hear a brief song about my cat, and me asking my Alexa how to say something in French. This will be something that I will think about at 3:00am when I’m 60 years old.
I cannot stand when people ask me to pick a time for their meeting. Figure it the fuck out I’m not your mom! This was a learning moment for all parties lol
Not nearly as bad as this, but I muted my headset mic and yelled "QUIET" upstairs to my dog who was barking at something in my backyard...

Turns out my laptop mic was being used, and my boss was currently talking. He stopped and went "umm is my mic too loud for anyone else"
Hey I did something similar once! I was trying to join a meeting but had no headset, so I normally dial in on the phone. I also had 3 people standing around my desk hassling me for stuff, so I was already flustered.

So I'm in the meeting, but there's no call in number, so I start swearing under my breath eventually saying out loud "aw, these fucking idiots didn't create a call in number!"

About 3 seconds later my desk phone rings and it's my co-worker who is in the meeting. He says, "Hey bud... We can all hear you."

Betrayed by the webcam Mic, which is normally deactivated, but got turned back on somehow. It was an awkward meeting, given that the "fucking idiots" who set it up were a vendor we were trying to buy a product from.
Jesus Christ isn't a digital assistant.
This happens to me all the time.  I straight up reply "my calendar is up to date" without any remorse because fucking adults should know how to book time with people.
We live vicariously through you.
I worked at Taco Bell as a teen. I was working drive thru one night and the person ordering was taking F O R E V E R. I thought my mic was turned off and I said "come onnnn"! I about died right there and made a coworker meet her at the window!
I thought I was on Mute when I announced “holy shit, I need to **peeeeeeee**!”
Since we’re confessing: I work as essentially a glorified call center rep in higher ed. Overworked, underpaid, etc. I talk all day to adults going back to school and many (not all) can’t grasp the concept that I have other students I need to speak to. Last month, I had finally gotten a hold of a student I’d been chasing for months. They pick up, won’t turn off their loud TV, then walk to the car, turn on the stereo, won’t answer my benign questions without making me repeat myself 3-5 times, then after 10 minutes of this, they put me on hold to take another call. They click over and I say loudly, “IT IS SO FRUSTRATING DEALING WITH THIS GUY!”

I was not on hold, and the individual has left the institution -_-

Bonus: I also forgot our calls are recorded, so my boss can find it at anytime if he goes digging for it. >_<
I was in class, listening to lecture while driving in my car back from work, so I can’t see the screen. Our professor let us know our TA would not be in attendance this lecture, and I jokingly said (as if I were the TA) “fuck them kids.” It got really quiet in lecture while my project group members started blowing up my phone asking if that was me. Our professor learned to mute everyone as soon as the class filled up.
My brother was on a zoom call with some pretty important people at his work. He felt a sneeze coming on, so he clicked the mute button, sneezed, and clicked again. Except… he was muted to being with. So he unmuted himself to sneeze while the higher ups were talking. 

And he’s got that Dad Sneeze™️ too.
I was an executive assistant for 10 years and here’s the thing…people don’t keep their calendars up to date. Either they are showing free, but “have to go pick their kids up from school” at that time and can’t do a call or they show busy, but “it’s flexible or just blocked working time” that can be scheduled over.

The number of times I scheduled a meeting based off of the fact that everyone looked free only to have someone come back with, “that time doesn’t work for me, can we do this other time?” that was, 9 times out of 10, a time that only worked for them and no one else, is easily in the hundreds.
Fuck'em. Sometime people need to hear things like this.  It helps them learn to think.
In a corporate classroom environment, weeks of material covered, we had one guy in a room of like 40 people pick up his phone off mute the moment he joined the meeting. 

There were a couple of instructors, and some were better than others. One of the mid tier instructors started off and he said "oh this bitch" to his buddy she dead stopped. 

She did a good job after that, I think a lot of people were sure to be attentive and ask thoughtful questions lol
My best guess:
They'll probably check your calendar next time. :)

For the win!!
One time I sent a meme about anal sex with a hooker to my entire team including my manager so don't feel too bad.
You're just saying what we're all thinking.  

Fuck teams. And fuck your teams meetings.
I was in a big departmental meeting once and we all heard some guy say “this is so fucking boring”. I’ve never cringed so hard, although he did say what we were all thinking
[deleted]
If only people said what they actually felt all the time, the world would be such a better place. Instead we cover up our true thoughts and feelings and give false pleasantries.
I live on fear of this moment. I'll have a beer for you, my friend
I can tell you all a story to make you feel better. Because you can't possibly have fucked up as bad as this.

At a prior job, there was a very large meeting, that had high level people in a few related government ministries. Very high level managers, prosecutors, possibly a judge.or something, not totally sure.

Most people did not need to speak, so they had their cameras. One lady was dialed in on her cell phone, and didn't realize her camera was, and she was going about her home, living life, taking her phone with her as she listened in. Now you may be thinking, oh, she went to the bathroom, that's embarrassing.

You're wrong, it's way worse. She was washing her dishes, and, alas, dropped her phone. Camera pointed up. And stood over it or walked over it a couple times. She was dressed only, *and I mean only*, in an oversized hoodie. Anyone unfortunate enough to be paying attention enough to see the video feed for her got a *really* good view.
I was in a meeting with a construction team going over sequencing and after an hour the architect logged on and started undoing everything we had discussed to that point and one of the subs thought he was muted said "who the fuck is this?" And it was my favorite meeting ever
I mean, they should have just checked your fucking calendar to be fair
Oops! 🤣 The other day I wanted to get off of a meeting with a team that is very dry. We had gone over things relevant to me several times and after the second time someone asked, "anyone have anything else?" And after 30 seconds of silence I got assertive and took over and excused myself by wishing them all a good day and said goodbye in a rush. Then I ended the meeting on my PC but forgot I was connected via phone call and I said "Oh my fucking god I am so awkward.." and kind of laughed and then realized they were still talking and I hadn't hung up.  I just hung up. 🤣 Whatever.
I hopped on a meeting from bed without realizing that my camera was on.
I was on a call with a customer a few years ago and my cat pooped on his tail. 

I thought I was on mute and yelled “the damn cat has shit on his tail again” to my SO. I was in fact not on mute, the customer and my coworkers were laughing, but that was the most embarrassing virtual meeting experience I have had.
One time, on a teams call, a guy accidently flashed his dick and balls because he was taking the call from the bathroom. He is a great asset, so we just ignored it. He didn't even skip a beat. I will never forget it, but it doesn't get talked about. Just move forward.
You know what. After reading some of these stories.. if I ever start a company I'm going to allow this kind of shit.
My dog had really serious behavior problems when he was a puppy. At one point I was in a meeting for a new job and he ran into the room. Before I even knew he was in the room he jumped up on top of my desk and sharply barked into my face. It startled me and I screamed his name and then yelled for my husband to come get him. Wasn't muted. There were maybe 50 people in the meeting and everyone got quiet. I still think about that today.  Especially because I don't yell at my dog, I don't think it's acceptable, and yet the one time he shocked me it was broadcast around my company. Kill me.
A lot of people are too stupid or lazy to keep their calendars up to date. So checking someone's calendar is usually not too reliable, unless they know you keep your calendar up to date then they definitely should've thought too.

But yelling it out loud, definitely a fuck up lol
I mean - they should have checked your fucking calendar. That’s why, in a work environment, we share our calendars…to avoid time wasting shit like this.
I was a 911 dispatcher and once did something similar over the radio. I said, “why can’t you just do it yourself” to the sergeant not realizing I had an open mic. I very much feel your pain.
Well, you are Calendar Guy for at least the next couple of weeks. 

Then something else will happen and you'll be replaced. 

Such is life.
One reason why trying to multi task doesn't work. Leave it till after the meeting that needs my attention.
Sounds like you were asking Jesus Christ himself to help. Not a big deal.
Send them a gift basket.

But they should also go look at your calender and see
People need to start yelling that at people more often TBH. But I suppose if you use outlook it was seemingly designed by a 4 year old who was given a stimulant and asked to design some software so I can't blame her too much.
If I had been on the receiving end of that, I would have laughed. Cmon, this ought to be no big deal so long as its not something you do on repeat. 

&#x200B;

You are supposed to judge people based on the totality of their actions, not their worst moments. I suppose if your worst moment involves physical assault or something, then yeah, we have to judge you over that moment, but this isn't remotely that. You're fine, in my opinion.
I keep my camera covered with a slider and the camera off and quadruple check I'm muted.  Tiktoks convinced me that people could see and hear me regardless.
At least they'll check your calendar next time ;)
I'm glad I'm not the only one. I did a similar thing where I screamed "what tHE FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK" and my big-ass brain thought it would be good to just deny having done it when inevitable followup questions ensued.
Ahahaha I did this but was on mute and said it loud enough that my tech who is outside my office, and was on the same call and had his line unmuted to which they heard me in the background, oh for fucks sake how many times do I need to explain this horseshit!?
Tech mutes, starts laughing.  No one said a word to me about it but noticed folks were a lot nicer to me than normal for the next few days 😅
Impulsive thoughts wanted to teach your coworker a thing or two lol
You are my hero, well done.
There’s a project on “Instructables” IIRC, it’s a little gadget based on an Arduino with a big “mute” button on it. It lights up when you’re muted to avoid tragic situations like this!
[muteme.com](http://muteme.con)

It's not inexpensive, but I would do anything to not have that happen to me. Again.
Well at least they will ALL check your calendar first from now on. 😂 

You’re fine. I yell with my RBF instead of words all the time. It happens.
This is my nightmare😳
Honestly, we are all you. We all think these things. If you could hear what everyone else says in private you wouldn’t feel so bad.
I mean... that's needed sometimes. It happens. My wife deals with shit like this. I would have told them off long ago.
It sucks it was live but it's absolutely guaranteed everyone has said  something like that
I was called out for publicly bitching about one of our vendors in the wrong place and felt really bad about it. I now feel much better because I am not you :)

Thank you for sharing lol
Buy a round of drinks at the next team outing
"April Fool's?"
One time on a frustrating call with Microsoft my sound stopped working, at which I yelled FUCK while trying to fix it. Then the chat msg came. We can hear you 😕
Oh man, this made me laugh out loud because we’ve all been there with that frustration. Sorry this happened to you! Sounds like your coworkers will be chill about it, so don’t beat yourself up over it.
I'm more recently of the mind that it's also unprofessional to stomp all over someone else's calendar. It shows a lack of consideration for the other person's time.

I've started to prioritize and callously decline (without explanation) those meetings I feel can wait.
This is not normal?
I accidentally put a snarky comment about a coworker in the team meeting chat instead of in a private chat. Got written up for “bullying”.
Outside of a very select group of immediate team members, my answer to any meeting inquiry is simply "my free busy is accurate, just invite me."  People are slowly learning.
My old boss called me once and was like hey I'm gonna put you on mute.. let me know if you hear this.. then silence. He comes back and was like did you hear that? I'm like no? You were on mute. Apparently he was in a phone conference and had his phone on mute (the light was lit red) and he ripped a fart.. then the meeting got all quiet. He thought they heard him and his mute status was broken. LOL
TBF, in this day and age, everyone should know how to use the Scheduling assistant in Outlook...
I forgot I was not on mute during a zoom presentation with my entire law firm and my husband came home and yelled “THE FUCKING RACCOONS DRAGGED NOODLES ALL OVER THE FUCKING YARD”…. I will never live it down.
Blasphemy 101
I can’t say I haven’t done this, too
I once got an email from a boss about a new assignment when I already had a very busy assignment and a ton of person stuff built around this current assignment. 

New assignment would change everything here at home, too

So, for some reason, I took that email from boss and used it as my personal to-do list. Reschedule appointments, kid stuff, all that 

For some reason I hit "send", thinking I was sending my PERSONAL notes on the situation to myself to keep for later...

Nope, you guessed it: I sent it to my boss.
I wouldn't have apologized for the swearing. Maybe for the interruption, but not for the essence of it. More honest this way. People need to check fucking calendars.
Not muting and them hearing it is embarrassing.  But as a fellow corporate drone - when setting up a meeting, the FIRST THING IS TO CHECK THE OTHER PERSON CALENDAR!  

It's simple and takes about 1 to 2 minutes
I tell people this intentionally almost every day. 

I start off nice enough. But by the 3rd time, I'm at the "Stop talking and start listening, you stupid mother fucker" stage.
You are still better off than that guy who was caught with a dildo.
a few years ago i was in a large meeting.  it was a weekly informational/training seminar to teach newer people the ropes and to pass around information to a large body.  maybe 150 people called in.  halfway through somebody cuts off the speaker by saying, "huh? nah, i'm in this dumb fukkn meeting" and you can hear their voice fade off as they walk away.  we all found it hilarious.
lol I did one of these… right at the beginning of the pandemic I was in a group meeting on Teams (small group, just 4 of us) and in the middle of talking about one of my projects my child threw a stuffed animal at me and I yelled “FUCK!” … dead silence.
Right at the start of covid during a training meeting with a bunch of coworkers we all heard what sounded like a garage door opening. Then the unmistakable sound of someone taking a huge hit from a water bong. Our lead supervisor immediately asked who it was and everyone was silent. Luckily the meeting wasn't recorded.
Without a doubt, Jesus Christ will check your calendar the day after Easter. April Fools!
At least you were t jerking iff with your camera on, like Jeff Toobin.
Been there, done that. Sucks. All you can do is apologize, move on, let it be forgotten in time.
And now you doxed your Reddit account and all comment history to everyone at your employer.
If it makes you feel better, the week before last I joined a client call on Google Meet from my phone, and when she didn’t show up I turned it off and stuck my phone in my pocket and started cleaning up the remains of my daughter’s backpack that the dog had destroyed…long story short, she heard me swearing loudly for about 30 seconds before I realized I was still in the meeting and now so was she.

Anyway, I wanted to light myself on fire, but these things do happen, and I sold the work and now I have to continue to talk to her, oh nooooo.

(But six different coworkers scheduled meetings on my calendar for my very heavily communicated PTO last Thursday-Friday and acted baffled when I told them we’d have to reschedule, so I feel you on the calendar thing.)
I mean, I was once sitting in on a training with most of the product members of my org in attendance. One guy didn’t know he wasn’t muted, and he was clearly on the phone, talking about how useless the training was… while a VP was presented. That guy is still employed. I think you’re fine. :)
One time I forgot I was sharing my screen and started searching memes to react to what someone had just said so I could send it to my coworker. Awkward...
That’s awesome that it was with decent people and the other person was understanding. I’ve been fired for less. 

Ok my camera accidentally turned on and I was lounging shirtless on the couch playing Xbox, but still…
Lolll made me think of when my old companies CEO was going on and on about some bright idea she had (honestly probably another $tupid wa$te of time), and our main engineer just let out “Jesus Christ, just shut up you old bat” on a hot mic on Teams. I did him a solid and muted him. She was talking to a room full of our employees and I think at that moment they all clapped or something, so I don’t think many people heard her except for a few of us working remotely. Funny thing is she is his ex wife so made me laugh.

I could also see him talking to his video screen after the fact so he must have been rippin her a new one.
We e all felt that
I was running a meeting of probably 60 people and one accidentally started talking about getting the divorce papers from the lawyer.
I feel fortunate that the worst I’ve done I yell at a cat (full mom voice included) while unmuted. Fortunately the people on the call laughed.
This is why I could never survive in a white collar job.  If it’s a known/common thing to have your schedule posted on a calendar your coworkers can see, and someone is pestering you about that time without having checked first?  I say your response is 100% valid and you have nothing to apologize for.
You are my hero.
I definitely whispered “oh my god I don’t fucking caaaare” directly into my mic during a meeting today. I’m the manager. Not my finest hour.
The only thing you did wrong was apologize.
Could be worse my old boss jumped into a big global meeting without his shirt on because he was wfh, we live in a tropical country and it was pretty hot that day, and he didn't think his camera was set to turn on automatically when he joined. Around 40 people, mostly women, a good chunk of which were higher up on the totem pole than him, were on the call at that time.
I bet he checks your calender from now on.
I got fired for being off camera saying on the phone I was stuck in a stupid meeting. Wasn’t connected when I was in the room. Having issues. Stepped into other room for a phone call. Came back and apparently everyone heard and I was fired next day. Jerks
We all feel this way. If any one complains about this to your manager just ask your manager to look at he fucking calendar.
Don’t make a big deal about it. It happened and everyone now knows to check your calendar - you gotta look at the bright side.
Similar fuckup today. Just saying.
Oh I’ve had a moment like that. It was my teams daily catchup (we’re scattered around the country). 

My dog was curled up next to me in his dog nest and happily snoozing. After my turn on the call and it was another guy’s turn, I knelt down beside the beast and told him “awwww who’s a good boy?”
I did this once (slightly different scenario). I was mortified, it got so quiet and then someone muted ME! So I know everyone saw my little box light up. I left the call and didn't return and then proceeded to spend too much time thinking about how to respond if anyone asked me if it was me, but no one really did.
This made me laugh so hard that I cried. Thank you. I could 100% see myself doing this.
Happened to me a couple months ago. Don’t like to think about it because I was absolutely mortified, but yup, negligent dropping of an f-bomb. Was in a Zoom meeting for work which we normally *never* use - it’s always Teams. I hadn’t used Zoom in over a year, at least (and even then it was for a group I belong to, not work). So Dumbo here didn’t realize the mic was on. Somebody was talking about a process and I muttered, “Every *fucking* time,” and DING! DING! Two chats came in on Teams from work friends yelling, “YOUR MIC IS ON!!!” Omg. Instant shock and horror. 

The dept. manager - great guy, but a real Goody Two-Shoes, WWJD bracelet-wearing type - heard me along with several others. Thankfully, *not* my direct boss who is a super-nice lady but even more uptight than the manager. I think she never would have looked the same way at me again. Trust me, the f-word has never passed her lips in her life. 

I did not get in trouble but boy, did I learn my lesson. Nothing like that happening to teach you to keep a sharp eye on the Mute button no matter what you’re doing!
I had a 1:1 with a guy who forgot he was on a video call. And proceeded to pick his nose and examine his bounty.

I reminded him his video was on.

I've never seen a dude with a dark complexion blush, but there we were.
I was a radio jock doing my show once when something royally messed up and I said a quiet "fuuuuuuuck...." to myself right in the mic. The mic I accidentally left WIDE OPEN ON AIR. To make matters worse, my show was on a relatively family-friendly station during the morning drive when little Timmy is being taken to elementary school. I potted myself down instantly and sweated getting a phone call for like a week. Thankfully the music drowned out my on-air f-bomb.
I had someone flush the toilet during a Teams meeting...
This is a FU no doubt, but it's also true that people should fucking learn to use the tools they work with and avoid spamming questions that could easily be answered by looking at an online calendar
A guy, we’ll call him Don, that I worked with at my last job told a story where he was listening in on a meeting with his phone, microphone muted. During the meeting he was having his own sidebar with himself, making sarcastic remarks and just keeping himself amused.

Someone on the meeting said something particularly dumb, Don drew the phone up to his face and yelled an expletive-laced comment about how dumb the idea was.

The meeting all of a sudden went quiet, and the speaker said, “sorry, did someone have feedback they’d like to share?”

Don double checked that the phone was still muted, but in a brief moment of terror threw his phone across the room thinking he had yelled so loud it had bypassed the mute function. The meeting continued without a hitch, he did not defeat the mute button
If it makes you feel better, I was recently in a meeting where the presenter started with "deep breathing" exercises to help us de-stress..... and someone was not muted and YELLED, "We need to take deep breaths because we all hate our fucking jobs." 

Oh, what I would have given to be a fly on the wall for the meeting that happened after that...
Maybe next time they'll try checking the fucking calendar first!
This is so relatable - get them some chocolates or a gift card or something as an apology and move on
I was on a region wide town hall meeting on Teams (about 800 people listening to a presentation from the Executive VP). At the end, I hit the side button on my headset to disconnect and then started listening to my coworker vent about the meeting. My phone kept vibrating from every time someone would drop “Thank you!” into the meeting chat. I finally got irritated and shouted, “Oh my fucking god, people! Stop fucking saying thank you! No one gives a fuck!” …and then I hear a noise come through my headset. I pulled it up from around my neck and realized that the side button had not disconnected me from the call. It had unmuted me. 

I called my boss immediately to confess, and his first response was, “I know. I was still on the call.” I just about died. He was very gracious though. The best part was that I came in for the next few days to find little printouts of the transcript taped up on my name tag, under my keyboard, in my desk drawers…sigh. 

I also had to call the head of Marcomm to give him a heads up so that he could edit the recording before it got posted on the global website. Joys.
Unlikely to be a FU. “That could be an email” is a phrase I actively encourage my employees to use out loud to keep things in check. You said what others are thinking.
This one isn’t as serious but in 2020 when everything moved to working from home we were on an annoying meeting and i SWORE i was muted but i accidentally ashed my joint on my lap and a very angry “BRUH😡” rippled through the meeting 💀💀💀. I was embarrassed.
If it makes you feel better, my friend was on a company wide zoom call and someone (who probably assumed he was muted) must’ve gone to pornhub or something because his mic picked up that ‘tired of jacking off alone?’
Fuck 'em, shoulda checked your fucking calendar.
If more people vented the way you did, fewer people would ask stupid questions they could answer for themselves. I 100% support your choice here.
I wasn’t wearing pants during the pandemic and I am 85% sure when I shifted my laptop everyone saw me in my undies sitting in bed. Whoops
Always assume you are not muted.
Such a true sentiment though. Stop messaging me to see if I'm available at x or x time. Check my fucking calendar
My colleague had a *very* distinctive voice, easily recognizable and was on a teleconference. Someone came by and asked “Who are you talking to?” My colleague belted out “a bunch of f@ck1ng idiots!” Was NOT on mute
I peed on a teams meeting with all the big wigs of my company at the time. I didn't realize until the meeting went silent and it said "you have been muted". I had put my phone in my hoodie and it apparently unmuted me. Same day I did it again and was talking to my daughter when I was muted again. I stopped putting my phone in my hoodie while I was on a meeting 🤦
I think I could top all of you on this - I was driving in my car - thought I was on mute and heard my boss on the phone talking - I looked at my wife and said - " I hate his fucking guts" - I looked at the screen on my car and immediately knew - When I got back to my desk - I had about a dozen people hitting me up saying OMG you're not on mute!... Nothing came of it - but my boss always threw shade after that - I have his job now tho :) - so I guess there is a happy ending.....
Had a buddy who liked to call ppl into his office for “huddle ups” of 3-4 ppl. Sometimes we’d have to conference in other folks. He was also notorious for playing phone games for 3 min spurts (fixing a farm or updating a clan type of thing). He was doing that and didn’t notice someone in the huddle took the phone off mute and when the gal we called offered her opinion on our discussion, without looking up from his phone, he said “ugh, what a bitch.” To which she responded, “I beg your pardon!?” There was no coming back from that. He didn’t get fired, but he wasn’t promoted for 8 years.
Honestly this isn’t a fuck up. People have access internally to calendars. Look at it. Use the resources. That is one of my biggest pet peeves.
It's all good. Now they know you ain't fucking around. 


Reminds me of this one time early in the pandemic when we had just started to work from home. Coworker asked our supervisor a question during a meeting. Pretty simple question that I immediately knew the answer to and could hear my supervisor trying to answer but she just kept on and on elaborating. Thinking I was muted, I said "for God's sake just shut up and let her answer". Got a message from another coworker laughing about how they all heard me. Never heard anything else about it lmao. 
I took a shit and flushed the toilet only to have someone tell me i wasnt muted
Same I was on a conference call years ago and they were talking about yearly revenue (which if I remember correctly was a rather good year)  and someone yelled out "than where's my fucking raise"

Update: For those asking, it was an awkard "I'm sorry did someone say something from management" response but a bunch of us in a separate office on the call all were like ohhh shhiiiiiittt
Nice save, Sean.
Once during a particularly boring uni lecture on the British empire during social distancing, all the class was fixed on the tower of highlighters that one of the students was building. Literally, it was fascinating me so much, I started recording the class on my phone to listen and take notes later.

And everyone's bubble burst when he switched from English to our language to call her out. "Hey, Y, if you're not interested, you might as well not come into class. We're not checking attendance rn."

Cue to her screen going dark. He'd startled her so much the tower had fallen down anyway.
Jesus Christ Sean its July, couldn't have come up with a better excuse?
Then your team responds; "Aren't you in Cyprus this week?"
Plot twist, it was an in person meeting!
Plot twist: it was July in California
I choked a little reading this 🤣
I'm impressed how believable the story was on the fly. Unless it was summer or he lives in Australia or something.
Ran into this once in my call center days.  I was on the phone with an irate executive, just waiting to turn his frustration with his technology on me.  I guided him through a troubleshooting step, which didn't work.  At the same time my cubicle neighbor had just done something stupid on his computer.  So I muted and said "Ha ha".  Except I actually UNmuted to say that by mistake.

Customer's point of view.  
Me: "Could you try this please?"  
Customer: \*sigh\* "Okay."  \*clickyclicky\* "Nope, that didn't do it either."  
Me: "Ha ha"  
Customer: "I beg your pardon?"

I spent about 30 seconds apologizing and indicating I'd meant the comment for someone in the room with me.  Fortunately I fixed the issue without having to escalate and make him wait for a sysadmin.
I've been doing the same for years... But just like firearm safety that one FU is enough to either do real damage or scare you to death.
Learned that in theatre/music in college. 

Every mic is hot. Always.
[deleted]
I do this but a few weeks ago I was setting up to join a job interview and it’s like well let you know when others join! Thinking it’s in a lobby or will make a noise when people do join I start reading the job info - dog starts going apeshit at the postman so I’m yelling at her to shut up cause my meetings about to start omg give it a rest you see the postman every day etc - laughter, just straight mirth comes out of my laptop speakers and lo, two people joined the meeting and it didn’t tell me!

I got the job though so it was a good ice breaker I suppose, though I spent the whole thing mortified.
I double mute via headset and Teams/Zoom/Skype/whatever because I just *know* I would be saying the most outrageous shit I'd never said before and THAT would be the time I was somehow unmuted.
I’m so glad our provided laptops have sliders to cover the camera. I don’t trust it either lol. Headset gets muted, mute on Teams, camera off, slider covering camera.
I wish everyone did this. I was in a webinar a couple years ago in the evening. This lady got up and started getting ready for bed towards the end. She walked into another room we could still see into and got down to her skivvies, started rubbing lotion all over her body, then put on a night gown. No one really knew what to do because she was clearly AFK and calling her out would’ve called attention to it for those who may not have seen it. I don’t think she ever realized jt because she came back and sat down like nothing happened. I will never forget it though, and I always quadruple check what my camera can see. 🫣
I have a “meeting buddy” on my team, we always text each other throughout like hey I have to pee I’m clearing my throat now can you hear it? Or I missed my lunch I need to eat, tell me if you hear this cough. I never trust the mute button on its own
One time our boss thought the camera was off while he scratched his belly and smelled his belly button scent.

I'm happy I have a camera cover and that I'm always careful.
My camera is off, taped over and laptop shut under my docking station. I try to check the mute light is on pretty frequently too.
I've bought a physical cover for my webcam to solve half of this.
This is true. I always treat them like everything. Last meeting I was in someone near me had a hot mic and someone said "god damn if only these network diagrams were up to date"
I cover my cameras with tape when I'm in meetings.

I refuse to be the guy whose camera turns on while I'm at home taking a shit, while I'm supposed to be at work, with 200 people watching.
Early during lockdowns I remember seeing a girl in a group meeting take her laptop to the toilet with her and put it on the ground while she did her business and everyone screamed at her to turn her camera off. The trauma is so deeply engrained, even on mute and camera off, if I have to do much as scratch my nose I move away from my laptop.
I've been gaming for years, do you guys just not use push to talk or...do you just like playing with fire?
I got so paranoid today in a call I was on. I was muted and had to cough and clear my throat a lot for a minute or two. Every single time I did so, whoever was currently talking paused until I was done. Even when I wasn’t visibly doing anything. Had me super paranoid. I kept checking that I was muted and I was. Must’ve just been weird timing.   

Whenever I mute to fart I always say something after muting to make sure nobody can hear me before I let it rip lol.
They taught us this when I was being trained at a call centre. You are never muted. You may think you’re muted, because you pushed the button, and the light is on… but who knows for sure? Technology isn’t always 100% reliable. Sometimes we’d hit mute AND unplug our headset from the phone and still be paranoid!
Double mute!!
I have my camera turned up toward my ceiling any time I'm not actively using it. One time I was asked "are you a ceiling fan today?" 😅
I have a privacy cover for my camera so that won’t cause problems by mistake - I like to take calls in my pajamas in the morning sometimes. I do generally act like muting is only going to work 90% of the time.
I was this optimistic once.
People have type my name to put in my email and yet they still typo the first letter of my name all the time after Hi xxx. So I wouldn't be so sure they will....
They’ll look and just book over an existing meeting if my own experience is any indication.
I had one guy at my last job ask me the same question every few months. I just started forwarding the previous email to him. He never got the hint.
*fucking* calendar
EVERYONE now probably got the hint, bro took one for the team lol.
Even better, maybe everyone will get the hint (and gossip it further) and check their calendar next time. 

Personally I would be grinning like a Cheshire cat if a colleague did that, and then forever afterwards suggest we could have a meeting once we'd check their fucking calendar.

"I wouldn't want to schedule something important in just before the fucking"
A friend of mine is a touring musician, and keeps his online tour date scheduled 100% accurate and updated.   Still nearly daily people are asking him via social media post replies when/where the next concert is.  
Yeah but all his buddies are going to message him to ask when he's available for the rest of his career
In fairness, I work with a lot of people who block their calendars just to get work done and aren’t necessarily booked for anything.
The problem is, half the people you work with are super buttoned up with their calendars, the other half leave theirs a total mess.

My favorite is when you book a meeting when someone appears free and they decline it saying they will be out that day. THEN MARK YOUR CALENDAR AS OUT OF OFFICE, DOOFUS!
This is actually kind of wholesome. CEO out there actually earning a portion of their paycheck
Honestly with an automatic CC transcript it's entirely possible that the bot writing the transcript caught the swear, eliminated the line, and garbled you.
Oh oh oh speaking of recorded meetings i learned the hard way to use a completely separate browser for work when remote. I was demoing a website launch on a recorded zoom call that they intended to review and as I typed up the website autocomplete from my history displayed my debauched horniness for all to see. You know, ph websites, sex toy stores etc. it happened so fast so i dont think anyone noticed but I knew it was recorded and I was terrified someone would see it in the recording.

The next 3 days before the recording was uploaded was hell. I went frame by frame and sure enough its there but only for a single frame. To this day i live in horror that its on the company servers
I've been caught rolling my eyes at someone in a meeting. 

Just the other day, my supervisor was giving me a new task to do. We both found it inane. We said goodbye and ended the meeting. 
Me: FUCK A DUCK! (Rather loudly)
Then I realized my boss hadn't left the meeting yet when she says "I agree".

I was dying.
If it *had* caught your curse word, would that have led to any repercussions on your end??
Omg thank you for the laughter 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My last manager showed up absolutely shit faced to an all hands engineering meeting. He had been struggling with sobriety for months since his divorce. Starts yelling at the VP incoherently. He was asked to leave the meeting. Mfer ke0t his job and I got laid off a mo th later.
How is that even pleasurable? Horny people are crazy.
Hah, Had a poor tier 1 support guy paste a porn URL into a teams group with 500 or so IT people in it. He deleted it in seconds but anyone who happened to be on their phone when it came in had it pop up. He wasn't looking at porn on his work computer but he was using a KVM that shared the clipboard between his work computer and his personal one. Rookie mistake. Lets just say he had a resume building event.
😂😂
Ahahaha!  I’m trying to silently laugh as everyone is asleep here and I’m not doing it well.
I really wish that Teams included a push to talk key.
Stealing that Jesus tap dancing Christ line, lol
I once yelled the vilest stuff into the WebEx void when my VPN dropped and I couldn't hear my colleagues anymore.

Turns out that the void [my colleagues] does listen.

(The way WebEy traffic is routed is weird at my company)

First thing I heard when I reconnected was "Oh God, he's back".
I'm so glad I work from home now because my entire development process involves me cursing at every minor inconvenience and flipping off my monitor a lot.
I was on a legal conference call for some sales deal once while driving.  Someone tried to merge into me and I yelled.  Loudly.  Lots of curse words.  I was not on mute

It’s my catharsis
I yelled “ow, that’s my nipple!” more than once. My cat has an uncanny ability for jumping up with her weight landing right on my nipple.
Mine has jumped up on my desk and yelled into the mic more than once, he knows what time I'm *supposed to* get off and is very upset when I have to stay on late for a meeting.
My coworkers all know exactly what my cat’s butthole looks like.
to be fair I would tell the dogs (I have two and one of them is absolutely not allowed in the room) "sit down. sit down. HEY YOU I KNOW YOU KNOW IM CALLING YOU OUT TO SIT DOWN" in middle of a meeting.
I was calling a customer one day while working at home. Of course, that was when my cat decided to scream bloody murder because she wants to be pet. We ended up laughing about pets and he bought. He's become a pretty good repeat guy now, even.
New work besties lmao
…and today i learned that muting other people is not anonymous! guess i should stop handing out mutes so frequently 😶
this is hilarious...I would die laughing if I heard someone start doing that in a meeting haha
🤣 this is hilarious
i used to play thumb piano under my desk muted on zoom calls to help w the tedium
😂😂😂
You're my hero. I would have thought about it (seriously one of my favorite gifs). But I would not have msg it.
Love it. At 32 and at a smaller company now I’ve started to get very bold with gif usage. Dropped the Zoolander “merman” one during a 30 person call the other week.
You spelled your own Reddit username wrong. In the spirit of this thread, you better own that shit.
I remember being this optimistic once, before corporate drones ruined me.
I do that. I block off 2 hours in the morning from 8-10, one hour from 1-2, and then 3:30-5. Those are the times that I need to get shit done and eat lunch. The only people who know that they are just blockers are my immediate team and my manager.  
I also block Friday's from 2-5. Under no circumstance should I be in a meeting on a Friday afternoon when any work on something will be waiting until the new week. I'm either wrapping up that week's worth of work or I'm in "read only" mode and will not be doing actual work.
Yeah, hate that. At least some of them put them as “Focus time” or set them to public with a informative title.
In defense of your workmates, I ignore meetings that double book because I’m actually pretty good at prioritizing my own time.
This has become a thing at my company and makes scheduling meetings IMPOSSIBLE. It's really so frustrating.
Yeah, we've had to make a specific rule about that. I try to work with peoples calendars when I need to meet with them, but if they just block off every free moment they have then I'm booking over it.
I had the opposite issue. I would set a whole day event in outlook to show whether I was working from home or working in the office and I set the statuses as 'working elsewhere' and 'free' respectively but one of my co-workers just thought that I was busy so would always have to ask me when to schedule meetings for until I figured out that they didn't know/couldn't easily see the differences in status. To be fair we have both worked for the past 20 years and it's only been recently that you could set a 'working where' status.
I think depending on the invite, a message is fine as just an fyi what it’s about , especially if it’s something new or unexpected- however you can also just make the meeting invite description enough so people will know what it is about.
Really dependent on industry and office. If I just scheduled a meeting with my coworkers/boss without asking them first, they'd think I had lost my mind.
My guess is it depends on the culture. 

Where I worked before I always used the scheduler, we worked on site, lots of people had 5-6 weekly meetings with different teams so it was a nightmare trying to get more than 5 people free at the same time. 

Where I work now, I’ve never used it, we work remote, with very flexible schedules, I always ask because people always forget to block times for when they have a doctors appointment or a kids school function and they won’t go to a meeting but will always answer you even if it’s to tell you “I’m out now, I’ll give you a call when I’m back”
I had issues where I tried to schedule a meeting with a coworker, and their calendar never matches their real availability. I try to send a message saying I would like to meet about ABC. I’ve checked your calendar and I see X&Y times free. Which is better for you?
Don't make them do the legwork of checking calendars if you're junior/asking for a favour.

Message:  
 \- Hi, can we talk about {x}, I want {check y/ get outcome z}  
 \- Think it will take about {time}  
 \- Looks like we are both free {some times} can I book a meeting?  


It's just disrespectful to ask for a meeting in the middle of a period when they are already booked, or ask them to act like your secretary and verify + work around your schedule.
Just include those details in the meeting invitation and you'll be fine. Doesn't need to be separate. 
I appreciate getting a heads up. My calendar's fairly accurate, but just because I have open time slots doesn't mean I necessarily _want_ meetings there. If we're lucky, maybe what you want a meeting about is something I have documentation about already so we can skip the meeting, or have a shorter meeting, or whatever.  

I'd rather be asked one time too many than one time too few, _especially_ if you try to squeeze a meeting in at 8 am, 4 pm, or over lunch.
I hate when people ask me when I am free then I waste 5 minutes digging through my calendar and trying to find a time that also works for them. The only time I find this acceptable is if we are setting up a reoccurring group meeting and we are planning it on a project call together.


My entire day is basically meetings. I have no idea when I am free. Just look at my calendar and make the meeting invite title / description informative enough and I'll be there - if the time doesn't work for me I'll propose a new one
A quick "hey do you have time tomorrow afternoon to go over X?" is fine, but "can we have a meeting tomorrow at 3:15 to talk about X?" means I have to pull up my calendar and go back and forth over times. Cold invites only bother me when there's no details about what the fuck the meeting is about.
Honestly, this is only polite if you don't have access to my calendar. Otherwise, you introduce a whole extra email/step/response to the process and the last thing I need is another email. The whole point of being able to access the calendar is to be able to save time in booking meetings.
Remember, this is reddit, home of the misanthropes. I wouldnt second guess your professional approach if it's been working for you.
Yeah the last couple places I’ve worked everyone is a “just check my calendar” person, which kind of annoys me. Not everyone knows how you work and schedule your time, I’d rather just hear it from you.
It really depends for me.  If the person has lots of gaps in their calendar I'll use that and count on them to request an alternate time if they don't like it.

But sometimes I deal with someone who's entire calendar is blacked out for weeks at a time, and the only way to get time with them is to ask.
Yep - my calendar is meticulously maintained so I can avoid these convos.
how'd it go
I’m the executive assistant to the head honcho of my job.  I rarely use the scheduling assistant.  I could use it more, but honestly, I’m almost always on a hurry and it’s easier for me to just ask on teams.  Most of the time it’s me saying “hey, big man has these two times free.  Pick one!” Regardless of your schedule.  Sorry, you gotta move your shit around if you are busy and I don’t care.  If my boss says “I need to speak with Raven this afternoon”, then you will be redoing your calendar to make it happen.

However, I hate just demanding people change to my whims and I will reach out to see what time is best to try to minimize the disruption to your schedule.  

But when someone tells me to check the scheduling assistant I will just invite you at the best time for the director and you can figure it out.
I have customers at work (I'm in IT) do this way more often than you'd expect. The worst part is *they're* calling me, so they chose that time and place.
ha, i just posted a similar story. i feel your pain!
Oh, I feel this!  I'm a lawyer who decided to go back to grad school to get an MLIS for when the corporate world is done with me (people tend to expect their librarians to be old ladies).  

So last time I was in class, I was in law school where the professors are trying to trip you up, so you have to be prepared.  We had reading that was required to be done and discussed on the first day of class.

So back in my first few classes of library grad school and the other students, mostly new college grads looking to put off adulting for a little while longer, keep asking the teacher basic questions to the point I'm thinking to myself, "Read the g-dd-mn syllabus!"
Haha. I sing to my dogs when I am alone; telling them how much I love them.
oh man, this one got me😂
ugh, those open blocks that are only somewhat taken should be marked as Free not busy.
The dreaded opening "Hi".  Just say what you want and stop wasting my time dammit!
That's on them to reject the invite with a new proposed time if they're not actually available when their calendar says they are. And too many people will look at my calendar after I've told them to book around my availability, and then ask me if an available time is ok instead of just sending the invite.
I need that for screen sharing
Yep, and I'm living it so you don't have to! Always check your mute status.
“Sorry, uhhh I was waiting on a pizza from Ray’s and it’s super late, my bad.”

“Bro, it’s 9:45 in the morning.”
Did they get an answer?
We had a good one in a meeting with over 100 people from our business unit where a guy was taking a leak and you could very clearly hear his stream hitting center bowl as he was moaning in relief. My boss was presenting and stopped mid sentence and said, "Ummm...I think someone accidentally came off mute." We could all see Mike's name highlighted (off camera fortunately) indicating that he was the one from where the noise was originating. My boss started scrambling and saying, "Mike, you're off mute. Do you want to mute yourself?" And in response we just heard tinkling and Mike going "Ahhhhhh." After what felt like a really long time, it finally stopped and my boss started talking again and Mike's stream started back full blast like Austin Powers. His demeanor cracked and he started laughing then presumably one of the meeting organizers had the presence of mind to mute Mike.

A little while later, presumably after he saw a plethora of texts and Teams chat messages from people trying to save him, Mike commented on the meeting chat and said, "Sorry about that everyone. I was watering my plants and emptying the rest of the water from the watering can into the toilet."

Someone in the chat replied, "I'm not a doctor but I think your watering can should get its prostate checked."
The CEO’s paycheck.
Sorry but the money has been earmarked for stock buybacks 😋

We will be sending out recognition awards that will show up on your team profile instead!
What a boss.
"than where's my fucking raise your glass speech for how happy the shareholders are gonna be, right guys?!"
That's kind of a dick move on the teacher's part. You can stack stationary and still listen. Not to diagnose a random kid in a random comment over the internet, but that sounds like an ADHD thing to do. Teachers used to throw a fit when I doodled in class, but if I ever stopped, my brain just started talking over them and then I couldn't pay any attention at all.
I can listen and tower build!
We're in Australia!
Negligent discharge of an F bomb.
During one of our team meetings, one of my coworkers thought her mic was live but she was actually muted. She turned her mic ON and let a big fart rip.
My brother nearly shot me in the face when he was waving around an "unloaded" gun. I had asked him to stop being so careless with it, he replied "It's not loaded, see?"  Pointed it at my face and pulled the trigger.  Bullet left the barest mark on my ear, hit the wall beside my face.
Lol very true
I’ve been on so many meetings with people who have forgotten their mic is hot and have let some wild outburst fly. If they are indeed a group of decent people, I guarantee you will be reminded of this at some point in the not too distant future accompanied by laughs. In my teams, these have become fondly remembered fodder for jokes
Well it would also help to get out of the habit of extreme overreacting, even in private.
That one is a series of fuckups that never had mute off.

The amount of times I say stuff out loud and panic that mute might be off is the main reason I make sure if I notice someone’s is on I let them know.
Even the one in your pocket. *puts on tinfoil*
About a month ago I witnessed the funniest HS play hot mic I've ever seen. Scenes change, dialog rolling,...is that running wate....r.... oh no.... not that.. peeing while on a hot mic! Everyone was super mature except me (40's) who can't stop giggling.  My wife asks me after I get it together somewhat "can you tell by the splash if it was a boy or a girl?" I lost it and got hushed by a lady behind us..
If for no other reason than that your theatre tech friends knew who gossiped when off stage and we were *definitely* listening.
Me: *no Zoom cam, wireless earpiece, on mute taking a shit*
You guys are wearing underwear on Teams calls?
I mute teams, mite the headset and take off the mic. And I'm still paranoid
I mean, they got to see you handle a stressful situation, it might have worked in your favor!
I just use a mic that is detachable, pull that fucker right off with certainty that no one will hear you.  

Unless you're on a laptop/tablet and it auto-switches to the laptop/tablet microphone, but it should ask you before doing something like that.
I bought a ton of cheap sticky slider things and put them on EVERY laptop I use. I may be paranoid, but I just don't believe that the camera is **only** capturing me when the light is on!
And maybe a post-it over the slider…
I was helping organize one where something similar happened. Guy was clearly in bed, thankfully covered and stayed that way though. We were hovering over the "kick" button in case something inappropriate started happening lol
I work on a small team, several of us will fire a "hot mic" or "cam on" message if we suspect someone is unaware.  We often have meetings with other departments, who manage to ask stupid questions.  It has saved us a few times.
That’s a good plan
I’m such a child, I cannot stop laughing at this
Even with a scheduling assistant that shows all parties availability, people still screw it up
How often do you think about the many people you’ve made attempt to wipe or blow away a hair from their screen?
Love the profile pic
Your profile pic is evil. 🤣
People will still misspell my name in a slack thread, with my name in it, after tagging me which has my name in it. I don't have a hard name either (it's basically John vs Jon)
Do you have a particularly challenging first letter? Something like a thorn? Just
... How? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter)
I once saw an excel sheet where my last name was written in 3 different ways. One day I'm just going to say that if it's not my correct name, it's just not me who is responsible for the action.
These people are the spawn of satan and immediately go to the bottom.of my to do list... unless they sign my pay cheque 
Lol I had some guy I didn't recognise come ask me for something. Seemed to know who I was and everything. In office so no actual clues like a user name or something I could search while pretending I knew who it was. 

Turns out he had been there 6 months and we simply never crossed paths, he was even about to leave and needed my help with x thing to finish the project..


Still no idea what his name was, sure I had to ask figuring they were new which was when I found this out...
https://xkcd.com/90/
And actually apologising, too
It has to be a start up
Nope, I of course also listened to the recording to make sure and it is really hard to hear because another person was speaking at the same time.
Seems like you made a whole bunch of rookie mistakes there:

Using the same browser for work as for play

Not insisting on a company laptop

Not using an entirely different user profile if a company laptop isn't an option

Not using incognito mode
ph websites? The nerd in me is automatically going to, "education about pH balance" but I'm not sure if that's what you actually meant, lol.

Edit: WAIT
Always set up a separate browser profile for work, if you can! If not, use completely different browsers for work/personal use!
i did the same thing while trying to show a pinterest board. instead of typing "pi" into the search bar, i typed "po", and before i caught it... i clicked enter to take me to the autofilled site. i have never pressed the back button so quickly.

thank god that zoom call wasnt recorded though. it lives on, only in their memories.
I purposely do eye tools, grimace, deep breath, etc. versus actual words. Gets the point across in a non-verbal manner.
>Mfer ke0t his job and I got laid off a mo th later.

Did you take up drinking too?
He was around when they buried the bodies, poor timing on your part
Danger wank.
Could be a joke.

I say stuff like "hang on have to put my pants on first" when I'm going somewhere...even when I already have pants on.
I believe it’s the space bar?
I had to scroll way too far before someone found that as funny as I did lolol
I knew that IVRs do, didn’t know about that. That sucks.
Sounds like he has your back! 🤣
I feel like this is way more common than we think
Haha did everyone respond and say, I am sitting!
It's anonymous enough depending on how many people are on the call lol
I’ve purposely disconnected someone twice on the same call bc he wouldn’t stop blabbing nonsense speculation to the auditors. FWIW, I’m also an auditor.
Lol. I keep thinking I should start another account just for my F Ups. There's so many. I'll add it to the list.
>I also block Friday's from 2-5

That's actually pretty smart. To some, it might seem like skiving-off on a Friday afternoon, trying to avoid work... But actually, it ensures the week's work is wrapped up, *and* minimises opportunities for anything new landing on your plate - *that would have to wait til Monday anyway*; details of which would likely end up being forgotten (or worse, worked-on!) over the weekend.

Thanks for the tip - I'm gonna try this! :)
Also there are some meetings I can definitely miss if needed. Like sometimes a meeting is good for me to be in to be kept up to speed but it isn't vital and I can get a rundown after. So if there is a more important thing like talking with a client that needs to happen at a certain time because that's the only time they are free I can skip the other meeting, a quick message "hey is it possible to meet at 9AM on Tuesday for this? Looks like it's currently blocked off." is totally acceptable IMO.
Right, or ping them saying "I have some questions about xxxyyy, can I set up a meeting"
Geez, that’s rough.
This is very useful and nuanced. Thank you.
YES and this is exactly why I reach out directly. I don't want to just say "hey please get on this call at this time for this reason". I want to give a very clear opportunity for the person to tell me if I'm asking the wrong person, if the timing doesn't make sense or any other reason my approach should be different.
That is what 'Propose New Time' is for ! And you can always add a block/self meeting for those times you don't want.
The vendor got their asses ripped by the site CIO for wasting our time, so it was a rare victory.
I believe the appropriate reddit response is "he dead"
LOL yes I report to the Director and her assistant does the same - totally get it. She’s not gonna get a “check my calendar” from me. But in most other cases it is not a fair assumption that I will shift my schedule for another meeting - if it conflicts, I will decline your invitation. And why not use the tech as intended? If they can’t find a time that works and it’s important, then they can email me and ask me to clear something.
No it's totally cool if you're the one telling and suggesting time availability. Imo you're doing it right.

It's when it's an open ended "whatever time works for you" or "what are your open times" messages that boils my blood. If you have to ask when I'm available then use my calendar.
Exec assistant here too. I never use this function, because no one seems to actually keep their calendar accurate or updated. Most of the people I am setting up meetings with are technologically illiterate (why I have a job in the first place tbh).
Yeah, this is reality when trying to schedule meetings with senior folks at my org. Scheduling assistant only helps if by some miracle everyone is showing free. Otherwise, it’s “pick between these two slots if you want to attend, regardless of what you already have scheduled”. Absolute worst part of my job.
That's both gross and disrespectful.
I've had people keep replying with how about x time when I have already said my calendar is up to date. If I tell someone my calendar is up to date, I make sure that's a true statement. Then they tell me I can't see your calendar. That sounds like a you problem and a company problem that you are unable to use the basic tools for the job, not a me problem.
Yeah it’s a breakfast pizza, supposed to be here at breakfast time!
They raised him a pink slip.
that's amazing
Never forget that you can mute other people. You can't unmute them, but you can mute them. (Teams)
Spot on.
Plus, we have a El Chepo pizza party for the  6PM Mandatory meeting to discuss the plummeting moral of the story the worker bees.
It’s not just about the one student though. Teachers are responsible for the class. Going off what the redditor above said 

> all the class was fixed on the tower of highlighters that one of the students was building

The class was distracted. She did it in camera view, it’s not like she was undistractingly doodling. Maybe teachers need a better way to navigate ADHD/ADD situations and call them out differently, I won’t argue that.
Stationery. The tower fell, so it wasn't stationary.
I just swear like normal in all of my conversations at work. I e never given a single fuck.
She got the worst of both worlds.
Your brother sounds like somebody who should never be trusted with guns.
I once knew a guy that did this to his best friend. Goofing about with an “unloaded” gun and pulled the trigger after aiming at his friend. It wasn’t unloaded. His friend died.

My father took me to gun safety school when I was 14-15, specifically so I’d learn how to handle a gun, know proper safety, and have exposure shooting a few. The primary intent was so that I’d know what to do if a friend of mine started waving about or showing off a gun.
As harsh as it is true. It’s not that we shouldn’t have those emotions, it’s that we need to understand the periods of our day-to-day that we must mute those emotions and deal with them at a later, more appropriate time. While I don’t practice it myself, I hear journaling is a good outlet.
Especially the one in your pocket.
*Hopefully* on mute :)
Right? Buncha crazies. You and I are the only normal people doing them completely nude
Okay Rockefeller, some of us can only afford underwear for our calls on Google Meet and not the meetings on Teams too. Have a bit of sensitivity.
Loller
You guys own underwear?
Hello, fellow kids.
THIS! HOLY SHIT! "Are you available X time?" I don't know Donna, did you use the scheduling assistant that will SHOW YOU my calendar and let you know if I can listen to your inane prattling?
A lot of people keep old shit on their calendars and never clean it up, or have time blocked off because of other people (at one point I had my entire Monday blocked off because someone sent out a reminder for timesheet approval and made it an all-day event), or have meetings that can be moved. It’s frequently difficult to find a time that works for more than like 4-5 people without having to start asking people if they can move things around or how important certain meeting a are.
I have a boss who refuses to either look at the calender or accept other people's invtiations if it doesn't involve one of his cases.  I've told him - repeatedly - to accept all invites even if they're not about you.  

Why?  Because he'll schedule things with clients for the conference room we all share without realizing someone else has already booked the room.  

He never frigging listens.  I've been telling him this for years now.
It must be nice to work at y'all's companies where people's calendars don't get filled up with crap they have no intention of ever attending.
You can add me to the list of victims.
I see it as a graph of their optimism over time.
John over here, I get called Jon every now and then which is annoying but not unexpected. The amount of times I get called Jake or Jeff by people is truly surprising. It's not even close.
Paht instead of pat?
I get that too in emails. I always sign my emails as well. It drives me nuts. I have a name that can be spelt two different ways with one letter difference. Sooo many times it's spelt the wrong way, even though they just read an email signed with the correct name. My email address also has my name in it. Why? My favourite is when they combine the two spellings. Who tf has ever spelt it that way?
It's a Y, gets replaced by an I by most english peeps
Not really. Sometimes there's this super weird dip where the actual upper management is nice, the regulars are nice, and the middle management are insufferable POS. 

I worked for a big company and our team manager, a guy in the middlest position possible with zero chance of further promotion (because in that particular company that was as high as a position possible for an IT lead) was super petty and even though multiple people told us that there's clearly defined guidelines for dress code and I fit them 100%, I should shave off my mohawk, remove beard, and wear a tie - and he insisted it wasn't coming from him, it was coming from CEO, and this CEO guy is brutal and will fire me on the spot if he ever sees me like this. 

Well I was fed up with  headbutting him and that team and emailed CEO directly as he was the one I was "scared with". 

THREE minutes later I get a call on the intercom and I see the name and number and I'm like "Oh I am royally screwed" 

I pick up the phone and he's like "Winjin, right? You're the guy with, like, a short mohawk? Who told you that I hate it? I love it! If I were forty years younger I'd wear something like that! Wait, don't tell me, I know who said that. Well trust me, I've seen you many times running around the office and if I had something to say, I'd tell you personally. Our guidelines are against outrageous hair and if you promise not to grow it out into neon pink spikes, I'd say we're cool" and it was... just a normal conversation?! with a CEO running an office the size of a small city?! (if we use the US definition of a "small city" between 1500 and 5000 people, as this was a 4000 people company) versus a manager with like 25 people under him? 

And the same went for most of the management, directors, and partners. The nicer the person is, the bigger is the chance it's a managing director or a partner. If he looks at you like you're trash, that's some junior manager or, funny enough, a recent promotion from an intern. These were also insufferable for some reason, often thinking they're above IT engineers in company grade (thing military rank) and paygrade. 

And it was wrong for both.
I setup hyper-v and run a fully separate VM for work.
I just use edge for work and chrome for play, easy fix.
Chrome for work and Firefox for everything else.
Or perhaps had a stroke?
Ctrl + space bar
WebEx is spacebar
First time I used that button I thought it would only mute the audio on my end. Found out the hard way when I muted my prof during a lecture during covid 😂
Luckily he never knew it was me lol
I do think you already had the important part down though -- giving context for the meeting you want to have and why.


If possible, sending material for the meeting ahead of time and/or starting the meeting with background info for 2 mins is incredibly helpful.  But it does help if you are in company has a good culture around efficient meetings. A fucknut Manager might not understand or appreciate that such meeting prep is efficient and instead think it is wasteful.
Who actually *wants* to attend meetings?
I would absolutely give this guy a Ray's.
Goddamn you, Toastyy1990, now I want a breakfast pizza.

Who folded?
To be fair, if the lecture is boring enough that most of the class somehow ended up looking at a screen of one person stacking highlighters, then the lecturer needs to improve their skill in delivering lectures.
but also if it's a zoom class how tf can you tell what all the other students are looking at? There's no way for the prof to actually tell that it's actually distracting the class
Yes, but sending the student away was not the only answer. For example, ask for camera off.

In fact, camera off is, more broadly, a really great tactic for supporting neurodivergents, even outside this particular example.
Ha ha. Me too. I swear like a sailor at work. I was just rolling on, talking to my boss, dropped the f bomb, and was like, "Umm, sorry. I apologize for my language." His response was to roll his eyes and smirk and tell me, "I gave up on you policing your language a very long time ago." So I took that as tacit permission and give zero fucks now.
I sang that in Hannah Montana’s voice.
The full story is very specific so I'll refrain but he did something spectacularly stupid, well, several things, and had his guns taken away.
But…but his 2nd amendment rights!

Ppl like his bro and all the other “responsible” gun owners who were responsible until the moment they weren’t are exactly the problem. There are way too fucking many of them. Bring on the downvotes!
Man, fuck that. I'm not bringing that mess home to my family to be dealt with. If a little venting here and there gets it out, especially in private, then that's a far better option.

ASSERT DOMINANCE
I frequently take teams meetings on the toilet...
oh my God the person who never checks peoples availability at my workplace is called Donna lmao
Reminds me of when I had to block out time for lunch on my own calendar.  Someone would schedule meetings for 12:00 because “that’s the only time everyone is free” Yeah, cause it’s LUNCH.
As someone who schedules a lot of meetings, this isn’t unreasonable behavior actually. I used to use people’s calendars when scheduling something, but probably 75% of the time they come back and say they’re not actually free during that time so I don’t even bother anymore. Now I just ask.
You haven't shared your calendar with me, so all I see is 1 monolithic 9 hour wide "busy" from 9 am to 5 pm every day for every day on your calendar for the next 2 years, and then, interspersed, at least 6 1/2 hour "busy" events, and overlapping against 5 1 hour "busy" events on your calendar. So...yes, I did check your calendar.  And you have set office hours, so I can't request a meeting before 9 am or after 5 pm. So, once again, I'm asking you, can you meet with the team at this time?
WOAH WOAH WOAH! Stop the clock. If we're talking about **Donna Sue**, she can interrupt me anytime she wants for an impromptu meeting. I will always make the time of day for that sweet, southern belle.
"Please let me know your availability next week"

I usually respond with a simple "My calendar's up to date, so anything that shows as free I can do."
I have a coworker who schedules meetings during my PTO constantly. My calendar is up to date. Every flippin time I have to request some other time.
I've worked with people who struggled with forwarding a message, the schedule assistant I think would be incomprehensible hieroglyphics to them.
The solution is just refusing to answer that question, you just actually say "check my scheduling assistant" every single time..

Eventually people will understand that you will waste their time if they waste yours and just go straight to the assistant instead.
Seriously. And don’t ask me to set up time with you if YOU want the meeting. 
Me: I’m available to meet any day except Tuesday. 

Them: Ok, let’s meet on Tuesday.
Yeaaa true but people block their agenda full with self-work and you have no idea sometimes when you can plan a meeting
😅😅😅😅
Yeah, not advocating for idiots... but any time I've used the scheduling assistant I'll end up with suggestions for times months in the future, well after specific projects have closed and deadlines have passed. 

So no matter what I do I'll end up asking at least one person if they can meet at specific times when I know they already have something on their calendar at that time. My hope is that whatever they have on their calendar (it's typically not shared with me) is something they can move/reschedule/cancel. If not, then I'll end up asking a different group of people the same question, just so that I can have my meetings before the end of the century.  

If not, then clearly management didn't stress this particular project/issue enough, and if/when it fails (and/or continues to happen, depending on what "it" actually is) my thoughts are it's on management, not me.
my company sends out trainings for very specific departments to EVERYONE so often my calendar is filled with inane trainings that have nothing to do with me and i don't catch the email invite quick enough.
I'm gonna say that's not on your boss. If people book the room in an invite then it doesn't matter who gets it, the room should show booked. I've worked at multiple places that use teams., sending an invite to everyone would be a mess. So Teams marks the room as used (it links with Zoom too). This is on whoever setup the calendar for your company or people not booking the room as part of the meeting.
Our meeting rooms all have their own accounts/calendars. No chance of getting double booked. I don't know exactly how it works, but each meeting room has a tablet on the wall next to the door, showing the room's calendar for the day. When booking meetings, people add all the attendees *and* the room to it, which then adds it to the room's door tablet.

Which was handy for me. When I had my 121 with my line manager in the CEOs office, I forgot entirely what time it was, but I had a look on the way past the CEOs office. Unfortunately my line manager wasn't refined enough to include any details other than 'Rayne' on the meeting. So naturally, the CEOs office just had my name next to the door in between 'available' that day.
Create a conference room calendar.

 Don't ask him to put all that shit on his own calendar 😂
Sounds like you want to set the room to reject conflicting meetings..
Oh I get invited to a lot of crap and just decline the invites. If I'm really needed, they'll ask why I declined lol
And me
I've fucking had people argue with me that my name had to be short for Jonathan.  I want my H dammit.
This is like the person that constantly inputs my email as his own on everything he signs up for. I feel for you. I know everything about this dude's life. The type of car he owns, the stores he shops at, what takeout he enjoys, all of it, because I get his stupid emails.

Kenneth, if you're out there, I hate your face. Stop using my email just because we share the same first initial and last name.
>!Ysolde?!<
I was more going by the fact that the CEO and IT guy are working in the same room
He was dedicated to hitting submit for reddit, bless him
Why would they make it 2 keys???? Lol
Who still uses WebEx?? (other than Cisco themselves)
Generally, the self-important ones
I'm a lecturer. I put a lot of effort into making my lectures engaging (and my student feedback reflects that) - but some material is just incredibly dry, and you can't save that. We're not performance artists.
I think people forget that professors aren’t all brand new and all of them have also been students before. It’s pretty easy to tell what is a class distraction.
You mean besides almost headshotting you at point blank?
But not soon enough.
I hope no one got hurt during said stupid event ❤️
Every gun owner knows another gun owner who they who they wish wasn’t allowed to own guns.  Guys who have been through all the safety courses, have passed every licensing test, acquired the proper permits, passed the background checks never raised a single red flag, yet they should never under any circumstances be handed a loaded firearm. Because the minute a gun is in their hand, every single brain cell they have decides to go on lunch break and the “do something stupid” switch gets flipped.
I said appropriate time, my man. In front of your family isn’t an appropriate time, that’s just a different time. So yea, a private, controlled space is what you’re looking for. Therapy, for example.
i am doing a gig job talking to the robots.  5 bucks for an hour of dedication to Roko.  i am just stacking it all in as soon as i  can so i  get the best view from my nutrient protein cocoon.

This thread has caused me to reevaluate my methods. I've always felt that sending someone a note explaining why I'm asking them to a meeting and asking whether the time works for them is more courteous, but it turns out that doing so annoys everyone.
I get that all the time. So either don't turn up (because Lunch) or show up and eat my lunch loudly not on mute to make a point
Had to block morning, lunch and evenings or I'd get meetings scheduled when I'm sleeping.
I get scheduled for noon meetings all the time.  Some days I’m in meetings back to back from like 10:00 on without a break and I hate it.
I have to block lunch off because the rest of my team is in a different time zone, and while I'm super cognizant of their lunchtime when I am scheduling meetings, they seem to give zero fucks about my lunchtime.
That's their fault.  Seems like it would be helpful if that company culture could be changed.  I'd keep scheduling meetings during those times and "forget" to read emails or IMs that they couldn't make it at that time.
100% accurate. All these people complaining obviously don't have to schedule a lot of meetings.
This! It will say they are free and when you request the time they announce they are no longer free at that time and just haven’t put it in the calendar/ don’t use the company calendar
That’s so fucking irritating. EVERYTHING is on my damn calendar, including times when I’ll be out due to a Dr appointment or whatever. I’d never be able to keep my life straight otherwise.
Yes! This person has been asked to set up meetings in impossible circumstances
No, we are talking about Donna Jo. The one who cut the cord to her mouse to make it "wireless" and then complained when it stopped working.
I’ve found that are usually asking/saying that bc they want to know if you have vacation scheduled. 

Sometimes people don’t put it in their calendars until late.
You don’t have to acknowledge the rejection (don’t ask me how I know - fuckers I booked this room 3 months ago and we have a 200lb chassis cracked open on the table, pound sand on your training class). 
This shit happens to you too? My name is John and I've had people argue with me over my own name saying it's short for "Jonathan"!? No, the fuck it isn't. Has been with me my whole life.
Bruh it's time to use your email to reset the passwords of those accounts.
Same, Eveonna and Ernest both need to figure out wtf their own emails are.
Oh.

Ohhhhh!! 

Damn I missed that competely. Yeah it makes sense
So that you don't accidentally press it and say something embarrassing like "Jesus tap dancing Christ, leave me the fuck alone for once" during a call
The education department here invested heavily in it buying every school in the district 2 large WebEx tvs and a portable sized one. Naturally the portable one sits in the store room and the WebEx TV's are just used by staff to connect their laptop over HDMI and everyone uses Teams for their meetings which the education department has included as part of the 365 enterprise license we all get.
At least one multi billion dollar per year company haha
I have a friend, a PhD who is just too into guns, anxious and too into impressing people.
We have a mutual friend who is in the FBI.

The FBI guy and myself have an explicit agreement if the three of us are ever in a situation where someone is doing a robbery etc, our first move is to knock out the PhD before he tries to intervene and gets everyone killed.
>Therapy, for example.


Yes, $200 therapy session every single day to vent. Brilliant! 



Be realistic. Nothing wrong with a little rant or sarcastic comment that you intend to keep to yourself. Yeah, it may suck on the very rare occasion someone overhears it, but that's life. There is nothing truly problematic or unhealthy about it. A muted microphone while in your office is enough of a private, controlled space to be fine.
🙈🙈🙈😂
I like to schedule it but give permissions for others to change the time. Then I send a note like "fyi I scheduled the project sync for 3:30 today, but feel free to move it if needed! Just needs to happen by Tuesday morning"

Ofc only works if you trust your coworkers not to move it without checking others' calendars...
If there truly is no common time everyone can meet when you look at scheduling assistant then it’s okay to schedule for when most people are available and say “ hey, this is the time most people can make the X Project meeting. If you can’t make it, we’ll send you meeting notes.” Sometimes you can’t accommodate everyone, but it’s rude to just schedule for a time that works for you and then expect everyone else to change their schedules.
Yes for sure. Book the time and explain in the notes part of the invite what you’re trying to accomplish or better yet, include an agenda. Then let them accept or decline or reschedule.
I like to include all of that in the invite that's sent.

Just a nice little point-form agenda, and a few lines explaining that Yo dude I snooped through your calendar and this looks good, but if it's actually fucked let me know and we'll reschedule.  Gets the job done, but also the agenda reminds people of why we're having a meeting at all. Because people forget. Shit, *I* forget :)

If a client is involved, though, it all happens in emails just as you're describing, and I don't schedule shit until every detail is confirmed for all.
I've had good success by starting with the scheduling assistant, then a quick IM with key people to confirm that the opening I see is indeed a good time, then sending the invite.

Only exception is if I have to call an extra-bigass meeting with lots of invitees. Then I just find the time that fits the most for at least the highest ranking people.
I think what you do works since you're actually checking their calendar (you are right?), as long as you don't book for a time that's clearly not ok for them.
Depends really, a quick "you free to talk about X tomorrow afternoon?" is fine, but "are you free at 3:15 to talk about X?" is too specific. Yes I have time tomorrow, but I don't want to have to check my calendar and go back and forth over times when you can see my availability. 

Really thought, I'm fine with just getting a meeting invite. Especially if we've already been having discussions about the topic.
I like to eat soup in forced lunch meetings, the clanging of the spoon, the slurping of the soup, it’s just a beautiful cacophony designed to make them regret stealing my lunch 30 mins
If someone did that to me, I wouldn't care because I just wouldn't show up lol
No, these people despite being college educated are dumb as fuck and just don't know how to use Outlook scheduling.  They're just dumbasses.
I've cancelled low impact things like door dash orders. I had a chance to cancel their airline tickets once but chose not to because I thought about how they wouldn't know until they got to the airport since they wouldn't get the email confirmation.


But a lot of them are things that don't have accounts. They're reminder emails for appointments or some shit.
At some point you'd think they'd be like "why don't I ever get these emails?"
Lol. Happens to the best of us
Exactly. Ever since Teams took off and is included in O365 that most orgs already pay for, I feel like most people have canceled WebEx and either use Teams or maybe Zoom if they want more features or a better experience.
I send them an email before I look at their availability, telling them I'll be sending out an invite shortly. I also write in the same email to feel free to suggest other times. It's called common courtesy people!
This, this, a thousand times this. __Please__ put in your meeting invite what the meeting is about / what you are intending to achieve / why you want people to attend. Don't make people guess why you're taking up an hour of their time.
THIS! For the love of Dog! Include a freaking agenda so I know if I need to prep for the meeting. I hate nothing more than showing up to a meeting and having questions asked of me that I wasn't aware I needed to provide answers for. I can HEAR people rolling their eyes while I bumble about trying to scurry up answers in a hurry.  I'm not a mind reader!
it might be they don't want the emails and think of this guy as the junkmail box.
Please don't be that person, just put it in the meeting description box as that's included in the email. If they want to reschedule they'll write you back.
That’s called extra work.
Also if your org requires you to attribute all time spent at work to charge codes on your timecard include the charge code!
Well then they're monsters.
TIFU by getting caught with a dildo up my ass
I (M29) have been with my girlfriend (F27) for four years, living together for two. We have a pretty good sex life, but there are some things I want that she doesn’t. Since this is an alt account I’ll just say it: sometimes I like being pegged. I told her this exactly once about six months into our relationship. At first she thought I was joking and just laughed at me, when she realized I was serious she said it was weird and gross, and had absolutely no interest in it. I haven’t mentioned it since. 

I still have an old dildo from a past relationship. (My ex loved pegging, she was the one who convinced me to try it in the first place.) I still use it when I masturbate, not every time but most of the time. My girlfriend doesn’t know I have it, and I intended to keep it that way. Not that I needed to hide it because she’d be upset, I knew she wouldn’t be, but because it’s fucking embarrassing and I don’t want her to know. Since we moved in together I haven’t been using it as often, which is fine. Our sex life is still good. But when I have the place alone for a few hours, I still use it. And to be clear, I’m definitely not fantasizing about my ex- that ship has sailed and sunk. I just watch porn, which we’ve both expressly agreed is completely fine, although neither of us does it often.

Today, I was home alone, enjoying myself. My girlfriend was supposed to be out for most of the day, but she ended up coming home early. She came in quietly and I was being… rather loud, so I didn’t know she was home until she walked right into the bedroom. When I saw her, I panicked, screamed, rolled off the bed, hit my head on the nightstand, and the dildo fell out with a loud wet plop. She started laughing louder than I’ve ever heard her laugh before, and she turned and left the apartment. No clue where she went or why she came back early at all.

So now, a few hours later, I’m just sitting here with absolutely no idea what to do. I haven’t texted or called and she hasn’t either. I can see on Life360 that she’s at the beach with some friends, like she was planning on. If her plans don’t change again she won’t be back for another hour or two. I have absolutely no idea what will happen when she gets back and I’m not sure if I even want to. I’m seriously considering going to a friends house to hide from all this. Fuck my life.

TLDR; my girlfriend walked in on me with a dildo in my ass and thought it was hilarious, then left, leaving me embarrassed and confused.

Small update: I texted her “Hey when will you be home?” She responded “ten minutes.” Fuck fuck fuck.

BIG UPDATE: She came home, we talked. She laughed because, in her words, “it sounded like you had three or four guys in there, I seriously thought I was about to bust a gay orgy.” It was partly because of my reaction and partly relief that I wasn’t doing anything actually wrong. She had completely forgotten that this was even something I was interested in, because I only mentioned it once so long ago. Now that she realizes it’s something I still want, she’s willing to give it a shot. She doesn’t promise to like it but she promises to try it, and that’s way more than I expected. Honestly, I was just hoping she’d pretend it never happened. I would have been happy with that, so this is great. 

And for all those who keep asking: no, I didn’t keep going after she caught me. I have no idea where the dildo went, it vanished. It better turn up because now I really need it.

FINALLY UPDATE: we tried it, she actually liked it. She didn’t really realize what it was until we did it. It’s going to be pretty common now, looks like. And yes, we found the dildo, and no it wasn’t hiding in my ass. (I would definitely have known.) It rolled under the dresser.

Thanks everyone for your supportive comments, and for those who are calling me gay and unmanly, I have only one thing to say:

Fellas, is it gay to have sex with a woman?
She walked in on you during a private moment. This wasn’t a sexual act that she wasn’t aware of, she just stated she wasn’t interested in participating. Try not to be too embarrassed, I’m fairly certain you will both look back on this in a few days and laugh together about it.

Maybe it leads to opening her up a bit to some possibilities in the bedroom.
At least you always know you have the upper hand in an argument

"Go fuck yourself!"

"Well ok don't have to tell me twice!"
I need you to update this. 😆
'“it sounded like you had three or four guys in there, I seriously thought I was about to bust a gay orgy.”' 


Live your best life, dude. Lol
She should strap up and also tell you her darkest fantasy for you to reciprocate
This situation sounds like a pain in the ass
🤣🤣🤣🤣 we need an update
TIL some men are loud while masturbating.
I wouldn't make this about pegging or your ex- just say you like some prostate stimulation 
my ex would tell every friend she had that she “finally pegged someone” like i was some fuckin trophy to be won. the first though that came to my head is that she and her friends are all laughing about the dildo in ur ass
Her laughing is probably a good thing and truth be told, you smacking your head on a night stand after being startled with a dildo up your pooper does sound hilarious. To be clear though, the fact that she told you “it’s gross” is pretty shitty and if she does tell her/your friends (hope not) or does make you feel bad about it, I think she’s an asshole. Sorry. But a partner should be understanding. It would be like her telling you she likes anal and you telling her THAT’s gross (literally).

Apologies, I realize how what I said might have sounded mean towards your girlfriend. I wasn’t there to hear the conversation so I automatically imagined her kink shaming you but like others have said, she definitely has a right to not share your like or dislike of a certain kink.
"I don't know where the dildo went" Uh... brother, you may have a hell of a stool later on.
I would recommend considering getting a new dildo and or strap-on for your gf rather than re-using one from your ex. 

It's not a problem to keep for yourself or even try in the future but now that she is willing to try it with you, getting one that is hers/yours alone minimizes the things that could bother her and increases the chance of a positive encounter.

After all if you're mid way into it and she asked where/when you got the dildo she may be offended due to everything being a bit higher emotion and more things to be nervous about. 

It's not a bad call for any kink one party is more into if the barrier to entry is not too high.

I am not saying it would end anything but it's one more thing that could go wrong and make it less fun.

At the very least talk to her about whether she would want her own equipment beforehand or if she is ok using what you have.
What a weirdly wholesome story…
To quote Tom Segura, “a lot of girlfriends can’t handle that shit. But a wife…a wife will go “that it?I’ll spit butter in your ass. Whatever you want.””
The question everyone wants answered:

Did you get back on that horse, so to speak?
Honestly in this situation.... If I were you, I'd explain cause she didn't show interest that you just take care of yourself in private. Def emphasize that you don't want men, cause there's a possibility she might think you're a little gay, that you just like a little backdoor play and nothing past that. She wasn't interested, which is totally fine and her right, so you just take care of things when you have "special happy alone time" and that she still satisfies you and gives you the things you need.


Once this passes, also subtly set your home as a location on Life360 so it'll ping your phone when she arrives so she doesn't catch you in a embarrassing position like this again.
Just text something innocuous, like, are you having a good day, when will.you be back. 

Her reply text will give you an idea how things are.
loud wet plop

Christ I’ve not laughed like that in a long time
> I have no idea where the dildo went, it vanished.

I wish I hadn't dropped out of high-school just so I could use this as my yearbook quote.
I'm honestly surprised it took this long for her to find out since you've been living together for years
Oh my god this is way to funny for me to discover at work
All I can hear in my head is the Mallrats line...
-"Well did he cum or what??"
-"Jesus Christ man there's some things you don't talk about in public!"
I love ass play and my girl is NOT into it at all giving or receiving. She knows ima get my dildo time in regardless tho. 

Don’t be too embarrassed, I was at first too cause it’s a “man thing”. But seriously it’s not that deep, you just like what you like.
Just gonna say this for ya buddy: wanting to be pegged isn't weird or gross. She's totally within her rights to not want to do it, but I really don't think you need to be as embarrassed about it as you are. It feels good, right? It's not for everyone, but it's obviously something you enjoy doing. It's ok to enjoy it, try not to overthink it so much.

  
That being said though, this situation is funny as fuck and I think you two should probably talk about it a bit when she gets home. Nothing serious, just be like "hey I'm super embarrassed, can we talk" and get on the same page.
I mean, you could just own it - (cis) men have prostates, prostates can be stimulated anally, ie. it's normal for that to feel good and be desirable.  It does not make you less of a man or any other toxic thing like that.  You would be amazed at the number of men that are, just like you, secretly into being penetrated anally (as a female who's pretty fine with pegging and such, I *do* know first hand).  If you would all just be open about it....you would realize how common and normal it is....and all stop being embarrassed and/or judging other people over it lol.  You shouldn't have to feel bad about a healthy sexual desire that is normal and common.  Someone's gotta lead the way in that, though ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
[deleted]
My man... That update is crucial.  The way she handled it is awesome.  She didn't ridicule or try to embarrass you.  She actually wants to try this with you despite her initial apprehension.  That woman is a keeper!  Don't let her get away.
> Fellas, is it gay to have sex with a woman?

I don't even care if the story is true or not, this is just perfect.
Hope you're not a bot coz I'll need an update as well on your story. The good thing is that she laughed at least. It could've been worse.
Bro lost his dildo. Don’t have company until you find it. 
Oh love, this is a funny story. It may not seem that way currently but trust me in a few years. This is going to be a funny story. I’m glad your girlfriend is not freaking out or anything. Ridiculous. Men are allowed to like what they like and if it’s up the ass all the better.
In my head this story ended with the wife coming home with her girlfriends from the beach. They are joking and teasing OP about the dildo in his ass. Things get heated and the girlfriends run a train on OP.

I'll be in my room.
Why is this so wholesome 🥹💕

(Dammit. Before anyone else says it, “Why is this so *hole*some?”)
I approve of the updates
So you’ve got a shitty dildo hanging around somewhere ?
Pretty hole-some TIFU to be honest
You're gonna get fucked in the ass! Worked out well brah congrats
I am much in the same situation, ex really got into pegging, I really got into it and miss it. Me and my current have been together for some time now and she has maybe pegged me 3 times. I know she isn’t totally interested so I don’t press it. I do hope one day for it to open up
😂 Glad this worked out in possibly the best way possible for you. Honestly would have reacted similarly, but I'm a nervous laugher
OP - take her shopping. Either online or irl, whichever, just let her pick a new strap for you. There are lots of options, from harnesses to feeldoes, but the main thing is that she's using something that is hers and yours, not something from a previous relationship.
This ended pretty wholesome. I hope she ends up being into it
She's sounds like a keeper
Is your head okay? You said you bonked it
Honestly, I think that was just one of the two appropriate reactions to walking in on your partner masturbaiting. Laughing cause it's just a silly moment and leaving to let them have their time, or offering to help. 

I'm glad this helped her realize how much you enjoy this and that it has made her willing to try it. It means she really likes making you feel good and wants to participate in something sexually important to you. 

Super healthy and it's awesome you two got to this outcome!
You got yourself a good one and I think you need to marry her.
Bro needs to find it or it will find him in the middle of a hot summer day 🤧
Hahaha as a middle-aged gay guy... This is simultaneously hot, funny, and cute LOL. I think it's a good thing you got caught! Things actually worked out!
In reply to the keep asking bit: it's done its part and poofed. Time to celebrate this new twist with letting gf help you pick the next one lol
This is the most hilarious and wholesome NSFW thing I've read.   Glad it worked out for y'all.
It's interesting to see all the fearful socio brainwashed expectations.   Some of you haven't found your G-spot in your  bu*t, and it shows.

Relax, you may find it's your new favorite thing.
FYI those friends at the beach… they know everything.
Glad it had a happy resolution 😊 

Just wanted to remind people, guys, absolutly nothing you do with a WOMAN makes you gay.
“You put stuff in your ass? You’re gay…”

Nope, and my orgasms are better than yours.
This is one of the best TIFU I’ve ever read. So happy everything turned out well for you two, the updates made me smile soooo big. You got a keeper dude
What a fucking happy ending! 

You Sr have a great women on your hands. Don’t loose her. Treat her like the Empress she is.
What a rollercoaster 🤣🎢
Little late to this, and I'm happy it worked out for you, but I laughed a little too when you said you rolled off and hit the nightstand. Glad you didn't get a concussion
God, thank you for the last bit on this update. "Fellas, is it gay to have sex with a woman?" is the only good take I've seen for straight men wanting to be pegged. It made me giggle.
Man, she sounds like an absolutely quality woman. Keep her long time, friend, and enjoy your peggings.
If she’s a good girl and loves you, she won’t care.  
It’s really not that big of a deal.  Butt stuff feels good. Doesn’t matter if you’re a guy or a girl.  
If she makes this a big deal- find yourself someone who will love your Hershey highway of love as much as you do.

If it makes you feel better, my guy likes butt stuff too.  The chick he lost his v card too wanted too experience role reversal and asked to strap him.  He was NOT interested, but eventually caved so she would agree to a 3 some.  He loved the pegging. She loved the three some.  So much In fact. She became a lesbian. for many years after their breakup, he did this privately on his own. From fear of judgement.  
He asked me in the beginning to strap up on him. I was super excited at the idea.  Then I saw myself in the mirror with a giant black strap on and felt such deep shame and embarrassment I couldn’t handle it.  
One day I came home to him literally with a giant dildo stuck up his ass with the suction cup stuck to the side of the tub and it was a literal emergency.  I had to unstuck the dildo from the tub & his ass. 
He perforated his colon.  It was a hole ass thing *pun intended* needed surgery and everything. 

He can’t enjoy it anymore due to damage.  But now a days I offer from time to time just so he doesn’t hurt himself 

Save your booty hole. 
Find a girl who will safely peg you.
The dildo of consequences, rarely arrives lubed.
OMG this is like the time my ex walked in on me going to pound town on myself in the shower while listening to radio head. I was laying down in the tub and she walked in (music was loud), saw me, and for some reason thought I fell in the tub and asked if I was ok. I'm glad it only figuratively scared the shit out of me lmao
All the signs of a healthy relationship and it's great you are able to discuss it together.
nothing embarrassing about what you like.  Glad you were able to talk about it and maybe get to experiment a bit with her.
I'm so happy I found this after it's been fully updated. This is a wild ride from start to finish. Kudos to you friend!
Omfg this had me dying. I’m glad
She was a good sport
🤣🤣🤣🤣

Sounds like it all worked itself out in the end lmaoooooo
If I walked in I would’ve dropped everything and taken over.
Well, your relationship is only stronger because of it! Man, if there was a way to introduce it. You got her attention. 

I see good things in your future, sir!
I want you to know, this post made my day! I’m glad your girl didn’t make you feel uncomfortable.
“I have no idea where the dildo went, it vanished” was the cherry on top lmao
Your butt your choice man
Thank you for making my day. This was a great read and I am happy for you that you are getting your needs met AND that she discovered she likes it. "Try it, you'll like it!" 🤣
And they all lived happily ever after!! 

This better make it to BORUpdates.
I love this. When I was pretending to be straight with my last boyfriend and he was also pretending to be straight I loved pegging. Now I know I just like the strap in general and not men. But that’s beside the point. Awesome that you guys were able to work it out and. Now you’ll both get to enjoy using a ton of lube so she can pound ya good.  I’m not a “fellas” but I really don’t think enjoying this makes you gay necessarily, but it might be a little gay to be thinking of men when doing it.
This is by far my favorite story on reddit so far. Thank you for sharing. I wish you and your relationship all the best.
This was not a FU. OP this was a blessing. I mean, it could have gone a number of types of sideways, but my dude, you actually hit the jackpot.




I'm happy for you and a little jelly.
Good for you for not being afraid to explore your body. Honestly there’s a lot of gay men that are too caught up in their minds to explore beyond what they think they know. Hope you kids both have fun with this new activity together. Keep learning and growing!
This ended up being way better than I thought. Your girl is awesome
Good for you, King. Sometimes *shit* really does work out for the best. Glad you didn’t make a complete *ass* out of yourself.
Interestingly, in my experience, I've hardly met a woman (that I've talked with this about) that *hasn't* been into pegging.
Honestly dude you gotta own it. Enjoying anal play is completely natural especially for guys. No more allowing society's ridiculous gatekeeping to stop you from enjoying YOUR sex life because that's just a waste of energy. Do whatever the hell makes you feel good as long as it's consensual!
This will be at reddit hall of Fame for sure
The ending topped this off! I chuckled at the closing line
Once got walked in on when I was knuckle deep searching for a rubber butt plug. At that moment I also popped. And it came out as I did.
OP not gonna lie, I absolutely pissed myself laughing on a crowded train at the description of the dildo ejecting itself.

Glad it all worked out, of course.
I came in late to this party so have the benefit of seeing all the updates. Just wanted to say, what a great story! Sounds like you have a really good relationship with some healthy communication, even if sometimes it had to be prompted by being found with a dildo up your ass…

I’m glad you found something new you both enjoy. :)
This is some fucking good tea
The laugh was probably part laughter when she realised the sounds she heard wasn't you cheating on her.

The rest was probably just hilarity from seeing you in such an embarrassing situation with the added bump on the nightstand and wet dildo plopping on the floor.

You seem to have a healthy relationship. I'd say you're safe. Although not safe from her never letting you forget and randomly starting to laugh uncontrollably everytime she remembers for the rest of her life.
I have a question because I don't do bum sex or bum anything other than shitting...

Aren't you put off by fecal matter on stuff that goes up there? I mean, I know you can keep the outside parts squeaky clean, but the inside bits? 

Don't those parts have residual poop?

Asking for a friend... /lie
Don't sweat it, dude. There are plenty of guys that like putting things in their butt, myself included. Just enjoy it and if anyone tries to shame you for it they are missing out. Prostate orgasms are the strongest I've ever had. If you can get your partner involved, it only gets better.
Just want to add, get a new dildo bro. Don’t make her use your ex’s.
Just gotta say, that's probably the most wholesome ending to a story I've ever  read about a dildo up one's ass.
This is no big deal! I worked nights and came home to my ex in our bed, sprawled out naked with my comically large dildo resting between his legs (think at least 15inches long and girthy. Not at all my favorite. A funny toy not a fun toy) He was asleep. I thought he was messing with me. So I picked up the dildo which was just resting in the inside of his sphincter. This woke him up! Then I look around and there are candle burning and a red scarf over the lamp. He FREAKED out on me. I was confused. I never pegged him but definitely provided stimulation to the area previously and we both liked it. I tried to address it later very reasonably I thought. I mostly just didn’t want to end up using a toy that had been in an ass in my vagina. I keep those separate. He would not discuss it, became very angry with me and basically denied that this even happened. I’m glad you guys were able to discuss this in a mature way. Ass play is fun😏

Weird. This was the next post in my feed…
Omg Dude i'm so sorry but it's hilarious (because of the good ending) Wish you a great time und a Lot of fun
Same thing happened to me!
Wife was out (she has zero interest in anything anal and I’m fine with that, I’m a grown ass man) so I bust out the towel and lay it on the couch, bust out the lube and dildo (which I actually got for her but she’s not really into it, also fine!) dig up some old porn files and hit the go button!

Now, I like to take my time (20-30 mins) so obviously I’m a little distracted…and here I am, buck naked, spread eagled and in a pose that would make a yoga instructor jealous, in bursts the mrs, we lock eyes for what felt like eternity and all I could think of to say was “you want in on this?!

She burst out laughing and spun on her heel and exit stage left.

We never spoke of it again.
Don’t sweat it OP… and I sure hope you find your special friend!
I will never be loud in a shared home. Even if I’m home alone.
For the love of god, keep your asshole clean. Seriously. Buy a fucking bulb and a solution to clean that ass out because if she’s considered it “gross” in the past and she’s willing to try it now, if there’s even the slightest hint of shit she’ll bail and never do it again. Honestly take the good from this and don’t be embarrassed about it. You got a badass girlfriend willing to try out kinks with you now. Take advantage of it. 

But yeah don’t be embarrassed OP. Me and my girl rarely masturbate because we just have sex. Only time I do is when she’s not home due to scheduling. She knows I like to use ass toys too. Nothing wrong with that. 

All I’m saying is, if your girl can poke fun of you and turn that situation positive you’ve got a good girlfriend.

Edit: Holy shit. OP, I am so happy for you my guy. Fuck the assholes who say it’s gay getting pegged. I’m a straight dude who loves it myself.

Enjoy yourself man.

Welp. That's enough Reddit for today.
Ugh, your girl is so lucky, I wish my husband was into ass play, I want up in them guts.
you showed confidence in being wiling to do it so loudly not 100% sure if she would find out,that's why she is intersted in trying it out. you probably brought it up al nervous and complicated like you did here. maybe she went to talk to her friends about it and heard stories after you told her its sometihng you want her to seriously consider and showed her that well, you were willing to do it. youve been deriving yourself of this pleasure all of this time simply because she wasnt confident in what you weren't confident in. Now you know for next time how the game typically works between masculine and feminine energies flirting.
Splendiferous update
That was the funniest shit I’ve read in a long time. Thank you for that and I’m glad things worked out.
Hmmm... if this is important to you and a relationship deal-breaker then explore it and see where it goes. But also be prepared doing something like this could also cause an end to a relationship. 

If you engage your gf in this activity you have to be ready for her to view you differently... Whether it's right or wrong, justifiable, whatever, it does not matter, it's human nature. There are certain things or events that change the way we view our partners and there's no reversing it mentally. I guess some call it the "ick".

Not saying your desires are wrong or anything of the sort. Just a fair warning, it might change the dynamics of your relationship in a irreversible way.

If it's important then move forward and see if she can do this with you. If it's not important, then trust her first gut instinct, her initial response is probably what she really feels.
Text her and say 'I'd like to sit down and talk about last night... but..y'know..' If you get her to laugh a bit, it might make things less awkward.
Glad it worked out.  We are sexual beings and if that's your biggest "perversion" (for lack of a better word) she should be gratefu.
I hope you find that dildo. You sure it’s not still up there?
Somewhere on reddit  there’s a post titled “ my boyfriend likes shoving giant dildos up his ass. What should I do?”
Get a butt plug… stays in much easier
My wife found my 18" Black Colossus, she doesnt care that I do it but wont participate. I told her thats fine just know I still need to do it on my own sometimes. Its a specific urge that cant be satisfied any other way.
It sounds like you guys have a really healthy, communicative relationship. That’s cool!

Sorry for the embarrassment (& hope your head’s okay!), but glad it all worked out well, in the end! 😊
I hope she told her friends 😈
Yay for her willing to try again! This is cute and shows that she cares about what you enjoy and the idea just never crossed her mind to incorporate that into yalls intercourse. Wish you both the best and for her to enjoy pegging you 🖤
As though you can’t just get a new dildo, bro lol. Your story cracked me up, as I like being pegged too; it was actually my wife’s idea to introduce me to extreme heights of pleasure so a bit of a reverse situation from yours but I am glad she’s willing to try. Best of luck!
> and the dildo fell out with a loud wet plop

This is the hardest I’ve laughed in a while. Kudos. And glad it turned out okay.
Oh man the writing of this cracked me the fuck up. I’m glad you guys had a happy ending ;)
I think that perhaps the dildo did exactly what it was supposed to, and disappeared when it was supposed to. Now it’s time to buy a new one, for a new relationship and new explorations.
There's nothing embarrassing about using a dildo. It doesn't matter what sexuality you are; prostates exist and some people get off on anal. It's nothing to be ashamed of. 


I am laughing at the dildo vanishing though. Might need an X-Ray ;)
Check your ass for the dildo it might still be there
I'm glad it sorted of worked out for you. At least she's willing to try it with you, sounds like she really loves you
Her reaction kinda aaaawwweed me tbh
“The dildo fell out with a loud wet plop” 😂 listen y’all were able to laugh about it which is good.
I love this. Glad she’s open to trying it
Not my bag baby but to each their own.

If your relationship is that strong then it shouldn’t be an issue though, 

If your relationship is that strong personally I’d expect (and tolerate) a bit of rubbing on this one,…lol, with a big wet “plop” 🤣

Not to mention the knot on your noggin, best to ya
No good advice from me. I just wanted to say that there is a joy button in the male butt. You didn’t put it there and if we lived in a less homophobic society, every couple would be pegging or incorporating prostate massagers into their sex life.

Don’t be embarrassed. You’re an advocate for better orgasms and that makes you a hero.
That dildo is going to turn up when someone is in your bedroom you don't want to see it.
With the updates, this is a rollercoaster.  Great outcome in the end.

TIFU but it may work out great.  Bit too long a title for a sub Reddit.
As others have said, I think you’ll look back and laugh about this someday and I am happy to see your update where you say your gf will give it a try. 

Did the bedroom door have a lock? My wife and I (and just me when I was single with kids) ALWAYS lock the bedroom door even when nobody is home. You never know when plans will change. She probably still would have heard you but if she called out at a locked door, you’d have a chance to compose yourself. 

Best of luck. It sounds like you guys have a healthy relationship.
Is pegging common in straight relationships? :O (I'm gay)
Can we have an updated update after you try pegging so we can know what she thinks?! I may be way too involved in this story...
This could’ve been an episode of friends
Ha this made me laugh. You girlfriend is a good one.
Redditors are weird man
This is one of the best stories I’ve seen in years on here. Thank you.
Many women aren't aware that part of a man's sex organs are at the base of the pinus. very close to the Anus The prostate can be very stimulated from the rectum.  I know several men who enjoy the sensation of the prostate being massaged during sex with their heterosexual partner . Just enjoy it ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy).
This is so goddamn funny! I'm sure you were very embarrassed until you two spoke, but as far as reactions go that one wasn't so bad. Sure hope she didn't tell her friends though or you're going to be getting a lot of weird glances paired with giggles.
I'm happy this story had a happy ending lmaoo
Felt like I was reading a comedy 😂. I can understand why she was dying laughing because that shit sounds funny as fuck 😂🤣😂
Yo this is hella wholesome lol, I am happy for you OP
Benefit of the doubt and assuming this is true, this right here is why communication and being willing to try new things is great. OP let her process the events, they talked, she was open to it, and they both enjoyed the experience. Also it is NOT gay to enjoy anal play.
Update OP????
Not into the whole pegging thing myself but look bro if it's one thing i learned over the years it's that people are gonna do what they like to do. In public in secret or wherever. If you like it and also she likes it now, do your thing. All the guys calling you gay are probably on other reddit threads wondering why their wife won't have sex with them anymore.
Man I love the progress of these updates, good for both of you!
Omg this is one of the cutest and funniest couple stories I've seen on here. It truly warms my heart to hear that she not only wasn't upset about catching you, but that she was more open to the idea of trying something you liked. So glad to see that y'all have a new way to enjoy each others' closeness.
aww happy ending
These updates took this entire post from "TIFU" to "Yesterday Was My Greatest Fuckup Ever"
Congratulations on this life milestone unchievement unlocked. You should absolutely share this with your partner. Many, many straight men enjoy this.
these tifu stories keep getting more creative
I kept thinking reading this she laughed out of relief that the noises were you alone.
I'm glad this all turned out well for you OP! but lmao seriously her thoughts on what was going on vs what was actually happening then what happened when she walked in you poor person. I wouldn't have been able to control the laughter either it probably looked pretty damn comical from the look on your face to hitting the dresser to the dildo popping out
That ending made me so happy. It made me sad you felt embarrassed to self pleasure/that you owned a dildo. Getting walked in on would always have that surprising embarrassment but you should never be embarrassed/or be made to feel embarrassed for liking what you like. I’m glad she is being more supportive of your needs/wants. I hope she loves it and it becomes a regular part of your sex life. I hope that if she doesn’t love it she’s still totally on board with anal play in some regard in your sex life or, at the very least, in your solo play.
LOL just popped in to say wild ass turn of events 🫠
Lmao this is great… glad it turned out okay for you guys!
I had a bad day.

My day is now less bad.
Bruh you don’t have to post everything online
So glad this had a happy ending. 😉
The only thing that upsets me is you said you got your head on the night stand ... did she make sure you were OK before going back to her outing?
She caught you in an embarrassing moment.. and then she left without a word (actually laughed?!) and didn't even talk to you for hours? Not to mention, did she see you hit your head? How bad was it? Did she even care that you might have been hurt??
i wish I could give a good pegging to my man. good that you could solve this with her.
She told all her friends at the beach btw.
that update is an absolute win, I love it when couples can explore new things together and even better when you both like it!
Love this story and the updates. Glad it worked out for you bro. This is sadly the most wholesome things I’ve read in a while, but it slightly restores my faith in humanity.
Is this how I get my wife to start? She keeps telling me no.
If nobody else has mentioned, can get an L shaped dildo, short part goes in her, long in you, there are also ones with vibes for her stimulation.
Pretty late to this but this is the most literal "I fucked up" post I have seen on here to date
This is such a hilarious situation I’m glad it worked out hahah.
U r a very lucky man! I'm out here with the wrong woman I swear many times
What a nice happy story. :)
Can’t lie bro nothing is weird or gross about what you’re into and if she’s gonna change her love for you, or her treatment of you negatively, then you deserve someone who will peg your brains out
This was a rollercoaster of a read 😂 I'm glad it was a happy ending for you homie
This is actually pretty funny but jokes aside, she sounds wonderful. When she found you like that she didn’t judge you or make you feel bad instead she laughed and was willing to try it with you. Definitely should put a ring on her.
This whole post is a blast from the past. 

When I was living with my college boyfriend, i came home from school early one day and found him with my vibrator in his ass. 

It wasn't anything we'd ever talked about before, so you could say I was surprised.
Oh to have a boyfriend who likes to be pegged...
Do you think it's gay? My ex stuck her finger in my ass when she was giving me a blowjob. At first it bothered me but then I actually started to enjoy it.
Culturally there’s a lot of weird feelings based in shame. Penetration is inherently viewed as the one being fucked which is weird. I feel bad for any man who will never know the sensation of a prostate orgasm. 

Glad things went your way OP
Do most people moan when they masturbate?
The worst part here is using an old dildo. 

Get a new dildo.

Get some variety options.
After the update I think we can all agree you’ve got yourself a real one there
Hmmm… kinda experienced the same thing. So this is just something men enjoy but are not gay or bi?? 

Please don’t tear me up in the comments. I’m just trying to make sense of this. And coming across this thread will maybe give me a better understanding of it all and get all these negative thoughts out my head.
yay a happy ending! 🥰
Gay sex is when you have sexual acts with the same sex. Soo happy it’s a norm or something you both enjoy now.
Aww this turned out so wholesome. I don't think it belongs in TIFU anymore though 😁 Glad it worked out for you
So, I grew up as the only child in my family and when I was younger my mom always checkup on me in my bedroom to see if i was doing my homework and one year, I was 15, going to 16, and with my paycheck, I purchased some gift cards to purchase some lube and a dildo for an experiment as my friends told me. A few weeks later, I received my packages, and after a month without cumming i was super horny. After my mom and I returned back from my football practice, me in skinny jeans and a baggy white sweaty, super horny by my outfit decide to play with the dildo (6inch) in me, and 45 minutes later, my mom walked up stairs and opened my door, but I couldn't hear her because i was wearing earphones listening to music and watching my phone with my left hand as she saw my really erected 6 inch penis at the time flopping and cum all over my legs with my right hand moving the dildo up and down in me. Later that night, I was so embarrassed during dinner that my face was still red, and I forgot to change my skinny jeans which had cum stains on them. My mom later told me in private in my bedroom to lock my door next time and to maybe use a buttplug instead, so if it happened again, she wouldn't be grossed out.

What's worst is that she mentioned the first thing she saw was the dildo going out and inside of me as I quickly sat up to hide my rear, but then she saw my penis afterwards dripping with cum.

But, my mom used that incident to blackmail me to finish my chores and excel both in my sports and academics. Otherwise, she would tell my dad.

I'm 19 as if now
Bro.. if shes with her friends you are in TROUBLE!! women talk MAD trash and think its normal.
Your allowed to have toys and use them!
You should probably marry her
I am so late to the party with this post, but the ending made me LOL. I hope it turns up for you, OP. So glad your girlfriend is open to trying it with you. Nothing wrong with experimenting as that's what life is all about. Thanks for updating us.
That’s a good woman.
I’m fully invested in this, please keep it updated
I don't see a reason why she should be angry.. You're not cheating or anything
I know everyone is giggling in your comments and it is a little funny, but on a serious note I hope you’re okay. I dated a guy who liked being pegged, and while it wasn’t my thing I would’ve never dreamed of kink shaming him for it. You deserve to be with someone who wouldn’t laugh at you or make you feel embarrassed in such a vulnerable moment. For your sake I hope she does better in the future. ❤️
Hey man you are stimulating your prostate. Since she does not have one she might not understand it gets you off. Just tell her since she was turned off by the idea and wasn’t willing to do it….it had to get done somehow….you thought you had some alone time and well you didn’t get a chance to finish up. No harm, no foul, it’s not like you were cheating on her.
Shit happens….hopefully it will just all blow over.
Best of luck 😬👍
Honestly man, your girlfriend sounds awesome. 

After seeing that she realises it does it for you, and is willing to give it a go. No drama, no judgement, just a cool GF. The perfect reaction. After what was probably the funniest thing she’s ever seen in her life.  😂 ‘plop’ 😂 

I wish you guys the absolute fkn very best.
ah jeez
You like what you like bro. Will be a funny story (for you) in the future
Hope all is well
Harmless fun, if you can't do the time don't do the crime, own it.
I'm glad it worked out, and that she's willing to give it a try.
Cheers to future peggings with your gf
I came here to say this may feel awful now but with a bit of honest conversation could turn into a beautiful moment for your relationship.

Congrats on…opening up…to your partner
Jake? 

-ex wife
What do you mean it vanished
What was the....what...
Cute
Pegging is great. Also great story. You guys will be fine!
![gif](giphy|3oEjI67Egb8G9jqs3m)
Enough internet for me today.
I’m not buying this
This entire story is about what’s going on in your head. You need to care less.
One thing for sure. She will tell all her girlfriends about what she saw.
Bro this story is fucking crazy 😂
ngl kinda shitty of her to say it was “weird and gross” when you originally mentioned it.
This, I'm sorry, is hilarious! This is also awesome - you got what you wanted and she had a new experience (that she liked). Good for you, man!
This is too funny.
Oh \_gotta\_ get the update on this one. Bless!  I hope she'll be cool with it. Not your fault you got a feel-good spot up there.
Just commenting so I can come back for the update.
A good outcome for all 🙌 Congrats on your relationship
Upvoted for the update
Amazing! Glad it worked out for ya! She sounds like a great partner!
Awww that update is so wholesome. Glad you two could talk it out!
No need to be embarrassed man, plenty of us out there know what's up with the back track.

Glad it worked out in the end
Be careful what you wish for.  Prepare your anus.
So not sure if itd fit your kink.  But you could wear a plug, im sure its not the same as pegging.. but it may be a way to get her to be more ok with your kinks.. /gradually work up to the heavier stuff/actual pegging.

As one gf showed me, she can massage my prostate with a finger/dildo... while she gave me a bj.. some enjoy the extra control they get.. 
Also consider gloves if shes icked out from the rear.
Most women have a difficult time with guys using a dildo for prostate stimulation. They don’t get it & understand it. It’s totally normal for guys to pleasure themselves with a dildo. Women think that as guys we have to stimulate their G-spot to get them off… well guys have a G-spot also. There is a very small percentage of women that do like & enjoy pegging a guy. It’s all comes down to the women who are comfortable, open, secure, non-shameful, non-judgmental & sexually liberated with their boyfriend/husband who likes to self pleasure himself with a dildo. Your gonna be ok Bro!! Enjoy yourself all the way:)
At this point it’s just my fault for having a phone
Good story man.

Glad things worked out.

It would better if you said “told her once, exactly 6 months into the relationship” but it’s fine. Honestly.
I’m a firm believer in being pegged there’s not a thing wrong with it and my partner loves it to
[deleted]
dude no biggie, you’re touching yourself yay i don’t think she would give less of a fuck and plus this day will become less thought of as times goes on for sure. maybe it will
open her mind to you guys using it together even? 
also completely unrelated but i need some advice 😭
i wish my man let me use a dildo on him damn. i don’t wanna make him feel
uncomfortable or pressured but how do i convince him? he’s said yes to it but then he just puts it off. we’re pretty freaky and we’re hot as fuck and he thinks i’m a goddess so surely this is an advantage. i want to please my man 😭😭.
Tbh I would probably have the same reaction except the being grossed out part if
I accidentally walked in on my husband using the smaller butt plugs I have I use the bigger ones  but it was cheaper for a set and we’ve done plenty of other things especially if he fell off the bed trying to hide 🤣 but definitely try to explain to your gf from a scientific point plus she might find she enjoys it more than she thinks signed a shy good girl who is now a very kinky person 😈
[deleted]
What a great story! I am laughing hard with both of you :). There is nothing to be embarrassed about though. And I am sure you will find a solution that works for both of you. Seems like she is a reasonable person. 

I was once in the opposite situation. Had a girlfriend who fancied pegging me, which I wasn't very interested in. I let her do it anyway though in return for other favours ;)
stay strong OP, it may take some time (it took me 10 years) but someone out there will love pegging you
Sounds like she’s a keeper
Have you checked under the bed???? Or like behind whatever furniture in there?
Further down the comment someone mentioned so you got a shitty dildo laying around and you commented yeah that's why it's a priority to find it dude shitty dildo if you move there's going to be more shit everywhere that's fucking gross clean it out first
Ash?
Huh, some wild ass shit
u/deadfan52 🤣
>At first she thought I was joking and just laughed at me, when she realized I was serious she said it was weird and gross,

Well that wasn't a very nice way to react to your partner opening up about what they're into. Even if you don't wanna do it, calling it weird and gross is just mean.

>Now that she realizes it’s something I still want, she’s willing to give it a shot.

That is nice though 😚
Make sure to be extra cute and make this worth her while to get the best shot of her into it 🫡
You shouldve checked the life 360 before you started and locked the door. amateur 😂. But i guess it all worked out for you!
She’s a keepa Mate
from Pinkard and Bowden.   I'm tired of the gay life, don't feel like sucking dick no more.  Last week down at the disco my but plug fell out on the floor.
Jesus Julian, lol. The boys got a good laugh from this one.
I find it bizarre that people track one another’s locations these days. If you trust your s.o why would you need it?
OP, The next time you're around her group of friends, especially the ones she went to the beach with,  be prepared for some serious looks or chuckles from them. Can only imagine what she told them.
it’s never a good thing when you can’t find the dildo. are you sure you don’t need to be looking… within?
Oh my god, this is hilarious. 

I am glad that there was such a good outcome.
Poor aasshole
Not sure if anyone else has said this, but get a new dildo. The old one has connections to your past...relationship and humiliation. Create new adventures. Maybe go pick one out together.
Never be afraid to communicate despite how embarrassing or silly it may be. As much as it may have sucked now, yall will laugh at that memory for years to come.
Nothing beats a happy ending
Happy ending!!!
Great post
be quite nex time
And this is how I learned what TIFU stands for 🤣
Hilarious story! I hope she now gives you the pegging of a lifetime! 😂
Lmaooooo
Reddit is so much fun this morning!
Yeah my wife had the same thought. Thinks its gross. But she had had dreams of a sex dungon useing me. So there that...
I hope it didn't vanish up there...
So glad that this story has a literal happy ending, even though it doesn't have a metaphorical one (yet).
At least she was a good sport about it lol
Always nice seeing a “success” story on tifu lol
Logically I know you’re right but getting caught fucking yourself isn’t easy to move on from
Is there ever a good way to get caught jerking off though?
She didn't state she wasn't interested, she called it gross. That detail kinda pissed me off lol but she's changed her mind apparently and is down to try it so that's good.
You were damn right.
This is a perk I've found working at an adult shop! I get to tell people to go fuck themselves a lot
"Again?!"
I prefer "don't threaten me with a good time" but same sentiment. It's a running joke between my fiancee and I.
I’ll update as soon as I know whether I’m fucked or not
Updated.
Yeaaaah, I'm gonna need this, as well.
That’s a fair trade. I don’t think she has anything left we haven’t done though
Maybe for some.
More like a headache with how hard it sounds like he hit the night stand
Not if he was doing it right. He sounds like a skilled operator. I bet it was wonderful.
Updated
I will post an update once there is an update to be posted
Normally no, with 8 inches of silicone yes.
If we feel safe to be, of course! I have thin walls though, so no moaning for me 🤷‍♂️😞
That’s probably the right approach. I won’t even mention my ex or pegging unless she brings it up.
If she told them I’m seriously going to die, most of her friends are either my friends or my friends girlfriends. If this gets around I seriously can’t handle it, I’ll fucking move and change my name
Why would you write this lol.
This. 

Put yourself in her shoes. You hear noises and go investigate. You walk in and suddenly she stops, screams, bangs her head, and fires a dildo across the room. There ain't a living soul I can imagine who could keep a straight face after that.
I don’t think she meant anything by her “gross” comment, but she’ll be home in a few minutes so I guess I’m about to find out.
So a lot of people have that reaction to the idea of poop itself without thinking about it being a hole that's got some possibilities. It's a valid initial reaction because poop, not because biases.
Why? There’s plenty of people who don’t find what he’s doing to be something typical or pleasant, and I know Reddit struggles to respect an opinion if it’s not theirs, but she has a right to find that gross. I don’t blame her either.
This is solid advice. I pegged one partner who already had a harness/toy he liked. Which was great honestly because having to shop for a harness myself would have been weirdly anxiety inducing since at the time I knew nothing about it. He was worried the harness wouldn’t fit because I’m small but it did. I personally was never bothered by the fact it was “used” (it’s all washable/serializable) because it was his toy, for use on him. I don’t particularly want used toys up in me, but using his used toy on him? That’s fine.

I would encourage you to use a toy you already know you like the first time she pegs you.
No. The horse was startled in the chaos and now I can’t find it.
Yeah I’ll explain. Home is in Life360, but my dumb ass turned notifications off because I was getting too many of them. I’m pretty OCD about notifications, I always eliminate as many as I can. I guess that’s one notification I really can’t do without.
Bro I’ve been trying but I can’t make myself press send
I am a master of stealth. When I don’t have 8 inches of silicone up my ass anyway.
I’m glad I could make your day a little funnier.
Fucking brilliant
How the hell do I make her understand that something that seems so weird isn’t? Where do I even start?
Yep, there’s stigma because so many straight guys (and even women) can be homophobic and their immediate reaction would be “What are you, gay??” (as if that’s a bad thing anyway)

Like, no, playing with your own body isn’t gay lol
You have my word, I’m not a bot. Small update already added, big one probably coming later tonight or tomorrow.
Yup. Believe me, finding it is currently priority number one. My girlfriend is currently on her hands and knees looking for it because she feels bad for laughing, and if I’m being honest, my ass is too sore.
Buddy this is Reddit, you can say butt.
Or maybe she shouldn’t have to do something that grosses her out?
Sometimes people just don’t like things. You don’t get to dismiss them and overstep boundaries because it feels good to you. 
No means no. 
Gross means gross.

Just put a condom on it. Effortless clean up.
You might want to tell your friend that they could try to use an enema. 

It rinses out any leftover residue before supposed  anal activities. However; this cleanliness only last for a couple of hours, as the bowels will keep moving out the waste that was deeper inside there. And that "waste" is actually needed, as the bacteria in the bowels need something to sustain them. But cleaning it out now and then, is not an issue. Just don't overdo it. And allow the cleared area to rest for a bit before starting the desired activities.. The anal sphincter might tense up, as a reaction to the water release once it is pushed out. This is a reflex to keep one from dehydration. Normally, everything pushed out is rather dry. But if your bum suddenly thinks you are purging all the water out you consumed previously, it closes. 

Have fun!

*edit: spelling
Depends. You can clean out before hand but I really doubt most people do that for solo toy use. If you have a good diet and poop maybe an hour/two before you’ll be fine. If you’re going real deep, there’ll probably be poop. If you’ve got a bowel movement “on deck” there will be poop. If you’re really bothered by poop you try to avoid it. If you’re like “not my favorite but I’ll clean up” you put down a towel. You can also put condoms on the toys to keep them cleaner.
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
I’m gay and there is nothing gay about. I have women friends who’ve put their fingers up there and the are freaked out that their partner is gay. I’ve had to calm them down and let them know their partner isn’t gay. I know these guys and they are definitely not gay lol. The male g spot is up so any man regardless of sexuality may enjoy their prostate being stimulated!
I’ve included all the updates I’m going to, there’s nothing more to say
🥺👉👈😂
If a man wants to do it with a woman - that's straight 

If a man wants to do it with a man - that's gay

If a man wants to do it by himself - that doesn't mean either. It's just what he likes.

Would you consider a lesbian woman straight for using toys for penetration?
Updates have gone as far as they’re going to, the internet doesn’t need to know the details of me getting railed
I don’t think she’s angry, it’s the embarrassment I can’t handle.
Being the devil's advocate here for a bit, maybe she didn't actually intend to kink shame, nor laugh. Perhaps that was just the immediate reaction, but with open communication she would understand OPs needs and respect them as well. On another note, I agree and sending OP some (lubed) love, we all have our ways and personal moments, and there's nothing to be ashamed of. Hope they talk it out well, and I'm invested in a update on this drama!
If you think I’ll ever tell anyone I actually know about this, you’re crazier than me. Only the internet will ever hear, and I’ll probably be deleting this post in a few days anyway.
Just updated
Uh… no. Bringing sexual activity into public is fucking weird, not to mention illegal. Leave it at home.
Yeah, it was under a dresser
We found it, don’t worry
How did he lose it though 💀
Some people use this for safety, not for jealousy. Just another positive invention used in bad light is all.
So what? 


Early on i told my wife; I will support you,  be faithful and love you with all that i can.. But once in a while, i need to ram a giant dildo up my ass. 
If that's to much for you, you are very free to leave.


Been together for the last 20 years with a great sexlife.
I know this one chick that can’t get off unless she is dressed as Princess Leia. Yours is nothing compared to that, I feel. While your feelings are valid and I would feel embarrassed, I also know that if I walked in on my husband doing it, I would also laugh and walk on. Her feelings are also valid and it sounds like, maybe not in the way you liked, you brought her joy! I think yall need to discuss it because I am pretty sure it would bring you two closer. Your relationship seems pretty solid and I think it could take it. She now (really) knows you’re serious about it.
You are not wrong my friend hahaha...I've been there with you...well I mean not with you...but...well you know what I mean lol.
This is a made up story isn't it?
It was inevitable though, right? You could have avoided all of this with a little communication. Hopefully you see this is the chance to grow up a little.
The crazy thing is ,women talk. She probably asked for advice from her friends. At least it went your way
I’m glad this ended the way it did. I would suggest taking her to pick out a new strap and not having her use your ex’s make it a fun new experience
I mean it's not different from pleasuring yourself with your hand
Sure, by your horny step-sibling.
Yeah, with a picture of your wife / gf / significant other being your focus ofcourse.

Then again if the picture is younger / thinner than your partner currently is, you may be about to receive a beating.

However if thats something you're in to, its still win win!
Yeah, when you're caught, simply say "oh hey, was just thinking about you"
People can take time to adjust their thinking.

Not always a good thing, not always a bad thing.

Now I probably wouldn't describe anything my wife suggested as "gross", more " that's not something I'm interested in" but to each their own .

Also, gross doesn't mean uninterested. I've had GFs who wanted to do certain things BECAUSE they were gross.

Of course what's gross also changes from person to person.
I think all anal stuff is gross.. There's nothing wrong with that. As long as you realize there's nothing wrong in doing gross stuff if everyone involved is fine with it.
How is a straight man getting his dirty asshole rammed by his girlfriend not gross? Lmao
Which kind of fucked are you referring too? Lmao
I wouldn’t even know what to do, I’d just play it off like nothing even happened lol. Like “hey how was the beach?”
That ship has sailed

We're interested in what she thinks
can you update us when you find the dildo because I’m somehow the only one in the comments wondering how something like that vanishes
Thank you...and it sounds like you have a keeper.
There’s usually something we’re afraid to ask for, also what about using toys during? There’s a anal vibrating plug that is also a cock ring, a treat for the both of you ✨
#Goals
Where’s the update I don’t see it 🥲🥲 is it another post?
I have to agree with you here. Masturbating with a dildo in your ass just hits different
Thanks for the mental image OP 🍆
Damn that’s deep!
The pegging thing is only embarrassing if you let it embarrass you. Just own up to it and nine can hurt you. 

ps: it would be severely disappointing and a reason to have a long chat with your girlfriend if she told others. That’s a huge breach of trust.
Well if she tells your friends that she caught you enjoying your private time, that is a breach of trust. There is a plenty of embarrassing stuff I have done in front of my wife and my wife has done plenty in front of me and It would not cross my mind to flaunt it to my friends. 

I think you guys need to have a sex talk. It might be that your girl friend has become more open minded in past four years and is willing to make you feel good even if she does not get that much out of it (my horny grunts gave my wife a raging lady boner when she was pegging me, so it might be worth trying). Or maybe not, but then she just has to know that you enjoy your private time and you'd appreciate a heads up if she is heading home early.
Or just fucking laugh while admitting it's true and take the sting out of  the situation.
It looks like she didn’t tell anyone. And I get the initial worry/concern. 

My advice if word did get out. Own it mate. Pegging feels fucking amazing. 

It’s a huge level of intimacy between you and your girlfriend. AND multiple orgasms. 

Be confident, throw shit back at friends who make fun of you: “I am feeling pleasure beyond what I thought I could, I don’t really care what you think of it”.
My wife and her friends/co-workers have had casual chats about sexual preferences and kinks before. 
I'd previously told her I don't care if she discloses mine to them as well.
Apparently quite a few of them are jealous that she's gotten to peg me and that we're both into it among other things.
I guess they've told her they want to try these things too, but their boyfriends/husband's are too close minded to even consider trying it and other kinks.

So in reality it really doesn't matter if they did find out.
As others in this thread have stated, it really comes down to how you react and if you let it bother you.
Can you help me under this because I cant wrap my head around it. You like fucking yourself in the ass so much that you do it when you get alone time and while masturbating. And it seems like your story even has a happy ending for you! So why are you so ashamed and embarrassed of it? Obviously I know it’s a private thing and I dont think you should be sharing it with people voluntarily, but if it comes up why do you hide and deny something you enjoy and take pleasure in?
I’ll bet money she told them
I’m more than a little confused with how accepting people here seem to be of her coming in, laughing at him, and just leaving with no discussion at all? 

I don’t… really get that. 

Sure the image of that happening as it did is funny… 

But even if he was just normally jerking off or something with zero real reason to be worried about shame or embarrassment (aside from being startled and hitting his head) it’s kinda fucked to see your romantic partner masturbating, laugh at them, and then leave without saying anything. 

Am I wrong there?
If OP's update isn't him getting railed I'm gonna be so mad for him
Don’t stress. It’ll probably be alright and maybe even a bit eye opening for you guys. Fingers crossed for ya.
Please update when/if you find the horse
Yeah, if you plan on jerking it and going to town on your butthole at the same time, you should probably be aware if anyone else is home.
What time zone are you in? Lol
I love how excited you are to talk about this knowing this is(or was) your one big outlet to talk about it. 😂😂

Gz bud, the ending was pretty cute ngl
Science, perhaps?  Anatomical diagrams?  I feel like that's a lot of the reason I've always been open minded about a lot of stuff, I'm very science minded and based.  So in my mind, knowing about a prostate gland, yeah, it makes perfect sense that a man would enjoy anal penetration because it stimulates the prostate.  Cool, why would I judge him for that then.  I suppose I do also have some weird interests of my own but I don't think it makes me a freak so I guess that might help too lol.  But that's a pretty good starting point I think.  Hell, show her the comments here if you think it would help lol.  Only you know her well enough to judge whether she'd be upset you posted about this on the internet or not, and if that's something you should choose to directly share with her or not.  But yeah like being the type of person I am (tall and big, fairly masc, openly bisexual and genderfluid) back when I was on dating apps and stuff men would seek me out for stuff like this, hoping/assuming I would be kinky and into pegging and domme stuff.  And let me tell you, they are NUMEROUS, so you're definitely not alone in this.  Just none of you are aware of the others because almost all of you hide it lol
Look up the results of sexual surveys and academic research on the subject. 
Human sexuality is a widely researched subject. If you’re not anthropology-adjacent in some way, it might seem weird to google that that kind of stuff. I assure you, you are not weird at all, nor is this an unusual thing to do (masturbation, via a dildo, which focuses on anal stimulation/penetration). 

I’m sad that you have felt like you’ve had to hide this and horrified when envisioning the embarrassment you’re feeling (it is palpable), but also I’m glad that an opportunity has arisen to strengthen your connection and communication. 

Also, make sure you’ve taken care of your head if you hit it on the night stand - head injuries can be insidious.
Maybe you can show her this info from Ruby Rider. She's a get sex educator. She's amazing at her job and provides lots of information and context.

[https://peggingparadise.com/new-to-pegging/](https://peggingparadise.com/new-to-pegging/)

Or have her listen to this podcast by Ruby Rider.

At least it was your girlfriend not your mum, dad or Nana!
Best get off of Reddit and help her then buddy. Priority number 1, my ass. Hahahah see what I did? lol
That was... very detailed!
Sexual acts are just that. Acts. They don’t define your sexuality unless you legitimately show an interest in the same gender and whatnot. So yes agreed.
Oh my bad I didn’t see that. SHE TRIED IT? And liked it? Major W. I will never have the balls to bring this up to my wife
I have nothing to add to this except society sure is hung up on pleasure.
Pretty sure the internet has already decided whether they need to know, you just decided not to, uh, *fill* that need...
Hard disagree
Your girlfriend sounds like a keeper. Glad she’s being open minded.
Noice ✨
Under the dresser?! It must have ejected like a shot put.
How did the congregation react when you busted out that vow?
This is the best reply I've seen on here in weeks. I miss reddit gold
We all know he can take it. But whether or not the relationship can, only time will tell. 

Jokes aside I have come across manymany women who would be suuuper pumped about taking part in the butt, so I’m with ya, it’s not that weird.

They’ll be fine :)
And it all ends up on a porn site
Every time my wife walked in on me it was awkward. Not dildo balls deep in my ass awkward, but awkward either way. 

She wasn't mad. But it was awkward. Unfortunately She only offered assistance a couple times. Unlike pornography.
...coming soon to unethical life pro tips:
1. Get the fattest picture of your wife you can find
2. Setup sexy lighting
3. Wait until you hear her coming
4. Start moaning and fapping while staring at the picture and saying "I love you, i love you, i love you..."
5. Get laid while she still has tears in her eyes.

Also coming soon to r/deadbedrooms
She laughed then said it was weird and gross. She's clearly just being dismissive and belittling something he's into, she doesn't have to be into it but there's more respectful ways to communicate that.
Its not about what you think it's about what you say. You don't like it? That's perfectly fine. But calling your SOs sexual fetish gross is just flat out disrespectful and belittling.
Both I guess. Either/or. Hopefully the good kind.
Actually, that’s what I’m gonna do. What dildo? My ass? I don’t think so.

She just got home. I’ll update the post later.
TIL: my butthole turns into a black hole when I’m startled.
It rolled under the dresser.
It’s at the bottom of the post
>hits different

Literally
Good to hear that someone understands. Not sure if it’s worth it now though
You’re welcome.
Agree, 9” can hurt you.
She confirmed that she didn’t (and never would) tell anyone. And yeah, it’s time for another talk.
I can certainly try
Masturbating? No.  Getting spooked like a horse straight off a bed? Definitely.  That's like peak physical comedy.
It is.
Nahhhh he won
Girlfriend is currently looking for it. Current theory is it’s hiding under the bed.
Yeah, probably.
Yes OP break out the anatomy lecture slideshow to propose sex in a professional and scientific manner
Holy fuck I hadn’t thought of that, you’re right.
If I move that much there’s going to be more shit everywhere. And she said this is her punishment for laughing at me and then not doing anything to let me know she wasn’t upset. It’s unnecessary but I appreciate the gesture.
Send her this post, see what she thinks and go from there.
"Do you take this man, to love and to ram..."
I ❤️ sex-drugs, so that didn't even crack the top 10..
Hit the 3 dots on their comment…. You will find what you seek.
I seriously just laughed in the lobby of a car dealership! Who knew the acoustics in here were so….🥴
I miss you too buddy
“The fattest picture of your wife” is taking me out 💀💀💀
This right here gave me a good laugh 😂
"I love it when you tell me about your problems with your PC...oooh baby..."
While there are, laughter when one is nervous or uncomfortable isn't out of the ordinary though.
I don't think its really crazy for some people to think playing with the poop hole is gross though? Gross in the sense of potentially dirty (literally), not actually gross in the sense of messed up.

Like how some people think rimming is gross, others love it.
I don't see it as belittling or disrespectful.

It obviously depends how it's said though. If you say something like "I find all anal stuff to be gross" I don't think that's belittling or disrespectful

On the other hand if you say: "you are gross because you like anal" that would be disrespectful.
It's not disrespectful. Some people don't like people who stick things up their ass. Can't be mad at that
Fingers crossed for yah my guy lol
Lmao try and make it funny, and then be honest and open, at least I feel like that’s what I’d try
Follow your nose, it always knows.
I hear ya brother
💀
That’s awesome she’s a great partner and so are you. Best of luck
I'm sure you'll be good. She said that she didn't want to peg you but that shouldn't stop you riding away in your own time
But, like, in the good way
Just take it, like you take that dildo up your ass.
'MY GOD did you hear?! While we were both out, some stranger who looks similar to me broke in to the house and started doing strange things on the bed! Neighbours said they saw them running out of the house naked obviously startled by someone but when I got home there was noone here?!'
I really should’ve been more explicit in my comment I guess, gotten a few comments like this now. Lol. 

If you’re in a super accepting positive situation it’s definitely fucking hilarious.

But seeing your husband privately fucking himself with a dildo (even if you don’t remember calling it gross) and fall, hit himself, the dildo fall out of him slap stick style… 

And you just leave wordlessly after laughing. 

That’s pretty fucked up to literally drive somewhere and maintain radio silence the entire time. 

Literally anything said would’ve been better than that. 

It’s only really understandable in my mind if you are being judgmental and are okay conveying that. 

Sounds like that’s not the case here, which is to say she fucked up.
Go off king
Just get a new puppy, it'll find it immediately.
Lol "probably"

Look on the bright side, once the storm passes you should be able to arrange time for yourself alone whenever she has other plans and she knows not to come home early to interrupt.
Aww mate she’s a keeper!!
Well you did not FU.
"Bride, you may now begin pegging the groom."
What are sex-drugs?  You mean roofies?
I know... it is not the saaaaame
You're replying to my comment where I say it's perfectly fine to not want to, it's the way she said it
True. Some of the comments on reddit are just naive.

I remember one post where the op found her bf basically doing what was discribed above and wanted to dump him for it.

She got absolutely torn apart in the comments and told it was none of her business how he masterbated.

Well the thing is. It is. You need to be compatible and if your partner is into something you majorly find gross, than you need to ask is that a viable relationship if we are not meeting all of each others need? I find anal/anal play absolutely disgusting. I really dont like it. And whilst im not bothered if others like it, i become bothered if im in a relationship with them. Because i dont want it as part of my relationship and it will start to affect my opinion of them. And i know that i will basically dump them for it.

So now im really blunt and tell them straight up about it, mainly because its unfair on me as it is just such a deep instinct on my part (i find it dirty and gross), which is weird because im not exactly vanilla. But mainly because my reaction will be unfair on them. Ill be asking them to repress and hide it amd that's not on.

No one owes anyone justification for their preferences and it is absolutely not a democracy.
Thanks…
It's easier to fit then in the butt when crossed
Can confirm
Or ask your mother if she could clean your room, she would find it instantly
Her name was Peggy
As Relative says, stims, mdma, edibles and lately LSD 🤌
This is true. While a good comment, I can’t justify paying any money to upvote a giant dildo up anyones ass, even my own. Poor man’s gold works too… 🏆🥇🥈🥉🏅🎖️🏵️

I do miss the old setup.
Exactly. It's normal to find some stuff grosses you out and there's nothing wrong with expressing that even when you're talking to someone that likes that stuff.
That is the sweetest update I’ve seen in a while. Your girlfriend is loving. Because this is new to her, she might react a bit different first, solely because she doesn’t even KNOW how to react. Be prepared to get teased about it from time to time, it’s a common reaction to spouses trying to understand their SO’s kinks. But remember she supports you.
I hope your dreams of getting pegged comes true..
https://youtu.be/OslWqLHlCvw?si=TbDM0M8Az9Tu9pFd
If there were anything to get me to shell out real money on this site, it would be a giant dildo up someone's ass for lols. I am a simple man.
She’s trying, so that’s a start. Even she she ends up saying no at least I know she’s not judging me.
You know, don’t blame ya there. There may be better sites for that tho 😭

Times have changed lol
She’s a fucking keeper dude, not many women would react in such an awesome way.
Possibly. But it is never as funny as it is on here. The giggle switch is located right next to the prostate.
TIFU by accidentally buying 109 pounds of grapes and things just went downhill from there.
The store I shopped at last week had a special on grapes, $2 a box. But no way to weigh the boxes, they have the kind of scale that hangs from three chains, and the boxes didn't fit in them. 

So I got 4 boxes of grapes. Large boxes, I wanted them to make a batch of wine. For $8 it was a steal.

The first thing I did after leaving the store was get the shopping cart stuck in a rut in the parking lot and I couldn't pull it back out. A stranger helped get me out.

Then I got home, and was able to weigh them. A 5 gallon batch of wine uses 50-80 pounds of grapes. I had 109 pounds. Oops.

Okay, so I hand pressed the grapes through a rack meant for cooling cookies. 3 hours later, I have enough mash to fill my 5 gallon fermentation bucket. And there are still more than half the grapes in my fridge!

I decided to embrace the FU, and made jam with one of the cases. I was at least happy to have a reason to use that no/low sugar pectin I bought a few years ago. 4 hours later, I got 22 pints of jam.  2 quarts didn't fit in the canner, I just tossed them in the fridge with screw on lids, but the rest is all set for the pantry. But - none of it actually jelled, the directions said it might take a few hours or overnight to get thick, but nope. The pectin must have been too old (2018). I'm gonna have to unseal all the jars and recook it with sugar and can it again. And I still got like 30 pounds of grapes in the fridge.

So I decided to turn my canner into fermentation bucket #2 and make 5 extra gallons of wine, with the brilliant idea that I can use some of the unjelled jars of grapes to top it off since I'll be a little short, and that will save me some reprocessing time with the jam.

4 more hours of hand smashing grapes and that bucket's full. Or almost, I do have to top it off with the liquid nonjam jam. I figure I'll start with the two quarts from the fridge that never got sealed, I grab them from the basement. WTF, they aren't liquid, they are full-on jelly now. The fuckers jelled up in the fridge. So now I realize I can't use them, and can't use any of the others that are still liquid at room temp because I can't have my wine jelling up if I refrigerate it. 

Somewhere in there I realized the store gave me a senior discount for being over 60, which I didn't ask for, and it's not a store with a loyalty card where they'd have my birthday on file. The cashier was just like, yeah, this one's obviously over 60, don't need to card her. (I've been 60 for like 2 weeks.) That was especially demoralizing because I'd just been trying on dresses from my closet to see if they still fit, for an event I am going to this Wednesday, and was feeling smug because they DID fit, and I was thinking I look good in them, I was specifically thinking I don't look anywhere near 60. Pffft, wrong about that. I look old.

I got a call from the event host today asking where I was. I wrote down the date wrong, the event was yesterday and I missed it. 

And I need to buy either more grapes or more juice to finish the second bucket of wine. 

TLDR: Accidentally bought 50+ pounds more grapes than I needed, everything I did to try to use them backfired and now I need more grapes to save the ones I used. My ego ended up even more crushed than the grapes after being given the unsolicited old lady discount.
They write math problems about you
when I was a cashier I would give the seniors discount out to customers who were nice to me, just because it was a small way I could show my appreciation and have any control in my day lol. probably was that.
what store sells 109 pounds of grapes for $8?
I've never seen someone from Stardew Valley post here. So cool! Do Starfruit next.
You’re my hero and I want to be like you in 25 years
Whoa my God, this story is amazing.
This is so good. It's the kind of stuff you would find in a random passage from a Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett novel. Love it.
This is probably my favorite TIFU ever. It’s giving Amelia Bedilia meets I Love Lucy. Here’s hoping the next batch of grapes is a little less chaotic 💜
>I got a call from the event host today asking where I was. I wrote down the date wrong, the event was yesterday and I missed it. 

Some wine should help you forget the pain of missing it.
Guess what everyone is getting for Christmas! Wine! Grape jelly! Grape soup! Grape... Nuts?

I'd be exhausted and could never have half the dedication to processing 109 lbs of anything. Good on you! And maybe you got the discount because the cashier thought you were cute.
This sounds like the terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad days (a La that Alexander boom/movie) that I have occasionally 😂. On the plus side, Frozen grapes are a great snack on a hot day, or used in smoothies, also perfect as ice cubes in drinks, especially wine or cocktails!
At least it wasn't [$240 worth of pudding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikbPoVbOB_E)
8 dollars for A HUNDRED AND NINE POUNDS OF GRAPES?!

  
What?!

8 dollars gets me about 3 lbs of grapes. You are buying grapes at a 97% discount. That's absurd.
Wow, as an amatuer home winemaker, I'd love to buy 100 lbs of grapes for $ 8. And as an old fart, I'm betting you will look GREAT at your event.
I have never been this delighted reading a long post before. Great story!
Now we need Lucy tromping the grapes barefoot.
**I hope you own a lemonade stand and a Duck walks up to you**
This is a wonderful calamity. But the discount was the real kicker.  I’m almost fifty and though I haven’t been given a discount yet I used to get shocked responses from people when I gave my age which was much older than I looked.  At some point no one was shocked anymore.  What can you do but laugh or cry.  I prefer laugh so thanks for sharing this.  And cheers.
Thank you for being the person we hear about in math class.
You have ADHD, don't you.  This is the kind of shenanigans my ADHD kid is known for.
Next time, freeze some! They're a great summer snack!
This is fantastic. 

It’s all gone hilariously wrong, but at least it’s a good story.
The next time someone asks me to explain what it's like to have ADHD, I'm going to send them this post.
I mostly see awesome wins here! Well apart from missing the event, you still fit in your dresses and look good, got a killer deal on grapes, the jelly you thought you messed up just need to be jelled up in the fridge, you got nearly 5 extra gallons of wine and 22 pints of jelly you didn`t account for, and you even got the Senior discount you were entitled to despite completely forgetting to mention it to the cashier! You should be really proud of the fruits of your labour and being a savvy shopper :)   
   
You might also be popular amoung friends and family if you give them a freakin low-sugar guilt-free homemade pint of jelly or a quart of wine
You might already know this but food grapes don't make good wine at all 😅
You’re amazing. Thank you for sharing your FU.
I’d hate to be the first person to call you after all this started
109 lbs of grapes for $8! Where i live it’s like $8 a lbs! No joke.  This is the kind of TIFU i want, and would absolutely go buy more grapes. Everybody I know would get something grape themed for a gift.
Making wine out of grocery store bought eating grapes is, let's say, suboptimal from the beginning....
So then I got this idea about driving a cheesecake truck...

https://youtu.be/9inOtq0Ayek?si=nqEvqotsa3hUO6aj
This is the most real TIFU I’ve ever read.

You might say… you’re in a jam! Badum-tss! I’ll see myself out
When I was a cashier as a teenager I would give every discount I could to people. Senior discount? Yup. Father's day discount for dads even though it was a woman? Yup. We didn't have to keep the coupons and all the barcodes were the same so anytime someone would bring in a 20% off coupon I would use it for any customer that was nice to me.
This post was all over the place lol.
I don't know about you but this story sounds amazing to me! I want to be this cool and occupied with my time when I am 60!
This might be the best TIFU post I've ever read, it's a cascade of horrible grape-related events (and one bonus existential crisis)... I'm just glad the jam wasn't for the missed event. Hope that posting this will end the grape curse!
I keep getting 6–8 bunches of bananas instead of 6–8 bananas. Different online grocery ordering systems use different methods. Now I have a freezer full of bananas. No senior discount, although I could almost qualify …
Just beware - pectin is fermentable, but it ferments into methanol and not ethanol
![gif](giphy|1VFF7MnrcXGW4)
Sometimes the juice just isn't worth the squeeze.
Aren’t wine grapes different
This is the kind of thing I would do in the fits of peak ADHD hyper focus, but I’d end up sitting on the floor crying at some point when it ran out 😂
Ypu spent $8 and got some good out of it. Eve. If you had spent $8 and eaten grapes to your hearts content and lots ended up as compost I don't think you would have screwed up. You saved a lot of food from being wasted any which way you look at it
If it makes you feel any better I got a senior discount one day after buying Cadbury eggs and a bottle of wine for dinner when I was 23.
I have gotten two hours of sleep awake with my newborn and am at my wits end. This made me laugh out loud, so thank you for improving my night/morning 😂😂😂
It’s ok, you’re only into this for $8.  Keep that in mind.  Live…… Laugh…… Lug home 100 pounds of grapes 🤷‍♂️.
This was quite a ride!

I send hugs from another old lady on the Internet who looks 40 in her own head.
Your endless chain of fucking up reminds me of my own.
“When will I ever use this math in the real world”?
When the make a movie about this it's just a damned shame that Lucille Ball isn't around to star as you
This almost sounds like part two of an ornamental gourd futures investment.
Bahahahahaha I'm sorry OP, but thank you. You have given me a flash of my future and it's weirdly comforting
I'm so sorry but this is the funniest thing I've seen on reddit in a long time 😭
you are an incredible storyteller and I wish you the absolute best in everything
As a retail worker, sometimes I give out discounts just bc I like the customer but you can't tell them and make it obvious or someone might over hear you and demand a discount as well so maybe it wasn't because of your age and just because of your great personality
You're crushing grapes to make your own wine and jam and fitting into your old clothes! You're crushing life!
A duck walks up to the lemonade stand
I need a week long nap after just reading about your single day. How do people have so much energy?
Am I the only one wondering where OP got over 100 lbs of grapes for 8$? 🤷
Groceries ain't cheap these days.
You're making wine and jam... You're looking pretty good for 60 over here.  Just saying. 

Keep gettin' down wit' yo bad self. 

You might want to add some pectic enzyme or pectin enzyme to the wine must.   It helps reduce cloudiness when using real fruit. 

Also if you make another batch fresh, try freezing the fruit first to burst the cell walls inside.  Yeah you might not want to freeze 100 lbs, but even freezing some can increase juice yield.
What a roller coaster!
lol, if you can send some to cali, I'll buy some wine or jelly.
Those young sweet cashiers see people older than they actually are. I know I did. Ah youth!
I really love your dedication of leaned/dove in head first into your initial FU and tried to do something with more or less a person's weight worth of grapes.
This is a lemonade stand
I feel like all of this screams 60. 
I remember seeing your earlier post about the grapes! I love every bit of this story. Good luck! 😅
You deserve a good laugh after this ordeal. Go read this story and please let us know your thoughts after reading it.
https://x.com/nameshiv/status/1301521850552315904?t=QkPUsOGA5ZKfHOp1_9PL_g&s=19
Question I have is how is table grapes for making wine? Aren't they different varieties?
Get some pectinase/pectic enzyme to add to the jelly that set but wasn't canned. If you make wine already, you probably already have it for clearing haze. That's the same pectin that sets jams and jellies.
The low: no sugar pectin sucks imho!! We have tried it several times and it’s never worked for us. it simply doesn’t work!
I feel like the venn diagram of people who buy 109 lbs of grapes to make wine, and people who crush grapes for making wine by manually pushing them through a cooling rack, is two circles where one circle is in NYC and the other is on mars

OP, you're a beast
I feel into that spider web of disjointed thoughts. I hope all the things worked out. Of course I have to erase any memory of you lest the "ideas" rub off on me.
I love this so much. I am sympathetic to your grape dilemmas too.
I don't know why but I imagined all of this story as if it had been directed by Wes Anderson... and it was great!
I know this one duck that would love you
Guess you're not the fox complaining about sour grapes
What a glorious journey
You bought 100+lbs of grapes for $8? 
Soon, a duck will waddle up to you and ask: “Got any grapes?” …
Are you Lee Mack?
I’m sorry, 4 HOURS of hand crushing grapes? I both salute and fear you 🫡
Don’t worry about the seniors discount. It’s like when they card people who are obviously older that the drinking age but in reverse. If you look under 25, they card you. Over and you get the discount
You could get a 3 gallon carboy or a smaller bucket rather than getting more grapes. It’s ok if the bucket isn’t full during fermentation - the co2 will prevent oxidation - so you’ve got a few weeks to figure it out. You might end up being able to use the extra bucket worth to top up the bigger batch after you rack off all the junk that settles after fermentation.
I know somebody who accidentally bought 25 pounds of tofu. 

You guys are brave🫡😆
What kind of grapes did you buy from the store? My grocery store only sells table grapes, the kind with edible skins.

You'd need the other kind of grapes like Concord grapes, whose skins slip off easily and who are mostly unpleasant to eat raw.
I dunno, you might be on to something.  I don't really like jelly and jam, but wine jelly might be enough to convert me.  I do like some of the homemade ones, but not the store bought stuff.  PB and Cabernet Sauvignon sandwiches sound pretty delicious.  Can you turn this into a happy accident and make wine jelly?
I'm just stuck here trying to figure out how you managed to pay $8 for 109lbs when grapes on a good day at the grocery are $2.50/lb
Nice. If you had use the "jelly" for a batch of wine, that would have resulted in some rocket fuel...damn now I wanna make wine out of jelly....
The cashier may have been trying to be nice. I've heard of people who give anyone the discount as long as they don't look like kids.
You got 109 lbs of grapes for $8??
Stu, a Gross is 144 Eggs
heyy, well atleast this story entertained a lot of us lol  
P.S pls stop feeling bad getting old. Ageing is BEAUTIFUL. capitalism has demonized it so bad. these 60 years of your life is an accomplishment, and your experiences are shown by your appearance. that is literally nothing to feel bad about!
Thank you for making me laugh when I really needed it
You sound like a cool person who's into cool things, I want to hang out with you. 
Were you drinking wine while you were doing all this ? LOL
Show us the dress grandma!
When life gives you grapes…..
On the other hand…I think I can get onboard with wine jelly 🤔
There was a r/BestofRedditorUpdates about a woman who accidently multiplied a bread recipe by 4.

You could open up a lemonade stand.

I don't know if you look your age or not, but your dedication to your hobbies and your work ethic is admirable/attractive!
I would love if my fuckups included so much wine.
You had the PERFECT opportunity to say things just went sour from there and you missed it!
I’m a winemaker. Are you fermenting on the skins?  You’re going to lose about 25-30% of your volume once you press off the skins. If you don’t top up your second fermenter now, you’ll finish with about one full vessel with no headspace, which is the goal or else your wine will oxidize and have a VA spike.

Also, in case you weren’t aware, grocery store grapes aren’t nearly high enough quality or sugar to make typical wine. You’re likely only going to yield about 7-9% alcohol and it won’t taste like normal wine because table grapes lack tannin and character that wine grapes have. That doesn’t mean it won’t be enjoyable—just adjust your expectations acccordingly.

If you have any more technical questions I’d be happy to answer.
> That was especially demoralizing because I'd just been trying on dresses from my closet to see if they still fit, for an event I am going to this Wednesday, and was feeling smug because they DID fit

How old is that dress? Congratz on fitting in a dress, but if it was from your younger days, you probably accidentally dated yourself via fashion...
As a brewer/vintner/distiller I would VERY much like to know where you got 100 lbs of grapes for $8.
$8 for 108lb of grapes? Are these food grade? This story smells fishy;)
Is your name Amelia Bedelia?
Your own personal Grapes of Wrath.
Things were out of your control. See if the jelly can be made into a desert with ice-cream? Maybe it's an unexpected treat. When life gives you grapes...don't wrath about it. Have to laugh at this point. It really wasn't your fault. Good luck. Can also make raisins if you end up with extra grapes next time and make some cakes or muffins as gifts if you like. I recently made too Much coulis and I'm mixing it with sparkling water and it's quite a nice drink and goes a long way. Similar thing happened to me so I'm just smiling and waving.
How to tell me you’re another member of the adhd club without saying “I’m adhd”. Haha, welcome friend. We all forgot to organize a main dish but we have a lot of snacks and drinks on the table. No chairs because why bother - none of us sit still.
   A few years ago for Xmas I wanted a Ham for the fam. simple. I ordered the fam ham on instacart and it specified what weight. I guess 8 lbs should be about right.

   The family was all over and we were having a jolly time. Lol and behold the Instacart driver shows up and I can see the copious amount of deli thin sliced ham bags from afar. 

 The sheer horror 

I didn't make a scene as the whole family was in the room having fun, excited about the ham for fam dinner. 

I ordered a couple pizzas and told everyone my oven was broken. lol.
however you are a heck of a good story teller!
Sheeesh gran, go write a book. (I'd buy it and read it)

Hello there.
I'm sorry this all happened to you but you sound like a really fun person and I enjoyed reading this.
Do you....have any lemonade?
This might be one of the funniest stories I’ve read on here. I could see it playing out in my mind it felt like a comedy sketch lmao.
Lady I’ll just buy you a couple bottles of wine
This is wholesome and funny. I love it
The pectin issue is not you. The amount they tell you to use is ridiculously low. I learned that the hard way and had to redo a huge batch, too. Once you figure it out, it’s good… but that was not a great discovery.
I laughed through this entire story. Thanks for the giggles. Please let us know how your wine turns out.
Gotta admire the commitment to not letting the grapes go to waste. And hand pressing grapes through a cookie rack, damn. Years later I still whinge about hand squeezing maybe a fourth of a pound of lemons for homemade margarita mix
That low sugar pectin is unlikely to work well with grape jelly. It works better with jams that have the crushed fruit in them, not jellies that start with juice. It also might depend on what kind of grapes you got. Most grape jellies are made from concord grapes, which aren't usually used for wine. Good luck!
Young cashiers don't know shit about age. A rule at a place I worked was, if they look like they're your parent-- just give them the discount. We routinely gave it to 30+.
No offense but it sounds like you had your first senior moment better watch out for those in the future.

Don't feel bad about it I have already experienced those and I'm only in my 30's.I blame mine on a side effect of one of my medicines (it is a side effect unfortunately but I have to take it).
![gif](giphy|llbEoVMhkLngWlzVVa|downsized)
I got about halfway through before just howling with laughter. OP this is comedy gold lmao
I would of made a lot of the extra into just grape juice. Fresh grape juice is the bomb.
I want to know more about the event or is that another post?
That's what you get for listening to redditors about how easy making wine is...
I was expecting you to have eaten a load of grapes and them deciding to cause an explosive rear end incident. So, at least that wasn't the case!
I think I'd do juice with anything left and call it a day. Maybe buy a bottle of wine to relax with... 🤣
What happens if you fridge the pantry jars?
For what it's worth, you sound like a cool old lady. I hope you manage to salvage your minor disaster.
Do you have the 5 one gallon bottles?
You're amazing
On the good side, you have a year worth of wine. And 2+ years of jam.

But what kind of shop are you going to that's giving away grapes for 6-7kg a dollar?

I couldn't steal grapes for that cheap.
this is for sure an original experience
Was the jelly any good?
why the f then they sell grapes for like $9.99 for a 2 lb at grocery shop then, where is this $2 boxes of 25 lbs
You know, i wanna laugh, but i just feel sad for you. Im sorry, OP.
Just go to bed and restart tomorrow.
How the hell did you get 100+ pounds of grapes for 8$??

I'm lucky if a 2lbs box is 8$.
Saving this for future math problems in homeschool based on you
I feel like if canning something didn't go perfectly right the first time it'd probably best to just throw it out than to try and redo it? But then again I don't can things so what do I know? Don't listen to me.
Use Turbo yeast for the rest, makes wine Fast and after 2 weeks it's like 20% alcohol, does that make it a liqueur? Still blow your head off strong for wine.
Best tifu post I’ve ever read. Your misfortune made me giggle. I genuinely hope you enjoy your wine :)
109 pounds of grapes for $8?????
Sounds like you have some problems that could be solved with 109 pounds of grape wine.
She has grapes and wrinkles
Where the hell do you live that you could buy 109 lbs of grapes for $8?! That's like 3-4lbs where I live. For green seedless anyway
This was such a pleasure to read. Thank you for your artful prose.
i can say, with no question, that i love you!!!

seriously.
They need to make a movie about this. Story is 100% more interesting than anything produced out there right now
You could just make the biggest jello wine shot of all time?
I'm gonna try making jam now.
Can we be friends?
Peanut butter and jellied wine sandwich
This could easily be a copy pasta.

Fucking hilarious
Good lord I’m wheezing this is hilarious! Im dos sorry about your luck, some days/weeks it really is that way where nothing goes right. Hopefully you will shuck off the curse of being the star in an overly exaggerated infomercial soon
I know a certain duck that would be interested in this deal
This made me laugh.. thanks for sharing!
Put the juice in jars with really tight lids.
That's an amazing deal and I also wouldn't have been able to resist.

I think it was the low sugar pectin that messed you up. That stuff is unpredictable as heck.
i dont even see the fuck up lmao
This would happen to me tbh
I think you missed a great opportunity to be the inventor of jelly wine. I'm going to add that to my list of things to do as soon as I stop scrolling Reddit!
Fermenter doesn't have to be full for it to work, once the bubbling starts the co2 will push the oxygen out
Mfer got micro transacted. In game currency can never be fully spent.
Experience is what you gain when you didn't get what you wanted.
You and my mom would be best friends. Better luck next time I guess lol. Hope your wine is good!
Oh my. If I were your friend I’d make you a cup of tea/coffee and we would laugh until we cried. Thank you for sharing this with us!
I bet she gave you the senior discount because you're really cool and nice, and she wanted to do something nice for you.
Please update this so it can become a [BORU](http://reddit.com/r/bestofredditorupdates), lol
Where in this world does 109 pounds of grapes cost $8???  You are using pounds and $ so I’m assuming USA?
This doesn’t have any sex or revenge who cares?
Holy shit I wish I had this much free time. You are living the life!
Bro’s making wine out of Welch’s
Did the boxes not list the weight on the side? When I worked at a grocery store all the boxes of produce had the approximate weight printed on the box.
When I worked retail and I had a customer who was kind to me, I always gave them any sort of discount I could. 

I wouldn't take it personally because you do sound awful nice! 

I hope your wine and jam are wonderful!
This is gonna be some interesting wine.
I'll have what you're having
I lost track of how many times I have spent money trying to save money😆
Throw it all away. Be done with it.
This sounds like a mistake I would make. AND I’m 30 but I’d be thrilled if they gave me the senior discount — perhaps the cashier was just being nice since they could give you a few bucks off without having to really check anything!
Not sure this qualifies as a 'FU' - seems more of a 'MessedUp'
I make mead; send me 4 gallons of juice, and I'll brew up a pyment and split it with you.
I love the way you write and I’m sorry but I was shocked to get to the part where you said you’re 60. I bet you don’t seem like it in person
I don’t know if you feel amazing after all this, but I think you’re absolutely amazing.
Does wine from store-bought grapes even taste good? Some varieties are bred to taste better when eaten, and others to taste better when fermented. I've tried making wine from concord grape juice and it wasn't great
It’s ok to throw out some grapes you got for $8. It happens. You don’t have to make 75 pounds of jam. 
Stay tuned. The story takes a dark turn when OP discovers that wine grapes and jelly grapes aren’t the same as table grapes.
You could still make wine jelly.
Is this a specialty store with grapes for wine? You wouldn’t typically make wine with grocery store grapes.
Oh gosh, this all sounds so frustrating! I’m rooting for your life to get better! Also, perhaps it wasn’t that the cashier thought you looked old, maybe you were just incredibly pleasant to check out and they gave you a discount to say thank you? When I was a cashier, I’d definitely slip extra coupons in for people who were patient with me when the line was slow or as I fixed a problem for them.
Do you have adhd? This how most of my cooking adventures go no matter how diligent I am. Does sound like you know what you’re doing and just had one of those days. It happens, and hopefully you’ll be able to laugh about this!
This is the funniest shit I've read all day! Amazing. I wish a satisfying conclusion to your grape endeavor.
I feel you OP.  Between my horticultural pursuits and my still I've had some pretty epic screw ups.
This is one of those good news-bad news stories.  At least you’ve got some of each.
You got 100lb+ of grapes for $8? 
Did I read that right? 
Where can I do that?!
I have no idea what happened here and I love it.
We have Amish produce auctions around us. There are only two outcomes from them, you pick up cheap produce or you don't bid and look at people like they are insane for paying the prices they are. When the produce goes cheap it's hard not to get caught up and buy a lot. I should add there are no small amounts, everything is generally by the box. Last year my MIL went to one. She called me, "do you want some zucchini?" The answer was yes, because who says no? She shows up to my house with 4, yes four, 40 pound boxes of zucchini. When she kept bringing them in the house I thought we were dividing those up for people. I was wrong, they are all for me. She bid on and won 12 boxes. The total was $24 for all 12. At the end of two weeks we had made/froze zucchini everything and still had two boxes left. Do you know that it only takes about one zucchini to make any baked good with zucchini? 🙄 I found a recipe for zucchini pickles both dill and sweet. So I made a bunch of those until I ran out of jars. To get rid of the last box I randomly left piles on our friend's and neighbor's porch!
You can freeze grapes. They are so good as a snack and taste a little bit sweeter than if they are in the refrigerator. Unless you have an industrial sized freezer, you can't freeze as much as you got. This sounds like an episode of I Love Lucy.
i think it's ok to take an $8 loss.
Just out of curiosity is that white wine or red?
That reminds me of the time I picked over 200 lb of strawberries with the intent of making wine. Ended up making 35 gallons of strawberry wine. Makes a wonderful vinegar now.
Why did this post make me giggle the whole way through 😆
This reminds me of my first harvest in my newly purchased home that came with 12 grape vines.  That was a lot of grapes 😆 🤣
That’s a lot of grapes …
I have been given a senior discount. I am barely in my 30s so it has nothing to do with looks. I think the cashier just does it on senior discount day for all or by accident.
Comes to us all in the end.
Where do you shop? Grapes are like $2.99 a pound. I could use a good deal
I'm just picturing the lady who fell off the stand when they were stomping grapes.

heh
How does someone pick up a 25lb box and not even realize how heavy it is, let alone 4 of them.
Where did you get grapes so cheaply? Which part of the world? Less than 10c a pound?!
Wine in the making.
Yup, this is about how Curse of Grapes is supposed to manifest.  Exactly.
I'm pretty sure you're the reason I failed Algebra.
This is an amazing story, and I hope you laugh about it for a long time to come!
are you a duck?
I felt tired already after reading your TIFU.
I’m new to TIFU, so all I can think of is to suggest that one always have fresh pectin in the kitchen.
In my head, grape jelly? I didn't have luck with grape jelly. Maybe Opie does, though.
Math problems around the world wish they were you
Don't be ridiculous. You look great. Any experienced cashier knows that nobody under 60 buys that many grapes at once.
😂 😂 😂 I thought OP meant British pounds 😂 😂 😂
Add acidity to the jam, it helps pectin set. Just a little drop of red wine vinegar (Id say use half a teaspoon per jars worth)
I usually buy a lot of grapes to make pies and other assorted bake goods. usually I'll precook and freeze the jam and defrose. Only reason I say this is to indicate I buy grapes in bulk on the regular. for you next batch, I would recommend using a hand held potato masher. Thats the best tool that my family has found for mashing the grapes.
You just need a box turtle
![gif](giphy|St9zG2xh41k2r1JxGl|downsized)
Sounds like you need another carboy or whatever it is you ferment your mash in
You got… 109 lbs of grapes.. for 8 American dollars?

What kind of crack was the person doing the pricing that day smoking?

And how big were those boxes??
Wait, so you bought some grapes. And then what?
how did you win and still end up losing
Were they even proper wine grapes or just random grocery store grapes
Are you me from the future?
i also read the dehydrating tomatoes post, you sound like SUCH an entertaining person!
makes me wanna buy grape and make jam out of it now
This comment genuinely made me laugh
Jenny had 6lb + 40x and add two = xyz + 14. What does Jenny now have?
This.

If my child will ever complain about how unrealistic math problems are, I will tell him about you, OP. Thanks for the proof!
This is an SAT question for an essay…. Not just a kiddy question!
I tell people I'm the person they warned you about in math class. I tend to buy things in ridiculous quantities. 50lbs of oranges, 4 bushels of peaches, 20 flats of strawberries, 25 trees in gallon pots, 15 bags of apples, 80 lbs of tomatoes... all things I've drug home in the last year. My poor husband just shakes his head and starts unloading my van. Life is interesting at our house, lol.
This comment has now embedded this story in my mind forever. Every time my kids bring me a fruit related math problem, I'll think of OP and her grapes.
This has to be the best comment on Reddit ATM, amazing work good sir. I laughed a whole minute straight from that single sentence.
Damn this isn't /r/roastme and now I feel bad for laughing
the story was funny, but your comment is fucking hilarious
I got that one wrong
Haha good one!
Fucking RIIIIIP 😵
I'm doing math with unknown variables and word problems right now... and this was my first thought
You win the internet today.. best response ever
I busted out laughing WAY too loud in my public office after reading this comment. Thanks for that! 👏🤣
If opp purchases 109 pounds of grapes, and can jelly 20 pounds.   If Opp can also use 1/3 of the grapes for wine, how quickly will opp experience a grape related psychosis?
Im literally cackling I'm the break room at work 😂😂😂😂😂
This person is the epitome of hotdogs vs buns.
I came here to say this 😂
This made me smile. Please have an upvote to go along with your other 10.3k
It even has the irrelevant information about her age at the end to throw you off the important pieces of information
You are clever lmao
I hope that's all it was, I was smiling at least at the checkout because the grapes were so cheap (and I hadn't gotten stuck yet with the cart). 

Even if you just made this up, it was nice of you to post it!
Can confirm, the only CS job I had I didn’t do this with was when I worked front desk for a hotel. Best believe though I would bend over backwards trying to see if I could get them discounts or anything else, if your nice to me at 3am when not a soul wants to be awake let alone polite ima do everything I can to make you happy😂
The cashiers at my Savers often gave me (and I’m sure many others) the senior discount on their senior discount day and I’m only in my 30s.
Bless you.
Exactly. I worked somewhere that had a discount in our system that we would be refunded by that company at the end of every month it was anywhere from 5-15% off your order. So if you were a regular customer, nice, had a car full of children, or if I just felt nice that day, I’d give it out.

So I wouldn’t feel “bad” about getting some sort of discount, the teller may have just been in a good mood that day and you reaped the benefits.
When I worked in fast food, nice customers and the polite younger teens got our 10% "hero" discount meant for military members for the same reason
What is a senior discount? Why is it a thing?
Someone put an extra zero on their order sheet and the option was to sell them cheap or throw them away when they start molding
I’m so confused by this post because of that. It seems like a fuck Ton of grapes too. Like what is the area that fills up, how big is a 25+ pound box of grapes even? Where tf can you get a 25 pound box of grapes for $2?!
Yeah why have a vinyard? Apparently one acre of vines produces 4 tons of grapes, you could get 4 tons of grapes at this price for $640. 
She made another post about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/32dollars/s/95491zhsRD

The store was called Joe Randazzo’s or something like that, never heard of it
I am jealous. Where I am from that will cost ya around €220
3 pound clam shell at my local grocery store runs you $9
I was able to get about 10 lb of strawberries for about $5 once to go off, but that does sound kind of crazy.
LMAO glad I scrolled far enough for this, thank you
I’m screaming omg
All I read is that this person made two batches of wine and a shitload of jelly for $16 and still is inexplicably able to fit into their slim clothes.

If that’s not success…
Oh my gosh, this made me laugh!
Same, but it's mostly because I'm only 11 years behind OP and can relate too much lol.
Its like a short film
This is 100% the kind of thing that would happen to my mother- who is now 80+.   And this story has me crying laughing.   I can picture all of it.   

Even better is that she used to make wine and still makes jams and jellies and I can literally hear her mumbling as she would go through this.  Thank you for the nostalgia hit.
This may be one of the best TIFU's ever. Different perspective,  well written, no dildo suction cupped to a family member's headboard...
I can’t tell if it’s just cause I’m high or if that really was a feature-length film script set for Hollywood 🤣🤣🤣
The rare TIFU where it actually seems real.
I'm picturing David Sedaris making wine in his flat. Hopefully with a parrot parroting the grumbles through his shenanigans.
Plus grade school math textbook question...
No, please don't use not-ice in cocktails that call for ice! Cocktails that call for ice are engineered so that the water from the melting ice enhances the drink. If you don't put real ice in them, you end up with a bad drink.
I don't know what that was, but I'm definitely gonna make the husband watch it tomorrow.
Is that Michael Ian Black? Oh my god, he's such a baby!
Ahhhh yeahhh
Check out OP's post history, she is an avid extreme couponer. This appears to be the current deep discount that she has found.
I just can't help but imagine OP buying $2 a box grapes and rather than taking a little carton box, she just took the whole crates? hilarious to think about
Yeah, I could get them for $2 a pound on sale, and think it was good deal.
Seriously where the fuck can I buy grapes so goddamn cheap
I missed the event because I wrote the date wrong on my calendar. Thank god they called me, though, to ask where I was - because I would have appeared at their doorstep on the wrong day otherwise, all dressed up and expecting a party. 

I don't even know what's worse, to show up and have them home to witness my awkward arrival on the wrong day, or the soul crushing feeling of showing up to a party and nobody even being home.
Did you stop reading or what?

Got any nails?
It’s funny how aging happens in fits and starts. Five or ten years looking mostly the same- then you wake up one day looking like you had a *really* rough night, but surprise! You just aged 5 years overnight and that’s your new face/hair saying hello. 

For most of my friends it was in the 45-50 age range that we all went from “wow you’re how old?!” to “mmm yeah”. (TBH I do still get people thinking I’m younger but it’s not physical… I’m just an immature dipshit still and I think they just assume I aged like milk lol)
When I was 30, folks thought I was 20; when I was 40 they thought I was 30; when I was 50, oh wait....
I wish I had the freezer space! Another redditor talked me into making cucumber sorbet a few weeks ago and I made a lot thinking it wouldn't take that long for the two of us to eat it - but my husband refuses to even try it.
Yes! I have cotton candy grapes in the freezer right now. If it wasn't so late I'd go get some, cause they should so good now. But I should already be trying to sleep, lol
I think I'll be okay with that part at least. I've made pear wine and apple wine (both excellent), and grape wine before from cases of mystery green grapes that came out good. The only batch I really didn't like was pumpkin wine, and I should have taken it as a sign they don't sell pumpkin juice like they do grape or apple.
This isn't true. I have my own vine. I don't know the variety, but it's definitely a table grape rather than a wine grape and it makes perfectly fine wine. Won't be winning any awards, but it's good enough to drink.
I've never felt such a strong connection to a cartoon before!
ok, that's not what I'm going for!
Underrated comment.
[deleted]
lol. That's how I feel when I remember going to work every day. If you're doing that, and/or raising children, I salute you!
Oooh, I like that last comment. That makes sense to me - it's the reason I hate frozen vegetables. People always say to just roast them, they're good, but no. The cell structure is ruined when you freeze them, and you can't undo the damage by roasting. But it makes sense I'd want to do that for juice!
I never even thought about what it does, I just add it because the wine recipes say to. 

I had to order a second mesh bag for this nonsense and threw in some more sanitizer and pectic enzyme while I was at it, so I'm well stocked at the moment. If I just have the normal amount added to the fermenter (3/4 tsp for the 5 gallon batch) you think that would handle the jam situation?
I don't even need a duck - I already have a bird that asks me for grapes! 

https://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/raekd9/bongo_putting_in_his_lunch_order_he_calls/
How did that end?
Alright here we go. Editing out the dress and biceps one now, it feels weird to have it here, but leaving the bonus one  
[looking like an alien](https://i.imgur.com/rByRe85.jpg) picking blackberries during mosquito season. I'm a little worried the neighbors will shoot me if they see me near the property line.

Edit to add: The  arm muscles turned out to be useless in the parking lot, so I'm thinking mine are just decorative.
Ha, I'd have to pose with my flexed grape-smashing biceps. I'm worried that would make me seem weird.
The final fuck up.
I thought the same thing. Might as well dump 5# sugar in each fermenter and make a nice strong hooch.
This might be implied already, but I don't know how old the dress really is because I got it at a thrift store.
I wish I could point you to a reliable source, but this is just a hit or miss random find at a local fruit market. One day you get a $2 case of grapes, another day it's 20lbs of romaine lettuce for $2, and you have to get it because it's cheaper than a normal 3-pack of lettuce at Krogers, and you end up giving half of it to the stranger behind you in line because he's talking about how much his chickens love lettuce.
That's both infuriating and encouraging to hear. I'm sorry you had to deal with it too.
Ah, that's my mistake in writing - I was making grape jam, with all the fruit in it, but it didn't gel - so I may have written it as jelly a few times in the discussion. 

I wish I knew what kind of grapes they were - some were very round and red and had seeds, those all went into the wine so I can filter out the seeds. And the others were a mix of mostly red and bluish-purple, and a tiny amount of green. But I'm gonna file away your info for the future, that if I get more grapes down the road, check if they look like concord and use them appropriately!
Well, I have to disagree with this. Specifically the part where you imply it's my "first" senior moment. :)
It's just a bunch of us worked together back in the day, most of the group but not all are retired now. We have occasional potlucks now, and this one was just a semi-fancy one someone was hosting at their home.
I put one in for a 24 hour test - the more I think about it, the more I'm wondering if the two fridge ones set because of the cold, or if it's because that was the last part ladled out of the pot. maybe all the pectin settled to the bottom. 

They say not to double or triple a batch of jam because it won't set up right, but it's too hot to boil so many pots of jam all day, so I didn't follow that part of the instructions.
I have two 5 gallon carboys - I had a problem in the fall with my one being filled with plum wine, and then everyone in town was giving away large post-halloween pumpkins and I had to take them all. 

And I have a decent lot of empty wine bottles.  (From a neighbor who worked in a bar, I mean.)
Yeah, I though you accidentily ordered 109 pounds online and now your life savings are gone
Grocery store happy to get rid of the extra before dumping it in the trash-probably would have sold it to her for $4😂
I just checked the box in the recycle bin, and it says 18lbs. But - that's the weight when a case is originally shipped neatly in the plastic grape bags. These were all dumped loose into the boxes, like they'd gone through the bags where people had pulled some off the stems to sample, and just dumped the whole rest of the bags into the box because they didn't look good on display.
Ah, interesting. I'll try that with a small batch of jars - I'd really love to avoid the added sugar. (I mean, yeah, I'm in the midst of trying to make 52 bottles of wine here, but I still want to be healthy!)
I tried a potato masher but it wasn't working for me. I may as well have been trying to use it on crab apples - they just weren't smashing. The metal grid worked okay though - I used it after watching a guy on youtube destemming and smashing grapes really efficiently with a milk crate. I just wasn't confident I could get one of my milk crates clean enough to feel good about eating off it.
The boxes were just a bit too big to put into the shopping cart, I was able to put one on the bottom, and two across the top with the last one stacked on top of them. (But then I couldn't access the inside of the cart at all so I had to make a second trip into the same store so I could get the other smaller things I wanted.) 

There's a picture here of the full trip, with the other stuff it came to almost 15 dollars, because I also got a couple clamshells of kiwis, 12 pints of blueberries, some other smaller produce. You can kinda see the size of the boxes of grapes, but now I regret not buying a banana for scale: https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fdq56exz7cd7d1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1273%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De95d87baca311219e85e81f0965ce00495565b30
I have no idea what kind of grapes they were. There was a few varieties in there. I've been just drawing a dot on the top of my corks to label what kind of wine it is, purple for plum, orange for pumpkin, but this was different colors. Mostly red, the wine is sort of rosé colored.
It was my absolute favorite comment of the day. Laughed out loud for the first time in years. Thank you.

Edit: I meant to reply to the top comment, but had just woken up... Please excuse my morning brain.
😭😭😭
Wrinkles. Because she’s old. (I’m old. I can admit that.)
A headache
A tutor. Jenny has a tutor.
60 years.
A seniors discount and a fuck ton of wine
Early-onset dementia. (Just kidding Jenny! I’m a bit older than you)
A front page post on TIFU, good job Jenny!
Jenny thinks she looks under 60 years old. Jenny looks 10 years older than she thinks she looks. 
How old does Jenny look?
(This is a trick question)
My FIL has another. He bought frozen pies at a charity sale and ordered 7 beef, 9 chicken, and 5 lamb pies. He called later that day to confirm his order and they wrote it down again, doubling the order.


How long did it take us to eat those pies if we ate 3 every week?
I see what you did there. Very subtle.
How do you get through that much produce before it spoils?
This spring I ordered peach trees, blueberries and elderberry bushes... But, I didn't realize that the peach trees came in 2 packs, there were 4 blueberries in each of those orders and something like 8-10 elderberry...  I thought I was ordering like.. 6 or 8 plants. We ended up with 4 peach, 12 blueberries and... I honestly have no idea many elderberry. 20? 30? Something like that....
OP did also as they bought the wrong amount of grapes.
Same 😂😂😂 sitting at lunch with a coworker and I started reading some of the replies out loud and we're both cracking up
I legit did the same thing. If you treated me nice, you were 60 for a minute while I gave you a 10% discount. I would get offended looks if I forgot to explain 🤣
Yeah, you were all smiley because you had plans for 100 pounds of grapes!  It WAS going to be such a wonderful day!!
I worked at McDonald's when I was like 14-15. To me everyone was old so I'd give the senior discount on coffee to anyone that looked remotely 'old' to 15 year old me. 

Every cashier I see is 18-19 tops. Everyone over 40 is ancient to them. 

Don't worry about it :) hope the wine is great!
Aren’t you the dehydrated tomatoes lady? Like you wanted to dehydrate tomatoes in your husbands truck while traveling? That was so funny
I've given people that I'd be surprised if they were 30 yet a seniors discount. Shit, I've given teenagers the seniors discount. 

Especially if I was having a not-good day, and someone came in that helped it be a little bit better. 

Genuinely, if it was applied without them checking/asking your age, it's a pretty good chance that it was their way of silently saying thank you for making their day a bit better, even if it was just that you were in a good mood when they served you.
OP have you written a novel?...because I would read the shiiiiit out of your novel!

Seriously, this post started off like one of those medium-ly scary movies I'd watch in the late 90s and ended up like one of those extra large-ly scary movies I wachted in the late 2000s. 😂

I mean what the hell are you gonna do with all them grapes!?!?
This was my first thought, it's a definite possibility! I used to work in sales and if a customer was kind to me I'd always make sure they'd get a discount if it was possible. 

I love a friendly customer interaction, they make up some of the good parts of the job. It's kinda my way of giving someone a little thank you for not being a dick because unfortunately so many customers are terrible to deal with. If you weren't pleasant I would imagine they wouldn't have applied a discount at all unless you asked.
I got a senior discount at McDonald's. I'm THIRTY EIGHT. I had ocd and went full meltdown in my mind until I contacted the manager about how insulted I was. She said it was HER that gave me the discount and she does it now and then when people are just really polite. Then I felt like an asshole 🤦🏻‍♀️.
I'm 59 and in pretty good shape. I really laughed at this part of your story. I used to be told I look younger than my age, but I know in my bones this is changing. Still, I'll take it.
I did the same thing too - especially to nice bulk customers. I got yelled at by them sometimes and ended up regretting it. The "oh." on their face. It's an easy discount we could use without drawing too much heat. I did get in trouble once.
Yep in pretty much every retail and food service job I've worked, I handed out 10% discounts like candy at parades. Never cost me anything, and the business still profits
The local hotdog shop I take my son to has one waitress that always gives me the senior discount. Now I have a little grey in my beard but definitely don't look 60+, and I have definitely told her it's my son, so she doesn't think I'm a grandfather...I assume she's just being nice. Whatever the reason I'll take the discount happily.
How did you not notice that you had 109lbs of grapes? I’m assuming you hauled it yourself. Also where are you shopping where it cost you $8
That just sounds like an overall bad day.  Makes the rest of them better.  You handled it like a champ though.
I did the same! I didn't even think about the implications of letting somebody think I thought they were old.
Where I worked I would give it to anybody who could, in any way, end up being over the senior age, even if I thought I was stretching it, because so often people would forget to ask for it and then return angry it wasn’t given to them by default. Our boss would get mad at this so it was easier to just give em out whenever.
Nah, not made up. I would give discounts to people often (like, once or twice a week, tops) b/c they'd be understanding, or b/c they had a funny joke, or b/c they had a lot of kids and needed a break.
I'm 30 and when I was pregnant with my twins I visited taco bell a couple times a week. The cashier started recognizing me and would give me the senior discount sometimes! Definitely happens.

I bet you also helped them out offload a ton of inventory and write offs. I bought 50 lbs of bananas once from Kroger because they were bordering overripe and had been marked down to 15 cents a lb. They gave me an additional discount too for taking so many!
Maybe she was referring to your "rank" with respect to graping. Like you are the senior grapist in town.
I also used to give the *senior* discount to nice people, I knew they weren't senior but the computer didn't!

 the cashier probably just wanted to show you kindness =)
Yep, when I worked as a cashier and people were nice sometimes I would even give my employee discount
My work has senior's day every Thursday and I give it to basically everyone who is nice to me as well as anyone who appears over 40ish. I always tell them they don't look like a senior but I'm going to give them the discount anyway.

I'm sure you look amazing!
100% this. Store I work at has had sales where we’ll mark down excess produce (usually stuff we didn’t order but still got) about 80-90%. Store want to get rid of it because it takes up too much room, meaning we can’t get other stuff in.
Some stores out there would rather throw them away
Each of the 4 boxes was about the weight of a large thanksgiving turkey, so if you picture one of those broken down flat into a roasting pan, it's like that volume.

its a fruit/veggie store near Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Detroit. Thats where one would fine deals like this. Not at your typical market.
I sent this to my MIL and she says you should just throw the unjelly jelly in with the 2nd wine and use it as an Adult desert topping. Mix it in with icecream. Use it in whipped cream between cake layers. If you've got a big alcohol friendly party, make "wine cooler jello shots" with it. The possibilities are endless!

I was expecting the TIFU to be that they thought the boxes were that price, but it was the price per pound and they spent $200 on grapes thinking they were getting the deal of the century.
Well in the UK you go to a wholesalers at about 4am like spitafeilds and they will sell you a pallet of soft fruit (like grapes) for a £ to get rid of them if they have stuff super markets have rejected or only has a day or two on the date.

It's what all the market traders on the cheaper fruit and veg places do
I don’t know if anyone has told you this yet but your jam probably didn’t set up because you made too big of a batch. If you have a ball blue book follow the recipe EXACTLY and you should be good. Also google “grape jam didn’t set up” and there will be advice. It happens to everyone. :)

Look at the timestamps on that comment and the edit on the original post. Most likely they made that comment and then the OP edited their post to include that detail after they had responded.
Haha!   Yes.  Exactly.  It’s the first time when you say your age and get nothing that sucks so bad.  It’s like maybe they didn’t hear me?  No they heard me just fine…. Eventually you realize you are old looking when that rough night look sticks and now the pictures of me from like five years ago seem like I have an adult daughter that looks like me somewhere.  And right between 45-50.  Just like you said.
I had someone say, "well you remember the 80s of course....:"  I was a 1980 baby.  Time to redo my roots.  I'm not fighting time per say, but the white hair adds a few years.
It is absolutely true that table grapes don't make good wine. Awesome if you make something you can enjoy, I like lots of weird stuff too, but like you said it won't win any awards. They're fundamentally different.
I was not aware of that. Thank you!
Flash freezing does less damage (smaller crystals) but the damage isn't zero.

If you want to freeze something at home and you want it to preserve the texture as much as possible: 
1) refrigerate until cold first.  Then freeze.  

2) do step 1, but you want it to freeze faster, pack it in ice packs and other frozen stuff.  Some ice packs absorb energy faster than others so your milage can vary.  Use bags of ice around whatever you're freezing and the crystals will be smaller.

3) if it really matters, freeze with dry ice.   $1 a pound, I wouldn't do this for just anything, but it isn't awful either... You can make ice cream with dry ice, you just have to crush it really well first and don't use too much of it.  The texture of that ice cream is great.  Liquid nitrogen is great too, but you can actually buy dry ice at a lot of grocery stores.

Of course none of that applies to making wine.   Freeze the fruit, thaw it , and freeze it again if you want...lol
Unfortunately I'm not well versed on the math for quantities here, I would probably double it to be sure. There may be other places that actually break down some formulas for using jelly in a ferment, but given differences in yield, how much straight pectin you added... I'd start with just a bit more, and if things seem stalled out before you expect, add another dose.
That sent me down a rabbit hole of reading your other posts and I had a blast, you live a very interesting life!
He had to pretty much go all tofu menu the first week when it was fresh enough to be in the fridge without being in the freezer.
Not even eat tofu with rice or anything too filling. Just tofu with necessary spices 😆
Then had to give in and put the rest in the freezer.

He posted his daily battle and became a legend in an Asian FB cooking group for his feat😂
I mean if it helps, I would have guessed a lot less than 60 from just that photo.
That would only make you more badass!
That’s probably too much. That add would be about 120 g/L, not counting the volume discrepancy from skins (so probably more like 160 g/L), which would be enough for 10% on its own. Depends on the kind of table grapes, but a home winemaker is likely to get a stuck fermentation with a potential alcohol over 13-14 total. That said, some residual sugar sweetness might be what OP is looking for.
That’s awfully wholesome. And, that gives me a place to start scouting. Thank you.
You could start a business.
It should also help draw out the natural pectins in the fruit too. Happy canning!
I got hit with a language issue, then. (Non-native English speaker) 

To me, a box is generally one of those servings of blueberries on your picture, whilst I’d call  what the grapes are in a crate.

Or a moving-box.

Then again, I’m not the native, you are. Thank you very much for explaining it to me and showing me.

Edit: the fact that you got all of that for $15 is insane, though.
Morning brain is one thing but even I can recall laughing out loud at something within the last six to twelve months.

I went to a charity turkey shoot with my parents and sister one year when I was a teenager. Hit the target, win a turkey (one per person). Then you can go to a different set of targets to try for frozen hams. Fun, right?

We all won a turkey. I won four frozen hams, my sister got two, and my dad won one. We left with four turkeys and seven hams. A couple of days later my friend dropped off the turkey we forgot we'd bought for a fundraiser she was doing. And did I mention that both sides of my family had already bought the the meat for Thanksgiving??

I learned a lot of new curse words watching my dad play freezer Tetris until we could drop it off at local charities. And I believe the turkey shoot organizers put some additional restrictions in place for the next one! 😂
30 seconds initially, probably a couple of minutes after the initial novelty wears off.
I started canning with my granny as a kid. I learned how to work up a lot stuff in a hurry from her, lol. I do most things in stages (like peaches I blanch and peel everything, then pit & slice, then cook and can). I have a second fridge, too, so I can store stuff longer if needed. My family helps a lot, and I know my limits and buy just what I know I can manage before it goes bad. I can get 80 lbs of tomatoes diced and into jars in a day if I start early, but marinara or salsa takes more work, so I might only do 40lbs at a time. It's mostly practice, honestly, and having a tv I can watch from my work space so I don't get too bored of the repetitive actions, lol.
That's awesome, tho! I've just started rebuilding my garden at the house we bought, and I would love to have that kind of problem, lol! I know it seems overwhelming, but you'll get everything sorted before you know it. And if you don't have space for it all, gift or sell things to others. I'm sure you can find someone who would be very grateful for your extras.
When I worked in fast food, our store had a favorite customer that came in every day.  I have no idea if he was actually a senior, but we always gave him the senior discount and made him fresh coffee.
You weren’t kidding. This lady has some misadventures with food and a wonderfully enjoyable writing style. And a parrot. Possibly my new favorite Redditor.
That was me with the cheap tomatoes before. 

I was seriously considering just dehydrating half the grapes into raisins, but it was too overcast for the solar dehydrator last week and it feels wrong to plug in the regular one during the heat wave. 

If only the F150 could handle the load of the dehydrator, and my kid was pregnant again, this all could have worked out so differently.
Can you pls link the tomato post. The lady has too many awesome posts and I can't find it, but need to read it!
My ex-wife got carded in a bottle store in her fifties, by a girl, pretty sure no flirting was involved. I was there. Made her month.
I knew I had four big boxes of grapes, but I can't just pick something up and know if it's 15lb, 25lbs, whatever. I just know I've picked up something that's awkward and heavy. It's like when my GPS says "Turn in 1000 feet" - I'm like, I have no idea how far that is, I'm gonna need you to be more specific.
>I bought 50 lbs of bananas once

My people!
It depends where you are. In France they are unlikely to bother in the supermarkets. 

I still buy reduced stuff as much as I can.
I want to pay $2 for a 20+ pound turkey!

The potential alcohol on both batches is starting at 12%,  I'm curious to see where the first one's at when I test it tomorrow.
I don't know if the flashfood app is active where you live, but I've also gotten bulk grapes from them in the past. That's normally about $5 for a produce box - roughly 15-20lbs.
Just got served divorce papers after 17 years, at least in theory, (can't find out how to actually acquire them), and it was amazing to laugh again. Hope you have many more reasons to laugh.

If you drink enough fermented grape juice… you stop noticing wrinkles when you look in the mirror.

When I lived in France I just went to the produce markets at the end when the farmers and sellers didn't want to carry their leftovers back. Would get bags of produce of all kinds for free..
Or will become INCREDIBLY relevant by the third act. A C plot we've been watching throughout wherein an always smartly dressed 60 year old woman, who looks much younger, will coalesce with the main plot when the Regional VP of the grocery chain (played by Bill Murray) will be accusing the Store Manager (played by Jason Schwartzman) of malfeasance because "no one buys that many grapes Charles, they just don't, they just don't - there is obviously something amiss Charles. There is, and the fact you can't see it is concerning." Then they'll review the camera footage at length, track down the customer who Bill Murray's character will then fall hopelessly in love with.
The German impressionism cheerleader and of course, I wanna dip my balls in it!
Well Idk I'm just trying to give someone the benefit of the doubt, y'all can figure it out on your own.
201 g/L for table grapes is wild. Did you chaptalize or the table grapes started that high? What conversion estimate are you using? % of Brix?
Oh jeez. I can relate. I was in an unhealthy relationship and when it finally ended, I remember driving to work and being amazed at the beautiful blue sky and the wonderful white puffy clouds.

I didn't know why I was feeling this way on a Monday morning - but then it dawned on me - the regime had fallen, I had escaped the dictatorship. I didn't realize how miserable I was while I was in it, and life was good again. I think I might have laughed out loud that time too.
If you don’t have physical possession of the divorce papers, you probably haven’t been served yet. Was it a process server, sheriff, or other person delivering them to you? Not sure how you wouldn’t have them after they made you sign that you got them.
Here’s to more laughter in your future ❤️
You will be so relieved and happy. Better days ahead!
You drink enough fermented anything you stop noticing anything.
Thanks! Absolutely grand post! I love your produce related shenanigans!
I really want to be friends with you and have lots of food misadventures. Maybe some day I’ll be as cool as you are!
I love it that you included the parrot in the picture! On the road trip, I mean—I also just noticed your profile picture.
Depends on the market, but that isn't that common in my experience. They will often drop prices or do deals at the markets at the end.

If I were buying produce in the supermarket the cost would be double, if not more.
Don't vote for this guy, he has a colostomy bag!
No worries, sounds like you meant it coming from a good place!
Ah, you're definitely more sciency than me! My hydrometer just has three scales on it, one said 1.09SG, but if I rotate it, that matches up with 12% potential alcohol. 

The first bucket that's just how it was. The second, I just dumped in some sugar from my baking supplies - maybe a cup or cup and a half for the whole 5 gallon pot, I didn't measure. And I am hesitant to say that, since I'm clearly not good at estimates! But after I did it, I used the hydrometer, and that's where it landed. I don't think I added enough to noticeably even change it, from the chart I saw, I'd have to add 10oz of sugar to increase 5 gallons .6%.
No more waiting for something bad to happen, or to be told you did something wrong... I stopped drinking a bottle a night, and feel 100 times better... But I still feel like a failure for not making it work. The only thing that kept me going were my kids. If they love me, and want to spend time with me, I must be doing something right.
The regime had fallen, excellent. I’m newly-separated, stealing this.
To laughter in everyone's life.
I just heard you say drinking fermented stuff is the solution to any problem.
Huh. Maybe we were just too nice or something haha. It was in a few of the larger cities where we tried it
SG is specific gravity.

1.09 is about 21.5 brix. You should get around 12.7 alcohol. Most regular yeasts should get there without sticking. 

A cup and a half isn’t enough to really move the needle there too much. I’m actually shocked the sugar of table grapes was that high. Probably a couple hundred grams across 20 or so liters, so most likely only about 10 g/L or about .6% alcohol. 

Good luck!
It takes two to make it work. I was the same place as you - whatever I did, it was wrong. If I brought up that I thought the relationship needed work, it was my problem to fix because I was the one with the problem.

Eventually you get burned out. You can't keep going like that. Try not to blame yourself. Your kids love you, that's great. But you can't fix another person. My ex was very dismissive of my feelings and once I moved past it, the world was brighter place again. Life is hard, but you need to find joy - I'm glad you are on your way back to that place.
Cause of, and solution to, all life's problems. - Homer Simpson
All alcoholic beverages are, by definition, a solution.
You motivated me to get up just now and measure where I'm at - just on the first bucket still. And it's down from 1.09 to 1.00SG, with potential alcohol at zero, so if I am understanding this right, I'm at 12% alcohol. Do you ever add more sugar when you're ready to move it to the carboy? Or you think I should just leave it at that,  and wait another day or two to let the other bucket catch up and combine them and call the sugar done?
I really needed to hear this (or read, I guess, whatever) these words.🙏
Realization that you are just as important, just as valid makes a huge difference. Accept what faults you actually have, but don't take responsibility for the fault of others.

TIFU by being in the bathroom for so long that the restaurant thought I had dined and dashed.
I went to a Chinese buffet against my better judgement. Ate my food. It predictably opened my bowels right up because the fat content. Couldn't really hold it and wait for the bill. So, I grabbed my stuff because I didn't want it out in the open when I'd be in the bathroom a while. Apparently, the waitress only saw me load my stuff up and then just disappear when she looked back. 

I got done taking a long shit and came out to them talking to the police. They saw me. I talked to the cops. They got called for a dine and dash and showed up cause its a slow day. 

Explained the situation to them. They asked why I had taken all my stuff with me. I told them it was because "I knew it would be awhile and didn't want anything stolen". 

It was light-hearted. The cops, waitress, and me had a laugh. I paid my bill and left

TL;DR: was in the bathroom so long that the restaurant thought I had dined and dashed and called the cops.
Dine and dookied.
Ugh, this happened to me at a Buffalo Wild Wings. I was dying at my table surrounded by dirty plates and hadn't seen a staff member for about thirty minutes, except for occasional glimpses as they dashed out of sight. BWW is noisy, so unless I stood up and unleashed a full throated "HEY! CHECK PLEASE!" I wasn't going to get attention shy of a flare gun, and something was about to happen that hadn't happened since I was three.

So I grabbed my phone, left my jacket, and ran to the bathroom. 

About ten minutes later, I emerged in a state of considerable relief and extremely clean hands to find the table cleared and my jacket gone, as if they had waited until the moment I left to finally show up. The server who saw me sitting at the table she had just bussed was oddly grumpy as I asked where my jacket was and told her I wanted the bill now.

She brought back my jacket, fished the bill out of the bin (no kidding; it was all crumpled up) and I paid and left. I'm pretty sure she wanted the jacket, which is weird, because I'm a 240 lb. male and it's not a particularly nice jacket.
A similar thing happened to me at Olive Garden. I was with my 4 year old and we went to the bathroom, I made sure to leave my jacket so they would know we would be back. When we were done I walked back to our table and there were already different people sitting there. The waiters looked confused and we were at the point in the dinner where we were almost done but there was still some food left, very frustrating.
Happened to me in a small health food restaurant but fortunately I didn’t take that long so they just were relieved when they realized I was still there and intended to pay.
Shocked that the police attended. I didn't even know that it was a crime, enjoying a succulent Chinese meal.
something something poo poo platter
This is an irrational fear I have. I always leave a jacket or something for fear that hey will think I’ve left without paying.
My sister and BIL went to a nice steakhouse for her birthday. In the middle of dinner they went outside for a cigarette. They came back in to find their table bussed and reset.

“Uh, where’s our food?”

The waiter thought it was a dine n dash. They had tossed the food and everything. Free steak dinner and then some.
>It predictably opened my bowels right up because the fat content. Couldn't really hold it and wait for the bill. 

OP idk how to tell you this but I'm pretty sure that isn't "predictable" for most of us at all. Y'all got gut issues.
Probably 30 years ago my family was eating at a buffet called the Royal Fork in Fairbanks Alaska (closed now).  My step dad had a habit of going to the cashier and paying once he was done eating, even if it would often be another 20-30 minutes before everyone else was done and the conversation would wind down down.  So one time we get home and a call comes in from the police that we dined and dashed, and an employee got our plate number as we drove away.  Very luck for us, my step-dad used a check and was able to tell the cop the check number and amount.  The restaurant found the check and all was good.
As a Crohn’s sufferer, this is my literal worst nightmare
Just wondering, why doesn't the buffet charge you before you eat? It's not like they need to itemize a bill like a sit down restaurant. I have never been to a buffet that wasn't buy your plate and glass, then sit down and eat and leave when you feel like it.
Something similar happened to me at a Chile's. I was there with my son and after finishing most of my meal my stomach started feeling upset. I told my son I had to go to the bathroom. He doesn't like to be left alone in public places even though he was 10 so he came with me. It was summer so we didn't have coats or anything to leave behind. Came out maybe 10 minutes later and there was someone else at our table. When the waitress saw us she said she thought we left. I apologized and paid up then left.
I once clogged up the toilet at a restaurant and the waiters were all talking about it and looking over at me. I ate quickly and left.
The cops actually came. That’s the craziest part to me. 
The classic dine and dump. I hope it was a succulent Chinese meal and you were lucky you didn’t have to find out if the cops knew their judo well
During a UFC PPV event I went with many friends to the local Hooters to catch the fights and have some wings. We all decided to go wash our hands at the same time. When we came out many of the waitstaff were frantically looking around thinking we had all just dipped out on them. Apparently this wasn't the first time this particular waitress had sounded the Dine-and-Dash alarm, it was an elaborate tip-stealing scheme she would deploy any chance she had to create a distraction for the other waitstaff so she could collect tip monies off their recently vacated tables while they assisted in the search for the Dine-and-Dashers. Well, our false Dine-and-Dash was her last shift at the local Hooters as she was caught red-handed stealing tips as the manager had set up lookouts to watch her specifically as complaints of missing tips had been made prior.
1 plate in....... 2 plates out.
Sounds like democracy manifest to me
You probably already realize this but you now have a nickname at that restaurant.
Sometimes when I overeat (which is always the case at a buffet) that will trigger a large "major transaction".  That hasn't happened to me at a buffet yet, or at least not before I left the place.
This happened to me at a place I was a regular at. They did not call the cops but when I came out I heard the wait staff talking about it! It was embarrassing and I was actually a bit hurt they’d think that of me after all this time!
How long were you in there for?
I like to think OP had a jacket, a satchel, a backpack, a laptop bag, and like three grocery bags of stuff.
I have IBS so bathroom breaks can take a very, very long time... When I think I'm done my bowels decide there's still more to let go of lol. So, I can understand why you were there for so long.

This really isn't a FU. It seems to have been understood and resolved very easily even though it may have been embarrassing lol.
I had something similiar happen to me and my mother only we weren’t even in the bathroom long. I had to go just as the food was coming to the table. 

We actually been waiting a long time for the food and would have liked to eat it but I couldn’t wait to go to the bathroom so only quickly had one bite. My mother said she had to go too.

We didn’t have jackets to leave behind, and took our purses with us to the bathroom. We were only gone a few minutes but surprisingly our food had been cleared away. 

We were shocked as not only had we only been gone minutes but we had full plates on the table. The server said they thought we left. It’s not like they thought we dined and dashed as we hadn’t eaten yet. 

We asked why no one thought to check the bathroom for us. I don’t remember the answer. We also pointed out we hadn’t eaten yet. We had to wait a long time again for the food to be remade.
This happened to me at a Red Lobster once. I was dealing with tummy issues for expectedly, and when I was better and emerged, my table was totally cleared. I quietly went to the Ziosk, paid my bill, right in front of the waitress and restaurant manager standing nearby, who went white as a sheet. I heard “oh crap, he’s still here! I know just…let him pay and we’ll see if he—-“ being whispered clearly by them before they trailed off and ducked away into the kitchen.
This kinda happened to me in an Indian restaurant with my 10 year old…. But it was HIM who was taking a 20 min poop and I was sitting at the table freaked out cause I knew if I got up they would think I was gonna ditch them…. But worried he was stuck in a foreign bathroom (in a foreign country) and needed me…. In Europe you don’t get the bill very easily, so it took time to get it sorted… and yeah, he said a few people knocked on the door while he was pooping. He didn’t care.
Surely the security footage would show you exiting through the toilet.
**This is democracy manifest**

Police were called because you enjoyed a succulent Chinese meal?!?!
If that's not a smooth criminal story i don't know what it is.

OP muredered their toilet and still managed to smooth talk the police into letting OP free. Nice.
The real question is did u load up more before u left
Dang. I mean it couldn't have been more than what $25? For solo diner? They called the cops for that?
Dined and dropped
I dined and dashed on accident once. My son and I were eating burgers at our favorite place and when we finished we got up and left. Went back to his home a kit 45 minutes away and realized what happened. I immediately called the burger joint and told them what happened and I’d be back asap..lol
This happened to me at a Shoney's. Cops and all. I was travelling through with my 2 and 3 year old sons, and one had to use the restroom, so of course, we all went and I took my purse with us (obviously by the time all 3 of us did our thing, it was a longer than typical restroom visit.) I was shocked when we came out to police, and I had to explain it wasn't like I could just let a 3 year old go to the restroom alone, couldn't leave a 2 year old in the dining area by himself, and wasn't about to leave my purse sitting on a table in an unfamiliar restaurant by itself. Like, of course they let us go, but kept acting like I was lying or hiding something.
I’ve worked in the restaurant industry for 30 years.  
One trick that Chinese buffets use is to add fryer oil to food pans that have sat and started to dry out. 
It’s a thing. 
It keeps the food looking fresh and shiny, but it’ll WRECK your colon.
You poop four hour! You go now!
Not the people with perfect guts in the comments committing microagressions against us all 😭😂
The lesson of this thread:  try to tell someone if you're going to leave your table for an extended period of time, or the restaurant is going to move on, especially if people are waiting...
I mean, rule number 1 of dine and dash is you don't go back lol so if you were a dine and dash you're really bad at it...
I have a similar story but it didn't end as well. Tried to leave my keys, coat or fanny pack for good gesture intentions on the table and have horny men to to "inform me" I 'forgot' them while trying to break down the bathroom door.. my dook shoved right back up my colon
Sorry about your bowels, glad you worked it out👍
A shart from the heart.
Dine and poop LMAO
This is my nightmare eating alone. I'd try to ask someone where is the toilet, so at least someone know....
TL;DR 

Too Long Didn’t Run
You should have eaten more- now that you made room.
Back in hs I would have teachers think I was skipping because I would regularly take 30m -hr shit
The surprising part is you were in there long enough for the cops to actually show up 😂 sorry OP.
You Pooped and Paid.
Fair to take your stuff with you but if you think it's really gonna take long you should tell the waiter/waitress. It's a bit embarassing, but they won't really care... whereas dining and dashing is a serious risk to small restaurants that survive on narrow margins, especially buffets.
Called the cops on you? Yeah we're going to be negotiating that bill. 

A friend and I left a sushi restaurant, we had leftovers in a box. We got to the car, realized neither one of us had the leftovers and she went back inside.

This was 2-3 minutes max. Spot at sushi bar cleared, $40 worth of sushi gone. She comes back empty handed, almost in tears. Yeah, no. I went in and the manager headed me off, said my friend wouldn't listen, I said I'm not surprised, he asked what I wanted, I said we had this roll and that roll left and he had the bar make them right then and there. 

I thanked him and went on my way with my rolls. 

50% on us,we did leave our box, 50% on the sushi bar, but I do think they could have held it a few minutes. They did make it right though.
Reading all the stories here, I'm surprised everyone is either leaving their stuff at the table or taking all of it and then being surprised when the staff think you ditched. Why don't you just write "BRB, bathroom!" on a napkin?
A succulent Chinese meal?!
You be here four hour!  You go now!  You no all you can eat!!!

dined and dropped the kids off at the pool.
You had the poo poo platter.
Why did you pay? You didn't take the food out of the resturant. 😁
Dine and deuced
Eat more fiber
I think it’s from the msg, tmi but I get diarrhea every time I eat Chinese food
I was at a buffet once with another couple. It was busy. We all went to get food and come back and they were trying to flip our table. We could have left and not paid but decided to stay. I mean we were home for a couple of minutes.
Are you insinuating that the Chinese food that you just ate caused your prolonged bowel movement?

Because that's not how digestion works.
Dine and deuce.
U couldn’t say to manager, I need to shit like a goose? Come on man!
No NFU

You've got to give it to them, though. They've probably had people do the dash before and when no one saw you go take a squirt they thought the worst.
This is awesome. I love a good poop story. I have several.
If they don’t want you to have all you can eat then why do they provide bathrooms
This happened to the bus driver on a school field trip, though it wasn't a dine a dash because it was a buffet. They cleared his table, so he had to go back up to the counter and get a new glass for his drink. They tried to make him pay again.
Anyway, $5 a pound
Dine and Dump
Happened to me too. I took so long the cops came and left. When I came out the waitress told me to forget it and leave. She didn’t want to get in trouble for reporting me. I gave her a big tip and left.
Almost had that happen to me once. Thankfully I got back as the waitress was telling her manager so the cops didn't get involved
The old done and dump move
Did you get your leftovers for the road?
We used to call it Chew and Screw
Ma'am, you came in, and ate alone. What do you mean when you say, "you had to drop your kids at the pool?"
There’s a table etiquette position for brb / pause. It’s mostly kind of dead but as someone else with an ibs adjacent issue, I’ve never had my table bussed when [making a V opening towards you](https://www.sambonet-shop.com/dw/image/v2/BGMT_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-sbt-us-library-shared/default/dw289b2757/SEO%20Topics/Asset-Seo-TavolaSecondo-Frutta-Pausa.jpg) with fork and knife.
If you haven’t already,  Please get your Gall bladder and liver checked.     it’s a common symptom of issues with bile and fatty foods.
Next time I want to use the toilet and there are no public ones available...I know what to do now
One time I went to the doctors office and I swear I used a normal amount of toilet paper. I was there for a sinus infection. Anyway the toilet backed up and I was so embarrassed. I was plunging away for 10 minutes at the toilet sweating. I hear a knock on the door. It’s the doctor and she wanted to know if I was OK. I felt like I was lying telling her what happened. She said to leave it and someone else would take care of it. I was so mortified.
This could easily be a Seinfeld or Curb storyline lol
Give your servers a heads up if you plan on taking a bathroom or smoke break. Suspected walk outs can be very stressful for servers!
Dined and dropped a log in their toilet
"Dine and dash? Nope. Just making room for more food. I was planning on being here another 4 hours."

You could've made them wish you had dine and dashed.
Don't eat alone!  I once went to an Italian restaurant and had to use the water closet halfway through, and they cleared the table by the time I got back.  It wasn't even five minutes.  But I was the only person there.  They apologized and brought me another.
It's more like the restaurant fucked up, not you
Definition of renting the food
Bruh fuck these people talking trash about Chinese food, it’s the food you ate before that opened your white ass up bruh fucking white people think they just ate one thing and it goes through your stomach so fast you gotta shit…… uhhh no fucking dumbass it takes hours for your food to process into shit…..
Eggroll and a poopy hole
Lomein and stomach pain
The old poo poo platter causing a poo poo splatter
Benihanas has a dish called “Splash and Meadow”, that would have been a fitting meal
“TIFU by going to a Chinese buffet” - FIFY.
I thought all buffets charged before you eat.
#MeetCute
Don't buffets make you pay before you eat? That's usually how it works. I find the story to be somewhat dubious.
Worked for McDonalds when in high school. We hired a lady who must have been in her 70s to work the dining room and clean off tables during lunch. She must have bussed and cleaned tables who were in the bathroom three times a week. The manager was happy to replace three meals a week to have someone who kept the dining room clean during lunch rushes.
How ironic that I too had to go to the bathroom after eating Chinese last week before I got my bill. I was actually in the bathroom hoping that they didn’t think I just left and skipped out on the bill.
So, how would you tip in that situation?
I have seen dash and dine more times than I can count and have the police hasn’t been called ONCE!
Shit and run
I used to work a pizza buffet and a Bulimic lady would come most days after she dropped her kids off at school, eat a whole pizza, go to the bathroom forever and get rid of it, then eat another one. 3 whole large pizzas wasted.
I’ve never been to a buffet that didn’t have you pay first as you walked in the door
You know how I know this story isn’t real? The cops didn’t come out with their guns drawn and started blasting
I think you are allergic or have an intolerance to something in the food. That is not normal or predictable at all.
Shoulda just take a shit and came out bruh. You were busy scrolling through Reddit while shitting
[deleted]
This is so fucking funny.  What a great story.  I hope a comedy writer sees this cause it's great material
I stayed in the bathroom for so long at the bar, that the barmaid called the cops and I was promptly arrested and but in the back of a cop car.
"because the fat content." i loled.
Because the fat content?
I hope you flushed and washed your hands!! 😠
Wow you heaped shame upon your ancestors. 
Maybe restaurants should institute a policy if pay first then get food
Every buffet I have ever gone to makes you pay first.
it's a while, awhile is not the same as a while. stop it.
I don’t buy this. Buffets always make you pay first before you eat
How long does it take you do take a dump?
You should have called the health department on the place. That sounds really iffy.
Do you have a direct line from your esophagus to your anus? It takes time to digest food normally.
It takes food 24 to 72 hours to move through the digestive tract. You have other eating issues going on 
You really don't understand how the digestive system works, do you.
Dine and splashed.
Chewed and pooed.
Haha, the old "dine and sit there for 53 minutes pooping out some liquid some really long strands of soft shit mixed with some small hard lumps all the while straining and feeling like your bowels have lost the ability to move anything along while also sometimes urgently moving things along in a painful way"

/r/ibs

Dine and shat
Catch & release
I’ve had trouble getting the bill a handful of times. This is what actually keeps me from visiting more dine in restaurants.  The weird part is that the waiters are usually very good at taking your order and getting your meal. 
I’ve been to one BWW that was clean and had good service. Every other BWW I’ve been to in multiple states has been greasy-wet-table, glacierly slow/non existent service, and wings served ice cold with a side order of football stadium loud bros.  I just can’t go back- and that was with pre-Covid prices.
>I'm pretty sure she wanted the jacket, which is weird, because I'm a 240 lb. male and it's not a particularly nice jacket.

She liked your scent.
>something was about to happen that hadn't happened since I was three.

You've definitely shit yourself at least once since then. We've all gambled on a fart and lost.
If I don't see a waiter for 30 minutes I'm leaving. They can either take my money or not. I'm not waiting that long.
An oversized worn in jacket sounds like a trendy dream to a fashion forward lady! Your style is more popular than you thought.
B dubs sucks and their service is trash
It reminded her of her dad.
Roughed up oversized jacket is actually highly sought after with the youths. I saw a couple videos now of people offering to buy the jacket off their back. Usually blue collar people carharts that look worn.
Worked at Olive Garden. That's when you ask for a replacement entree to take home. Manager would comp that in a hot second.
What happened afterwards? You weren’t done eating but you just had to be done because the food was thrown away? And they had just moved the jacket from the seat?
Did they just move your jacket or did someone steal it? I hope you got it back.
You didn't even finish the story. Did you go poop again?
Lol, I did this as a busser once. Turned out it was the GM at my day job with her young son. All plates on the table were empty aside from a couple bites, drinks were empty aside from ice, and no personal items left at the table. GM at current spot gave her a full free meal to take home and didn't even give me shit about it. GM from day job had a laugh when she told me about it the next day at work, said I didn't even recognize her I was so busy doing my job (big enough and busy enough place I had an earpiece in and was just on automatic cleaning and resetting tables the hosts told me needed done. This one I had been told to do over the earpiece because the server thought they had left). I literally wasn't looking at tables that weren't empty and we had enough server coverage on the floor that no one ever tried to flag me down to ask for something so rarely actually interacted with customers enough to even register their faces. This particular shift I could have walked past my own parents and not realized I was so damn busy bussing empty tables.
I went with my sister to a vegan place and had seitan, which I had never eaten before. So did my BIL - we barely made it back to the house before we both had to run for a bathroom. Thank goodness they had two!
Take your hand off my penis
The cops were just there waiting to receive OP's limp penis.

You thought stealing was legal? 🤔🤣😂
Did he bring the knife to the restroom?
If your a** was a Chinese restaurant, I’ll have the poopoo platter.
That’s a strictly for white people thing lol
You be here four hour!  You go now!  You no all you can eat!!!

https://youtu.be/5KUyhlgxwFI?si=9n9f_UhzFstkmmw9
It’s clearly not irrational lol
If it's something you worry about just let a waiter know so they don't clean out your table.
Literally who does that though lol I’ve never heard of anyone leaving their table alone for a cigarette
They didn’t let the server know? That is odd dining behavior. I would have assumed a dine and dash as well.  

And if they were gone so long that the table was bussed and reset, they were gone for a decent amount of time.
Um, in my country, it's **extremely** rude to leave your table empty, like your sister and BIL did. It shows a lack of respect for the staff's time. You're not at the restaurant to smoke. You're there to eat and get the fuck out to make room for other guests.
I mean, that's fair on the restaurant's part. That's some next level smoking issues.
I’ll usually leave my car keys or cellphone on the table next to my plate etc if I’m going outside and my table will be unattended.
Dude, so many Redditors have serious gastrointestinal issues. Like, if eating at taco bell makes you into a backwards fire hose, then you should see a fucking doctor.
More people have IBS than you think, not even to mention other gut problems 

Just not everyone is comfortable admitting it
Yeah, it’s just really wild to me reading this. It’s not normal (at least to me) for any food to immediately induce shitting like that. Like … that’s the shit that was already in you. The Chinese food hasn’t even really been digested yet. How does that happen?
Being someone without a gallbladder, this happens to me very often.  Better than stones, I guess!
Yeah it's a really weird thing on the internet, every picture of or video about anything that isn't white bread has someone in the comments going "You're gonna pay for that later 💀" and a bunch of people agreeing.
I did a double take but assumed they meant predictable for them. And given they apparently don’t have a gallbladder that’s probably what they meant.
Celiac disease here…🙋🏼‍♀️.  Been there, done that.
Yeah, I'm also surprised that OP apparently had some stuff boxed up to go that they took with them to the bathroom, I didn't realize buffets allowed that?
Most buffets are pay before you eat around me. Those places are also always buffets and have self-serve drink stations. 

Many Chinese buffets around me don't have you pay until you are done. But they also only have the buffet from like 11am to 4pm and have a standard menu otherwise. They don't have self-serve drink stations either. So you order your drink/refills from a waiter. Outside of "buffet hours" it operates like a normal sit down restaurant.
Some aren’t because there are drinks that you have to pay for separately, including alc
You should have at least told them “someone” had clogged the toilet.
In my city the cops must get bored cause you’ll have five cop cars show up to the most mundane calls.
Seriously, you'd just about have to kill someone around here for the cops to show up. I got a couple of thousand dollars of gear stolen out of my boat with broken door and they took apart the gas tank to try to siphon gas out of it, and the only thing I could do was to file a report online.
Yeah, OP where do you live where there is a police response!?
they didn't, this is made up.
Has to be in a smaller city in the midwest, and not in some blue city where crime is rampant and cops don't come even for assault and larceny.
What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese Meal?
Always leave more than you take.
I was a regular at a sandwich shop I lived upstairs from, and I accidentally forgot to pay for my lunch on a very stoned Saturday once. Came back in for dinner and the manager (who I consider a friend) started ragging on me about it. Glad he took it so well; I apologized profusely, and we also laughed about how I only came back in that day because I wanted dinner, not because I realized what I'd done. Obviously he knew I'd be back sooner or later as I was there nearly every day.
Eating? 20ish minutes. Shitting? 10-15?
That's exactly what I would write if I was the person to dine and dash.
I mean it is and it isn't - the gastrocolic reflex is a thing, but they weren't literally evacuating what they just ate.
All I know is that I don't have a gallbladder anymore and eating anything fat and greasy pretty much opens the gates of hell very quickly.
Do you know his bowel health well?  As a younger man with a lower bowel of an 80 year old man, I take exception to your healthy-bowel-ism
You ever drank coffee before?
Exactly.
I saw this happen at an Olive Garden. He wasn’t happy but I don’t remember if they took care of him or not.
I live in Orlando, FL and the Orient Express on Semoran doesn't.
You’re not going to literally shit what you just ate but eating can get things moving that are already in progress.
No, they don’t.
have you ever had to wait for your colon to reload
Spoken like someone without any gut issues
Eating actually releases hormones that stimulate bowel movements.
With no gallbladder, eating greasy food causes more bile to dump directly into your intestines. It pushes out whatever is in its path.  You aren’t pooping out what you just ate.
Yeah. A lack of gallbladder.
I don't have a gallbladder.. I never said the Chinese food instantly turned to shit. Reading comprehension.. try it some time.
ever heard of ibs? can trigger within minutes sometimes
Yours is way better than mine, but mine came first and I truly feel bad about that.
Ran for the runs.
Eat and sheat
Eat and evacuate
Dine n dump.
Dine undine
Grind and splash
Ate and shate.
What a strange thing to literally be on the toilet reading this comment that describes what I’m going through exactly. Huh. Maybe I have IBS
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dookie!
Type the word you mean or don't bother typing at all. This nonsense is getting out of hand. Why are you being a coward?
This is what I don't get. A waiter will be lovely, fast service, everything nice, then just freaking disappear right before giving us the bill. So you just sit...and sit...and sit...and sit...and sit. Multiple times I have gotten up and literally wandered around trying to find someone to pay, sometimes even approaching the kitchen. I don't get it. Things went well. We are done. I want to give you money and a great tip. And then you just ghost me. It happens regularly enough that I think there has to be some sort of reason waiters do this???
[deleted]
Twice in my life I left a restaurant while shouting ‘Im trying to pay, I will leave without paying, Ive been waiting for 20 minutes and will be leaving now’ - both times no one stopped me
Ask for the check after ordering. If you order more, you can add it on. You don't have to pay it right away, of course. But it's nice to be able to pay and leave whenever *you* feel like.
They will seat me, almost make me feel rushed to order something, bring it to me, and then for the first 10 minutes, they will ask how things are just as I am taking a bit, and then they ghost me.
A GOOD server is ALWAYS "check ready"! Once food is entered a check should be printed and ready to be presented. IF there is anything else entered, they should print a new chit.
A server should NEVER offer dessert without a check ready to be presented.

Sadly, nobody is teaching Points of Service anymore. I've recently been in fine dining where all the food was "auctioned" off by the food runner instead of using pivot points and silent service. 

I see why people don't want to tip any longer.
They take your order, bring your food, and then forget about you for the rest of the time and expect you to pay their bills instead of the company. Don't get me wrong, I think people should make higher wages, but the expectation that diners should pay you for a portion of their meal is stupid, especially when you look at stuff like this.

And if you go to an expensive restaurant, the servers don't actually do *more* work, but they expect you to pay more because the bill is higher. They feel entitled to it. And let's be honest, servers get paid way more than the rest of the staff on *most* nights when they are being tipped. They complain about how back of house makes more when we all know damn well who is taking home the bigger check. Meanwhile, they have time to stop and snack and chat or sit in the corner on their phone for a minute here or there, while the back of house staff is in a neverending hell and doesn't even get a break until they're pretty much closing up and about to leave. 

"Hey guys, you made 'family' meal so you can eat while you clean."

Restaurant work is absolute shit and I'd rather do crime scene cleanup or sewage taste testing than ever work in a restaurant again.
I've started asking waiters to bring me the bill when they bring dessert, because in the last 5 restaurants I've been to (completely different types in different parts of the country) they completely disappeared when I was ready to leave
One time I had to leave because there was a long queue to pay and I had something I couldn't miss. There was zero chance of getting anyone's attention. It was a central London restaurant at lunchtime and I had no cash I could just put on the table.

It was four years before I was in the area again. They were a bit surprised when I showed up and paid. They'd had no idea.
Bring some cash and keep track of your total.
They get like 20 minutes before I just leave. I just assumed they were giving it to me for free
If they paid any attention to you they might have to refill your drink before you leave them a 25% tip.
When I was in my early 20's, I worked for a company that audited businesses to ensure they were following the policy to card people who looked to be under 30 who ordered alcohol.  I always dreaded getting a BWW on my card because it was going to take forever and I got paid by the stop, not by the hour.  Every BWW I had to visit took 2 to 3 times as long as other stops.  One night I had four...that was the longest night of my life.
Well shit, I've got me a gambling addiction then.
I always see people say shit like this. But I've never actually shat myself since that once incident in India when I was like 7.
No, definitely not all of us
No, no we haven't.
I haven't shit myself since I was 4. I've had close calls, though.
Yup that's what they did at the Ramen place that thought I dined and dashed on my lunchbreak while I was in the bathroom. 

Dude was so apologetic about it, gave me another entree for the road and everything.
Glad it was all laughs and no one was too upset. Could've been awkward at the day job if she held a grudge 😬

people addicted to smoking
Every comment about this seems like it’s from someone who’s never served, especially at a bar type restaurant. People leave tables alone to go smoke ALL the time. Sometimes I wander around looking out the windows to double check I wasn’t dine and dashed, and they’re always out there smoking.
Guess you’ve never been a smoker in a couple of smokers. The world was a different place until like 2005 when everywhere seemed to ban it at once.
Trashy people
Not necessarily, bussers can get a table turned super fast  If they saw the guests walking out with their coats on, the bussers could assume they're leaving and swoop in immediately.
that’s a bit ridiculous honestly, I feel like like your country’s serving staff should get over themselves
lol that’s bold. 

I would just leave the pack of smokes… it like answers the question of “where is this guy” and there’s a pack of smokes sitting there, so it’s like “oh, smoking”. Plus no worries of getting my phone stolen.
Hereabouts you'd come back to a missing phone.
I can't believe anybody would leave their car keys or cellphone on the table. I live in one of the safest towns in America and I'd never do that. Where the hell do you live? I once saw a guy leave his wallet while he went to the bathroom and I was super tempted to steal it just to teach him a lesson.
I have genuinely never had stomach issues after taco bell.  And I love me some taco bell.
For people with conditions like IBS, if they eat a trigger food it can make the whole digestive system go into overdrive. So yes the stuff coming out isn't what was just eaten, but it is coming out that urgently *because* of what was just eaten.
I don't have a gallbladder. Anything cooked in grease pretty much instantly opens me up.
I have IBS and this happens to me on occasion. Sometimes mid-meal. It's called the gastro-colic reflex and in people with certain GI issues (OP said they don't have a gallbladder). Eating can stimulate the intestines and colon to move things along, to make room for the meal being eaten, which is a normal bodily function, it's just "exaggerated" in folks with GI Issues. The best way I came to understand the intestines is when I heard it described like train cars. Eating is like adding a train car at the end, and if a gastro-colic reflex is triggered, the train car at the front is what is getting released. Normally, you don't have a completely empty train track when you're eating, there's typically train cars in various stages of the intestines.
What? When you eat something that doesn't sit well with your stomach, there are two options: vomit, or accelerate digestion. 


It's pretty common for irritants like capsaicin or high fat content, to cause the latter reaction. Food in your stomach can speed up the entire digestive process, so that nutrient and moisture absorption do not run to completion. 
I do intermittent fasting, where digestion pretty much shuts down. Eating a meal to break this fast will restart the digestion, which speeds up the exit of any poop that may have slowly been making its way out (it can take me 2-3 days to finish pooping everything out when I do an extended fast). This means that I often have to go shit immediately after a meal.
I feel like I've seen it before, but you get an additional charge for the to go box, so it stops people from loading up a fuckton of food
I read that as being personal items? Not food. Kinda odd that the restaurant would question why someone would secure personal items and bring them to the restroom. Maybe it's just me.
When did OP say they took food into the bathroom? Lmao. You mean when they said they brought their things, like jacket phone etc.?
Sometimes there's buffet food, but then also food you can order off the menu. Maybe that?
Never experienced such a restaurant but interesting to note. The Chinese buffets I have been to have been full time buffets and you pay up front like most other buffets and then it's all you can eat, so typically no reason to wait until the end to take the money. 

Sometimes you would get a waiter to serve drinks and bring things like napkins as needed or help with questions but generally not serve any food, also in places like golden corral (seen it self service or waiter service depending on location/timeframe).

Although in the areas I have lived Chinese buffet is more associated with low quality food and questionable seafood so most sit down restaurants may not want to associate their names with that.
I mean low crime rates got to be a good thing
They will pretty much always show up if you dont pay for your succulent Chinese meal.
it’s kinda sad to see this downvoted so much when it’s obvious—this is OP’s only post
Yeah it’s made up. Normally the cops just start blasting when they show up somewhere
I commented to the post but will comment here to. This is not normal at all. Get tested for food allergies/intolerance
Was just about to ask if you still had your gallbladder. The same thing happens to me sometimes, particularly when I've skipped breakfast and my first meal has fried food.
Well don't I look like a silly goose now.
Food doesn't just turn to shit the moment it hits your stomach. It takes *hours* for that process.
lmao, I've never compared my loose gut to the elderly, but it fits so perfect.
No when I feel the urge to take a dump, I go to the bathroom and unload. The whole process takes a couple of minutes max including cleanup.


If your taking longer then your forcing it and/or have a bad diet. Both are going to lead to trouble at some point.
If you have to wait then it’s not ready to come out.
Yes you did.
No way, the word dookie is always funny
But they were #2
No it isn’t. I read your comment a solid 30 seconds ago and I’m still giggling
Doesn't matter who said it first...

They're both #2.

(I'll see myself out!)
Hey, dookie always comes before the splash.
Why? The best poop joke is always number 2. You were just laying it up for them.
Masticated and defecated
Yea, its my usual bowel movement these days.  Cause I dont have the willpower to stop eating crappy foods.  And also I just have GI issues.
Even with IBS it depends heavily on your diet. Everyone has their own that works. Even if it's not IBS, your diet can make it seem like it is!
I called the cops on you.
Freedom of speech also means freedom to not say things, including to self sensor if one wants
Wth are you talking about?

My comment was a pun, meaning I thought it was funny. Why are you so angry
Stressed, overworked, and playing triage. Your check isn’t getting cold, but someone else’s food is, another hasnt gotten drinks or silverware yet, and the middle aged woman wants one of our signature dishes, but needs to change every ingredient except the noodles and explain to the server why and how she’ll react if her instructions aren’t carried out to a T.
I typically ask for the bill when my food comes, unless I intend on ordering another drink. I hate waiting for them to come back at some unknown time after I've finished eating. If they don't come pick up the payment before I'm ready to leave, I just walk up to the register myself and checkout.
It always happens when someone (or all of us) actually wants dessert, too...
Where I’m from we bring a handheld machine to the table to take payment, and it is by far the most time consuming task especially if there are separate bills. People are relaxed and will often just want to chat while internally I’m like OMG HURRY UP I HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO DO. So because I know it’s going to hold me up for upwards of a minute, I have to time it for when I have no drinks or food coming up and no new tables so sometimes it does take a couple minutes before I can get to it. I have no idea why this would happen in the US though where all the server has to do is swipe your card.
Problem is with the company. They won’t let your server bring the bill until you ask for it. I always tell the server to bring my check with my meal.
One answer is some people (karens) can get super mad if you drop the bill off "too early" or even mention it
Smoke breaks. You(and the other guests)made them need a 15 minute breather.
Had this happen once while seated outdoors.  The weather was great all day, but I noticed as I was finishing up my meal that the clouds were rolling in and rain was likely to start soon.

I just stood up and went inside to the host stand to ask for my check.  My server was annoyed, but she had also left me outside in the impending rain for the past 25 minutes so I didn't care.  As I was leaving the restaurant, the rain officially started, so if I had waited I would have been rained on at my table.
If I know a place is like that I ask for my bill as soon as they bring the food and pay ahead of time.
You guys would really hate dining in most of Europe…
It's almost like they have other tables and didn't expect you to inhale your food that fast.
At that point you really have to ask do they want my fucking money or not.
People don't want to tip any more because we're literally getting prompted for a tip everywhere. Carryout food, haircuts, housecleaning, contractors, drive thru... why would I tip someone for a 1-minute interaction where you put something in a bag and charge me for it? Or when you're self employed and already setting your own prices?
Let me guess you were a line cook, and a server broke your heart.
Nope. I'm tired of BOH thinking servers get a million dollars in tips every day. They don't, many are *lying* about what they make, and any time *not* serving is losing money because the "hourly rate" is completely taxed out. On top of that they have to cough up at tax time.
*I carried 8 plates to a table and only made $70 for 12 minutes of work!*
I doordash regularly and I always skip Buffalo wild wings because the order is NEVER out when it's supposed to be and if it is, someone else already took it and now it needs to be remade (code for they forgot to make it since the online orders go to a different order printer than the restaurant orders)
Ok, so it did happen to you at least once since you were 3? You just proved his point
It happens to me when I've been sick and had an all liquid diet for a few days.
It's never too late. You can do it and I believe in you.
Not that I know of! And my BIL isn’t either. TBF, we were both eating a lot of stuff that we hadn’t eaten before - the seitan, vegan cheese, vegan bacon. So, it could have been a combo of all of it.
Gentlemen, this is Democracy Manifest!
You must be fun at parties.

I’m sorry, if you can’t make it through a 1-2 hour meal without a smoke, it’s time to cut back. I used to smoke a pack a day. There are just times you accept that you need to wait. I have literally never left a restaurant mid-meal for a smoke break. Being addicted is one thing, that’s just absurd.
Smoke in shifts like reasonable addicts. That's what my parents always did.
I guess. I'm super addicted to smoking, but I finish my meals first. I never need a cigarette until after I'm done.
My girlfriend who’s Korean told me it’s a normal/very common thing in Korea and at Korean restaurants in the US also to just step outside for a smoke break for a bit and go back in to finish your food.
Yeah I’ve had lots of customer service type jobs as a college kid and what not (grocery store, bakery, etc.) but serving was something I NEVER wanted to do
I was in high school in 2005 so 🤷🏼‍♀️ but no I’ve never been a smoker, can’t stand the smell
And smoking is super common among restaurant workers so I’d bet most servers understand. Hell, there was only one non-smoker at one place I worked.
I vape, quit smoking ages ago. Car keys or phone works just fine though.
I don’t doubt that would be true in a lot of places.  At the places I normally frequent you could leave cash on the table and walk away and come back and  it would be there. In fact if you’re paying cash for a bill it’s common practice to just put it in the bill fold leave it on the table and walk away and leave.
Damn, that sucks. I would pretty much always assume my phone wouldn’t be stolen here.
Do it fairly regularly. I live about 3hrs north east of Vancouver BC in Canada.
It could also be psychological for some. 

To much fast food always messes me up though. Usually only happens if I eat like shit for a week though.
I am in the same boat. Ask to be put on Olestyr or colesevlam.
I was going to guess no gallbladder (I don’t have mine either lol).
Didn't stop me from wrapping steak filled dinner rolls in napkins and hiding them in my cargo shorts. Golden Corral gave me second meals as a young lad.
Ah you're right. I think I read the phrasing of "load my stuff up" and inferred the act of boxing food up, because at least to me I wouldn't expect someone to say that unless they had a lot of stuff they were putting into something, not just putting their phone and keys into a pocket/purse. But yes, upon second review they didn't say that they were boxing up their food
For the most part (except for 2016), the crime reates have been trending downward. However, there's been some high profile cases the past few years which got a ton of press. The stabbing that occured right in front of a police substation was a bit of an embarassment for the police.
And they will put hand on your penis
People care more about being entertained. Doesn't matter if it's true or not. 

I also don't give a F about Karma. It has literally no value anywhere in the world.
OP doesn't have a gallbladder so they're used to this
10 minutes? Feels like a normal time for a long shit, adding in time to wash your hands, change, maybe wait for a stall. Seems hyperbolic, unless it's every time. 
I want to apologize.  I am sorry.
As a fellow person with stomach issues, I can attest to food nearly instantly going straight through me. Perhaps from a physics standpoint it’s the previous meal coming out, but the current meal is what is causing the evacuation.
It's like kicking water uphill
It it was fully processed, it wouldn't turn into diarrhea. Your stomach needs less than two hours to fully dissolve your meal, so expect the barrel loaded when you're about to leave.
You must still have your gallbladder.
Your normal is not everyone’s normal
This guy gets it
Invader Zim once nearly sent Dib to a dimension of pure dookie. When I first watched the episode I didn't know the word actually meant anything and thought it was just some made-up nonsense word.
It’s the only way I can get through describing how my current roommates abuse the bathroom trash. We can flush TP and there is N-fucking-O issue doing so but they choose to place it dookie-side-up in the trash can for all of us to inspect.
I can't get over your name 🤣😂🤣
It wasnt solid
He was really able to wipe up with that one
That they both ignored 'splash and dash' upsets me a little, but I enjoyed both.
Yeah ibs is the new age "OCD" epidemic we had in the early 2000s. Just because you eat like shit and up with poor bowel movements does not mean you have IBS.
Add an r after the K in your user name and it checks.
Reading comprehension isn't your strong suite. I get that.
Yea but as a former waiter the best thing a customer can ask for is the tip one less table i need to worry about
Okay but that's weird too.
Trying to figure out what you mean by the US part? In the US, people still split checks, chat at the table while you’re trying to complete payment on your handheld, and they still pay with cash even if card is somewhat more common.
Nah, if you bring me the bill before I ask for it, it's as if you are asking me to leave. Can be a bit insulting, nothing to do with Karens.
> Smoke breaks. [...] breather.

hmm...
I love them
You must have been server at some point! 😉
Yea I was asked if I wanted to tip when I ordered pizza online for pick up. Like gtfo I’m not tipping an automated service.
The rough one for me was when I got my first tattoo.  I'm glad someone warned me ahead of time, or I wouldn't have known that I needed to bring some ridiculous amount to tip with.  Like, the artist runs the business.  She can literally charge whatever she wants.  Why would she undercharge and just *expect* that I'll tip.  And not like a small tip.  I was expected to tip like $50 on my $200 tattoo.  Someone told me that they didn't tip and that artist would never tattoo them again.  Please explain this to me.
I'll answer this, but I'll need you to become a patreon
I’m now imagining tips at my workplace. 
Your daughter’s aide just changed her after a blowout. Would you like to tip her? Your son threw a chair at his teacher during a meltdown. Would you like to tip her? Your child just bit the speech therapist, would you like to tip him? The custodian just clean up your child’s vomit, would you like to tip him?
I've worked in restaurants as a server mostly, but also dishwasher, busboy and bit of prep work.

Literally nothing he wrote is wrong.
Restaurants always prefer female servers and generally female bartenders and these are the best paid positions in a restaurant besides management, because of the tips and nobody in those jobs is dumb enough to claim all of their total tip money for taxes.

Meanwhile the kitchen is all dudes barely making more than minimum wage working nonstop through their shift, barely having a chance for a bathroom break.
Dude I've worked both servers almost always make more money on average.
If it's not busy on your shift you'll make it up your next.

BOH gets paid crap, treated like crap and don't get any down time.
If serving is so bad I bet your boss would have no problem putting you BOH washing dishes. But you won't because everyone but the servers admit where the better money is.
Nah, servers are definitely overpaid compared to back of the house employees.
Then file your taxes correctly? You dont want to pay taxes on your check you dont file a giant withholding. Then you dont pay any taxes unless you need to.
The Redditor urge to be right is strong.
Yeah but that isn't exactly the same thing. People who say that usually mean when they are grown up.
Same, it took me a while to figure out I can’t eat gluten so I e def had my fair share of gut issues. 

But I know when I have to be careful and make sure.
🍿👀
Ah, sounds like you went to a junk food vegan place. Those foods are generally lower in calorie and saturated fat than the animal counterparts, but also more of a processed food.
seitan may or may not have but vegan cheese is usually better termed bean dip with added spices, which'll do it
Seitan is quite nice and wouldn’t set you off any more than bread would, vegan bacon is inedible, but generally inoffensive to the colon. Blame that weird yellow nonsense they *persist* in calling cheese for some reason.

(To be clear, my problem is not with vegans, it is with taking a substance that does not resemble cheese in any way-not in form, nor texture, nor flavor-does not even function as a good substitute, due to being inedible and unpleasant-tasting, and insisting that everyone else must call it “cheese”. I’m pretty sure that’s a capital offense in at least three countries.)
the rolling R in Democrrrrracy is of utmost importance.
Guy Williams interviews this dude in the latest season of NZ Today. Still as batshit as ever!
It could happen to me
>> people addicted to smoking.


You forget that up until 20 years ago, people were smoking *at the table* in restaurants.
> people addicted to smoking.....       
           
         
> if you can't make it through a 1-2 hour meal, it's time to cut back.         
              
          
             
           
No kidding it's time to cut back. They're addicted. It's always time to cut back, but they don't, cause they're addicted. Being addicted sucks. But you don't care, cause you're addicted. I ought to know, I'm addicted to lots of things. Nicotine especially.
Having previously smoked myself for 20 years popping out for a mid meal smoke is not that uncommon. You might not notice it as much because only the smokers pop out so some other people are still at the table. For longer meals where you're having a few drinks I don't see how wanting a smoke after a drink and appetizer is absurd, in fact those were often the best cigarettes. Plus if people are lingering after dinner for desert or more drinks then I'm definitely heading out for one.

Ya obviously if I'm just having a quick bite I wouldn't but I don't see how it's absurd at all if you're taking your time. It's not like you're trying to light up in an airplane bathroom or something, it's just a few steps and a door.
I agree with you that I wouldn't leave mid-meal to go smoke but damn, you holier then thou former smokers can be so annoying. You're almost worse then the party goers who suddenly find Jesus and everybody who still goes to a club is a sinner.

"Look at me, I used to do this addictive thing but I overcame it and everybody who still does it is SHIT! They don't do this thing that I did as well the correct way! Only I am good! I am better! I was better!"
It's nice to do sometimes tho, I don't smoke anymore but after a couple wines when it's a big meal you need a break from eating anyway.
That's unfortunately just what addiction is, and habituation. 

If you smoked a pack a day tho, that's more than twice as many as me, but this is totally something I'd do depending on the place/people. Could see a few reasons for it that aren't just satisfying a craving.
Not just without a smoke, but without a smoke with company.
Okay, and I smoked half that and took breaks at restaurants fairly often. And either way it was very common for most smokers I knew to take a smoke break at restaurants.
How I might enjoy my dinner or spend my time is my affairs, not yours. Keep your moral judgments about how dinner should be eaten to yourself, please. I didn't know I had to follow some guidebook of manners in order to dine at a restaurant with pissing someone off. And hey, if you're pissed, that's a you problem.
Korea here. I've literally *never* seen this happen. Neither has my wife. We consider it extremely rude to the staff to leave our table empty, because we're at the restaurant to eat and get the fuck out to make room for other guests.
That’s a good thing. Quitting was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Between the health effects, the money lost, and the torture I went through quitting, starting smoking was the singular worst thing that I ever did.
Congrats on quitting! 

but like I wouldn’t leave my keys or phone unattended, but maybe that’s just me
Bad idea if you want to find your car key and phone when you come back. Have been out once for like 5 min, after telling the server we were coming back. We came back inside and they had bussed and put all our belongings to the trash. Had to insist a lot to get them back and they still asked us to pay for all the food we didn't ate
Yeah, I would assume whatever would still be there where I live.
Happy cake Day 🎈
People get scared AI will take over but will never be critical of their own desires. :^)
Not a few minutes after eating. Not unless you have an intolerance to the food
Not OP, but don't worry! The no gallbladder club is not a fun one to be in (better to not have it than get the attacks, though). No way you'd have guessed it.
LITERALLYYYYY when I eat I have to go to the bathroom within 15 minutes, easily. Everton is always like “it’s just a coincidence that it happens every time you eat, that’s not the way it works” UHHHHHH tell that to my gut
Gallbladder removal surgeries do this to people.
all words are made up
When I was in elementary school, there was a girl that lived nearby whose nickname was Dookie.
That pun kind of stinks not gonna lie.
>Just because you eat like shit and up with poor bowel movements does not mean you have IBS.

True, but only mostly... Because it can literally cause it. IBS is at the most basic level, your bowels being irritated easily. 

Eat like shit bad enough for long enough and you'll be fucked for life! Sometimes it can be helped with a better diet and probiotics and sometimes it can't. Though the "new" fecal transplants work better than probiotics, they're not a sure fix either.

There's only one way to check though, start eating healthy and see if you get better. Plenty of people won't do it, and end up being treated for (and eventually genuinely having) IBS.
Thank your lucky stars for Thomas Crapper.
I guess spelling isn't your strong suit. Didn't you say "type the word you mean or don't bother typing at all?" 

Practice what you preach and maybe you won't be so miserably uppity about words you can't even get right yourself.
I had someone say the same thing to me today. Apparently comprehension gets Saturday off.
Except it’s 715 on a Friday and there’s an hour long queue of irritated people on benches by the front door.  When those people leave, it all starts again! Christ am I glad that period of my life is long behind me. Talking about it is putting me in the mood to have a smoke out behind the kitchen while OP impatiently waits for his check.
That is just valuing your own time. I haven't asked for the bill at the start, but have just walked to the register when I was done eating before they brought me the bill.
I think we're just thinking of different things when we say "handheld." In Canada if you pay with card at a restaurant, they hand you a small debit machine at the table and you select the tip and then put your card in yourself.  This makes it easy for a guest to hold you hostage, they'll just be holding it and not pressing any buttons and telling me all about whatever irrelevant thing like we have all the time in the world and I'm just here to hang out.  

And if there's separate bills, which is more common than not, you can't just leave the machine at the table and go do something else because you have to be the one to set up the machine for every new payment.

This would obviously be the same in the US in places where they do have the handheld! But also yes if someone really wants to waste your time chatting, they'll find a way lol
do you feel this way even if the server drops it off saying something along the lines of “no rush, just wanted to make sure you have it”?
That's a you thing though.
I placed an order online for pickup, drove to get it myself, tip them a little, came home & looked at my receipt to see they charged me a tip already while ordering online for pickup ?!?!?
You're tipping the people getting your pizza ready
Do you think your pizza gets made automatically too
I really can't explain it! Tips were never meant to go towards business owners.
I've always tipped my artists, especially when it wasn't his shop and I knew he was getting a percentage taken by the shop. He always asks if I am sure and makes sure I know it is not necessary, but I like him and want to support his art.   
Also, knowing that you tip well could get you priority when booking or even better pricing.
Honestly, teaching would be a more enjoyable job if the bad kids resulted in more money. XD
Don’t forget BOH work can be dangerous too. Many cooks’ hands are covered in scars, I’ve cut off part of a finger, I’ve seen a guy in a pool of his own blood, heard about someone losing their hand, etc etc etc.
That's not how tipped income works. If a server is 100% honest, they will end up having to pay when filing taxes. Because tipped income is taxed *after the fact*.
Except it’s made out of cashews a lot of the time, and sometimes with no nuts or beans
I think my favourite part of that whole video is how theatrical his voice is.

It’s the exact voice that you’d hear “To be or not to be” in. Super Shakespearean but yet he’s raving about Chinese food, judo and his limp penis.
I saw the guy in an interview, possible from the show you're referencing. He said "I was very drunk. But I enjoyed it!" Lol
I haven’t forgotten that — when I smoked that much, it was still legal to smoke indoors where I lived (though many restaurants had done away with smoking sections already). Still never left a table to smoke.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Went to China recently and experienced this for the first time in my life. It is quite disgusting while trying to enjoy a meal.
People still do in parts of Asia.
Yeah, and we don't do that anymore because it's fucking stupid.
I still smoke (just a few a day now) as does my husband, and most of my close friends are pack-a-day. This is not normal where I live (Seattle). Bars, absolutely. Restaurants, absolutely not normal.
I’m not a former smoker. Also, I think you might be adding in a lot of tone I didn’t use. I still smoke, my husband smokes, most of my friends do. This was definitely not my attitude.
Restaurant staff probably love you guys lol. When I was in Korea though, I did notice some patrons doing it at some of the restaurants we went to. I’ve also noticed it in LA too so idk how common it really is, but have definitely seen it myself
Congrats on quitting tho!!
Just different in Canada I guess.
Yeah I guess I was just thinking about how long, not how long before. 
whoa
How bout you both stop. I was laughing all the way down the page until I got to you 2, dookieing all over each other.
Lol I hear that too well
I'm saying asking for the bill when your food arrives is weird. If there's a register involved, I don't think it's weird to get up and try to pay.
That’s exactly what I meant by handheld. At the restaurant I work at, it’s the same device we use to take orders. So even if you don’t have to split the check, you can’t really just leave your handheld behind because you’ll need it if another table is ready to order. And if they do want to split, we have to split the check on the machine and then separately hand it to each person while they insert their card, select tip, and sign. Bonus: if they want to pay cash, we have to run back and forth to the register in between each transaction, which obviously you can’t do when they won’t stop talking lol
No, it’s considered poor service unless specifically requested by the customer.
1) that’s literally their entire job; just because it’s food doesn’t suddenly make it an extra service. 

2) because the in store pizza makers already get paid minimum wage, the tip wouldn’t go to them like it would when tipping a delivery driver.  9 times out of 10 the owner of that stores franchise just keeps it as they can choose to do so.

Edit p.s. - that’s why I stopped tipping the chill dude at subway and stopped going to the chain entirely. He let me know to stop tipping because him and his coworkers never saw a dime. I ended up googling more about it and saw it as a very common franchise practice.
The pizza makers are getting paid a regular wage, not $2-3/hr like waiters.
If you want to, you can always make estimated payments during the year. I did say if.
[removed]
interesting.  basically cashew butter then 😃

a recipe i found once had chickpeas, i think.  it was really just a bean dip.  it was not a good "vegan cheese" but it was a passable dip.
“I had been somewhat influenced by the juice of the red grape.”
Nah I’m on your side. Even when I was smoked over a pack a day 10 years ago I never left a restaurant to have a smoke midway.
Well if you're down to a few a day it makes sense you are less likely to want one when out for dinner. I noticed this at restaurants a lot more when I smoked, and smoking was more common in general, but it is still a thing. I think you're mistakenly assuming because you and your friends don't do something that other people aren't doing it either. It's not like you're tracking every time someone at another table gets up and where they're going.
Nothing worse in this world than a bunch of salarymen who smoke too much. I used to work at a company where most of the men smoked so much that they hardly ever got any work done, and the elevator literally smelled of cigarettes all day because they took so many smoke "breaks" outside.

It's disgusting how common smoking is for salarymen here.
some more than others
Maybe you confused me with another commenter up the thread, because he never responded to me or "dookied" all over me.

But no thanks to the suggestion. I'll call someone out who's being a hypocritical douche and picking on someone any day, especially if it's over something as banal as spelling.
It is very common, especially for people dining during a lunch break or eating alone.
As a former server: *it is*, but that’s fucking stupid; that’s why any of my tables EVER got “forgotten” about.


I just have too much shit to do to GUESS how long you’re going to take to eat.
Fair enough. Explains the reaction is nothing even I tip on pickup lol
Again, that isn't how that works. The $2/hour server base pay is taken out for taxes unless you choose 0 withholding. That "hourly wage" is the only thing that puts a dent in the taxes until tax day. But you don't seem to understand how taxes work.
Do you realize that 40x2.13 is significantly less then the taxes that would be paid on 1k charge tips? It's simple math and you're rambling about withholdings as if that has anything to do with the subject. Next time you try to make someone feel stupid, please have at least a slight sense regarding your viewpoint. Dumbass.
Well it’s often made almost the same exact way cheese is made, just with cashew milk instead of cows milk. There is also cashew butter as well, I have some from Miyokos that is possibly the best plant-based butter I’ve ever tried
So you're at a sit down restaurant where you pay at the table and you get handed a plate of food and you immediately ask for the check? I've just never seen anyone do this.
I also actually started doing this years ago. It became all too common to wait way too long for a check. When I was a server (experience in all areas from rowdy dive bars to fine dining) I’d always drop the check after the customer was done ordering.

Fast forward some years, new life, new profession, extremely busy, and a new realization that I’m no longer getting a check in a timely manner, and now find myself I’m asking for the check when the last thing I ordered hits the table.

I do miss the days when it was standard practice for the check to drop with dessert or shortly after the table is cleared without having to ask for it. When it *does* happen these days I’ll tip big. If I’m wondering where the check is, then it’s late.
TIFU by walking in my parents passionately fucking
Title says it mostly. I accidentally walked in on my dad going down on my mom. This just happened like 15 minutes ago

I was playing Fallout 4 for several hours, and I had no clue where my parents were. Keep in mind, that I also have a hearing deficit and I was not wearing my hearing aids at the time. On top of that, it is currently very late where I live so I figured my parents were in bed or something.

After playing Fallout 4 for several hours, I go into the hallway and I see a small amount of light coming from the game room. I thought that maybe someone left the TV on and I went to turn it off. I open the door and lo and behold...

My father's head is in between my mom's legs, like 6 feet away from me. I just shut the door and ran downstairs and outside. I became a little concerned about what would happen next.

My father came outside, and I asked: "How are ya?" And he said: "Fine, but next time knock."

I explained that not only had I been unaware of where they were, but it was also late and I thought maybe they were in bed. I also mentioned that I was not wearing my hearing aids and could not hear behind the door very well. I also added on top of all of that I saw a light coming from the game room and thought that maybe someone left the TV on and intended to turn it off. I also apologized and said that I just made an honest mistake.

My father said everything was fine and I had absolutely nothing to worry about. He just said that Fridays and Saturdays are the only two days that he has time to spend with my Mom, so I should be more... vigilant about opening a door on those days.

TLDR: I walked in on my parents having sex. My father asked that next time I knock, but he acknowledged that I made a genuine error.

EDIT: Holy F-Word 6k upvotes! I want to thank the people who have given me positive reinforcement so far.

EDIT 2: I am at a loss for words. More than 10K upvotes. My inbox is so demolished that I don't think even Vault-Tec could have made a vault sturdy enough to protect it. 
Ads for Fallout are getting weird
Dad is the real gamer here, he fucked OP's mom.
I know it feels weird because you are probably young and it's....your parents, but you should know that so so so many longtime married couples eventually get to a point where they don't have sex anymore. they aren't intimate at all and it just becomes a very sad relationship that many times ends in divorce.

So, as weird as it sounds, you are lucky to have parents that are still going strong with intimacy. Now hit yourself with a frying pan and forget everything you saw.
Seems to me if you're going to have sex in a common room of a house where other people live, you should expect to be walked in on...

It was well handled afterward though. So many times one person or everyone involved blows it up and makes a huge thing about it when there's really no reason for it to be. Bet you get a little more suspicious about those lights being left on though.
This is the best possible scenario. All of you handled it in the most mature and rational way possible. No harm, no foul. Shit happens. 

Every time I read a post where people cry and moan about being traumatized or feeling nauseated after such an event, I just shake my head.
I saw my parents doing it when I was 15. I saw my dad's butt. 


He couldn't make eye contact with me for a month and the day after I saw them my mom hamded me a book about how ducks and fish lay eggs. Then she said 'Don't let a boy touch your hoo-hoo or I'll kill him!'




I was 15. 




So, considering that....I think you all handled it well. Lol
Well at least your dad is a better lover than DJ Khaled
Well managed, but… don’t people lock doors?
If you’re a teenager and your parents are still having regular good sex then you should be happy because they probably have a better relationship than average.
> My father came outside, and I asked: "How are ya?"

Oh my God, this is hysterical. Are you Canadian?
Who the hell knocks on the game door room. I  get knocking on bedrooms. But for the rest they should be more aware there are other people in the house.
>He just said that Fridays and Saturdays are the only two days that he has time to spend with my Mom, so I should be more... vigilant about opening a door on those days. 


Now THAT was extraordinary open from his side.


For me that time is Sat and Sun, about 6am, before kid wake up.
They should lock the door next time.
Honestly, you should consider yourself lucky. You have parents that are still into each other. There are so many kids that grow up with parents that are just roommates and sex is a monthly belly to belly missionary checkbox. If your old man is still going down on your mom after 15 or 20 years and they are still getting freaky like this, you are being raised by two people that love each other and still have passion. It's a rarity. LOL, you'll never get that image out of your head and it will "appear" at the most awkward times for the rest of your life, but "passion and freakiness for decades" is the pre-set standard for you when you are looking for your future partner later in life.
Why were your parents doing that in the game room.

Super weird to me they would be having sex in not the bedroom with other people at home and not locking the door. Unless it was some kind of weird thrill for them to be doing it where they might get caught.
"Gee whiz, Dad, hang a sock already, would ya??"
To be fair if someone else is home they should be behind a locked door
Sweet that they're still maintaining their relationship 😂

No dead bedroom,  bitterness and staying together for the kids. 

I have a doorstopper for doors that don't have a key.
So I've never been caught having sex by anyone...cause they can't open the door. 

You should gift one to your dad 😂
I don’t understand why they chose to do this in a family room instead of their bedroom lol
Bro how about they go to the bedroom instead of getting it on in the middle of the house.
Why in a public space? That feels weird imo, especially in a house with their kids
Shits normal bro, next time ask your pops if you can have some money to go to an arcade or something
Don't they know how to lock the door?
My response to “next time knock” would have been “if you’re gonna fuck in the public spaces of the house, next time lock the door”.  

Yeah the situation isn’t terrible but telling you to knock is like saying it’s your fault. They weren’t in their bedroom or even a private area.
GET OFF MY MOM!!!!

Wtf, is this a reddit post made by a logical human being? Where is the responsibility deflection and self pity?!
I think you follow all those who have come before you…make this go away.

Never think of it again.

Delete this post.

Your parents don’t have sex.

Never open their door w/o knocking.

Sunshine and rainbows.  Butter flies and candy canes.  Happy thought, happy thoughts…
Today, *they* effed up by having intimate relations in a common area of the house, knowing another person was in the home.

Good for your parents but I think your dad was embarrassed about being caught and misplaced the blame, especially knowing you're hard of hearing. I would take this as a sign to continue not wearing your hearing aids on Fridays and Saturdays tho lol Just make sure you have snacks for any after hours gaming and live in blissful ignorance.
As a fellow hearing aid user I feel your pain. Many a time I have stumbled I to awkward situations because of my inability to hear someone mumble something like "I'm in here" or "occupied" and I walk in and get yelled at for not hearing them and walking in.
On the bright side, at least you couldn’t hear your mother moaning
Parents should’ve locked the door.
Okay, but... They were in a communal room in the house. Why would I have to knock on the door to the den? And then you and your dad act like *you* were in the wrong? Maybe don't have sex in public spaces in the house?
Hey your parents still like each other. Even though I’m sure you are a little shook up. They still have a healthy relationship.
Ever heard of a lock? I purely blame the adults in the situation. 

You messed up? No. Your parents should add locks and use them. 

And, in the end, it’s all pretty harmless as long as you’re okay. Is there a tmpfu?
I’d just like to let you know this is a memory that will stay with you forever. It will be immune from blackout drinking and even Alzheimer’s. You may forget your name but you’ll remember this.
Just remember, your parents are human too. They prob could have locked the door or put something against it or something knowing you’re in the house and may not hear them. I’m sure they’re as embarrassed as you. Learning experience for both parties.
Waiting for the AITA post by the dad
You didn’t do anything wrong. They should know that if you have kids in the house, you don’t do it in an unlocked shared space.
Plot twist Op is 36
Honestly, good for your mom. 

That said, glad everything turned out well and you all sound like fairly rational and well adjusted people. Good on you
Be happy that they are happy.
Give em both a high five and laugh that shit off.

You saw a loving husband taking care of the woman who gave you life. 🤣

Seems like your folks should take some responsibility with the situation. Maybe lock the fucking door (pun intended) or put something in front of it if it’s a communal room???
Think about all the places they've probably fucked in the house. All the furniture thats been fucked on that you have sat on.
Isn't it great that your parents are still so in love with each other? 

You and your dad handled the situation like adults. Try to forget all about it and just be glad your folks have a healthy relationship.
Good for you buddy, you got parents who appear to be making their relationship work!

I remember reading somewhere that kids are both grossed out that their parents are intimate but also reassured because it shows that the family unit is strong.
Now you know exactly how to handle this when your kid walks in on you. Dad handled it perfectly.
As a parent, just know that we get it in whenever, and wherever we can. Time of day does not matter. It can be 3am and my husband and I can wake up and get to business then go back to sleep. When you have kids in the house you pretty much have to take your time whenever you can get it lol. I'm sorry you had to witness that. I understand, I've overheard my [grandparents] before as a teen and it was shocking to say the least because I had no idea they were still active in their late 60s. But you and your parents handled it very well and mature. Maybe, they can do something to help prevent it as well - hat on the door knob or something?
Uh, maybe do that in your locked bedroom when you have children?
Your dad not acknowledging that they fucked up too is messed up. I'd say it was more their fault than your fault.
Just remember you’ve been deeper in your mom than your dad ever was.
If Dad's still going down, the marriage isn't. Good on him
Man, at least it was your actual parents. I walked in on my mom cheating on my father when I was a kid and never got over it.
It's too early for me to be reading all this, I read it as you were playing fallout in your game room, and walked into the hallway and saw a light on in the game room that you were just in, went back into the game room you just left, and somehow your mom and dad got in there and started fuckin
Go mom and dad!
“I came out of there dad and now you wanna get in ??”
"Hey dad. How about you and mom do that in the non-public rooms of the house, or maybe shut and lock the door?"
Is this the first time you wished you were blind instead of having hearing difficulties? lol


It happens to the best of us, your mom isn’t the Virgin Mary popping out babies through magic. She be fuckin bro.
One down, one to go: You've walked in on them; only thing left is them walking in on you. Only then will your journey to the Dark Side be complete.
Tell them to bang in the privacy of their room next time.
My mom came in my room after me and my girl had sex we were both sweating and I literally threw the condom in my trash can and as soon as she walks in she goes, "Damnnn it smells like hot ass in here" then looks down at my trash sees the condom and says, "At least someone is having sex in this house". My girl just hid her face in embarrassment haha my mom's a savage though she calls out everything.
They were in a common room tbf
Just remember this when they walk in on you and your SO
Bruh why did you add passionately?
Your mom has to be happy if dad still dines at the Y
Yeah, it sounds like it was handled great. Dad sounds pretty chill.

I would say that in life, almost every kid has either walked in on their parents doing it, or one of thenparents walked in while the kid was pleasing themselves.
Not super related, but I also have hearing issues from a very young age and I'm honestly glad you feel comfortable enough to walk around the house without your hearing aids. I started to feel comfortable without them only after I moved out (yes, due to my parents).
Also no wonder you didn't hear them, shit's hard without aids 🤣
It's fine buddy. Just get some brain bleach. Luckily I was so little when I did it I don't remember the details 😂 dad responded pretty well. "Listen kid. I still think your mom is hot and the weekend is when we get to enjoy each other... let's knock next time huh?" Lol it happens kiddo. It's ok
Shoulda put a few more points into Perception! ;)
Don't they have a lock 
Need to tell him to put a sock on the door next time lol
![gif](giphy|6IPNUgkpCsDRK|downsized)

your welcome
You should be thankful your folks are still in to each other.
You see one upside of having divorced parents is that you will never see em fucking
That's awesome. He handled like a champ your dad. For Father's day, buy him a lock for his door.
I’m sorry but why are you expected to knock? Your parents shouldn’t be getting intimate in the game room but instead in the privacy of their bedroom. 🤨
My mom remarried at 64 (11 years after my dad died) and my younger brother and I discovered to our horror that she was a screamer. Never SAW anything and never wanted to.
God damn this is the most funny and brutally honest storytelling. Totally sucks that happened to you homie but my LORD this is too funny.
Least he wasn’t choking her 😂
The proper reply: Fine, but next time lock…
Im sure its awkward…. But be thankful. Im 40 and we still make love almost every morning. I have buddies that almost never get that feeling of closeness with their wives. It leads to an unfulfilling marriage.

Sounds like you handled it well.
I mean... at least your parents still love each other, right? Could always be worse.
How are ya?
Knock if the door is closed, but if the door is open and it’s unlocked then your parents were being pretty inconsiderate.
![gif](giphy|6IPNUgkpCsDRK)

This should help.
I walked in on my parents 25 years ago; shit still haunts me! Nothing more frightening than seeing your dad doing your mom doggy style and yelling your name from being shocked that I opened the door.
He said, "next time knock"? 

My wife and I always, and I mean ALWAYS lock the door to where ever we are, unless we are absolutely certain that we cannot be walked in on.
I feel so happy for them!  A lot of couples do not have a healthy sex life, let alone one at all!  This is awesome that your folks are still intimate with each other and make time for each other.  It is part of a healthy relationship (although I understand really unnerving to see.  I hope to have that when I am older!
Good on your parents for keeping it together. Knock next time.
a core memory is created that day
But why would they not do this in their bedroom when there are other people living in the house?

Next time, ask for tips.
Your dad handled it very well. I think it's a blessing that you didn't have your hearing aids in. I wouldn't want to know what they sounded like in bed. But seriously, they need to lock their doors. Especially if you have older kids in the house. My wife and I always take a little extra steps to make sure we can go at it without the worry of burning an image into our children's minds. I hope it doesn't come up in negative ways later.
I gotta tell you, you've already received great advice and input by others, but your dad deserves so much credit for habdling that situation well, and for being an absolute king and still being passionate with his wife. Not everybody gets to have that in life and your parents having that kind of intimacy is the goal we should all aspire to.
Sheldon Cooper moment lol
And so OP learnt to knock three times like Sheldon from TBBT
I was thinking about starting up Fallout 4 again - never finished that game.
Awkward but sounds like dad handled it well.  Good lesson for all.
My supervisor at work told me about the kids walking in while they were doing it doggie style. a 12 year old and maybe a 13 or 14 year old. He said its bound to happen, but it'll only happen once. The kids knocked from then on.
Better you caught them in that position than say mom getting her face squirted with a pearl necklace! Theres some mental trauma for you.
I mean, it happens. Its how you got here. If you want to keep reliving it, keep talking about it. If not, move on with life my friend.
Just wanted to share the post directly below this is hilarious given your title https://i.imgur.com/wRDuFX9.png
I came home when I was about 16 and my mom and her bf were in her bedroom.... and I heard her bf ask her if she wanted it in the ass again... my mom said yes
Only error i see here is them using a public space in the house without being sure you weren't asleep.  Otherwise life goes on.
Yea, you didn't do anything wrong so I'm not sure how you'd get in trouble for an innocent mistake.  It's not like you were caught smoking or something and forced to smoke the whole pack.  "How dare you walk in on me and your mom!  Now you have to watch me go to town on her... for an hour... to learn your lesson!"
Just make a lot of jokes about losing your eyesight.  My son said to me one day “Elliot [his middle school bestie] went blind today.”  I said “OMG, what happened.”  He said “he saw his mom naked and ripped his eyes out.”  He was joking.
Your parents are in love and they communicate with you! That’s awesome!
Better that than seeing or hearing them fight
It's human nature . Prepare for the random times it pops into your head but eventually it'll fade. 

It's good too if ya can joke about it. Go on Amazon and see if you can find a diving patch or sticker that says certified diver or something like that and give it to him .
Trust me when I say you're lucky that's your experience with your parents, as weird as it sounds. Mine was hearing them constantly fight. One time it got so bad I maxed out the volume on my guitar amp and blasted the house cause they were so loud. I was so looking forward to moving out. My mental health has drastically improved since then.

My parents are still together but they... still have their issues lol
I'm confused, OP. It seems like the door was open and you saw the light coming from the door being ajar and that's why you opened it all the way, right? Or did you see light coming from *underneath* the door? Because that changes things a lot. If they left the door open and you just opened it wider, it doesn't really make sense for him to tell you to knock before turning off the TV light etc...

Glad it all resolved peacefully though.
Well, it's embarrassing and sucks to be in your position. At least it sounds like your parents' marriage is going strong lol.
To reverse the polarity now you have to violently beat off with a closed door. Now when your dad comes into your room this next parts critical…. Maintain eye contact and then tone it down to a slow jerk and say… while still maintaining eye contact “maybe next time you knock first hugh champ? Don’t let the door hit you on the way out bud”
Should dropped ur pants and said player three has entered the game
It’s a public area of the house. It’s 100% not your fault. Dont even worry about that part. Sorry you had to see this. No one wants to see their parents like that.
That wasn't your fault. I would never have sex with my husband outside locked bedroom when our children are home,  don't care if it's 3am. Your parents knew better.
Do you know how you got on this planet? 
I dunno OP, I think it's more on your parents for not doing that somewhere more private...or at least locking the door lol
How old are you?
If my kids saw me kissing their mom or playing grab ass. The would go ewwwwww and I would say how the hell do you think ya got here
15 minutes ago and you're still so traumatized you can take to redit and write a well articulated and detailed, soft porn account of how you saw your parents doing what parents are supposed to do and that nothing bad happened afterwards between you and your parents except you were told to j ock next time before opening ing their door????

Really, reddit attention fabrication or not, grow up a little.
If you didn't feel freaked out, I'd worry. Awkward AF. least your parents love each other, right? I'm so sorry that happened.
Plot twist: OP is 57 and parents are 80.
How do you think you got here lol. You dad seemed like he was cool about it so I’m sure your good. Be happy your parents still love each other and can still connect
Check his ass and be more ‘vigilant’ about shutting/locking doors!
WTF?  They were going at in in the “game room” and expected a knock before someone entered?  No, you didn’t FU, they did!!!
If you have kids you should stick to your bedroom only for private time. Glad it worked out in the end I guess!
Alcohol, ear muffs and sun glasses are required around the house at all times.
Im sorry but they should go to a room w a locked door
I don’t understand why you would apologize ?

You live with them so if they want to have sexy times they should have been more careful
My kids walked in on their dad and I when they were 12 and 9. The funny thing was that the door was locked and my oldest picked the lock and they both barged in. Honestly, it cracked me up - I think their dad was a bit more horrified by it. They are 30 and 27 now and guess what? They are just fine and have really healthy attitudes toward sex - and share way too much with me about their sex lives. But I’d rather have it that way than not sharing at all.
Maybe they should’ve been fucking in their bedroom lol. I don’t think you should be knocking to enter a room when it sounds like it is openly accessible by everyone in the house lol.
How is Fallout 4?
When I was 14 I walked in on my parents. Im 37 and it still pops up every now and then. It’s an image that never leaves you, but it gets easier to forget with time. Also, this is more on them than you because they didn’t lock the door.
Knock on the game room? How about fuck in your bedroom dad? Jesus lol
Say hello to your new baby brother
Your parents still like each other. That’s pretty amazing. You should give them privacy and knock from now on. Count yourself lucky kid
Bro you and your dad won my heart. Very nice relationship between you
OP not directed at you, but just in general as one of my pet peeves - It seems like one of the last things that children learn is that healthy parents are, in fact, just people and not "support, care and money dispensers." Hopefully, with full lives, including a sex life. And that child rearing is just one of their endeavors in life. 

Children want to feel safe having their first sexual experience in their own homes, along with supportive parents who guide and nurture them through that part of life and typically get nothing but disgust and apprehension in return. How is that fair? I think most kids wouldn't like it if their parents accidentally walked in on them as teenagers having sex and wouldn't stop saying "ewwwww how gross" for the duration of their shared lives. You walk in, say excuse me as you turn around and walk out, and life goes on! Really doesn't even necessitate a conversation beyond what the OP had, assuming all parties are sexually active or at least sexually aware. 

Anyway, you can't make other people happy if you aren't happy yourself. Sex is one of the ways that happens. As others have pointed out, when couples stop having sex, it's almost certainly not a good thing. Miserable couples make for miserable parents. Go check out R/DeadBedrooms if there is any doubt. Your parents are healthy. OP sounds like no one really fucked up. It's just an accident. No biggie. Kudos to everyone for not making it weird!
Better than them passionately pursuing a divorce
I feel more bad for your parents OP, talk about a mood-killer 😅🤣
 we all have been on one side of that or another lol
Sort of narcisistic on the parents part. Dad was going to town in the game room, which naturaly doubles as a family room. Someone should not  need to worry about whats going to happen when they walk in to an open door, in their own home.
Soo back to fallout.. where are you? Have you aligned with anyone yet? What’s your main weapon?
All I can think from this is that my son has been blocking me for all 9 years of his life, and now I have evidence that it may not end soon. 


I don't think he has "caught us" yet, but that's only because the door was locked. The dude is uncanny with his ability to yell for us or knock right when things are starting. 


OP good on you and your folks for keeping things open and I hope your folks lock the door in the future.
I'm confused as to why your dad would be slightly upset over you bursting in on them in the game room (which I'm assuming is a public space)? It's not like you burst into their private bedroom... then I would expect his reaction. Ya can't fuck in shared rooms of the house and then be shocked when other people in the home walk in on you...
Grow up people fuck be happy your parents are about it could be worse
I have 5 kids 16-22.  My husband and I have been caught a few times and my lovely kids like to bring it up to try and embarrass me during dinners.  Finally I just said.  Look.  If you want to know details I’ll gladly share but bottom line.  You all should be very happy that daddy and I still want to have sex with each other !!  If not.  Divorce would be inevitable 😂😂😂
![gif](giphy|6IPNUgkpCsDRK)
Good for them. While it's weird for you, I know, it's lovely that your parents love one another that way still. Always nice.
Maybe they should lock the door?? It seems reasonable for you to open that door, given it’s not a bedroom.
My buddy, who is 47, told me a story last year about how he walked in on his parents. Had her bent over the couch. Never thought of locking the front door ig. If I’m 70 and still fuckin- life is good
The only person more traumatized than you is your mother. God help her. There’s no way she’s not super embarrassed 😭😂
Learn to knock.
If it makes you feel any better, my dad took me to the Dr once when I was 15. After my check up as the doc was about to walk out he asked the doctor this exact question in these exact words. "Hey doc, you think you could cop me some Viagra samples?"..... The doctor did indeed "cop him" some samples. That was an awkward drive home.
Everything is fine except telling you to be more vigilant about opening doors. He’s the one who should have been more vigilant and took it to the bedroom. Bit trashy honestly.
Maybe ask your Dad for some pointers for oral sex. Seems like he is keeping Mom happy. Be glad your parents have a healthy relationship. Your Dad sounds pretty chill.
Good thing you weren't wearing your hearing aids. The moans from your mom!
Just be glad your parents love each other and knock next time.
I walked in on my parents going at it as I was sobbing, holding my dead childhood cat. It was a traumatic night for everyone.
Your dad doesn't want to set your world on fire. He just wants to start a flame in your mom's heart
He was just exploring her vault
Imagine not having locks on the doors inside your house. Like, do these people not have to change clothes sometimes?

EDIT: about what other uses a lock on your door can have: sleeping naked, watching porn, masturbation, not wanting to be bothered, not wanting people to wake you up, having sex, being naked in general, pooping with the bathroom door open, crying, doing drugs, drinking, playing videogames when you're supposed to be doing some school assignment, and the door's pointed directly at your PC screen, so you can alt+tab and say you were changing clothes to explain the locked door, and the list goes on.
I’d just be pissed that they were screwing in the game room knowing I was home when they have their own damn room 😒
Your mother's inbox was demolished as well! :-)
Your parents still find each other sexually attractive and they want to fuck. That’s an excellent thing
Congrats!  Your parents love each other!  Much better that be the case than them hating each other and making home life miserable...

  
(Yes, I understand that it was traumatizing.  Think happy thoughts!!)
I love this ❤️
And so begins years of therapy... :D
The kid should knock, but no matter how many times a story like this is shared, I'm always surprised by people fucking in rooms without door locks or in the bedroom itself with a door that can't be locked.  I mean I never lock my door but I never fuck when other people are occupying the house.
I (38M) and my wife (39F) got caught on the kitchen steps by our daughter (18f) just last weekend, the curtains got ripped off the wall by my wife who ran to hide in the mudroom while I just opened a lower cabinet and crouched and said dont come any further in the kitchen. Random times DD coming home got us caught on the couch on saturday too. I'm still irritated about that one. Fly the nest kid!  
That being said, be happy your parents enjoy each other, these lessons will work both ways. You wont walk in on them, and when you are older you hopefully wont get walked in on.
also dont get good night kisses from mom on those days...
So your parents have a happy marriage, you should feel stable.
When I was around 15 or 16, me and my best friend went back to his house after being out with some friends and his parents always wanted him to check in when he got home so they knew he got home safe, well he went into their room to let them know he was back and to his shock and surprise, his mom was going down on his dad. He quickly ran down stair and I kept asking him what was wrong. He couldn’t get the words out. I got worried, I thought they had told him a family member died or something but he finally told me “I saw. My mom. Going down. On my dad” I couldn’t contain my laughter. That was in 2004 and I still bring it up. He gets pissed. lol
That's how you were made
This is rock and roll my friend. Your dad is a rock star. If your mom is happy then so to you should be. A little therapy won’t hurt. Good job man
Worst 15 minutes of OP’s life.
Not having your hearing aids in saved you an extra level of trauma.   Be thankful
How about LOCK THE FUCKIN DOOR DAD
maybe your parents should fuck in their bedroom when the kids are home and wandering around, honestly
Well, at least a healthy marriage is better than having your parents arguing all the time while you game
Dad is wrong. Not OPs job to tread lightly in case adults are fucking in common areas. It’s adults job to lock doors if they are going to be fucking in common areas. Otherwise they may get unwanted observers.
I mean I could get it if it was Fallout 3 or New Vegas, but how do you get that distracted and entranced by Fallout 4??? 

Super bad on their part to not go to their bedroom to have sex.  Why would you knock on the gaming room door?  Nobody does that.  If you're comfortable it can be your running joke until you move out, anytime they walk in there when you're gaming you can say NEXT TIME KNOCK!
I get that he was just embarrassed but your dad is being an asshole with his "just knock" comment. 

Uhh how bout you fuck in your bedroom and not a common area (game room)?? 

Also it's weird af that they had a sex in a common space knowing you were home and awake. 

If I were you I'd low-key be a little pissed about that. Even my college roommates largely knew better than to fuck in common rooms and if they did and got caught they new they were the ones supposed to apologize lol
Fucking in a common area but you should knock. Sounds like you have a new jerk off room
I might get downvoted for this but I don’t really like how your dad treated you OP. You’re hearing impaired AND they were in the game room (not the privacy of their own bedroom). Why should you knock to enter a public area and why are they doing it in the game room. It just seems icky to me especially if they’re doing it on something that can’t be cleaned or that others use. If anything your parents should’ve locked the door. Your dad acted annoyed when I think the proper response or reaction would’ve been embarrassment(?) or cracking a joke about it(?) I don’t know
Why the game room though? Like it sounds like everything was fine, no harm no foul but... like... don't they have a bed room? monopoly will never feel the same...
Lol. Don't worry, papa is making excuses but this is on him lmao. Be happy though, all our parents are divorced! 
When I was like 13 and my dad was in the Army, we got sent to a mandatory retreat for all the families preparing to go to Afghanistan, and on the second night my mom got obliterated drunk and tried to steal a tiki torch from some college students. Then when we got back to the condo where I had to sleep on the couch because it was a single bedroom, and as I was trying to sleep, my parents proceeded to fuck for what felt like an eternity as I heard my mother screaming "oooooooohhh God. Ooooooooh god." I tried to cover my ears and drown it out, but I couldn't. The memory almost induces vomit.
Hey you parents love each other! That’s great!
Pro tip:  Your parents probably do have sex now and again.  Hint #1 - you exist.
As someone who has walked in on my parents 4 times, it’s nice to know your parents love each other.
This is why when my husband and I get busy, we lock the door and double check it. 😝
When other people are in the house, couples should lock the door. It's the parents fault in this incident.
Hey OP, its nice your dad still goes down on your mom, it's a good sign. Be *glad* he does, because otherwise I'd have to and I dont know how to be a dad.
He says you should be more vigilant about opening doors? How about he locks the door? It wasn't his bedroom or anything
And now you've learned a very valuable life lesson. Knock, and wait for an answer, before going into a room where someone has closed the door.
Kid playing video games, Dad takin' care o' bidness. 

Perfect exemplar for the world today.
should of asked if he needed a hand tying the bitch up!!!!!
I’m glad my parents never did it. They adopted and my siblings and I just happen to look similar
Wanna make my cock explode?

Another settlement needs your help 

I wonder if an enemy snyth was involved in this event
You only fu ed if you stuck around to watch until the end
I walked in on my grandparents in 1977. There was dust everywhere.
Dude, what you should be saying is how cool your dad is for coming and talking to you about it. How many parents today would avoid that like the plague? Don’t beat yourself up about it. After all how do you think you came into this world? They ordered you off Amazon?
the awkward situatsion you described reminds me of the time i accidently walked in on my neighbors doing some... ahem, private activities. i was mortified, but they were very understanding about it. your dad's response of just asking you to knock next time sounds like a pretty reasonable way to handle it. it's good you were all able to communicate openly instead of it turning into a big confrontation. as a parent myself, i know how important it is to have that private time with your spouse, even if the timing isn't always perfect. just be more vigilant about knocking, especially on those friday and saturday nights your dad mentioned - you don't want to risk walking in on them again!
 How old are you?

>He just said that Fridays and Saturdays are the only two days that he has time to spend with my Mom, so I should be more... vigilant about opening a door on those days.

If it were me in your shoes:

Lol, don't be home on the weekends. Got it, old man.
When the guy in the lobby says he’s gonna fck your mom turns out to be your dad
Good for your parents!  A healthy sex life in middle age is a positive thing. 
But they definitely need to learn how to lock the door.
As a dad, I suppose it was one of those very rare occasions when you wanted to turn off a light anywhere in the house. :)
They should have gone to their bedroom tho.
When a man loves a woman, he kisses her radiation burns away.
You had to say passionately lmao
What do you think of the new fallout show?

>I also apologized and said that I just made an honest mistake.

I promise you, your parents never thought you did this on purpose lol
How you think you got here , they should have locked the door thou
I walked in on my brother and his wife on accident when I was in my 20’s. He’s deceased now and she’s long gone but I never quite got over that OMG OMG OMG feeling. I’m thankful it wasn’t my parents !  I would be mortified.
We old with kids, gotta take advantage of our spots. That 7am “wrestling match” becomes important
I see a lot of therapy in your future
If only you had been boning Jex, this might never have happened! 😂
Your parents sound awesome, and chill af. Only a minor fuckup on both sides.
That happened to me once.  I walked in, saw them, and walked out.   I was half way down the hall when all 3 of us busted up laughing.  Never talked about it, but I think everyone understood that it's a perfectly normal thing that happens sometimes. You move on.
At least your parents have a good marriage?… 🤣
Be proud of your parents passion!
My parents rarely, if ever, experienced congress. Until the age of 4 I thought they bought me from Sears and Roebuck. There was love, but no passion. It was a sterile environment.
That wasn’t your dad…..
so I'm guessing you didnt know your dad's dick had been in your mom's mouth before? 

I did
I remember one time when I was little I yelled up the stairs to stop wrestling because I was trying to sleep. It wasn’t till later I knew why they started laughing. 🫣
lmao "lo and behold" has me rolling on the floor
At least they're doing it, don't think mine have done it since Y2K.
Not you cockblocking your dad  lol everyone fucks friend. Next time muffle your scream and slowly close the door.
Pictures or it didn’t happen.
ITT: people fuck. OMG wow. Things that are natural shouldn't be traumatic. Grow up.
Better to walk in on your parents together, then one of them alone 😂
It's good if they are still fucking. People get so fucked weird in relationships and stay for so many wrong reasons.
Yea, a light inside a room usually means nobody is inside.
I walked in on my grandparents. I was 17 they were late 50s.  That shit is stamped in concrete in my mind.  Have fun with that.
Don’t see the problem,our kid caught me plating my Mrs,was a bit of a shock all around but we laugh about it now. He was 12 ish at the time,he’s now 35 and been‘caught’ by his own kid. Get over it.
You just need to make sure they walk in on you rubbing one out and you’ll soon forget walking in on them.
You’re not alone man, my parents (not married but together for nearly 30 years now) broke up when I was 8 and my dad moved out so it was just my mom and I for like 2-3 months and then our sump pump broke, our basement flooded with more than a ft of water and my mom only thought to call my dad and he basically came running back over to fix it. He did and they reconciled, they told me they were back together the night before Easter and I decided that night to call my friend on MSN messenger and tell her about it and play some games. At some point, I excused myself to go to the bathroom. For context, my hallway leads directly into the living room and their bedroom was at the end of the hall, which, for most of my life had the sofa in direct view from said hallway. Lo and behold, my mom was going to town on my dad. At first I didn’t know what was going on but it clicked pretty quickly and I decided to ruin their “fun-time”by asking if there was an “Easter bunny tracker” (like the Santa one) while fully knowing that I was interrupting after putting 2&2 together. 

Nearly 20 years later and now I get to make fun of them for it

Edit: they never noticed I even left my room 3 times before interrupting them lmao
And on that day, OP swore to never leave their room without wearing their hearing aids again.
Hey it could have been worse. Your mom could have been pegging your Dad.

No kink shaming but that's a hard image to get out of your head.
Meanwhile your dad is speaking to you with shrimp breath.
As a kid I would have no clue what was going on, but I don't think my parents practiced oral sex. My mother was of the opinion that it's okay if a man wants to do it to a woman but a woman should never ever do it to a man because it was too degrading. She told me that long after I had moved out. Kinda late. Over time I can see her point.  It is a good dodge though.

BTW that's probably not as bad as the "primal scene" that Freudians always talked about.
Now you have ammunition against your parents if they interrupt your gaming
He’s a mother fucker
There’s a nonzero chance he was down there for 4 hours.
Read the title only and said out loud: “NOOOO! No no no no no…” sorry buddy, better you than me 🫡
I cracked at “passionately” damn.
My wife and I were staying with my parents for a couple weeks waiting to close on our house. At the time they were in their 60s. One day I'm at work and she texts me she could hear them having sex. She wasn't sure how to feel but was mostly cheering them on. We have never said a thing to them.
And now you always knock three times and repeat that twice before entering the door.
“Look junior, one thing you need to know about mom and dad is that on Fridays and Saturdays we smash. Like all the time.”
I mean, if mans doesn't want you walking in while he's being intimate with his wife maybe he shouldn't do so in a common area? They're at fault here, not you.
When I was 19 or so we only had cable in my parents room. So I jumped in there to watch Ghandi on HBO. About halfway through I decided to call my girlfriend. I pick up the phone and don’t get a dial tone so I figure the phone is off the hook in my bedroom. I walk down the hall open my bedroom door and see my dad ballz deep in my mom in my bed.

I turn around, walk out, close the door and pour a gallon of bleach in my eyes.   

It’s been almost 40 years and I still have the image seared in my memory.  

To this day I still don’t know if they know what I saw. Until today I’ve never told anyone but my wife.
Eeek! How old are you?
When my husband and I were dating, his daughter was a young teenager. One time she just came all the way in the room and stood next to the bed to ask her dad if she could go somewhere or do something. I tried to shrink myself as small as I could. I was mortified. I honestly think she was clueless as to what was going on? Oh my God.
On the bright side, be glad they still have a loving relationship.
That just means that they have a very healthy relationship.  I bet OP will be cautious from here on out. Every time he sees a closed door, he's gonna picture dad having a snack between mom's legs! 🌮
Handled it terribly.. should have gave him a high five
Always knock, you learned the hard way
I’d say walking in on love making is better than walking in  on an abusive beating. I know many who have experienced that. Walking in on parents having sex is awkward and off putting, sure. But they love each other.
“Wanna have sex?” -ops mom
🏅
Great show though for real
🥇
Fallout 4, for when you don't want to be neck deep in pusy and mis the apocalypse!

i laughed at this
😂😂😂😭😭
Ok, this made me laugh quite a bit. Good job!

A couple of hours later, I actually feel less awkward about it. Reddit is being surprisingly mature and level-headed for once.
My Father is the only man I can trust. 

On the other hand he fucked my mom.
Dad still got game.
Dad knew what he was doing. This was a power play to serve as a reminder of who the master of the house was.
Dad even gave times to not cockblock. What a guy.
The last of this comment seriously cracked me up. My parents were old when they had me and I walked in on them when I was 17. Gave me hope for myself when I get that age, I’ll still be able to get busy hopefully.
I thought this too — even more so because dad was taking his time with mum rather than just having a quickie 😂
this is the first thing i thought of. OP consider yourself very lucky that your parents still have the emotional intellect and such an involved relationship with each other that they would plan together time. It's unfortunately rare.

  
but tbh, with your dad's response to you, and the matureness in your family -  i'm not surprised.
lol, oh man- I walked in on my mom and dad when I was about 11, and I was TRAUMATIZED for years.  At the ripe old age of 35, I look back and I’m like- get it!

Related: recently, my dad, who is in his 60s, had a surgery. My SIGNIFICANTLY (more than a decade) younger sister was sent to my parent’s house to collect some of dad’s meds.  She found a bottle of Viagra.  I swear to god, she was ready to claw her own eyes out and throw herself off a building when she called me in a panic about what horrific thing she’d found.  I just laughed.  I think she’s still mortified.  

Like others have said- my mom and dad have been married 40 years, they’re in their mid 60s, and I’m glad they still fuck.
I’m 31 and my parents are in their late 50s. Accidentally saw a text conversation between them and they were flirting like horny teenagers. It was both kind of sweet and extremely mortifying
I know when I was a teen the idea of my parents *doing it* freaked me out, but I also remember being in my mid twenties and learning my parents still had sex (going over some health screening forms with my mum) and thinking *"good for you!"*
i second this. my parents are near divorce rn and ill tell you, they went on vacation to Cancun last year, you’d think they spent some *alone time* but they had 0 intimacy in the whole week they spent alone in a hotel room. don’t ask me how i know.
I’m 36 and my dad just had open heart surgery. Beforehand when I was in the ER with my parents my mom was reluctant to say that my dad is prescribed viagra, so it’s not just since someone young. Parents can be awkward with it at any age.
This. No one wants to think of their parents having sex, but how the hell did you get here? :D
Be vigilant Fridays and Saturdays! It’s healthy that your mom and dad are sexually active. I bet they are awesome parents!
Right. "walked in on my parents doing the most wholesome, passionate, normal, healthy thing ever. I'm mortified." But we were all kids once wondering if our parents still did stuff like that. Turns out we didn't know how lucky we were that our parents were still doing that stuff.
To be fair to my parents, I was **very** deep into a gaming session on my computer. So maybe they thought that I would not leave my room for a few more hours. Also keep in mind, sometimes when people are super horny their ability to make decisions is affected.

But hey, at least I got the "good ending" for this. My parents acted normal for the rest of the night and then went to bed. There was no yelling, name-calling, or aggression of any form.
This should be higher. Gross.
Had to scroll too far to find this. If you don't want to be walked in on, you should be fucking *in your bedroom, your own, private space*. OP made no errors here, parents were just risky and inconsiderate.
My thoughts exactly. If you don’t live alone, you should be having sexy time behind a locked door. If you went in their bedroom that’s different.
I read about this so frequently on reddit.  It makes me wonder why people don't take a moment to lock the door.  It takes about 5 seconds.
Thank you for the reassurance, internet stranger.

Oddly enough, I don't really feel "grossed out", "scarred" or anything like that. I just feel awkward. I think the reason why I feel that way, is because my parents never made sex an "off-limits" subject, unlike other households. My parents are not Puritans, I'll say that much.
I mean your parents fucking is one of those things you know is happening but never want to see it

When I was a kid I had the habit of walking into my parents room at night without knocking, my mom will always berate for doing it 

Now I know why and thank god I didnt see anything
Sounds like OP's Dad shook his head a bit, amirite?
> Every time I read a post where people cry and moan about being traumatized or feeling nauseated after such an event

You just described r/teenagers
Dad is definitely like “This fucking guy.. leave us alone on Friday nights kid..”
Same, like, do you realize you’re here BECAUSE your parents get it on? Get over it.
It can be traumatizing if you’re parents were knowingly doing it in front of other people.
My mom sat me down when I was 8 and had a book written/drawn for kids to explain sex. She was very upfront and said I could ask questions. Her parents avoided the topic like the plague and she didn't want that for me or my siblings. 

I'm sorry your parents handled it that way.
I'm sorry that your parents had to act like total weirdos due to that. Nobody should be speaking to their child like that.

After my incident... My father was softly like "bruh" basically. Not even mad, just very mildly agitated. (Understandably so) When I shared my side of the story, he was completely fine. No yelling, kicking, or demeaning.
>Don’t let a boy touch your hoo-hoo or I’ll kill him!

What are you [Elliot Reid](https://youtu.be/AML86SQ5bi0?si=8fjjCnmM0p349spA?&t=59s) or something?
The bar is low.
Thank you for this comment.
Why did I just imagine a woman moaning and making sexy talk, followed by calling his name, except...

*D! J! Khaled!*

Some thoughts are so cursed they should never have been conceived to begin with.
A mother one
Nope, unfortunately. Not even doors to the bathroom.
I used to rip on my parents so hard for having "old people sex" before I moved out.  They were wild. It was a whole thing.  

Now that I'm grown up with kids of my own, it makes me happy to know my parents were still passionate and enjoying each other for over 30 years.

My children have not walked in on old people sex yet, but that day might arrive.  Hopefully, they will be as cool as OP was about it.
“Good, ‘n you?”.
For real, do you really have to eat out your wife in the game room? They play Yahtzee in there for God's sake
Yeah, I didn't understand why they were doing it in there... Seems actually gross and shitty of them. While their kid is in the house.
Bedroom = private space

Game room = public space

You shouldn't have to knock on public spaces. Gonna give the poor kid a complex about knocking before entering any room in the house. Dude will be knocking on the front door befor *leaving* the house.
Locks on all of the doors is the way to go.
They want to be caught.
For my wife and I it's Saturday or Sunday evenings after the kids go to bed. 

And even then the risk of a walk in is always there. 

It's hard being a parent. Especially when you're married to someone who turns you on in so many different ways.
> For me that time is Sat and Sun, about 6am, before kid wake up.

I found out much later that my parents were super happy we loved watching Saturday Disney on TV that ran from 7am to 9am on saturday mornings. Guaranteed to keep us oblivious. :D
Especially if they have a hearing impaired kid.
And they should fuck in their bedroom; now there's a wet spot from OP's mom in the game room.
They want to be caught.
62MF married 42 years. 5 kids never got caught. A few almosts. After all that time and kids out of the house, we still hit it daily. And she insists I keep my beard trimmed to the soft stage.
Right? Like as a parent, we keep it in the bedroom with the door locked so that the kids don’t accidentally walk in on us. Like I feel like that’s just the rule after having kids
Even worse, it sounds like the door wasn’t even completely closed. That’s the bare minimum when you’re in a shared space.
Finally get to play the "Don't speak with your mouth full" card on your Dad
Do t forget the unicorns…
This made me chuckle! Sorry that happens to you, never would have thought about it
I heard my mom and dad when I was 11. I thought I'd buried those memories but lo and behold your comment brought them back up.
Exactly what I was thinking
Oh, I'm doing much better now. I'm actually laughing my ass off at some of these comments.

And holy fuck nearly 6k upvotes. I might make an edit soon
I have been wondering why the door wasn’t locked. Isn’t that standard?
Oh my…. Did you tell your dad?
Dad was in there long before you were kiddo. Haha
"I came in there so you could come out," - OP'S dad.
Yeah… the “games room” where they go to play “games”
Thank you for asking the real questions.
This.
Because it's fun not always doing it on the bed.
The thing about owning a house is its your house you can do it in whatever room you please. Wherever the mood strikes. 

The thing about getting older is sometimes a boner won't last and you've gotta get on it while you can.
Me too. I finished it, but not the way I intended due to the Desdemona glitch…
Loaded it up the other day and fell in love with it all over again.
I beat the main story with the Brotherhood, I'm halfway through Far Harbor now.

Soon, the town shall know Atom's blessing!

But Fallout 4 has a fully automated settlement system. All of it just works. It just works
[deleted]
Yeah why should he have to knock to enter a common area in his own house lol. Not to mention he might not hear if there's someone inside. The parents should've have apologized for making him see that.
His dad didn't sound annoyed, he just said knock next time and everything  was fine. What else could he say? What else IS there to say? But dad could have locked the door...
Right? So many people in these comments are here because not only did their parents have sex, but their *grandparents* did too. It’s a natural thing. It’s not like Opie walked in like TAG ME IN DAD IM HERE TO HELP
I bet that sucked for your dad.

And what kind of dumb double standard logic supports that thinking?
"You wanna make my cock explode now? " -ops dad
Two weeks from now it'll just be funny. I'm still laughing at accidentally seeing my friends dad naked at 12 I'm 39 😂
Good on ya for being able to see the humor in it. 

Just to echo some comments here: don’t let it traumatize you, this is pretty normal. Awkward for sure but they sound like they have a good relationship and you should be proud of them for that. I nearly walked in on my parents when I was around your age (probably playing BF2: bad company at the time) and they don’t know how close I got to opening the door. Still waiting for the perfect moment to bring that up and have a laugh at their expense. 

I have two kids now and can confirm that it’s tough to find time for intimacy as a parent. 

PS I loved playing Fallout 4 to the end
I know many people already said this, but as awkward as walking in on them feels, be happy that your parents still love and feel attracted to one another. The alternative is pretty sad. 


And as far as being awkward, we all know that in order to have kids, parents had to have sex. It is the most normal and healthy thing in the world that they continue to show affection to one another even after they have kids. 


All that said, it would help if they locked their door when they are busy, so it isn't really just your fault for not knocking. I wouldn't feel bad at all in your place. Shit happens. You could have knocked, they could have locked their door. Mistakes were made, lessons were learned, and hopefully no one is too traumatized, lol. 
My *mother* walked in on us! She was living here, and had a question for me. I said, "Mom!!!" Her vision wasn't great, since she was in her mid-80s, so *she stepped into the room* and said, "What?" I said, "Do you MIND??" She finally figured it out (she couldn't see any "bits" from where she was, lol) and left.

Later she apologized, and said she was glad we were still making love.
[deleted]
Just keep calling your dad “You MFer” with a wink and a high-five.

Until your mom starts beating both of you up, lol!
Listen, we may all be immature assholes on this site, but the average age is like late 20s, so it's just one of those things we're starting to understand ourselves lol
"Reddit is being surprisingly mature and level-headed for once."

I just want to say OP that this is not your fault like your father said. Adults should know better than to have sex in shared spaces in a house with their child present (especially since you're hard of hearing). You shouldn't be afraid to walk around common spaces in your own damn home.
Good to hear!

I died catching my Dad and step once. Still try to erase it from my mind. And they were covered thankfully.

I don’t think they knew at all, I left it that way.

But now I have a kid of my own, that’s the image my brain will not handle if caught, and I aim to never scar myself accidentally. Guess who is getting a lock on their door one day lol
I mean you would do the same thing if both of your hands were broken somehow, kudos to the dad.
Does your mom have this shirt?

"Let. The boy. Watch"
How old is old,  and did this create any problems with your life?
Lmao I was thinking the same exact thing

That sentence had me like, "damn, dude NICE. Your parents REALLY like each other, that's awesome" 😂

Poor guy, but I bet he's had a great home life. Well, besides this lol.
You're a good dude man.

That empathy and logical thinking is gonna pay dividends your whole life.
Lol hell ya dude. The fact that you are making solid jokes about this already says loads (I had to) about you. On the realsies.. you sound like an incredibly rad person. Keep it up man that empathy shit will pay dividends down the road. I hope you take all this positive feedback seriously. Two thumbs up.
Sounds like both you and your dad were **very** deep into your sessions. 

I hope your dad got a happy ending.
Nor should there have been any issues from their side. You did absolutely nothing wrong. Your parents should be more cognizant that if they’re going to engage in sexual activities in a common area of the house, that getting walked in on is a risk that they’re taking. The fault for that happening was entirely on them, absolutely none on you. Again, you did nothing wrong.
You didn't get t"Good ending"... That's dad...
Everyone in your house is deep in something
You're a good boy. Lol
Yeah I wouldn't want to sit on that sofa
Honestly, be happy your parents have sex life. It's really the best to make nothing out of it. After all you were made in some way...
I like the "be careful when opening doors on Fridays and Saturdays" rule. 

Kudos to everyone involved.
I think dad going down on mom may be the least traumatizing option you could have walked in on too
Walked in on my college roommate absolutely punishing his Cornish hen one day. I just shut the door and went across the hall to another friends dorm. He text me apologizing and I was basically like “dude, no problem. We all do it.” It was slightly weird when we saw each other next but it’s was fine shortly there after. It’s just a part of life.
How has that upbringing affected you? I don't have kids yet but it was always my belief that this should be how families handle the topic. I come from a much more sexually shaming household and it's definitely had an adverse affect on my life
It IS awkward. But nothing more than that. Fortunately, awkward usually wears off rather quickly. Good on you and your parents to handle it like you did.
It's honestly a good sign that your mom and dad are CLEARLY still enjoying themselves together after years together. One day if you're lucky your kid will walk in on you as the cycle continues 😂
I can only hope I raise my children to feel the same way when they’re older
I walked into my parents banging doggy-style in a tropical beach bungalow when I was around 13 years old... first and thankfully only time that ever happened. I said something along the lines of 'whoops, sorry, never mind" and walked back out... and that was the end of it. Probably ruined it for them, lol. Wasn't grossed out or scarred either, it was just totally awkward and embarrassing.

Tell you what though, I do wish I walked into them banging again some 10 years later, because that would mean they'd still have been together.
https://i.redd.it/1byhlhv4ud1d1.gif
Were you worried there would be any yelling, kicking, or demeaning?
I hate thissss. And then sometimes they have the gall to be mad when you lock the door. Like wtf you expect, I'm pissing? Why do you want to be in here???
Thing is, and I say this as a middle-aged dad, old people sex fucking *rocks*.

You know exactly what turns you on and have no qualms about your body anymore. You just give and receive pleasure in any way you like, 'cause life is waaay to short to not have and give orgasms.

I prefer this over the "how do I look in this pose" - kind of bumbling, quiet, unexperienced sex I had way back when.
Notsabad. 

Fer fucks sake McMurray, that's inappropriate.
My father came outside, and I asked: "How are ya?" 

And he said: "Fine, but next time knock."

And I said: "Your face looks like a glazed donut.'
I can’t explain why but “They play Yahtzee in there for God’s sake” made me absolutely SNORT with laughter (which is unusual) at 5 something AM.
YAHTZEE! OMG now my brain is going there next time we get frisky. FU for that Mr. Jones.
Knocks on fridge... 

Or do you want to catch the salad dressing?
We are Saturday/Sunday morning while the kids watch TV. Lock the door. My 4 year old daughter did get very upset the door was locked on Mother’s Day while her dad was giving me my present 😂
We got interrupted just a couple of time by a 3 year old. She was not moved at all, she know parents love to lay together. :)  
We have to get up earlier after that
Weekend afternoons, we like to go take naps together.  In our bedroom.  With the door locked.
My parent sent me and my sister to swimming lesson on every Saturday morning...
My kids recently found out why they got to watch SpongeBob in the afternoons
At a certain age, we’ve learned how to throw a towel down. It comes with paying property taxes and listening to NPR.
Same.
My sincerest apologies
The house I grew up in didn't have locks on any of the doors at all. My current house has locks on all the bathrooms and a couple of the bedrooms, but not everything does. I know it's super easy to install, but it's pretty common not to have a lock on every door in my area.
Yeah if you have parents that still like each other, the “game room” is fair play to erveryone
And with multiple kids… sometimes that’s the best place available while we think you’re asleep or gaming hard somewhere else (have a gamer). I can name pretty much every room/floor/counter/shower that that moment presented its glorious moment. For me to get down with kids around.
That's kinda creepy (the neighbors not you)
Ha this happened to me too. Got up to go to the bathroom during the night and I guess he was making a midnight naked trek to the kitchen at the same time 🫣 Not sure if this is relevant, but they were French and nakedness wasn’t unusual around there lol.
There an end? WTH?
That's so so so so sweet I can't even lol. I'm glad people are pointing out how wholesome (and natural!) it is, instead of the silly "parents fucking, ew, gross!" like humanity would exist without it... 
LOL this would be hilarious! Bet the dad would use it, too
Dammit, unrelated, but that gave me flashbacks of calling my husband "son of a bitch".
.... In front of his mom.. 
I hate that I got this reference
Veterans of Reddit, assemble!
Lmao! Seriously tho... As a relatively "old" parent. What does this mean? Our parents were young. Now we're damn near 40 with a 6 year old. We were even considering having a 2nd one. But the math of having a kid graduating high school when we're 60 doesn't really add up well.
I'm 30 now, but my Dad is now 85. I was born in '93, him born in '39, so he had me when he was 54, my mum over 20 years his junior. To me it's normal, but it boggles some staff colleagues minds, as I work with some people who are in their 60s that have younger parents than my Dad - Heck, my grandparents on my mums side are younger. 

I've had a great upbringing and life and my parents have been my stalwart best friends and heroes growing up. The past few years have taken a massive toll on his health and he requires care now, but I have no issues whatsoever being there for everything he needs, and as I work in care anyway, I've got the skills required. Nothings too difficult when it's for those you love.

At the end of the day, don't worry if you feel you're older than you should be to be a parent, and worry about if a child will be okay growing up with older people. Just love your children when they come. 🙂
One of my good friends in high school was 16, his parents were both over 60. His oldest brother was in his 30's. His parents were retired before we graduated.
My dad was 50 and my mom was 47 when she got pregnant with me. I mean now that I’m 44 I guess it wasn’t too old but at the time I thought it definitely was. Especially when I walked in on them. To answer the second question, some of the guys I work with told me my dad should’ve known that eggs and sperm definitely have a shelf life.
They were in their mid and late sixties when this happened. Other than me thinking it was gross and never walking in unannounced ever again not really.  As I’ve gotten older I laugh about it actually. I mean think about when people lived in one room houses or huts. What did those kids deal with??? Ugh….
Right?! 😂
Oh shit I didn't read this till now. Obvious hard agree.
Agreed. Dude Is going places
What about Mom
I guess he's just lucky he didn't walk in during Pegging Monday. That'd have been a difficult one to erase.
Yup. In my household these topics were completely “off limits”; not barred but just literally NEVER discussed. I’m 38 and I have never had even a hint of my parents being amorous beyond just casual affection. It’s kinda sad.
I agree with you, I always think it’s best that kids know that a healthy relationship includes intimacy and sex. Maybe not seeing it first hand……lol
seriously, shows he’s got a happy family
>*My father came outside*, and I asked: "How are ya?" And he said: "Fine, but next time knock."

Least traumatizing **and** no risk of surprise sibling

Silver linings
Cornish hen is a new one for me, lol. First thought I had was that he had purchased a Cornish hen and...
I was actually thinking he was eating a real Cornish hen, viciously and deliciously.
My parents divorced in my infancy. Grew up between 2 households. 

In one house, anything sex or related to bodies was off limits. In the other it was all just a normal part of life. 

The normal part of life way is how I chose to raise my kids. At 3 my daughter asked how her brother got in my belly. We read *it's not the stork* together. As she grew up we read the other 2 books in the same series. 

She's a teenager now and I actually know what's going on in her life because she talks to me. 

So yeah. That's the reallllllly short version to answer your question.
Wish I could up vote this 1000+ times, bra pages in sears catalog were ripped out and Nothing was discussed except your privates are going to send you straight to hell and you will burn burn burn for all eternity, ok yup don't raise kids that way...
One day your kids will use the word "passionately" to describe your fucking 15 minutes after seeing it to thousands of strangers 
No, not at all. But I was concerned about the scale that my dad would be agitated. Turns out it was not much and I was able to easily explain my way out of that one.

I guess next time they'll be taking this to the bedroom.
"Why do you always lock doors cheesecake?" People get so annoyed with me too for locking doors for privacy.

I swear I know so many people who don't lock the door to the bathroom. To the point even if the bathroom door is halfway open and the lights are on, I knock and ask if someone is in there. sigh roommates.
Preach. Today is my 12 year wedding anniversary (17 years together) and the sex is better than ever. Yeah we were like bunnies when we first got together but it was much more quantity over quality compared to now
Old people sex is quite indeed the shit.  I still have no regrets about razzing my parents for it.
Pitter patter, let's get at 'er.
c'mon 😂
Yeah idk it’s like an old person thing. Very strange
Our kids were grown, one was married and the other engaged. So it was just us, but my youngest sister decided she didn't want Mom living with her anymore, so they said she should stay with us "for a while", and dropped her off with some of her belongings at our house. 

After several months, she finally figured out she wasn't going back, and we were happy to have her with us. She was here five years. It was a blessing.
I consider my parents old. My mom had me at 45 and my dad is only a few years younger. I’m in college now and they’re both in their late ish 60s.

Idk, I guess old is relative. But one of my friends mentioned their mom celebrating her 50th recently. My mom’s 50th was when I was in kindergarten.
Had kids when I was 42 and 44.  Fortunate to have two perfectly healthy kiddos.
My husband is 45 and we have a newborn. Not uncommon depending on where you live
My dad will be 70 when my youngest brother is 18 so it's not that bad
Honestly it’s pretty cool from the perspective of the kid. My mom was 40 when she had me. I got a unique perspective from her growing up (and some dance moves that won me a very embarrassing prom). But she knew things other parents didn’t. She could tell me all about the moon landing when I learned about it in school, had firsthand experience of being cool in the 70’s… it was pretty dope. She still didn’t seem old to me when she was helping me move into my college dorm at nearly 60. I guess it helped change my view of growing too. Go for it if that’s what you want. 
Oh also: I have a sister too, same mom, 21 years older than me. Her experience with a young mom was completely different and we kind of share what we learned from what feels like two different mothers sometimes.
I was 40 when my daughter was born. Still have fun times with my wife whenever we can.
Eh I don't consider that old, my mom had me when she 35 and I feel that's on the higher end. I personally feel there is a certain point where having kids older is somewhat not the greatest but it is relative
As someone looking *start* a family at 40, thanks for this.
I feel this. I'm 34 and my dad was quite a bit older than my mom. So, my dad is getting old, and I'm worried I won't have kids before he passes :( He's probably the best guy I've ever known. And my mom died from cancer a long time ago.
She got rear-ended.
Its Muff-Dive Monday. Peggings are strictly reserved for Thursdays.
Honestly want to upvote, but 69 up votes seems correct for this particular TIFU.
Same, until I was 17 and thought my mom would be proud of me for coming home an hour before curfew. I was very incorrect. We still never discussed, but I never came home before midnight and never got in trouble for missing curfew again.
When I was a freshman in high school I noticed my mom was getting a few gray hairs one day, and wanted to ask her what that was like. I got out the first half of the question "How does it feel to..." and then succumbed to an attack of the embarrassed giggles. Bless her heart, Mom jumped right on in there to help me out - and prove there were no questions she considered taboo - by answering what she thought I was trying to ask. 

For years I've wished I could have been a fly on that wall, watching my face as my mother informed me: "Sex really isn't much fun, it's just very messy."

Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Just no. I did not want that piece of information. Ever.

Saddest thing is, in case you're thinking she only said that in an attempt to influence a presumably horny teenager away from sex, nope, she meant it. Explained a lot over the ensuing years.
This gave me the perfect "browsing Reddit while the sun comes up because I can't sleep" chuckle to start my day
I enjoy making off the wall metaphors for masturbation. lol
Better than “cornichon”.
Did he thaw it first
Thanks for sharing that
“Don’t raise kids that way!” I couldn’t agree more.
Or locking the door - middle aged mom here.   We had a lock put on our bedroom door as soon as our son was past the toddler stage.
Happy Anniversary!
Like it wasn't wholesome before! Glad you were able to spend time with your mom, y'all sound so sweet!
One of my closest friends in high school had parents the same age as my grandparents. But then my mom had me when she was 16 and my grandmother was 38.
I'm 45 now and my kids are 27 and 16, so I consider having a child at 45 old and unlikely without medical intervention though I still take BC because no one wants surprises.

There are benefits to being a little older when having kids, like the other moms at mommy and me are not old enough to be your parent, you don't get asked if you're babysitting your kid, you don't get asked if your kid is your sibling, etc.
I have a 10-15 year difference in my parents’ ages compared to other people in my age cohort. My mom had me, the oldest, at 35. I have two younger siblings. They’re now in their early 70s and most people’s parents are just approaching 60. A geriatric pregnancy for my mom was a lot different than my friends now (almost all of them with kids didn’t have any until their late 20s to mid 30s). I don’t want kids. Especially now that I’m too physically exhausted all the time. I can’t get down on the floor with them or do things that many younger parents can accomplish.
I'm 41 and having a baby next week. Sort of feel like I'm ancient because my youngest is 16. I'm glad to hear that it's going ok for some people.
Especially for our generation. But being 2 kids of 22 and 17 year old single moms, we just feel so old. My mother just turned 61 and told me she can't imagine having a 20 year old child and in this economy likely even still living at home.

Then you hear about increased risks of complications during pregnancy coupled with living in Texas right now... I hope your newborn is healthy and happy. Kids are amazing precious gifts. I'd sacrifice quite a bit to be able to experience it all over again.
Only if you stretch first, you could get a serious cramp pulling off those expert moves at the same time if you don’t stretch
I too love to pull the tail off the donkey.
As a person who follows Jesus and has kids, it is really important that my wife and I are open and honest about sex and sexuality with our kids. They will know that our bodies are pretty neat, and sex with a spouse is fun, intimate, and something to be enjoyed!
Thank you! 😊
It wasn't easy at times for either of us! But we had a lot of good times too. My sister sometimes picked her up, or I drove Mom to her house, and they'd hang out. Or if we went out of town, Mom would stay with her.
As a child free, single woman in my mid 40s, this comment hurt.
My recent ex's dad is 3 years older than my grandpa. 3 of her siblings are older than my mom. Hell, they're older than *her* mom.

I'm on the 30s end of eight siblings that span from 33 to 6. My Pops remarried and had the oldest of the youngest three when I was 21.

Shit tends to get weird with divorce and remarriage, but I know a strange amount of people who were late-age 'Oopsie' babies. I have a friend who had an Oopsie when she was 42, and her husband was 57. That kid is 10. What a weird trip.
My husband's parents are the same age as my grandparents. My mom had me when she was 19 and my grandma was 39.
My mom also had me at 16. I remember my friends who had "normal aged" parents just seemed so old to me.
[deleted]
My daughter came on my 40th. She'll be 2 this year. I also have a 17yo, 14 yo, and 3.5yo.
It’s going ok for some people! I had one young and one later so mine are over 20 years apart. It also happened to two of my friends similar situation. One had a newborn of her own and a grandchild in the same year! Families come in all shapes, sizes and ages and it’s perfectly fine.
Just turned 40 and I have a four month old! We have older kids in elementary school too. It’s wonderful!
Our youngest turned 18 and moved into a college dorm the same week I gave birth to the next kiddo. Literally started right back at the beginning. 

The younger kids are now teens, older kids are grown adults. 

The only downside is anytime we go out anywhere as one big family, it never fails that someone thinks hubby and I are the grandparents of the younger ones. We laugh about it 🤷🏻‍♀️
Congratulations and blessings on your newest member of the family!!!
I’m 31 and my mom has a 5 year old. I feel ancient myself and I’m just the sister.
>coupled with living in Texas right now..

So sad that you need to take this into consideration.
Rule 18: Limber Up
My husband and I are also followers of Jesus. We approached the topic of sex and sexuality with our kids in the same way.
I mean I’m child free and in my forties now as well. It’s a choice. And I’m glad I made it LOL.
Bilateral salpingectomy has the dual benefit of keeping ectopic pregnancy low (scarring or banding of fallopian tubes has a higher risk than IUDs), *and lowering the risk of ovarian cancer by 65%!* 

https://www.themedicalcareblog.com/opportunistic-salpingectomy-how-is-this-not-totally-a-thing/
I'm fine staying on the pill, Dr said if I stop we'll probably need to look at HRT because perimenopause but since not full menopause, pregnancy is still a possibility albeit slim.

But thank you.  I would probably go with the tube removal because it's more guaranteed.
Tell me about it... I'd sacrifice a lot to have another child but not my wife.
Oh, for sure. But imagining a GRANDCHILD who already has their permanent front teeth...yowzers.
I’m 35, 36 in July. A friend from school - who is a week older than me - had her first child at 17. He’s 18 now (almost 19) and expecting his first child in a few weeks. 

As a child-free woman, the thought of being a _grandmother_ at my age is fucking baffling.
And my mother who isn’t even 60 yet is now a great grandmother courtesy of one of my stepsisters and their kids lol. 

I gotta say though they seem happy so good for them. But I’d have lost my damn mind LOL.
I'm sure it was more common in the past, accidents happen
TIFU by putting tampons in wrong for 10 YEARS
I feel so embarrassed. I (23F) have had my period for more than 10 years now, and I just learned, from a Reddit post of all places, that you are not supposed to just shove the whole thing, applicator and all, up there and then leave it like that. I have a Biochemistry degree. I have travelled the world. And yet somehow I never figured this one out. This is my first and probably last reddit post because I cannot keep my horror at the fact that I’ve been keeping pieces of plastic in my vagina for ten years inside, but I absolutely cannot fathom telling anyone I know about this. I have always thought that tampons were super uncomfortable (for reasons that are now glaringly obvious) and mostly used pads, but I love swimming and so I use tampons fairly frequently during the summer. As best as I can figure, I have used hundreds of tampons in this way. I have been scouring my brain but I don’t think that anyone ever told me about this, despite the multiple, wildly uncomfortable health classes I had to take in grade school. The worst part is that I knew the plastic bit was called the applicator, I just figured that was because it made putting it in easier and you were just supposed to leave it in. Thank you, redditors, for listening, and I can only hope that this horrifying blunder of mine will convince you to explain very clearly to your children how tampons work.
TLDR; I have been using tampons wrong for ten years and am extremely embarrassed 

Edit to answer some common questions: yes, the whole thing fit up there. Maybe I just have a long vagina idk. No, it probably didn’t work great but I only kept them in for a couple of hours at most while I went swimming and I used them very infrequently, maybe a few times a year. There are lots of comments asking why I didn’t read the instructions. Well, my mom always just had loose tampons lying around. I’ve bought my own maybe once or twice but that was when I was much older so by that point I felt confident in my tampon-using abilities and never read the instructions (lol). I had health class and went to grade school in a fairly liberal public school district. Now I am questioning what I thought was a fairly comprehensive health education.

There are some comments asking if I can read or saying that I must not have gone to a good college/ worked hard for my degree. Please don’t be rude. In my experience sometimes it’s the people who are really smart at one thing that are super dumb at others. I want to thank the people who shared their own tampon blunders for helping me feel less alone in this embarrassing mistake.

Another edit: people are also asking about how I could have had that much of a lack in curiosity about how it worked. I think when I was younger I felt a lot of shame around my body and didn’t want to think about it any more than absolutely necessary, and once I got older and more comfortable I kind of thought I knew everything I needed to about tampons
Before cellphones, when you went to the bathroom you just read whatever you could find if you didn't bring anything. As the only boy growing up with 4 girls I've read many a shampoo bottle, cleaning product , and tampon instruction manual.

Edit: be aware of Toxic Shock Syndrome
How did it never just slip out? The plastic makes it slippery
This is why tampons come with instructions. I’m honestly impressed they still did the job.
Okay but surely the tampons didn’t work very well for you then? You had all the absorbent parts covered in plastic inside you. And the applicator didn’t slide out? I’m very confused lol
Boss: “Steve? You know you’re 20 minutes late. Everything ok?”

Steve: “Sorry, sir. I started reading about tampons on Reddit and, uh, …”
If it make you feel any better, my partner used to just put the tampon horizontal on there, not inside at all. She was also a swimmer, so I don’t know how she didn’t figure it out tbh
I feel like sitting down would have been awful!
Every box comes with a very clear instruction and warning sheet that you cannot miss when you open it. You never looked at one when you first started using them?
As a once 10yo boy fascinated by the pictures in the tampon instructions, I say “haha!”
This reminds me of my aunt. She was talking about how much she hated shaving her armpits and putting on deodorant. The left pit was easy but she said it was so hard and awkward to angle her arm to do the right pit. I told her that she could switch the hand she is holding the deodorant/razor in and it would be much easier.

She was in her mid-40's and a nurse.
So sorry to have a chuckle at your woe but glad to hear that you did figure it out and at least you don’t have to “fess-up” to anyone. My daughter started her periods about a year ago, at 12, and I’m forever grateful that my wife was so brilliant with the whole process, showing her how to use tampons correctly, helping her to understand the full period process in a way only women can understand. 

At least you have a great story for your kids eh?!
Just move to another country.
Here where I live tampons do not have applicators.
Problem solved :P
Tampon tips:

**DO NOT** insert a tampon straight up into your body, perpendicular to the ground.  It will bottom out on the sidewall of your vagina and will not insert fully.   

**DO** angle the tampon so that it is pointing back, towards your anus. Your vaginal canal angles back more than you think.  This way your tampon will insert fully with the entire body of the tampon inside your vagina and only the string passing through the vaginal opening.    

**DO** insert the tampon and applicator into your body, use the applicator plunger to push the tampon out of the applicator tube, then remove the applicator tube from your body.  (OP already covered this).   

**DO** change tampons frequently, about every 3-4 hours. Even if the tampon is not soaked, still change it.  Leaving a tampon in too long can make you sick with Toxic Shock Syndrome. And it will smell absolutely terrible.    

**DO** consider a Diva Cup or other period cup product.  They can be safely left in place *all day* without emptying, are better for your body, are reusable, and are better for the environment.
Oh dear god. Welp, on the positive side, you will have many more periods to practice inserting and ditching the applicator.

I'm really sorry this happened to you. Shame on the adults in your life and our public health system.

Enjoy your new found freedom of using a tampon the intended way.

BTW, how did you figure it out?
This is what I did at first for a while too! I'd never heard of anyone else messing up in quite the same way, so, solidarity.
I never used an applicator but have seen it on some packages in the drugstore. Applicators aren’t used here. 

Anyway that sounds unbelievable uncomfortable! I can’t imagine letting a piece of plastic inside and go do sports or even sit! Glad you found it out.
My sex ed teacher had the same story! She goes, "Ladies, I checked the package and NO WHERE does it say to remove the applicator and I just want you to know that you THROW THAT PART AWAY!"
And to think there are people who don't want these types of things being taught outside of their homes
The first time I had a babybell cheese I ate all of the wax without unwrapping it
Huh. I've never used a tampon with an applicator in my life and I never knew they were plastic. Learn something new every day.
There's a lesson here for everyone who never reads the packet or the highly folded piece of paper that comes in a medication box.  

There's a saying in engineering RTFM - Read the F*$%ing Manual and it can save ages of heartbreak.
girl that’s okay, my friend thought pads went on sticky side up😭
How do you push it in without the plunger pushing the tampon out though? Has it never started popping out the top?
How did you even move with the plastic in?!? How did they even work?  This can’t be real
You learned this from that askreddit post yesterday where a woman said she ran track with the whole tampon in, didn’t you?
Not the exact same situation but i also had no idea how tampons worked for multiple years. I wasnt aware for a long time that anything was ever supposed to go in your vagina at all, i was physically unable to fit anything in my vagina (not even my pinky finger) until recently due to a septate hymen. I would leave my tampons in between my labia like a hotdog. I could never figure out how people kept them in when swimming or how they didnt bleed everywhere when they used them because i was just entirely unaware how they were supposed to work until a couple years after getting my first period 😬
I don’t understand how that would even work. The actual cotton is covered by the applicator so then there’s nothing to absorb the blood. I’m glad you figured it out but wow I have so many questions!
This is why I explained it to my kid using a bottle of water and a tampon.  I showed her directly how its works.
Did you never see the separated applicator and tampon in places like public restrooms?
Have no shame in this, please?!?!  My mother didn't teach me anything about anything.  She just tossed pads on the bed and said to hide them.  
I tried using a tampon as a teenager when a friend and I went swimming.  I obviously did something wrong, because I ended up a bloody mess.  My friend didn't make a huge deal about it.  I cleaned myself up and she gave me clean dried clothes...but I still didn't know what I did wrong!!  

I was in my 40s when I tried again...it took practice to figure it out, but I finally got it right.  Now it doesn't matter as I'm done with all of that.  

But my daughter..I coached her through the process.  Because I'm her MOM and then there was no question she'd be comfortable with using pads or tampons.  

Do not be embarrassed or shame for not understanding or knowing.
When I felt my cervix for the first time at the age of 12 I thought it was cancer. I ignored it for a year before I got so scared I was going to die from it I bawled to my mom. 

Definitely not a connect the dots kind of kid.
Jesus that was wild .. I'm a dude and even I know that
I mean, I've never used them because I'm a guy but I did know this.
It's okay! I did that with the cardboard applicators for a bit when I was a teen until I had to buy my own (period cramps leave you plenty of time to read random stuff while you're sitting, and I was bored enough to read the instructions finally lol). 

I also had a friend whose mom never taught her to wipe front to back... She was like 23 at the time and dealing with cysts (no idea if there's a correlation). I'd say there's multiple avenues of blame here. Yes, she's old enough to use Google, but... where was mom? School? idk, sometimes people just don't know shit (pun intended)
They come with an instruction sheet, don’t they? 

I was totally unfamiliar with tampons the first time I got them, nobody ever taught me so I just…looked at the instruction sheet. Why not take a glance?
Did... they... work?  


Also, I just use a moon cup, it's way more comfortable and doesn't feel like I'm pulling out sand paper. F tampons.
And this kids why my book learning ain't everything.
Deodorant says to push up bottom 😵‍💫
OP, don't feel bad.  I did this too! Thankfully I figured it out after 4 or 5 years but I also made this mistake. And I did read the instructions.   And I always wondered why everyone seemed to like tampons but they never worked for me. And why they always hurt.  Solidarity.
>I have always thought that tampons were super uncomfortable

FWIW, in my  personal opinion they still are. I hate them even though I know how to put them in.
I wasn't ever taught by a parent, sibling or school how to use tampons but jeez, I read the frickin leaflet that came in the pack!!!
Glad to know not only men throw away the instructions hahaha
If anything it shows that school need to spend time on teaching how to use feminine hygiene products properly during health or sexual education.   As a man, I never knew how tampons were used other than to just stop bleeding.  It wasn't until I saw a first aid training video at my first job that I learned that the plastic housing is to just keep the absorbant cotton clean and the cotton is pushed out of the housing. (oddly enough, the video was teaching how to stop bleeding if you or someone else gets shot/stabbed and why you should always keep 1 or 2 in a first aid box.  I learned from an EMT friend who was also an army medic that they'd carry tampons on the field for just that reason, if a soldier got shot they'd put a tampon in the bullethole to stop the bleeding.
If you switch to a diva cup, remember you need to take it out of the box first 
I never use tampons because when I first tried them they were sooooo uncomfortable. 

One time I decided I would use one because I was going to a party later that day and didn't want a massive pad on. When I came home from the party I was horrified to discover I couldn't get it out!! I tried so hard to pull it out but it felt like it was snagging on my hymen! It felt like there was a taught, incredibly sturdy rubber band down the middle of the opening to my vagina. I somehow eventually got it out but that was the day I discovered I had a sepate hymen! (I later down the line had surgery to remove the extra band of flesh but I was so traumatised by the experience that I still only use pads or period pants) 

I never learnt anything about the different variants of hymens in school. Same goes for the different colours of period blood! The first time I had my period I honestly thought I'd shit myself because the blood was dark brown 🤣😭
Not once in high school did you mention to a friend how uncomfortable they were (to which she would have said you're not supposed to feel them)?  Never bothered to look at the instructions to see if something was wrong? Hated the applicator, but never thought to try the applicator-free brands?  The very name "applicator" didn't tip you off?  As a biochemist, did you not once ask yourself what possible benefit the plastic was serving lodged there for hours in that manner?   If none of these things ever happened, it's pretty remarkable.
It’s been through these comments that I just learned you are not supposed to flush used tampons. I’m 31 years old. 

I always thought flushing used tampons but not the applicator, plastic or pads was fine. I feel so stupid.
I did this from 13-16 and only found out after telling my sister she bought cheap tampons because the cotton part kept falling out of the plastic part so easily, and she looked at me like I was crazy. I was also a swimmer in school so I was using them constantly! I feel your pain so much and I promise you’re not the only person who’s done this, we can laugh about it together now!
I did this too! Only with cardboard applicators—couldn’t figure out why it was always leaking and literally discovered my mistake when I accidentally pushed the plunger and the cotton popped out of the applicator. I blame my frowns-on-tampons-for-virgins-for-no-good-reason mom who was otherwise decent in the biology/sex ed department.
This too happened to me. I was raised by a Dad who was a no show with all that and I had to steal tampons and pads (I used TP most of the time) I had no idea how to use them until I was older. It happens
I did the same thing for probably a year but it was the cardboard applicators. And I am always amazed that it worked at all. But that was like 25 years ago and I still cringe about it. Taught my daughter how to use them and she hasn’t gotten her period yet.
I remember when I first started my period and my mom wouldn't even buy me tampons, let alone show me how to properly insert them. I had to figure it out on my own, and I clearly remember being around 13 and asking my best friend's mom to better explain how to insert them correctly so they're not uncomfortable. This is not a failure on your part, this is a failure on your caregivers part when you first started your period.

I recently just discovered you don't even need the applicator to insert the tampon. I bought applicator-less tampons for HALF the price and they work great!! 

There is nothing for you to feel ashamed about! Women's bodies are very complex.
How would they even work if they can’t expand? How do they prevent leaks or even absorb anything?
My mother was a dancer at a gentleman's club (she was a stripper!) for 12 years and she worked with a girl who had never used tampons because she didn't understand how they worked or how to put them in and they scared her. My mom told her how and explained everything to her. Don't let people shame you OP some people never have the opportunity to learn for so many reasons!
The very first time I used a tampon, I did this exact thing. I was out shopping with my sister, and she didn't have any pads. She explained to me how to insert the tampon, and I went to the bathroom. She never told me you had to pull the cardboard out. So I did what she told me and waddled back out painfully. She asked why I was walking like that, and I told her it was uncomfortable with the cardboard up there, and then she laughed at me and immediately told me I needed to take that bit out. 

But to everyone commenting about instructions and such, not all of us have them handy the first time. Not all of us are at home with the box right there for us to see. Stop being rude, when you may not have the full story. And stop making OP feel ashamed for not knowing how to properly use a tampon. That should not be a defining factor of how intelligent or unintelligent a person is.
I blame it on cell phones. There was a time when the tampon instructions were the only things to read in the bathroom.
Hold up. Imma check my box. No instructions or diagrams or inserts. They used to have them.
Honestly, I imagine you’d be super comfortable with cups now. Although you should probably read the instructions throughly first.
I guess that’s why on boxes they give detailed instructions step by step on how to use them. You must have used a ton more than you needed to! How did that feel comfortable in life, especially swimming? 

Ever wonder about the tampons without applicators? 

I guess if you didn’t know, you didn’t know?!
While we're at it: do NOT flush tampons!! A very educated woman I know, 40 yrs old, found out the hard way when her entire system backed up into her basement. There were dozens of mice (the term plumbers use for flushed tampons) floating all over the basement so it was quite obvious what the problem was.

She had never been told her entire life not to flush them. Cost over $10k to repair.
i just found out the same thing from a tik tok i saw the other day. i’m also almost 23 and have had my period since i was 13. are we the same person lol? tampons are gonna be uncomfortable for me regardless because i have chronic pelvic pain from probable endometriosis. it hurts to put anything up there. but i can’t believe no one ever told me you take the applicator off the tampon. my mom was so shocked when i shared this with her lol
In middle school this is exactly how I wore them. My mother handed me a box and didn't explain a thing. These two older girls in my class were the ones to teach me and they were horrified when I said how much they hurt and they found out why. We really have to do better for our next generations and teach them everything we can because so many of us were failed by the generation before us.
Someone doesn’t like to read the instructions
Reading instructions or looking at the picture-?
You know the boxes come with instructions for use, right??? There’s no way this is real. Am I really supposed to believe that it took you 10 years to figure it out??? You didn’t have any women in your life that you could go to?? The first thing my mother did when I first got my period was go over the instructions on how to use tampons properly.
How did you push it in without the white part coming out? I'm just trying to imagine how this is possible lol
Hi, man here with a question.  Don’t they include instructions like they do on boxes of condoms and the like?
Wait…I don’t understand. Don’t you need to push up on the applicator? What about the stick part at the bottom? How could you get dressed! (maybe there is another type I don’t know of but all I’ve used have been like that or the applicator-less ones…)
It could’ve been worse - you could’ve been sticking them up your ass this whole time
I knew every ingredient in every bottle of air freshener made back then
SODIUM LAURATE
YES, I read everything!  In the car with the family, we would read Every sign and sometimes every license plate, hungry for content I guess, crazy.
Yep! And because at least in Europe there are usually multiple languages on it, you could learn what “hair” or “dry” means in Finish, French, Dutch etc. 😂
This made me laugh out loud, yes, read whatever you could find. 😄
I only learned kind of recently that TSS isn't just like a random freak accident. It's caused by shoving certain bacteria from the outer skin/genitals up into the vagina with the tampon. So one should always be washing their hands before putting in a new tampon and of course keeping the labia clean.
You just threw me back into my childhood xD
Same
The Dr. Bronner's soap bottle was the best one to read.
I love that scene in Kingpin: "New and improved? I read that one already!"
Holy shit. I totally forgot it was like that. My mom is a gynecologist and the things I learned from medical magazines were fascinating. That and the ingredients for shampoo.
Holy shit yes I forgot about this
Dude I remember reading a box as a kid and being terrified by that, Toxic Shock Syndrome.. also learned how to insert a tampon.
I guess I was a weird kid, I always brought my book in with me ..
I think OP cured toxic shock syndrome
Sounds like keeping them in would be accidental kegels. Those muscles must be beast by now.
Idk- I always was scared they would slip out, which is one of the reasons I avoided them whenever possible lol
I know!! That was my first thought
I remember when I started my period lol the first thing I did was read the instructions on the pads and tampons
This is why all things have warning labels.
Australian here, we are not overly reliant on applicator tampons. For real, we just unwrap and push the buggers up there.
I'm a guy, but have bought tampons for my SO for almost 15 years. I've read the instructions multiple times. There's literally illustrations clearly showing removal of the applicator...
Right? Also, did she push the plunger in? Because that would just be hanging out of her, flopping around if she did. And if she didn't, surely her underwear would have shoved it in? Nothing about this makes any sense at all.
Knowing what I do now I am also surprised by how well they worked- but the top part isn’t covered by the applicator so that helped I think. It did in fact always feel slippery. Honestly, I just sort of figured that the whole tampon experience was supposed to be hellish and avoided them whenever I could lol
Boss: "Is that what you're going to pitch at next week's future plans meeting?"

Steve: "Ummm.... Yes..s hOww did you knOww"

Boss: "Yeah, Carry proposed that around 5 years ago so we put a little design together and put it into product testing. It turns out that there's not a large market for Bluetooth tampons"

Steve: "uh- What was Bluetooth about it?"

Boss: "it was an absorption alert when it reached 90%. People loved it in the free trial but when we asked how much they thought it was worth, we got an average response of about half of what it would cost to mass manufacture"

Steve: "well since that ship has sailed I'll go with something else"

And Steve lived happily ever after....until his boss looked up today's prices for microchips. Now he's the lead engineer for Bluetooth tampons.
Like a hot dog! Did she not have a ton of leakage?!
When I was a kid I assumed that's how it was supposed to go and was quite shocked when I found out they go.. Inside..
Oh no that’s horrible. Thank you for sharing a tampon blunder I really appreciate knowing I’m not the only one
*Horizontally 🥲
What!! Didn’t it roll out??
I might have to try that someone. Hot dog style lol
It worries me how little women know about their bodies
Please tell your partner she isn’t the only one, riding bikes was an interesting experience before I figured out how stupid I was
My mom always just had loose tampons so that’s what I used 🤷🏻‍♀️
Presumably OP was 13ish when she first used one. 13 year olds are not famous for their logic or comprehension abilities.


I first tried a tampon when I was about 20. I found the instructions quite confusing and am pretty sure I also didn't realise you dispose of the applicator at first. I kept having to read the instructions multiple timed (over a few days), before I finally got it. 


I can imagine OP read the instructions once the first time, then subsequently either misunderstood or misremembered the instructions correctly. 
😳
Same! When I first had to buy tampons on a travel I was so confused. Like... what is this plastic contraption??
The description was in a language I could not read but fidgeting around with it kinda explained the thing. This was so extra. And an insane amount of extra plastic waste. 
Definetly one of the reasons I took my cup on every vacation afterwards.
Yeah I hate applicators, so messy!
Nah, then OP would have just inserted them still in the shrink-wrap
Just to add on, the angle you need to insert it might vary depending on the configuration of your uterus and cervix, so if it's not working, try a different angle until you find one that works for you
I swear by my cup. They are so much better than tampons, especially for someone who bleeds heavily.
Cups didn't work for me, but discs did! They sit in a different place deeper in the vagina behind the pubic bone rather than sitting in the canal. Way fewer leaks and so much more comfortable (though insertion/removal can be a bit rougher). Different brands have different sizes of cups and discs; Lumma has a wide selection of different sizes and always is running a BOGO sale. More info about their sizing here: https://mylumma.com/pages/how-to-use  




My newest period upgrade has been switching entirely to underwear from Period. and it's been game changing. I have a very heavy flow and their sleep shorts make it so I can sleep through the night on my period for the first time ever. I don't even use my disc anymore unless it's a situation where I'm in water, though Period. has a swim bottom too! 
**DO NOT** leave the period cup in for two weeks. It will smell absolutely awful.
A Reddit post 🤦‍♀️
None of the adults in my life taught me how to use tampons, instead I used a tampon for the first time in highschool after one of my best friends taught me. It was uncomfortable but my mom didn’t even buy tampons for herself. She only bought pads for the house. The same friend was also the one that had to teach me to shave properly because my mother thought I should just know how to do these things. There were a lot of other things my parents never taught or explained to me or any of my other siblings. Overall they weren’t bad parents. We were well taken care of and money wasn’t an issue. They just never thought about the fact we needed to be taught these things when we matured. 

I’ll be teaching my daughter all the things. I never want her to feel the embarrassment I had to growing up.
Me too! I was on high school and I came home and told my mom how bad it hurt. We went in the bathroom together, I pulled it out and she laughed and said "did you put the box and the instructions up there too".
Thank you for your comment I really am glad to hear that I am not the only person who messed this up
Yep. Same…but it’s not something we’d talk about.
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE. Solidarity folks, solidarity.
Adding a late comment to show support. My first attempt at a tampon with an applicator resulted in a similar experience. I had no idea! My mom used OB tampons without the applicator, and I never wanted to try those. I was a sophomore in college before I tried one with an applicator since I was at a friend’s house and unprepared. After she gave it to me, I came out of the bathroom and said that it was super uncomfortable and how did people stand the hard plastic. She looked at me like I was insane and told me how to use the damn thing. You’re not alone, OP! 

Let this be a lesson, though. Never suffer in silence, and if something hurts, tell someone. As women we’re often treated as if our pain is insignificant and our bodies are shameful. Screw that noise! We are all amazing and deserve to feel good.
Some are cardboard

Edit: well maybe paper is the correct word
Also explain the directions to your daughters who may be overwhelmed w the entire experience and fail to read the manual
I agree, it can't be real.  They mention swimming... there would have absolutely been leakage if they were swimming.
Yes! That’s the one, shoutout to her for inducing this little realization of mine
Cork
Oh now that's clever!
Definitely adding this strategy to my toolbox for the future!
Same here with the cardboard applicators - like OP, my mom would dump big boxes of tampons in a certain drawer in the single shared bathroom and toss the box/instructions. I had to use one at 13 when my little sister had a pool party. I did actually ask my mom how to use it and she said “just shove it in there!”  No mention of tossing the applicator at all. 

For years I quietly avoided any activity that meant using a tampon until my mom and I got in a yelling match because I was refusing to go on a family float trip that I was previously excited about until my period came early. She thought I was being over dramatic. Three days of excruciating tampons, I’d rather have died! I finally screamed that I didn’t know how anyone could walk around with a whole cardboard tube up there and that tampons were like some kind of medieval torture device obviously invented by men to punish women. Felt pretty stupid when she looked at me like an idiot and said “well you don’t leave the cardboard part in!”

Catholic mothers. I swear. 

I made sure none of my little sisters made the same mistake.
If it feels like sandpaper, you've either not left it in long enough or you've got the wrong 'size' (absorbency).. they should easily slide out when used correctly. Have a Mirena iud now so haven't used a tampon in many years but never had any issues with putting in or taking out.. you use lighter absorbency ones toward the end of your period and heavier at the beginning when your flow is heavier
No, instead it feels like I’m pulling out my insides.
Me too.  I figured it was because my uterus is tipped.
Wouldn't be surprised if complaints were met with a *You get used to it* without broaching the topic of OP's methodology, assuming OP didn't have the classic teenage girl body shame to keep her from mentioning bodily functions ever.
Don't feel stupid. flushing tampons was pretty standard when we were young because menstruation was seen as shameful and something to hide (and therefore flush... imagine leaving traces of your 'uncleanliness' behind in a bin... The shame..!).  We'd have codewords to indicate we're menstruating, and it was all hush-hush whisper-whisper. To this day I still take doggy poopbags with me and use those to put my tampons in so I don't leave a trace at someone else's place...

It's actually wildly shit how menstruation was and in large part still is regarded - just reading through those comments and seeing how many women have no idea about their bodies or how to take care of their menstruation properly is shocking. Female sexuality is just.. not spoken of, at all. The mere fact applicators are a thing because women are too ashamed to touch their own vagina in and of itself is telling of this.
i just got out of bed to take this picture. this whole post has me shook 😂

My mom just gave me a tampon and practically ran out of the room 🤷🏻‍♀️ I love her but me getting my period wasn’t her best parenting moment; I believe she gave me a book and said that it would explain. Spoiler alert: it did not. I always just thought it was supposed to be uncomfortable because my friends all talked about how uncomfortable it was :(
Beware the  **methylisothiazolinone (MI) and methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI),** you can develop an allergy to those that can get severe pretty quickly and it's in a ton of personal hygiene products.  The more you use them, the more likely you are to have an allergic reaction.

Me finding this out right now 🤔
In the days before TSS became a thing, I would use two Super Tampax at the same time on heavy days. IIRC, the box had instructions on how to do this. 

You would use the applicator for the second one to sort of push the first one to the side, they ended up sort of staggered. I know you arent supposed to do that anymore, but it gave me lots of security on heavy days.

R.I.P. OP's dms.
At least you didn't use ob. They come wrapped in plastic but without an applicator
... what did you think was going on with all the other tampon users? Or did you think you were particularly slippery?


I get you, sis. I sort of did the same thing, back in the day of two piece cardboard applicators lol.
Thank you for sharing this. I'll be teaching sex ed in 3 weeks, so I'm going to cover this with my students. You never know what people don't know until they tell you.

OP, I'm glad you figured it out.
seriously, how did they absorb anything while surrounded by plastic??
How did it not slide back out!?
Your mind is going to be blown when you ask your dentist how to brush your teeth.
I'm impressed OP - I'll read anything when on the toilet and that has definitely included the side of a tampon box in the past. I can only assume that to you as a woman this information was barely worth paying attention to whereas as a man, it was a brief glimpse into the dark arts of womanhood.

If it makes you feel any better, it took me until I was about 19 to realise you explicitly needed to wash your arse in the shower. In My defense I mostly took baths until that point but even so I looked back at the time like "yeah that is both obvious and disgusting it took me so long"
I read the instructions. Still put them in wrong exactly like you when I was in high school. It wasn’t until a college party that a girl took a new one out of her purse and launched it in the air like a rocket (pushing the applicator super hard) that I realized the applicator slips into the other piece and the full cotton tampon comes out. Would still probably be using it wrong 20 years later…
Same (Norway) - I think I've come across a brand with applicators some time long ago but never once used them
I just don’t like using those when I’m out of the house. I don’t want to put my fingers inside me when I’m using public washrooms because I just don’t feel like my hands are clean enough.
Am boy with penis, read tampon instructions at like 9 or 10 while taking a shit.

I'm 4th hand embarrassed for OP.
Yep just pushed the whole thing in! Trust me I wish this weren’t real then I would have been able to sleep instead of sharing my mortification on reddit
>just sort of figured that the whole tampon experience was supposed to be hellish

This feels like pointed social commentary on our society, lol.
But what about the plunger? Do you put that inside too or pull it out? How did it fit!
>Honestly, I just sort of figured that the whole tampon experience was supposed to be hellish

Why would you think that? Of course not. It's so sad how women are conditioned from a young age to expect intimate discomfort and yet we do nothing to educate them or advanced medical and science to eliminate that stigma.
I assume the actual tampon was pushed out of the applicator far enough that it still absorbed?
You joke but I would literally pay for period products that can intelligently tell me when it needs to be swapped. Way too often I get paranoid bc it feels like I need a change but nope, that fucker's perfectly fine.
*LIKE A HOT DOG*
Forbidden hotdog 🌭
I just saw a TikTok a few days ago of a girl who used to do this! She learned it was incorrect when a friend in high school wanted to go swimming, and she said she couldn’t go because “tampons fall out when you’re swimming.” The friend was baffled and after talking it out, showed her the correct way to use it. Apparently they lived in an area with very poor health education.
When my brother was 8 or 9 he informed my mom that she was almost out of her fart stoppers. No one could figure out what he meant until he brought out a mostly empty tampon box.
they're bullet plugs! WW1 BABAY
You’re not at all! My mom just handed me a tampon when I was 13 (no instructions) and I did the EXACT same thing as you. Didn’t like it so never used them again.
I was literally about to comment that I saw an adult woman on tiktok who said she recently started using tampons and did it hot dog style for a year before she found out it was wrong. You’re not alone!
[deleted]
Competitive swimsuits are tight, and she wore pads for any other time
Honestly don't think its much different than tucking a pad? I learned in high school that just tucking the pad between the flaps & crack was like the most effective anti- leak method. Although sometimes though those hard school chairs+ tuck left your flaps numb....
[deleted]
That’s the Texas education system for you
and i guess you didn’t use them often enough to buy boxes on your own because they were uncomfortable? oof 😭

did you go through them really fast considering the applicator prevented more of the cotton from absorbing the period? i can’t imagine how expensive it would’ve been if you only used tampons all these years
Loosies, like what it’s called when you buy a single cigarette! 😂
Whelp, now I am buying a box of ones with applicators to show my kid because I mostly use the applicator less ones too.
The fact that the packaging on tampons have the tampon without the applicator wasn't a good enough sign for you? Lol
I was like 10 and I was only putting them half way in and they hurt, but I just figured that's was how it was supposed to be. One day I accidentally put the entire thing and a light bulb went off in my head and I finally figured out what the string was for, lol.
I don’t know, I mean started using them at 12 from my very first period on, never used pads, and I still got it right without reading the instructions or asking for help so this post is really wild to me 😂
An American once asked me if I had an extra tampon she could have. We were hiking and she was caught by surprise. I gave her a normal tampon without applicator and she was so confused. I had to explain in detail how to use it, while whispering so the rest of the group wouldn't hear 🙉
I can’t even use the applicator ones the way they are supposed to be used. When I have to use them I shove them out and then use my fingers as usual. It’s a bit fiddly since they don’t have the same structural cohesion as applicator-free tampons, but I trust my hands to know where things have to go, not a cardboard or plastic tube.
If you have a tilted/retroverted uterus, and find normal tampons or inserting them uncomfortable, try OB brand. They're shorter and applicator-less. You use you finger to insert, which isn't straight and rigid like an applicator. Less waste with no applicator, but you have to wash your hands before and after. I hated tampons before I found them and I've heard the same from other women.
I learned from a Reddit post tampons shouldn't be flushed, and I felt dumb as fuck given I was in my 30s and almost  exclusively used  tampons since my late teens/early 20s. I knew pads shouldn't be flushed but thought tampons were OK. I checked the box, and sure enough, it said not to flush. 

I always put tampons in a receptacle now. Try not to be too hard on yourself and hope you have a better experience now... that sounds quite uncomfortable!
Ah yes you mentioned that. But what part of the post made it click for you?
My parents were the same. Its almost seemed taboo to talk about such thibgs, even though we weren't religious or like modest people. It was just in those regards same as you.

For my own daughter, I gave her books about puberty that talk about everything and different ways people handle their bodies, like shaving being optional, how to do it and when not to (right before going into a pool or ocean, it opens the pores and leads to infection). 

For girls it was a newer book that has tons of options for periods and very detailed comic book type guides to using them. It tries to keep everything light and funny. That book is how I learned about menstral discs and decided to try them. Its also how I learned what wasnt normal in regards to periods and talked to my gyno. Turns out I had a cervix that was fused to my muscles causing me extreme pain. I just thought it was normal pain until that book opened my eyes.

Anyway. My daughter and I talk about those things, but the book gave her the right words and info and if she had further questions she knew how to ask them.

Before she started her period i made her a box of supplies and included all of the instructions and a funny book about starting and understanding your period. She was in bed avoiding the world for her first period, so reading that book gave her something to do and helped her feel confident again.
I was never taught anything or really given any rules. My neighbor friend next door taught me how to ride a bike, my sister took care of the period stuff (she heard me scream) and taught me how to shave my legs (after cut myself and screamed).
Laissez-faire parenting.
Same here, that goodness for my friend's older sister answering all our questions. She was a saint.
Haha!  Bad tampon users unite!   My whole family used pads.  When I was in high school I was told I had to use a tampon for gym class (swimming), and sort of left to figure it out.  I did the same thing and then avoided tampons like the plague.

I learned the truth many, many years later
I’d like to upvote your mom’s comment separately. I’m 💀
A friend of mine in high school did this exact same thing. She learned she was doing it wrong when it fell out during basketball practice.
I was looking for these comments. OP - I had a roommate that did the exact same thing, until my other roommate and I informed her otherwise. It happens. Im surprised to see some of these comments because, after working in healthcare for over a decade, I can attest that humans do dumb things a lot. A lot, a lot.
A friend of ours was in their mid 20s when we were on a vacation together and headed to the beach. She tried tampoms for the first time that day, and when she came out of the bathroom, she said she didn't think it would feel so awkward. Thankfully she was with us girls, so we helped her through. Just imagine if she had tried when she was alone, though...she might have gone years without realizing, too! So glad you figured it out...better late than never!
No I think cardboard is more viscerally accurate. Accidentally got a box of them once as a teen, ugh.
I cannot imagine THAT A-Ha moment 🤣
Yay IUD Club! Here's an added bonus you may get to enjoy later: Last time my replacement date came around my Dr suggested checking hormone levels because I am >50. Turns out I am fully menopausal. Peri? Never met her. Now there is a chance that may have been the case anyway but considering how terrible my periods were the working theory is that that steady low dose of hormones from the IUD let me sail through without even knowing it was happening.
Haha, yeaaahhh it took me a bit to figure out how to break the seal around my cervix. It's ... I guess nice they leave a little tail on it but I really have to pinch the cup to let it release.   
I will say, I have spent a good two hours trying to get it out, in the beginning.
I seem to either bleed straight through or I don't bleed enough and when I pull them out they're dry af and hurt
That’s the worst set of instructions I’ve ever seen on a commercial product. Huge lettering for steps 1A and 1B so you know how to arm the thing I guess, then little tiny diagrams and the words “Both tubes” in very low contrast text in between two steps. I know whatever megaconglomerate owns Tampax can afford a tech writer, so I assume this is an outright attack on women everywhere.
All this post is doing is making me certain that we ladies need to talk about the squidgy things more so this doesn't happen to other people haha.  
Also, IMO tampons are SUPER uncomfortable, so I have used them like twice ever.
What kind of personal hygiene products? Any examples of big brands?
Are you me? Because I memorized that too and occasionally would say it at random times to see how people would react.
I just went to check my soaps and stuff and most products seem to have it. Even cleaners have it
Toiletries and cereal boxes for me  😄
And sodium laureth sulfate. I thought of them as brother and sister, Lauryl and Laureth. (My sister's name is Laurel.)
I've read the information pamphlets that come with the tampons and it still didn't tell me that, so, I figured I'd put it out there in case it helped someone.
The Crevasse
Vagina dentata, what a wonderful phrase! 

Vagina dentata, ain't no passin' craze. 

It means no wieners, for the rest of your days...
I'll be in my bunk
Before I switched the the disc, ob was all I used. I could never get the tampon placed properly with any other brand with the applicators. I’m thinking OP never even saw an ob tampon or else she’d have to have realized something about her approach was suspect..
As a sleep deprived mother, I did not only once leave parts of the plastic wrap on the tampon.. it does not work well when half of the tampon is still wrapped 
Edit: spelling
Well it would have been BETTER if she used OB since she was just shoving it all up there anyway.
I hated those little bastards so much lol 😭 not nearly as bad as the cardboard applicators with the blunt edge tho
personally, those were my preferred ones. Those hard plastic applicators always hurt.
In OP's defense, I've had a ton of instances of going, "Wait, this ISN'T how everyone else experiences [random thing]?" 


In my case, I thought apples genuinely caused extreme gum, mouth, and throat discomfort to everyone and I was just a big old baby for not being able to push through it and like apples like everyone else.  At 26 years of age, in a college class, someone overheard me commiserating with someone else about the itch and yelled "DID YOU KNOW THAT MEANS YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY" Why no. No I didn't. in retrospect it explains a lot lmao 


So yeah, fully possible to assume that the normal tampon experience is very slippy and uncomfortable. My experience with them was really itchy and uncomfortable. OP never used the tampon instructions as bathroom reading material, I never thought to try organic tampons, both of us have a "oh shit" moment embarrassingly late in life that no, most people do not in fact have that experience with tampons  


Rip op


Edit: lots of new and fascinating allergies in the comments below, thanks all! I wish I could unsee some of them!!!
I'm wondering this!
That was my thought.
Capillary action?
Inpressive pelvic floor muscles
It’s been difficult to talk all these years with a rolled up toothpaste tube in my mouth.
Wait, you're not supposed to use tampons to brush your teeth?!
At 31 years old i had my first teeth clean and was taught by a dentist that im meant to be brushing my gums and lower teeth when brushing rather than the outer parts used to bite (if that makes sense?)

My parents never took me to the dentist as a kid and i didnt realise the importance of going. And obvs i wasnt taught how to properly brush 😓
Was I supposed to take the toothbrush out of the package or something?
I know this might seem off topic, but I remembered one of my great personal hygiene misunderstandings just now. 

When I heard to wipe front to back, I always assumed it had to be in one continuous motion, and I was honestly confused how people were acrobatic enough to reach the front from behind, going under their legs. I never asked for clarification because I was embarrassed about my short arms. I was in my 30s when I realized that people wipe their front and *then* their back afterwards
Wait…my first thought on seeing this post was about how I was in my 30s when I learned I have to brush the back of my teeth. For years, I guess I thought of teeth like hair - I’d run the brush through and somehow reach the back? Makes me worry about how many other things I think I “know”.
Toothbrush in anus right ?
Step 1: Hold toothbrush  
Step 2: Pretend you're giving a BJ  
Step 3: Spit and look at your face in the mirror with a little white stuff dribbling down your chin
Jokes aside, there IS actually such a thing as good brushing technique and thousands of people probably just smear on some paste and never scrub the right places (or the opposite, those who hurt their gums through over-enthusiasm), so that's not actually a bad point to bring attention to.
I mean, people have cell phones now, nobody is reading shampoo bottle or tampin boxes anymore
Same (The Netherlands)  
When i grew up (am 44) there was 1 brand with an applicator (tampax), but if it still exists... i havent seen it for a long while in the drugstore's (or supermarket)
Are you me? I feel like this is common knowledge for BOYS who've used a bathroom with a box of tampons
I also took shits before we all had pocket computers. I’ve read everything a standard bathroom has to offer.
Would you still be able to pull it out by the string? Or did you just end up pulling it out by the applicator?
Listen... you aren't the only one. One of the only things I remember from Gr 5 sex ed class was Ms. Clayton telling us that she didn't know that she had to remove the applicator from a tampon... and she thought they were so uncomfortable.


So 30+ years ago, Ms. Clayton saved a class of girls from making this mistake... and now OP, you have saved innumerable young humans from the same mistake by posting on Reddit.


Well done!
Were these the type of tampons where the applicator is already inside itself? The ones that you have to pull the inner part of the applicator out before you use it?

I am really struggling to understand how you never realised you were doing it wrong. I know you said your mum has them loose but surely you have at some point bought them yourself, or just seen the packaging in a shop or something. Did you never realise they weren’t absorbing properly? I have so many questions.

Edit. [Images for reference.](https://www.tumblr.com/anonanonanon123456/743759958259236864)
I once visited an obgyn repeatedly for what I thought must be some sort of recurring infection. On about my tenth visit she explained cervical mucus and discharge to me. I wanted to die. I was seventeen.
Girl I did this too for way too long. You're not alone 🤣 Switched to pads because it was sooo uncomfortable lmfao. Then I learned the RIGHT way when i finally looked at the instructions a few years later. 

Thanks for your help, mom 🤣 /s
I’m trying to imagine this. So did the cotton tampon part push out of the plastic applicator part, and the sliding “stick” part went up into the applicator basically collapsed into the top part of the applicator, in the vaginal canal below the cotton tampon? So it was like the tampon on top, then the plastic applicator below it all in your vagina? Or was the tampon still fully inside the applicator and the plunger not depressed so you had a rigid plastic stick all the way inside your vag?
I sincerely hope it wasn’t the latter, either way it sounds very uncomfortable! SO glad you saw the light! You’re probably saving some poor young girl from doing the same thing with this post.
Brilliant comment- why would someone expect a reasonable and painless experience based on how all of our other gynecological experiences went?
It must have been the kind with a retracted applicator that you're meant to pull out. It's not much bigger or longer than the tampon itself. I can picture it fitting easily but also sliding out.
Maybe she has a long canal? The ways our bodies can differ is WILD.
It is really sad but I could totally see why someone would think that. Periods can be painful so why *wouldn't* tampons be painful too? Plus all the weird narratives about beauty = pain.
You answered your own question. Conditioning. All kinds of women's health and reproductive stuff is shitty when it doesn't have to be. Tons of women never find out they have endometriosis or similar because they're just told it's supposed to be painful and they don't know that the pain someone else is talking about and the pain they're experiencing aren't nearly the same. Autoimmune disease is much more common in women, many autoimmune conditions clearly seem to be affected by estrogen and progesterone cycles, but nobody funds the studies to find out exactly why or how so there's no recourse. Etc.
[Some cardboard applicators aren't 'closed' at the tip.](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/cardboard-applicator-tampon-on-white-260nw-2736925.jpg) So I could see a light/slow enough flow being absorbed through the top.
What it would likely be is a two part system where one is the Bluetooth device that screws onto an absorption pod with a cheap humidity sensor on the bottom

This prevents the main electronics from being eroded or wasted and we could probably make each disposable part for about 3 times the price of regular tampons(bluetooth part would probably cost $5 to make). I'd say it would be useful for big events(nice clothes events) where you would have the option of discreetly checking without wasting time.

Although it would generate a lot of tech waste with how widely it would be used. And another problem is that it might erode and become a safety hazard(either cuts+tetanus, burns, or even shocks).

All in all it would be helpful if it weren't so dangerous. And, ignoring all of the safety hazards, it would be relatively simple for me to model up a prototype. We also could literally cut into a tampon and stick a moisture sensor in there, that's all it is.

lol I told my brother women out then up their butts so they don’t poop. It wasn’t ladylike. Uh, I think he believed me?
Me too! Me too! My mom gave me one with a cardboard applicator right around the same age as well-- no instructions. Not that I blame her. We were out swimming with our friends at the lake and I was so embarrassed about the whole thing that I basically treated the hand off like a drug deal and got outta there quick as I could. There wasn't any bathroom around, so I just had to fumble around in the back of the car. It didn't work (obviously), it hurt, it was a mess. I just put a pad in my swimsuit and wore shorts and refused to use tampons for years.
At least yours had an applicator! My mom only had OB with no applicators. Took me a few years to realize other tampons exist and are much easier. Wore pads through my pre-teens

Physician "Aaaalrighty let's have a little peaky peaky. Just relax. Just relax. You've done this before. You've seen 1000s of these! You can do this! Don't let them know this is your first time. Just play it cool. Just..."

Woman "Are you talking to me?"

Physician ".....My apologies, I didn't mean to speak out loud. Should you be facing me?"
Yeah I hated using them and would use them for a couple of hours to go swimming then immediately take them out
It's tough for some of us gals..... I couldn't figure out how to use one until after I get fingered buy a guy for the first time 

There was a girl on out volleyball team that needed a tampon but couldn't get it/ didn't know how and her bestie had to put it in for her! (Gross I know lol)
As an American who only used applicators and who used to specifically experience vaginal dryness around my period, I have no idea how I would have gotten a plain cotton tampon in without one. It would just get stuck at the entrance???
I learned not to flush tampons from a sign hanging in the bathroom of my favorite Chinese restaurant. Apparently they'd had issues with that.
when I started my period at like 14 my mom told me not to flush tampons, so I didn't.

fast forward a couple months when I'm visiting a friend for a couple days. I wrapped my used tampons in some toilet paper and put it in the bin.
then my friend's mother pulls me aside and asks me to please flush tampons; it's disgusting to have them in the bin. 

nah fuck that, I don't flush them.
God there was a TikTok about this a while back and the people in the comments were so adamant about flushing them. One girl said to me she’s flushed every tampon she’s ever worn in her entire life, would continue to do so, and she hoped that ruined my day lol. I told her it wouldn’t, but it would ruin hers when she eventually causes a backup and ends up ankle deep in raw sewage mixed with those same tampons. People are so weird.
Oh my god, me too! Except it was my middle school aged step daughter and her friend teaching me. Like, this is the evil that comes from not just talking openly about natural stuff like this.
Thank you for sharing your tampon blunder I really apréciate hearing that someone else also didn’t know everything about tampons lol
Someone mentioning how they once left the applicator on and how uncomfortable it was lol
I'm really interested in what books you gave your daughter to read! Could you share the titles, please?
I was wondering if this was part of the issue- a culture of shame around women’s bodies or being uncomfortable touching oneself and figuring it out. I wasn’t raised that way, my mom had our bodies, ourselves prominently displayed on the living room book shelf and you better believe I read that a lot. There wasn’t any shame around bodies in my house (the one thing my parents did right lol) and I felt very capable of reading instructions and using a tampon correctly. I was that friend that always had tampons, condoms and advice. That didn’t go over big in a conservative small town in the 90s, but I digress. 
My mom had hit menopause by the time I had my period and I was the only girl, so instead of telling me how to use one, she just handed me a tampon at the pool one day and said to use it. I cried in the stall but also left the plastic in 😭
i actually like the cardboard ones better, the plastic ones have like,,, teeth that scrape you if you accidentally get the wrong angle in a rush
Honestly I just can’t get them to work for me, even when they have the uber seal of death they leak! Then I have to play tug of war and the whole experience is traumatic.
I find them very comfortable (forget it's there) and prefer them to pads which I find unpleasant due to the moisture. The only time they're uncomfortable is when removing one that is still mostly dry due to light flow. While uncomfortable, it's a brief second or 2 and not concretely painful. Preferences and experiences really do vary  woman to woman.
I agree! And I think that everyone around me complaining about them being uncomfortable is what stopped me from questioning my methods lol
Essentially all big/name brands: Dawn, Clorox, Seventh Generation, Suave, Dove, Aussie, the list goes on. Even Free & Clear liquid laundry soap has it, but the pods don’t so I’m stuck with the pods.

It was originally used as a mold inhibitor in paint thinner….then they discovered it worked in household products as well. The so-called natural brands are some of the worst offenders.

I have an MCI/MI Allergy and had to switch out 90% of my cleaners & personal hygiene products.

I’m limited to a few CeraVe products, All Free & Clear Pods, Suave Naturals shampoos & Kids 3 in 1 body wash, and Dr Bronner’s Baby/light blue unscented.

https://dermnetnz.org/topics/methylisothiazolinone-allergy
It's in so many things.  So far I haven't had to switch out household cleaners, just body moisturizers.  I avoid it in my shampoo and conditioners, face creams, etc.  I'm fortunate enough that I'm not so sensitive that residual from cleaning the house impacts me.  I have a hairdresser friend that developed a severe allergy to it, it's a massive headache for her to keep her workstation MI and MCI free, work with gloves all the time, on top of all the home stuff.  I just got a mild rash everywhere, but her hands would break out with open sores and get infected constantly before they figured out what was happening.
Huh. The more you know! I also had no idea. They always just say DO NOT LEAVE THEM IN TOO LONG!!!!!! Which, is obviously good advice, but they never tell you what actually causes TSS
Excuse me, I believe it's pronounced Crevasse
A literal lol at this. Holy shit.
Oh my god 😂
I chortled. Good job you. Enjoy this updoot 🤘🏾
Fucking underrated comment!!! I'm in tears ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
*... It's our penis freeee.... philosophy!...*
This is what I come to the Reddits for.
I may be the only one, but I hate applicators with a passion!! I buy exclusively ob. Maybe a European thing? I feel applicators are more common in the US?
A few years ago, I read a twitter thread where people were talking about learning that pineapple is not, in fact, supposed to make your lips itchy.

I was telling my husband and kid about it, and I said, "Imagine not knowing that pineapple isn't supposed to make your mouth all itchy. I mean, it's not a fruit like kiwi, that makes your mouth and lips go numb and tingly."

They stared at me and I said, "That's what kiwi does, right? RIGHT??"

And that's how I learned I was allergic to kiwi lol.
This comment reminds me of when I asked my friends if they also liked to eat cheese "until their face felt tingly" and found out that cheese does not, in fact, make most people's face go tingly.
For the longest time I could not for the life of me figure out how foods like kale and Brussels sprouts were so popular when they literally taste like soap. Then one day I stumbled across an article about Supertasters. Holy shit. They don’t taste like soap to most people!
Literally last night we told my coworker he's probably allergic to avocado. We were all talking about acidic foods, and how pineapples have that enzyme that can make your mouth sore, and he said: like avocado! They're so spicy and acidic and burn your mouth. We're all like: um, I think you're allergic bud
I had a similar experience to you, but with plums! 

Who knew that everyone else didn't just have their tongue swell up randomly sometimes, with taste buds all raw and weeping? Not me! I thought it just happened to everyone, sometimes, for no reason that anyone could fathom, just like people sometimes get headaches or sometimes get hiccups.

I didn't even manage to tie that experience to eating a specific food until one moment in my mid twenties when I was complaining about the tongue swelling, thinking others around me would commiserate, only for one to look at me strangely and say, "That's not normal. That doesn't happen to me."

Only then did I realise that I was eating a plum, just then, and could it be, maybe, that it specifically happened whenever I ate plums? And... ah. Allergy.
I have gastric distress almost every time I eat chicken.  I like chicken, and I never put the two together until I was in my forties.  I had made up a religion that had a dietary restriction on eating archosaurs (because I worship a ghost dinosaur) and I stopped eating chicken for a while.  I later changed that commandment and began watching chicken occasionally again.  One evening I was sick and my daughter told me Friendbird was punishing me for eating chicken earlier.  I thought it was funny, but I remembered next time I ate chicken, cramps and crazy poops.


Praise the Bird for revealing my allergy to me!
yeah but counterpoint: the tampons come with instructions on the back and inside the box, but apples didn't warn what an apple allergy would be like lol.
Same for me and I love apples :') Took years to realize "Wait. I am not a spoiled brat I am allergic."
Lol this is exactly how my husband found out he was allergic to apples. Also I didn't realize I needed glasses until so late. I thought it was normal that no one could see the board at school.
Same for me but bananas. I was probably 30 when I asked my husband if bananas made him cough and make his throat itch/burn. Worst part is that I am a nurse 🤦🏼‍♀️
Like a cork in a wine bottle
You're supposed to move the brush up and down and side to side and keep your head still, not the other way around lol
I’ve been flossing twice a day since my 20s and didn’t realize until I was in my late 40s that I was flossing incorrectly. I was getting annoyed by my dentist always complaining I wasn’t flossing so I watched a YouTube video on how to do it properly. I didn’t realize you needed to go on each side of the gum between each tooth. I was just jamming the floss straight down.
Not with the applicator
 No, pretty sure they’re for nosebleeds.
There’s a reason they both start with the same letter 
just wait until you hear from a periodontist, everything we do is apparently wrong. even the motion people use is wrong.
I'm in this picture, was 38 at the time.
34, and I just learned that you're supposed to get the floss UNDER your gums O.o
TRex had short arms too yet they managed to wipe themselves off the face of the earth.
Wait, what? What you mean people don't do it in one continuous movement? This is like the some people wipe standing up thing all over again....
What do you mean you can't reach??? What is happening with people agreeing? 😂


I wipe in a continuous motion from front to back. And then from taint to crack if there's a need...


Everyone I've seen wipe does it this way??
Well wiping front to back isint just about wiping puss before ass if thats what u r saying,    its also just about the direction like i cant be going back to front pushing shit towards my dick and balls. 
I was 30 when a dentist told me you're meant to focus the brush on the gum line, not just the teeth. I was also bad at brushing my wisdom teeth because they only partially erupted and kept healing over and re erupting over a decade, so they were hard to brush.
I mean I learned I was flossing wrong around that same age. I just thought clearing the space once was enough but you need to rock the floss in between the gap to loosen everything up. 

No wonder my gums bled for decades
Instructions unclear: toothbrush in ear
This checks out from the instructional TikToks I've seen
Haha true but on the odd occasion my phone is on charge or I just didn't bring it, that's when I reach around in desperation for the nearest reading material
You mean to tell me you don't have the obsessive paranoia that your phone is secretly recording and storing audio/visual of you taking a private shit and you take it in the bathroom with you???

Or the obsessive fear that the bathroom germs and airborne poop particles will infect and colonize your phone??

Just me??
In the US tampax is like the gold standard of tampons. Which I don't understand why cuz they're actually not that great. I prefer the non-applicator ones myself.
Shampoo and lotion have way more ingredients than people realize.
Usually I could use the string but sometimes it would get lost in the applicator
Answer us lol
I made this mistake as a teenager and taught my own teenage daughter and her friend… who admitted that she had hated tampons because she didn’t know it was just an applicator before our talk. It happens
What the hell did she tell you on the first nine visits?
🥺
Y'all don't even know... in healthcare we call the Pure Wick female catheter a blue hot dog 😂
I literally sat here and read the comment over and over trying to understand what they meant. When it clicked, I LOST it 😭
same, i thought he meant perpendicular to the twat
The only redeeming thing about having a little brother for me was convincing him of really far fetched stuff. At one point I had mine completely convinced that our parents were in the witness protection program and our grandparents weren’t really our grandparents, they were assigned to us because they were in the program, too. Told him I’d found paperwork but we couldn’t talk about it or we’d all be kidnapped.
OBs are the best tampons, and I will die on that hill, but they are super awkward for young girls to learn with for sure.
I love this whole comment section
Would both pieces of plastic be inside you or was the bottom half out still? I'm trying to imagine this while wearing a bathing suit!
How did you get them out without unwrapping them? Then the thread is not accessible…
Oh I don’t think it’s gross at all. It’s just a vagina, everyone had one in that scenario. If someone needs vagina help, you give it! 

I remember my childhood best friend’s little sister had a hard time with tampons too and both my friend and their mom had to try to help her, and she still ended up just wearing a pad and shorts into the pool. I think there would be a lot less vagina trouble out there if we normalized and encouraged getting familiar with your own body at a younger age, the start of puberty at least. Like take a mirror and say hi, give your girl a handshake and get acquainted!
[deleted]
So I thought I also had dryness around my period until I started using pads exclusively. The tampon is likely causing the dryness! It doesn’t discriminate on the fluid absorbed and it takes it ALL.
It does. Had to use the kind without applicators while study abroad in the Netherlands. They’re not easy to insert and are way messier. Sticking your whole finger up there makes it waaaaaay gorier than it has to be
Tampons are very common residential sewer line clogs, too.  ...so  unless you want to spend a day with a greasy rented sewer machine feeding  cable down  the vent, and back out again, please don't flush Tampons.
My dad in his younger days managed a block of apartments and had horror stories about tampon clogs. Hellish. I’ve never flushed a tampon.
I was in my early 20’s and it was from the plumber that came and fished out an embarrassingly high number of tampons from the toilet line.
Lol, your trash is dirty! Oh no!
Lol I would have been like "Okay will do, but don't complain when your sewer line needs unclogged." 🤣

My mom was a line opener for years. I've heard soooo many horror stories about flushed tampons and even flushed PADS.
*Not me brimming with teenage adolescent shame literally ripping apart pads to flush at a friend's house instead of having to face the shame of leaving waste in the waste receptacle*




[This SNL sketch](https://youtu.be/tzQLYKSVwRI?si=S1afVLrWov3RxlU6) hit waaay... Too... HARD...
Gross. How can anyone be so deliberately obtuse and awful?
I've got one, but it was more of a random mishap than a misunderstanding. Once I accidentally shaved off my tampon string in the shower, so the part with the knots that you grip to pull it out was gone. What was left of the string was short, slippery, and mostly inside me. I ended up having to employ needle nosed pliers to get it out. 🤣

I have also once pulled one out not quite delicately enough on a heavy flow day and ended up flinging blood all over the bathroom. O.o I had guests over. And I spent more time than is reasonable in the bathroom because I was cleaning.
think of it as youve tampons on hard mode for a while now,everything gonna be smooth sailing from here on out
Yea I can imagine. I feel like it must have also been pretty ineffective since it would block the absorption. But hey, stuff like this happens. Sometimes our brains just don't connect the dots until all of sudden it clicks into place.
My grandma was pretty much the same, just handed it to me and I hated it. I really didn’t want to go swimming, I had JUST started my period. 

It was one day sitting and randomly reading the box I figured it out.
its the opposite for me. one wrong step and the cardboard ones feel like knives T_T
Oof yes the scrape is awful! Doesn't happen often but when it does, ouch!
Honestly, the two hours I spent trying to reach the damn thing was pretty traumatic for me. I had to do research to get it out. I honestly thought I was going to have to go to the ER.
I see the uncomfortable comment a lot and this is most likely because you are not pushing it up far enough (and at the proper angle), so you are feeling your vaginal muscles tightening around it trying to hold it in. When inserted properly, you shouldn't feel it at all! 


The tip of it should go all the way back to your cervix (think how far your doctor goes in to get cervical cells for a pap smear). It will seem like it's too far at first, but just go slowly, don't force it, and you'll almost feel it slide right into place once you got the angle right. 


You can put one foot on the toilet to loosen the muscles and make it easier at first. Push the top part of the applicator in all the way up to the plunger part and then push the plunger in and the tampon will sit just at your cervix.... then remove the applicator...almost forgot that part ;) 


Your post probably helped some folks so good on you for sharing what you learned.

Isn't that what I said?! 🤔
Accents on point, just throw in a British expedition and we've got a BBC documentary in the making. Here's looking at you, Frozen Planet.
Sorry but it is only called Crevasse if it's from the mountain region Crevasse in France, otherwise it's just a sparkly crack.
And to think, I've been pronouncing it Crevasse my whole life!
I do love a good updoot!
Vagina-Denataaaaa~
Seriously, I LOVE YOU GUYS! I was laughing so hard, I almost couldn’t couldn’t sing along! 😆😂🤣 thank you
Which also makes it a problem-free philosophy, if you think about it.
The comments are where the real fun is. Fact!
Can’t speak to either, I’m in Canada, but they’re certainly more common here. Ob is the only brand I know of that doesn’t have an applicator. I agree though, not a fan of applicator lol but I’m loving the disc way more than either pads or tampons.
The non-applicator tampons, like OB, are so exceptionally painful for me to shove up in there. Perhaps I have also been doing something wrong on that front but it's so dry and I need to get the tampon far enough inside me that it feels like forcing a roll of sandpaper into my already painful bits.
Right? I'm European too and I've never bought tampons with an applicator, like i wouldnt know how to find them, i dont thinkive seen them. It feels like a ton of useless plastic waste anyway... probably a Europan thing 🤷‍♀️
I'm in the US and I exclusively use OB... I think it is just a personal preference thing.
Some of them have CARDBOARD applicators! Cardboard! And you're supposed to shove it up there! If I ever had to use a tampon with an applicator I just took it out and used it like any of the ob ones.
I'm in Germany and I've never seen tampons with applicators here except maybe for 'my first tampon' starter kits. When I buy tampons abroad I rip the applicators off because I don't know what to do with them.
SAME! Exclusively ob. I like how short they are and so much less trash. I didn't know what an applcator was until I was like 25.
Lmao. 

Pineapple can make your mouth tingle!  It’s super acidic! 

Right?
That's me with walnuts unless I toast them. Spent years thinking it was the tannins making my mouth hurt when no, they just trigger my tree pollen allergy. Since I've cut them out of my diet, I've discovered by accidental ingestion that they were the source of digestive issues I'd had since I was a kid that doctors never found a reason for.
When that song came out that goes “I can’t feel my face when I’m with you” I told people that were talking about it (who were saying it sounded like drugs) that to me it sounded more like an allergy, because if things get numb and tingly it’s an allergy. Someone came up to me privately and proceeded to describe an allergy, but to semen. She thought everyone experienced that. It sounded horrific. I had worked in nursing before I was injured away from bedside so she felt comfortable and I was happy to help but I was definitely out of my comfort zone. Poor girl. I guess it’s fairly common or not that unusual based on what we found online and she made an ONGYN appointment, but I have thought about that for years.
Cilantro tastes like soap to me. Little shaved pieces of soap in the food, lol. I guess to other people, it has an herbal taste. Who knew?
Hey buddy, how do you feel about coriander (cilantro)?
Very fair and there's such a dearth of sex ed material that it's hard to miss... still, I think I only know about tss because I read the tampon pamphlet as toilet reading material in the days before smartphones, and would have never learned about it otherwise, despite it also being on the instructional pamphlet that I otherwise never looked at 🥲
Ahaha I'm so sorry, but the fact that your internalization was exactly the same as mine is cracking me up. When I told my therapist, he was like... "ok, well, that's probably the most succinct way to explain most of the stuff we talk about in here actually" and he WASN'T WRONG


btw I'm 100% not giving medical advice but my allergist told me some varieties of apple and some orchards may provoke less or no reaction. i found an orchard that barely caused itch right before i had to stop altogether. love, another lover of the forbidden fruit 🥲
Bananas make my mouth itch. I thought that was normal for the longest time.
Oh my gosh I'm so sorry!! 


Honestly, I think I bring up the apple allergy so often on reddit because people will come out of the woodwork with their obscure food allergies. I had no idea bananas were on that list! Are there any other foods that you're allergic to or did your body just decide to say nope to that one particular fruit?
Ha I do both. Can’t help it.
Instructions unclear, shoved a toothbrush up my nose
I straight up asked my dentist what toothbrush they recommended and they said electric hands down. Even a crappy electric one will work since plaque is so sticky, the vibrations and movement really help break it up.
Yeah after i was taught all this i googled about flossing (had never flossed in my life) and found the same thing out! Now im a regular flosser. When my mental health is ok at least. Sometimes i go a few days-a week without flossing but i remind myself that its better than nothing, as i was doing before.
Yo this shit is hilarious. 😂😂😂 Thanks for that laugh.
This could be the funniest thing I’ve ever heard 🤣🤣🤣 but likely no other scenario in which I could steal/use it 🥲
How many people have you seen wipe ???
how many people do you see wipe?  that's a weird fetish that i'm sure exists...
I’m talking both in one motion. That’s how I understood “front to back”. From mons pubis to top of your butt. 

But in reality, I think it’s probably first front, then back. I can only reach my taint when coming from behind. So, how the fuck is half the population performing acrobatics in the public toilet stalls? Without straining their backs or getting messy? The answer, to me, is that they divide and conquer. First the front, then the back
Of course you can, "front to back" only applies to people with vaginas. Shit won't hurt your balls, it's just more difficult to clean. And I say that as a guess because, despite wiping back to front, I don't ever get shit on my balls because I'm not an idiot.
Before cell phones my family would keep a handheld Yahtzee game in the bathroom
I just want to say that I really appreciate you sharing the story, even though I know it's probably pretty embarrassing. It has given me the launching point that I needed to start a conversation with my 12-year-old about how tampons work. 

It would be a strange thing to bring up with her for no reason (she hasn't started her first period yet, though we've had supplies on hand for a while), and reading this gives me a reason to make today the day I show her how tampons work. So thank you!
She just kept giving me medicine for yeast infections. One day she's like so... itching, burning etc??? 


And I'm like no and I describe the discharge to her and she's like so, there's a thing called cervical mucus, you know that's normal right??? 


 And it was worse cause she was prob 24, if that. She was an NP. And it was just so embarrassing.




So she wasn't an ob, but was the only female medical professional in our town and was the closest thing to one I could access at the time.
😂🤣😆
You’re the second person I’ve come across in like an hour that had the perfect username for the perfect situation. The first was a video of a lion staring a guy down while he held a slab of meat and even after he threw the slab of meat into the enclosure the lion just kept staring like he wanted to eat the man. The top comment was from someone with the username notalion saying “ that human did look tasty.” Really i just want to say thank you and im glad for people like you being at the right place at the right time, it warms my heart.
You're hired!
Omg does it mean like the lips are the bun?!?! I thought they meant sideways inside
Wait, me too... what does it mean??

Edit: NEVERMIND, got it
I need answers for this fr
Maybe OP has only used the compact type? The kind where you have to extend the plastic before inserting but OP never did that step either.
I can’t help but imagine OP had a small bulge 😂
Some tampons have the end to push it in collapsed and you have to pull it out to be able to push the tampon itself, it may have been one of those types.
i’m desperately trying to figure this part out
I don't understand this comment?

I've used plenty of tampons that had a depressed plunger that needed to be pulled out then pushed back in to insert the tampon, and in all of those the string is still hanging out of the applicator whether or not the plunger is depressed. 

Unless you thought OP was using something like OB tampons that don't have an applicator but just a plastic wrapper and they were inserting them without unwrapping, but that's not what happened.
Yeah I’m not buying this tifu
Yea, but I had that issue even before using any tampons and when the flow wasn't very heavy. I remember at some point I would have to... sort of use somd blood to lubricant the applicator to go in. Kinda awkward to admit but fuck it this is Reddit.
Hah yeah, this is how I learned not to flush them.
The toilets at the restaurant I used to work at kept getting clogged. After calling the plumber multiple times they finally pulled out the most disgusting entagled trail of hundreds of decaying tampons from the depths of the pipes...
My health teacher told us a similar story. She and her roommate thought it was great how they could flush tampons, then their toilet got blocked and they came home to a note from the plumber or landlord telling them to stop.
right?? like, what.
Yep, it's honestly super obvious what can and can't be flushed if you understand how sewer and septic systems work; it's not obvious at all if you don't.

Whatever you flush basically has to completely disintegrate into fine mush in water all on its own for it to be safe to flush. Even those "flushable wipes" are pushing the limits of how durable the paper can be and still be flushable. Definitely don't flush a bunch of those at a time.
🤣😂 On those days you just HAVE to laugh about it!!
OMG noooo not the fling 😂😭. (I have actually also done this before, for the record. Horrifying at the time but hilarious looking back.)
lol im actually excited to try during my next period
Vase versus vass, I assume
I fucking love reddit sometimes lol
I’m also in the US and exclusively use OB as well! In my case they were always what my mom used so I just kinda grew up thinking that was what tampons were like and have always used them. I have used other stuff when OB wasn’t available but rarely.
And here I am in Europe and have never even seen one with an applicator. Sounds odd, are they like tampons on sticks?
I live in the US (Florida), and OB is also the only brand I’ve seen that has tampons without applicators. Everything else has them, cardboard or plastic.
Agree. I needed an applicator. They never went in properly without one.
If it’s dry and painful, you’re probably changing them too often or using the wrong size for your flow. Things should be pretty moist up there when swapping things.  I had issues similar because when they leaked, I changed them. Turns out I wasn’t getting the placement right so they were leaking past the tampon, before they needed to be changed.
Ob has two versions, regular and pro comfort, the regular ones feel pretty dry and cottony but the pro comfort ones have a silky layer on the outside that feels a lot better going in. The boxes look really similar, I bought regular by accident now I have to suffer through them. Putting a tiny bit of lube on it helps and doesn’t seem to mess up the absorption
I'm in the UK, we have applicators that are cardboard.
The ones with applicators are sitting right next to the ones without it. Also a european that has used aplicators since they became popular many many years ago.
Now more tampons have a cardboard applicator as well. So there is variability. I always found the OB ones tricky. But my period volume is pretty inconsistent so I don’t use tampons much. I have a lot of clots that slip out. Too risky.
I'm in Denmark, and they are more common with applicators than without here🤷‍♀️ So no, not a European thing. But many brands have switched over to cardboard applicators.
I’m gonna be honest, I prefer the cardboard. The plastic ones seem to always catch my skin/tissue where the opening for the tampon to come out is and that HURTS. The wax coating on the cardboard is enough that it slides much easier to me.
I used cardboard when I used tampons.
They are indeed very acidic and contain bromelain, which is an enzyme that breaks down proteins and is used as a meat tenderizer, so it's veeerrryyy lightly digesting you while you're digesting it.
Yeah that part is normal, can straight up make your tongue hurt if it's lots of super fresh pineapple. I can see this post confusing people about pineapple if they don't see these followup comments now. 

Some pain is just worth it though, and pineapple is worth your mouth being dissolved by acid.
This is why it took me so long to realize I'm allergic to pineapple! 

First of all, I really hate pineapple so I avoided it already. But then some friends were complaining about how they'd eat so much more pineapple if it didn't make their mouths hurt and I was like "yeah, that part sucks but I really hate how it makes it harder to breathe as well!" and their eyes just about popped out of their heads lol.
Aaah walnuts, cashews, and pecans do it to me for the same reason!! My allergist told me roasting the nuts won't make a difference, but my birch pollen OAS is so strong that it sent me into anaphylaxis with cherries, so that might be why you get walnuts. 


What do they taste like when they're not laced in pain and discomfort? Are they good?



Of all the things to be in the top 1% of, I really didn't want it to be "how badly my body overreacts to thinking random foods are tree pollen" 🙃
Oh wow. Well, uh, thanks to your uncomfortable experience, I've now added semen to the list of allergens I've only learned about because I told my apple story on reddit, so there's that at least...
That's a wild allergy. Would suck for someone wanting to become pregnant, but guess they could still do ivf.

Amazing allergy for someone with a pain and semen fetish. 🤷
I'm a 57 year old man. 

I know about TSS because it was the subject of a 20/20 segment that aired in the early 1980's when I was in high school. 

It seems that the makers of the Dalcon Shield (an early IUD) covered up internal memoranda suggesting that the company was aware of a link to TSS. 

Big class action lawsuit. Dalcon Shield pulled from the market. 

It's interesting to me that we all walk around having the same history but not the same *awareness* of that history.
I do both too lol! Glad I'm not alone
I can see how you got this wrong, next time use the tube, take the cap off, insert into nostril, squeeze till empty.

Pro Tip, Cinnamon or mint work best.

I've never had an issue doing both in one motion? Am I weird for this?? 😭
As a former 12yo give her some tampons to play with. Basically show her how to use them with a glass of water. I remember how fascinating it was to watch the tampon get bigger and absorb all the water in the glass. 

And don't expect she'll use them anytime soon. I don't think I started until I was 16 and wanted to go swimming with my friends. Before that, I only used pads because tampons were too scary.
Uh my mom taught me how to use tampons by demonstrating on herself so whatever you do, please don’t do that.
Also recommend that she read the instructions.

My mom partially explained it to me but they never worked so I just never used them. When I was like 16 I read the instructions and realised that the applicator is supposed to go IN a bit before you push the plunger.

You might not be able to anticipate what misunderstandings your kid would have about the process but the people who write those instructions make a living based on them being as clear and comprehensive as possible.
I am so glad you’re going to bring it up with her. My mom gave me a box, and told me there were instructions, while I was in a public restroom AT THE BEACH. I had a wretched mix of anxiety/period shit in the toilet, then there was so much blood, then I panicked and THREW THE APPLICATOR AND INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TOILET TOO. 

It’s been almost 20 years, and I am still ashamed and mortified and I just feel like a huge hunk of garbage for doing that to a bathroom.
I think talking about it beforehand would be best! Instead, I have the traumatic memory of my mom yelling at me in an LAX restroom stall, trying to teach me how to use one while I was already running late for a flight to New Zealand. It was extremely stressful and 20+ years later I still cringe at it.
That's on her for giving you medicine NINE TIMES without asking you questions or even examining you.
Yes 😭
I still don’t get it send help
i also need answers for how the tampon even worked - like how did it absorb anything? i just…
I WAS IN THE POOL!
I’m so glad the miserable experience of a period finally has a sliver of joy attached! I’d say worth it just for that.
This is some fuck up, poor you. They must have been so inefficient too 😣 Just so you really know…you shouldn’t be able to feel them at all when they’re in properly! If you can squeeze your pelvic floor and you can feel them then they’re not far enough up (they should be up the length of the applicator…you know the thing you use to put them up there…)
No, no, it's pronounced like the astronomer, Neil Crevasse Tyson.
Well I definitely went with the ass
same here! ppl were always horrified i used them. something abt “not wanting to shove their fingers up there” which. didnt make much sense to me because it doesnt require really any depth to put the damn thing in lol
I also exclusively used these before I switched to the cup. I just love how tiny they are! So easy to carry. You can store half a million in your purse, or tuck one in your bra if travelling light for an evening. But now I don't have to carry anything!
That’s the same reason I started with OB, but continued because I found them to be higher quality than the applicator type. Like the applicator ones can kind of… hide? shoddier quality, us not seeing the product outright.
I have always preferred OB bc they are more comfortable for me. When I started using tampons all the tampons would longer with use and this was uncomfortable to me. I have found them harder and harder to find.
The tampon is inside of a little plastic shell, and there’s a push pop like stick at the end so you position the applicator inside the vagina, push the stick up so it pushes the tampon out of the plastic shell and up into the vagina, and then you discard all the plastic. I think the idea is so that you don’t have to use your fingers to get the tampon up high enough? Idk, I can’t ever get those ones positioned properly.
Yep. I have to go in far and angle a certain way (tilted uterus) so fingering an OB tampon into my body has never been a viable option. I use a diva cup now which I love.
This. If your flow isn’t heavy enough to warrant tampon use, you should use a pad. For OB the pink ones are the smallest, if you want to give non-applicators another shot, start here!
This doesn’t answer the question. How do you get it inside without it feeling like sandpaper?
That used to be the norm here in US. I use cardboard applicators but they're increasingly hard to find in stores, so I stock up when I find them.
I always sing "the fruit that eats you back, Pineapple!" (To the tune of the goldfish jingle) whilst eating pineapple
One January I ended up with a ton of canker sores in my mouth, and I went to the dentist because I was really concerned. She asked me if I liked clementines and I told her I loved them. She asked how many I'd eaten recently and I told her I had no idea because I ate maybe 5-10 every day. That's how I learned that I can only have one per day now.
Ok.  I was worried for a second…
I once ate too much cut up fresh pineapple and my lips started bleeding 😅 I just really like fruit, ok?!?
My daughter promptly informed me that she did not have a vagina big enough for that “thing” when we went over tampons during our period talk.  She stomped out of the room because I couldn’t stop laughing after that.
I didn't use a tampon until I was nearly 22. They made me nervous, I didn't explore my body, and I honestly waited until after I had sex for the first time before trying them. 

Quickly discovered I liked OB the best, then went to a disc and then to a cup and cloth pads. But that first tampon was intimidating.
My daughters were 4+6 when my then 14 y/o stepdaughter moved in with us. I'm an IUD user so apparently they had questions when a box of tampons appeared on the counter. Imagine my horror when said SD told me that the girls asked about it and she'd shown them how to use them. Yes, that horror. Turns out she'd just demonstrated absorbency with a glass of water.
I was also fascinated by this! But then I took it a step further and threw it at my brother after it was full of water. FYI, it makes a cool splat sound and sticks to the wall if you throw it hard enough.
Lucky. I was 11. 😭
My three year old walked into the bathroom at *just*  the right time to ask, "But where'd it go, Momma?"
I got my period when I was 12 and all I \*knew\* was that your cycle was 28 days.

So I thought that meant you bled 28 days a month. I figured it wasn't a big deal that it didn't stop the other 2-3 days a month.

Anyways, about a year goes by and I end up with an emergency trip to the hospital and a 3-day stay while I got multiple blood transfusions. Doctor literally said they couldn't explain it but that medically speaking I should not have been alive with the amount of blood loss I had suffered.

Definitely make sure your kid understands how periods work lol
I cant believe I'm typing this BUT I will sacrifice myself for the greater good:

The tampon fits between the labia lady lips like a hot dog in a bun.
The hot dog bun is the labia
{[|]}
The person typed horizontal when they meant vertical...so most people didn't understand until the hot dog reference...if at this point you're still confused the tampon is the "hot dog" and the vaginal lips are the "bun" 🌭
I'd image, especially based on OP saying she only wore them to swim, it didn't absorb anything lol. If it did, it was only where the cotton was exposed at the top. Fuckin wild.
🍑✨
Oh I know. I never got that one either. Like, even if you do touch something…are we that squeamish about our own vaginas? It’s fine if that’s an issue for someone and I accept that and won’t try to change their mind but it’s definitely an issue I don’t understand. Then again, I occasionally masturbate with my own fingers inside me (tmi I guess but we are talking about periods and vags so…sorry? lol) so I’ve clearly got no issue going in. I also have to check my iud strings occasionally (maybe should’ve gone with that example 😂)

And also…are we not washing our hands? It comes right off lol
Right? And what’s the big deal anyway? It’s your own body! You let sexual partners put their fingers up there but you won’t put your own?
Same for me as well, and if I ever had to get a tampon from a friend who used applicator tampons I would always take the tampon out of the applicator and insert like I would with an OB.
Even that tiny pocket in jeans, I think it's a coin pocket maybe? Perfect for "bullets" which is what we called them in our teens lol
I don’t not understand, for the life of me, how one removes the cups.
I have always had issues with non-OB tampons.. they tend to grow length wise instead of width wise when they absorb? It’s horribly painful and eventually my doc told me to ONLY use OB from now on. Unfortunately I live in Asia where they don’t sell them, so I bring 3-4 boxes back everytime I visit North America, and it’s always in my care package if anyone comes to visit.
Mine legitimately wasn’t though. (Likely a form of vaginismus) My mom always suggested tampons and the first time I tried them I literally doubled over for two hours and throwing up. Couldn’t even take it out bc it hurt so bad. Mom was baffled. So, maybe laughing isn’t the best way, maybe she has tried putting a finger up there or something and she was trying to communicate that there was no way that’s going up there without hurting. Probably not, but it might be. 

Tried once again after that because I wanted to go swimming, same deal. I felt like something was wrong with me and I felt very infantilized.  As an adult, the couple times I tried it it’s still uncomfortable and makes me queasy. Pulling out a fully absorbed tampon was like, an hour ordeal to get myself to do it. I’m just on the pill now to skip every period. It’s confusing because I can have sex fine. It’s probably a mental block thing. It’s crazy how unwilling your vaginal muscles can get just from a mental block. 

Anyway, advocate for various types of period products for her to find the best product for her. (Not accusing you of doing otherwise)
I remember the first time I put one in and it really didn't feel like there was enough room in there. It was sooooo uncomfortable I didn't try again for years until I was more developed. She might not be as far off as you think. And yes, I was on my period at the time so there was enough lubricant.
I laughed out loud for that one. Kids are cute.
I got my period when I was 10 and was a competitive swimmer. I learned to use them quickly, but I remember the first time crying from anxiety while my mom coached me.
i was 8 T_T
I salute you 😂
I’m dying. I just had a coughing fit
Oh okay that’s what I figured but I wasn’t sure lol
well now i’ve heard everything. i can get off the internet for awhile lol
right!!! ur in the bathroom. all you really need to do with your potentially bloody fingers is pull ur pants up, open a stall door and wash ur hands (assuming ur in a public restroom). and, that said, most blood i got on my fingers when changing a tampon was from finding the string of the old one and pulling it out!! rarely if ever did it come from putting a tampon in considering i usually wiped up any old mess before insertion. i get being uncomfortable with your body, but i knew about a lot of these people’s masturbation habits so the whole thing was baffling. i suppose they thought of “fingers in the vag” as an inherently sexual thing, but unless youre going up a couple knuckles and really putting the work in…. nothing about it feels sexual lol
Any chance they sell seventh generation there? They are indistinguishable from OB except they are 100% organic cotton so no other ingredients. Much healthier for the vagina but same exact quality in every other way.
You just explained why these have been so life changing for me, thanks! The others definitely do get longer. Damn.
She has access to period panties, pads (smaller, younger teen sized ones) and smaller teen tampons. She knows she can ask me or her dad if she’s running low on supplies, but for now she just adds it to my shopping list. I just wanted her to be aware of the most popular choices and not end up alone at school and scared.  My laughter was honestly at her horrified look; my mom told me I did the same thing. She seems happy with a combo of period panties and pads right now and I always make sure she has an extra pair of leggings, extra panties, a couple of pads, clean up wipes and some midol in a bag in her backpack. I can remember getting surprised a couple of times at school in the beginning and the panic was awful.
I wasn’t expecting her to want to use them, I was just going over the options well before she started her period. I didn’t want her to be at school the first time and feel panicked, I wanted her to feel like she was in control. We went over how to put pads on, how period panties work and how tampons work. I did buy a box of teenage specific tampons so she has them if she wants them, but I just want her to have choices. I’d never force her to use a specific product.
Oh nooooo that is AWFUL. My mom went to school with someone who was 9. 8 is just…I’m so sorry.
TIFU by getting caught with a prostitute in GTA V by my wife.
Tonight I was playing GTA V in the basement and my wife caught me having sex with one of the prostitutes in game. 

If you didn't know, GTA allows players to pick up hookers in your car and pay them for various sexual services. I had headphones on and thought my wife was asleep. She ended up being behind me in the back of the room and basically saw the entire shooting match. 

My wife is very religious/conservative and I think I may have really fucked up. We do share a lot of the same values but I have been doing this in GTA since before we met. I tried to explain that it was just a game but in her eyes it was betraying her trust. 

She is even more pissed because I went back for seconds and thirds, paying the prostitute multiple times. 

I am no longer welcome in by bed and this could actually cause a major problem for us. She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching. 

TL;DR 

I was unfaithful to my wife in a video game and now my marriage may be over.

if you actually cheat on her with a prostitute irl she'll completely forget this GTA business.
You should full send it and get married in a rp server
I think we need to know if both hands stayed on the controller or not when this happened to fully judge the situation
Looks like you're going to be on the couch for a while.. Atl last you can hit up the prostitute again while you're there..
Now the important part, did you run over the prostitute afterwards? Gotta get that money back.
You could justify it by telling her you don't go out stealing cars and shooting strangers either.

Unless you do.
At least offer to pay your wife the same in compensation 
Who were you playing as?
Play Baldurs Gate 3, you can have sex with a bear, that should put it in perspective…
This is just genuinely hilarious to me
Tell the truth.  She caught you stroking it, which is why you went back for seconds and thirds. Closest to porn you can get, huh?
Every time I read something like this I'm happy about how unshitty my relationship is.
You just got your butt fingered and now you’re plowing hookers in GTA and might lose your wife because of it. Dude.
Lol, did they finally animate it or is it still driving forwards and backwards?
I somehow feel like there are more problems with you two than just this GTA sex gag (this whole story alone feels like bait LMAO). There’s a lot of ways to look at this deeper than what’s simply said here for a marriage to be in danger imo.
You both are married at 12?
>We do share a lot of the same values

Well, apparently not. I'm not saying you were in the wrong or that she was but you two are not on the same page clearly.

I also like to point out that in your brain, the FU is "getting caught" (see your title). Not the action itself but your wife noticing. That shouldn't be a thing in a healthy marriage.
Lol, this can't be real...
Reading your post history you’ve both cheated on each other it seems…
Went back for seconds and thirds had me rolling lmao!!🤣
If this is real, your wife has major issues.
I'm 99% sure this is all creative writing, but for that 1%.... how on earth is that cheating? Did she catch you masturbating during or something? I'm just really confused about how that constitutes cheating.
The GTA thing is weird because you did it multiple times. But, she also has some bad jealousy issues. Maybe y'all should try some couples counseling.
The second hand embarrassment was so bad I had to leave the app for a bit
“I was unfaithful to my wife in a video game and now my marriage may be over.”
 
What an insane sentence, sounds like this may be a blessing for you in the long run
Just say that the religion actually allows this
U fuck up by marrying a woman with pathological jealousy issues. She is the problem not you. If she can't get over something miniscule and stupid as this than your marriage is over. And it's her fault.
Just wait til you cheat on her in one of her dreams.
There’s a better life out there my dude. 
She knows it’s a game, right? 🤣
I honest to god don't mean this in a rude way, but why are you as a grown man soliciting services from a prostitute in GTA? Steal a car, fuck shit up, crash a plane idk?
Your wife sounds exhausting.
Sounds like your wife needs to get a grip. She needs to be made aware of the phrase, “pick your battles.” Of all the things someone could do, *this* is what she has a problem with? The bar has been set very low. Huge red flag. Allow this sort of ridiculousness to become a repeat occurrence and your marriage will be miserable.
I need to be more careful playing Sims4. /s
Your values totally make sense and this is a completely reasonable response that only very sane people would be capable of. 

/s
>She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching.

This is a type of emotional abuse.  I've been in a toxic relationship with a woman like this, and it wasn't healthy for me at all.

I'm not telling OP to divorce or run or anything drastic... just, think about things a bit, OP.  That's all.
Your wife sounds insufferable
Both of you need to grow up.
Asked my fiancée for advice for you and she says get a new wife, that shit’s insane
>She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching.   

So, an insecure child?  I'd die on this hill, personally.  Nothing that triggers me more than a grown ass adult in an adult relationship behaving like it's fucking middle school.  Tell her to start therapy and fix herself before she comes at you over pixels.
Play  the game with her and kill that exact hooker (in game) infront of her 


That would calm her i guess
> this could actually cause a major problem for us. She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching.

WOW. This level of immaturity is far beyond a normal person-to-person difference in values. This girl needs therapy, not even for the sake of your marriage, but for her own quality of life.
"we do share a lot of the same values"

Apparently not.
This has to be a joke, right?
> I am no longer welcome in by bed and this could actually cause a major problem for us. She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching.

Lol, good luck and may god have mercy on your soul, OP cause your wife sounds like a jealous nut who would get pissed off at your if you cheated on her in her dreams or some shit
"She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching."

Holy shit this is problematic. She needs therapy to address such a severe insecurity.
She gets jealous when hot women are in movies and shows you watch?

That's a red flag the size of a London double decker bus.
Why do you have to sleep on the couch? She's the one who's mad, make her sleep on the couch!
Your wife needs serious counselling. She acting like a complete fucking child. 🚩
As someone who has literally hundreds of hours logged across various GTA x editions, I'm really struggling to believe that someone would bother buying an in-game prostitute OUTSIDE of deliberately showing someone what you can do in the game.

For context, a vaguely female looking stack of polygons moves on-screen towards a rectangle (the car) ... The rectangle makes a "rocking" motion 2 or 3 times and the polygon-lady starts walking around again.

If someone was playing a GTA game for sexy times titillation, they'd go to the strip joint where you can see boobs.

> GTA allows players to pick up hookers in your car and pay them for various sexual services.


Like this right here. That's not at all accurate. GTA 5 shows you the rear brake-lights of a car and they rotate slightly on the X-axis.

In what universe does a dude, with headphones in, playing late at night do this multiple times in a row? It isn't an interesting animation from a "sexy times" perspective.

> I had headphones on and thought my wife was asleep. She ended up being behind me in the back of the room and basically saw the entire shooting match.

It's also kinda slow.  How long was she allegedly watching for from the shadows? 10 minutes? 

This feels like someone wrote a hypothetical into a story for reddit to me.

Now ... If it was "caught wanking to the strip joint scene in GTA5" I'd be more likely to believe it... But the underpants section of a JC Penny catalog is sexier than the GTA5 car-pickup prostitute scene.
What in the Utah....
Uhhh, don't marry religious nutjobs? What is this, ELI5?? And please don't procreate.
I dated a woman just like this I wasn't allowed to watch certain shows or movies because of her jealousy. Luckily I realized eventually and broke it off, but have heard through friends her current husband isn't as lucky as me. He has to have tracking software on his phone and isn't allowed to watch anything without her approval.
Good thing you weren't playing The Witcher 3 of Cyberpunk.
Do you really want to be with a wife who gets angry at you for something in a video game?
Dude. Your wife needs counseling.
Ngl, this whole post sounds like shitposting lmao
I consider myself a religious bigot so don't take my advice, but ditch her for a woman who doesn't have imaginary friends.
I think your wife has problems deeper than GTA if even the sight of another woman makes her jealous. She needs help my man
But all the theft and murders are no problem, right?
It's a video game. Tell her to get over it. 

You did nothing wrong. When I play I ask my wife to choose the prostitute. I don't expect her to do a 180 on her thinking but she's freaking out over nothing.
Yeah okay... Awkward. 


I guess you spin it as looking out for your avatar. Seeing him as an entity kind of like a friend. You don't want to cheat, but that doesn't stop your bro from getting laid right? The character is just a character. Not literally you. Idk if your wife can see that but that's all I've got.


 In a way you were acting like a wingman right xD
She's pissed off about that, but not at all worried that you're a murderer?
Tell her it's for regaining health!
Shouldve followed it up with “im only going to murder her for my money back” it wouldve smoothed the whole thing out
We tried it out together the other day and laughed at it so hard. It's just a videogame... who cares.
Omg it's a freaking game. And if she gets jealous of attractive women on TV shows and movies then she has some issues to sort out.
Gets jealous over women in movies? Jesus Christ she's insecure, that's insane behavior lol
She’s okay that you murder innocent civilians on the street in the game but engaging prostitutes is the line?
I couldn’t imagine marrying someone this insecure
This sounds like when she’s mad and says “you cheated on me in my dream”……except she’s watching….and you’re dreaming.😂

Also, never understood how because you’re mad I gotta sleep somewhere else.  F that.  My wife gets mad.  She goes in the other room.  Your temper tantrum ain’t kicking me outta my bed.😂
You didn't fuck up today, you fucked up when you married someone who gets jealous of a cluster of pixels. There's nothing about that in whatever holy book she likes.
Your partner can't be jealous if they view their own treatment as markedly better. Pay her 10x more than you paid the hooker in-game and do her in the back of the most tricked out car you can get your hands on.
Your wife’s reaction is absurd. You’d probably be better off without her.
I never solicited a prostitute in the game until I gave my wife a turn on the game. First thing she does is drive to a dark alley at night, have sex with her in the car and then stab her 14 times as she is walking away. 

I guess there's 2 kinds of wives.
Religious folks ruining another life I see
Seems like you need a new wife
So not trying to sound mean or anything buuuuut....

If your wife is so upset....about what a fictional character in a fictional world did.....id say she needs to address that with a therapist. 

That seems like some serious deep seeded feelings rather than a normal, healthy response to this.
>She is even more pissed because I went back for seconds and thirds, paying the prostitute multiple times.

This sent me over the edge into cry-laughing. Congrats OP, you have good comic timing.
Your wife is very religious and conservative.... And your playing GTA V and you didn't see a conflict of personality and belief type there? You got bigger problems than a video game.
You think that's bad? I walked into my wife getting plowed by a bear while playing Baldur's Gate 3.......










She had the audacity to not invite me along
"I was unfaithful to my wife in a video game"

I cannot remember reading something more ridiculous than this sentence. This is lunacy.
my friend, the bullet is actively dodging you. escape
Hate to see how she reconciles not being ok with game prostitution but is ok with game murder
Uhhh sounds like the fuck up was how every many years you ago you proposed to this idiot.
Tell her you were going to kill the prostitute and get your money back so it doesn't count.
If you start the divorce now, it should be settled by the time VI releases.
Only thing my wife wants to do when she plays GTA is fuck the prostitutes
What a ridiculous woman your wife is.

If she's conservative, what happened to taking orders from her man? Tell her to shut up and let you do what you want, and if she doesn't like it, she can leave.
If she's the type to be jealous of actresses and video game characters...that's a rough life. I've had an ex like that, and all I can say is, no human being is perfect, but some human beings prefer their partners to attempt to be perfect even though they can't be...and those people are, well, jerks. They think they have high standards, but the truth is they have a huge fear of abandonment, and it can destroy others' mental health. That's the kind of person who could literally drive you crazy, so take care of your mental health. Remember it's not your job to be perfect. It's her job to lighten up.


I'd rather act normal, be imperfect, and be single, than have to try to appease a perfectionist the rest of my life. She may try to convince you to go to some kind of therapy for looking at lady in a game the wrong way, but everyone will know she's the one who needs therapy for giving a shit if you look at a video game character. Keep that mind straight. Be willing to call her out for being ridiculous. It's just a game. It's just as dumb as her getting mad you slid a long tetris piece into an open space. Remember that.
Idk, this sounds like an easy out to me. I had a bro in college who's gf was crazy like that and the moment she lost it like that over something and started threatening to leave he was just like "cool, how soon can you get your shit out of my apartment?" Best decision he ever made.
I'd tell her she should file for divorce, but that I *have* to be present for the part where the judge asks for the cause... Because I'm gonna DIE laughing when she goes to explain that to the judge and just watching that whole exchange.

"Your honor, in her defense, and to be fair... I also spent 3 hours one Sunday night trying to save a princess named Peach" 😂😂😂

In all seriousness though, her issue isn't with you, it's with her dad.
![gif](giphy|xUA7aM09ByyR1w5YWc)
She sounds like she shuts down intimacy every time she has a DREAM of you cheating.

You might be cooked, homie
If this is all it took for your marriage to fall apart.. bro it was doomed from the beginning.
Just tell her it was part of the quest
For all that you might as well have slept with a real prostitute.
If your wife acted like this over a game, it's the least of your worries. Your life is going to be miserable.
"She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching."

Since I've been in your shoes, get out. It will never end. You will start to avoid certain shows/movies in an effort to avoid this. She will find new arenas to bring up the topic. IT NEVER ENDS.
Dare her to divorce you so she has to go to court and explain that she (an adult) wants a divorce because you (also an adult) were playing a video game.
This isn’t real right? I mean surely nobody is that fucking nuts
My husband plays video games with sex scenes and he does so in the living room, where I can usually see and I really don't care.

There is very much a difference between "woop, a sex scene as part of the story" and "I'm sitting int he dark basement while my wife is asleep, wanking it to prostitutes in GTA".

The difference, of course, is the way *you* act around it.

If you know she has an issue with you watching any pornographic content and you had previously agreed not to, then this isn't about the game or the prostitute, but about you breaking your promises, betraying your shared morals and going behind her back, sneaking and hiding out in the basement to do so.

Either you are compatible or you're not, and if prostitutes in GTA is something you absolutely HAVE to do in the dark, three times to live happily and it's a dealbreaker to her, then you're just not compatible.
So she is very religious and that's why she is upset that you went with a virtual prostitute, but she is completely OK with you, equally virtually, run down pedestrians, steal, murder, and several other immoral activities the game offers?
So... you married a lunatic?

Or this is just a badly written fanfic, which i find more likely tbh, because ive never heard of anyone genuinely that insane IRL.
Waitaminute.. you've been doing this since before you met? And you often go back for seconds and thirds?

I'm not saying I'm siding with the wife here, but maybe she's actually more on the point that it's kinda a weird thing for a grown man to do.
If she's so religious, tell her it is her duty to sleep with you whenever you need it.
Lmao religion
> She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching. 

this is called being a crazy person
>My wife is very religious/conservative and I think I may have really fucked up. 

Generally when you hook up with someone that believes in an imaginary sky daddy you are going to have issues.  Especially if you aren't as nutso religious as they are.  If it wasn't this it would probably be porn or some other thing they are puritanical about.

You can try and patch this up, but frankly, having conflicting beliefs is just going to tear the relationship apart eventually.
I think the fuck up is marrying someone like that in the first place.
It’s a video game… she needs help… mentally
I can't imagine anyone seeing someone play GTA and taking it seriously, let alone feeling some type of way about it.
Honestly jokes aside, get marriage counseling
Holy shit! Talk about insecure! Blackjack and hookers is literally the basis of the game. I have no words my guy, but if you can't play a GAME in sanctity of your OWN HOME, then what do you even have man? She sounds problematic.
This falls under the emotional cheating realm for her. Best option is to talk about it, explain it's just a game, hopefully you were dressed, and explain that you have no desire emotionally or physically for what you were watching, you were just playing the game. No actual "sin" was committed. 

Having different values is difficult for marriages. I'm more of a whatever gets your motor running as long as you do it with me person.
No offense but this must be the most hilarious thing I've ever seen
This story would have been better if you were doing this in online session and your wife was stalking you as another character in game.
![gif](giphy|S8PgGLIp9gHjuE1qcm)
If your wife holds GTA 5 to the same moral standard as real life, she should be more concerned that you are okay with murdering pedestrians without a second thought.
Any wife that creates a fuss over video game activity is FAR TOO CONTROLLING and immature, and insecure. Don't let religion be a mask for justified mental abuse. You did NOTHING wrong. Stick up for yourself and get a new marriage after you grow a spine.
Ain't nobody got time for that
>She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching.

Why would you do this to yourself
Omggg! this post brings back a memory i buried deep in my mind! 😖
soo basically I was playing GTA with my *EX* boyfriend, who I been dating for a few weeks...
(We wasn’t using mic/party chat in the game, by the way.)
anyways, i noticed him riding around with some other girl, and I kind of followed them for a bit. Then my jealousy took over, and I pulled out my rifle and shot both of them while they were in a clothing store. He kinda just snuck away as she and I started gun battling. She was really kicking my butt, I always sucked at shooting. But I’m good in a jet, so I got my jet and kept killing her until he called me and said thats his sister. She got on the phone and cursed at me, and I cursed back at her, lol. We literally started beefing from that point on, and every time I went over to his house, she didnt speak to me, rolled her eyes at me, & closed her door. I never knew a video game could cause drama like that... We broke up a few months later, too, lol. Super embarrassing memory and silly. 🤦🏽‍♀️
🤦🏻‍♀️
Stay away from Baldurs gate 3
Don't let her take a penny in the divorce.

Trick her into telling the court that she is divorcing you because you had sex with a prostitute in a video game.
So your wife has no problem with stealing cars and murdering cops?
But I guess the running people over and shooting people in GTA is absolutely fine?
Dude, I was with a woman who was this insecure once… she either has to trust you or you can do better.
[deleted]
It must be exhausting to be with someone so uptight.
Well, that's what you get for getting a nutjob as a wife
Yes, nutjob is the common term for religious/conservative people so you know.
Someone should make a bible themed version of GTA or Fallout, based on Bible stories.  There are some pretty gory, incestuous, prostitution, slavery based stories that a large number of 'religious' types don't even realise are in their book.   

For extra points, do a DLC for the Quran version.
Religion is so fucking weird
“Babe, it’s just a game, look…” 

:::shoots prostitute 10 times::: 

“…she means nothing to me.”
Nah this shit can’t be for real lol
hey bro im really sorry but thats funny as fuck
I like how you went back for more just to piss her off because it really means nothing. 
You didn't FU.  Your wife has issues.  I started up GTA San Andreas recently and my wfe's immediate response upon seeing it was "You gonna pickup some hoes?"
>She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching.

Aside from cartoons what the hell can you watch around her? Practically every live action movie or show has attractive women in it, even if there aren't any as main characters there's still going to be some appearing as minor characters. Probably for the best if you break up over this to be honest.
I remember when I was a kid and my mom caught me with a prostitute in GTA3, and my response was “Don’t worry, I’m going to kill her afterwards and get my money back” as if my fiscal responsibility would make it less likely that I would get my game taken away. It didn’t work.
I know this isn't funny, but I can't help but laugh at how ridiculous this is.
She gets jealous when attractive women exist. Try to escape this controlling freak.
>She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching.

I have one of these, Im old, run now. Shit is so childish, I'm seriously thinking of divorce( along with the other 1 million issues I have.
So, when I was about 5 or 6, I learned that things on TV aren't real... if your wife is getting jealous of women in a TV show, movie, or worse yet, a video game, this is probably for the best...
My ex would also get upset by attractive women. It was exhausting. Pretty women in movie? Hour long argument about how I must want to fuck her and find my actual gf disgusting. Her sister is also at the pool with us? That’s going to be an hour or two of crying because her sister is so hot and will steal me away despite me not even really talking to her.

Honestly OP, you need to sit down and talk to her. She needs to grow up.
Dude GET OUT NOW!!! Any woman who is jealous because you watch movies with certain actresses is an absolute psychopath. You are involved with an extremely insecure woman. Get out before it's too late. It's a MASSIVE red flag! The fact that you felt the need to semi-hide what you were doing in a video games speaks volumes. You are walking on eggshells in a toxic relationship.

To put it frankly, my wife and I have a healthy attachment. For example we will check out other women together and comment on their beauty. No cheating, no open relationship, and we are strictly monogamous but we are secure in our love.

Dude run for the hills because I was you and I regret it with all my heart that I did not leave that insecure manipulative borderline personality disorder ridden woman. I remember having to screen movies before we watched them to make sure there were no sex scenes or nudity because it would set her off that I was "checking them out" I'm like really? I'm literally watching a fn movie with you.
She's does realize how many people you're killing in that game, right? Is she holding that against you, too? 

This whole thing is absolutely ridiculous.
Sounds like a misalignment of values. If she is conservative and you're not (the wording made it appear that you may not be), it's something that can cause issues. Ideally, when problems arise in a marriage, they should be discussed, calmly, like mature adults. Sounds like she may also be insecure. If she is willing to end a marriage over a video game, she ain't the one.
Yeah, leave her mate. This is straight abuse. Youre playing a game and shes making your life hell. Just dont listen to here  because this is obviously a game, and shes in the wrong 😩
So this girl who has a hard time discerning fiction from reality (religion) is having a hard time discerning between fiction and reality?

Shocked.
I’m so gay that I had no idea how to even track down prostitutes so I didn’t even care to try
Bro... This is ridiculous.
Your wife's an idiot
I’m sorry, but this is so silly and immature on her part. Not being prudes or conservative, my wife would probably sit on the couch and watch me and ask what all WE can do with the prostitute, like it’a literally just a video game.

But my wife and I are very open and not much of the jealous types. We talk about what kind of porn we like, we point out people we think are attractive to each other, she tells me about the bat shit insane smut she reads, and it’s all fun. Obviously everyone is different, I just can’t for the life of me imagine being in that kind of a relationship.
Wait till she figures out how you can even get your money back after said services in game.
What makes your wife jealous of attractive women in movies and tv shows? Is it something you’re doing (like making inappropriate comments about them)? Or is it her own/past insecurities getting to her?
>I went back for seconds and thirds, paying the prostitute multiple times.

🤨

Dude was definitely jerking off
“I’m no longer welcome in my bed”. You deserve whatever’s coming to you 🤣
7/10.

Not super believable.
she will get over it, i call my wife in during the shower with the girlfriend scenes in cyberpunk2077, she laughs and sias go get'm. if your wife/gf is upset by that, you need to rewife.
You go back to the same ones?  How?  It is universally accepted that you must kill them for a refund.
Paying a prostitute multiple times as a grown man on gta v is nuts
> She is even more pissed because I went back for seconds and thirds, **paying the prostitute multiple times**.

Not to imply that your wife is being rational about this, but I'm just wondering: why would you do that? It's admittedly been a long time since I played it, but if I recall correctly, you don't actually get anything from the game by having sex with prostitutes, right? I mean, I can see why you'd do it at least once to see how the game mechanic works (because it's kind of funny), but why bother after that?

Maybe what your wife is pissed about is not that you did it, but that you're apparently *getting something out of it*, and that this is suggestive of a larger problem in your marriage?
God damn the straights really aren't okay, wtf.
Why would anyone willfully choose to live this way...what a shit life. Your marriage is over because of a video game?     

i think even Christ would call that ridiculous.
Aah... dating super religious people is so much fun
Your wife is based, pornography is cheating on your partner if they think it is.
You could have also murdered the prostitute and gotten your money back
OP has admitted to cheating on their wife irl....less than a year ago......
Honestly, and I realize this is never what anyone wants to hear, but maybe your values aren't actually all that similar. Have you ever actually considered how happy you are together, and whether you'd be happier with someone else?
Why would you marry someone like that lmao.
Your wife sounds absolutely insane.  Please stay married to her and shield the rest of us.
Without reading a fucking word of this beyond your title...you made my day thank you
Don’t worry, super religious people don’t believe in divorce.
Your wife is just dumb tbh
Man this is the dumbest shit I ever heard...

![gif](giphy|1iXXkxSIOisE3OV2|downsized)
If you then kill the prostitute and get the money back, will that make it better?
Disclaimer: only in the game
Can you make it up to the real life wife but murdering the video game prostitute?

But she has no problem with you stealing cars and killing people in GTA?
Well thank goodness OP didn't set foot in the tiddy bar.
A type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies you are watching - is a woman with low self confidence.
This is the funniest tragic tifu I’ve read in a while
Make sure to bring her in when you're meeting Meredith at the No-Tell Motel in Cyberpunk as well
Your wife is a dipshit
insecure partners making it your problem when someone hot is on TV is a red flag
On a real note though... your wife's jealousy is unhealthy but so is your obsession with GTA prostitutes? 

  
But this whole situation is just too hilarious, dude. Ahaha what the hell. I'm really sorry your marriage is on the fritz though, like.. I know that's stressful af.
I’m a woman and I love having sex with the prostitutes then killing them to get my money back :) 

I’m appalled she’s upset by this. You can’t even really see anything? It’s a cartoon? Idk. Good luck.
I love the part where you went back for seconds and thirds 🤣 I wish I could've seen her face when you kept going back
This is like freaking out because you made Barbie and GI Joe smash on the hood of her pink Vette or something. My wife would laugh. I don't know if I'd be able to keep from laughing at her for being pissed! And we ALL know how much THAT helps...

Pretty crazy, man. Hope you get it sorted and, if not, it was bound to happen over something eventually.
She sounds like an extremely stupid insufferable person.
Is this.. *satire?* At this point, I don't even know if I can tell anymore.. If it isn't though, Jesus christ. People like this can't really exist, right? "Cheating" on her with prostitutes in gta? Can you not watch movies with sex scenes either? Get real, this can't be legit. This has to be a fucking joke. She knows you shoot people in video games too, right? It's gta.. I need to go to bed. This is enough reddit for the night. Rofl
Did you leave out that you were touching your pecker  too. Or was this strictly on screen and you were just saying oooh aaaah into the mic to go through the motions.

Imagine the chaos
Like that episode of black mirror
Flashback to XQC's RP divorce lmao
Chaotic evil
“My wife doesn’t let me watch porn and she caught me in loophole where I was beating off to a video game” sounds a lot more creepy haha.

I think this was a plot line in The League, but Ruxin was watching the maternity bra bounce test and not a GTA hooker.
OP mashing more than buttons.
Maybe he was using joystick.
That rumble stick was going crazy
This. OP portrays himself as this "laid back dude just playing vidya". But ask yourself, why does a guy like that end up with a super conservative woman who treats video games like a sin? He's probably conservative, just like her, and could be one of those repressed gooners who does freaky shit behind closed doors. So when he says "I went back for seconds and thirds" he was possibly getting off to the scenario.

I feel like OP is downplaying his own view on the situation.
I assumed "shooting match" was a euphemism
Isn't that what he meant by saying his wife saw the "shooting match"? Our guy was shooting ropes.
Depending on how up to date your wife is on the current media cycle the Couch might be another trigger… ;)
Looks like he's playing a single-player shooter for now.
> Looks like you're going to be on the couch for a while.. 

This is simmering I never understood. No one is kicking me out of my own bed, nor would I attempt to kick my wife out. If you’re so upset that you can’t stand to sleep next to your partner, you can go.
Only if the gaming area is where the couch is
Google Divorce while you’re on the couch!
Just properly dispose of the rubber glove...
This.. he could also just argue that its a side quest to complete the game
And would killing the prostitute help or hurt the situation with his wife?
Funnily enough, there's a side mission on another GTA game where a prostitute calls you out for *this* exactly

The hooker will rant about people killing them after they do the deed, then more hookers show up and gang up on the player to kill them lmao
You add murder, but remove the prostitution.
Asking the important questions.
See honey, she doesn't mean anything to me!
Bitch better have my money!
I haven't played GTA since the PS2, so is it more than just watching a car rock and hearing some noises now?

Still trying to understand why you'd go multiple times? Sometimes I'd do it as a joke in GTA San Andreas but it's just a waste of money
I have no money for a reddit award but i want you to know i CACKLED at this for like five minutes.
It would be hilarious if OP played GTA without breaking any laws. Except for the solicitation of prostitutes of course
That would only mean the wife is in the same level as the virtual prostitute

At least add five more dollars in exchange for a blowjob

Or Witcher to “collect cards”
Mass Effect, Dragon Age… sex scenes exist in games and movies. Your wife has some serious issues if she’s struggling with “things on TV are not real.” That’s what most people pick up on at what, 6? 7?
Listen, honey. All sorts of women are saying they’d choose the bear and I wanted to see what the fuss was about.
Umm and a tentacle man.
![gif](giphy|rguj35cTYIH5u)
Even better, make her play it, fall in love with Halsin and then you can grill her for that. Or get her to fall for Astarion or Wyll for a different approach of grilling
That's at least narratively interesting. There is nothing about the GTA prostitution that isn't just titillation for horny men. It's in the same ballpark as watching porn, and lots of women have problems with their SOs watching porn.
I was not prepared with just how obscenely horny that game can get lol
So that's what they meant by choosing the bear

I'm surprised the top comment isn't just a lonely "LOL"
I scrolled this far for this comment finally? WTF.... Our marriage is in peril because of nudity in a video game? Is he married to a fucking child? Look at the bright side OP. Now you know your wife has the emotional maturity and intellectual understanding of men as my kids goldfish.
Conservative values have fucked some people up lmao
Insecurities, level 1000
You probably didnt date or married someone so fucked up in head they cause scene about shit you do in videogame… this is at best sad as fuck and if i was this dude id gtfo, shes insecure to the next galaxy and treats him like 12yo kid..
Honestly my ex wife might not have been medically or legally insane, but it’s fascinating to think people this are out there being adults.. just existing
What gets me is that he's trying to spin it as "just playing video games" and then says he explicitly went back for seconds and thirds after she caught him.
>  Closest to porn you can get, huh?

This is my question. Unless things have dramatically changed from when I played GTA - it's nothing more than some weak audio and a car that rocks.

My first thought, are there IRL people running around GTA as hookers having audio sex, or something akin to that? Did the wife catch a long gooning session online?
Seriously. Even the part about the wife getting jealous over attractive people on TV is a huge wtf moment.
Read this three times knowing I was missing something. OP’s profile explained it.
Life comes at you fast; or I guess in this case, OP came fast.
and he’s a bears fan so he won’t have any happiness this fall to subside losing his wife
She’s probably jealous of the doctor too
I can't find the post pleas tell me someone screen shotted it
They’ve updated it now that the girl saddles you while you’re in the driver seat with full clothes on, but you can only move the camera left to right.
I read his other posts and feel sad for him. It sounds like his wife treats him like her child. He seems very constrained by life and wants more but can’t or else he will “get in trouble.”  That’s not how marriage is supposed to work. I’m a divorced woman, I should know. 

If you want to be happy in life I’d suggest marriage counseling now. Before you the kids are out of the house and then all you have is each other. 

Good luck. 

For reference, it’s a fucking game. A cartoon. Does she read steamy romance novels?
Yeah, because the action wasn’t wrong. It’s a pretend videogame.
i dated a woman exactly, *EXACTLY*, like this.

she ruined christmas once because i was having a good time catching up with my female cousin.  locked herself in the bathroom, convinced i was trying to fuck my cousin

i believe this is 1000% real and actually pretty mild
I was playing Stardew Valley and somehow it came up that I was dating Abigail in the game.  My wife (then GF) thought that meant I was playing online and had an online GF and got pissed until I assured her I was only playing single player.
People like this do exist.
My ex said it would be better if i would be gay. She was jealous of every woman.
Not saying it is real, but you’d be surprised, my friend once caught her boyfriend with a screenshot of a TikTok girl, and called me saying he cheated, then explained that porn is cheating, she showed me (it was a girl in a revealing workout outfit, yes revealing but not something you wouldn’t find at a gym) and then broke up with him, saying she was extra pissed that the girl looked nothing like her. 

Like I’m not judging, they have their own personal boundaries, but I want a girl who’ll see an attractive woman and say “damn she’s hot” instead of getting jealous.
Nah, I'd say it's about a Pokemon Uncommon level of rarity.

Lots of folks out there that are either intentionally, or unintentionally (usually due to insecurities), extremely emotionally manipulative.
OP mentioned she's religious and conservative, so that kinda goes without saying.
Cheating in his "head", its just one step before he does it in real life. At least that is what his wife thinks.
> Did she catch you masturbating during or something?

That wouldn't be cheating either, friend. If a partner thinks something like "I'm all you should need, masturbation is cheating, bla bla bla" they are probably not going to be a great partner.

You don't have to masturbate to have a healthy relationship, but you should not think it's cheating or hold it against your partner if they do.
But doesn't GTA give you multiple options when you pick up a street walker?
maybe they can find couple counseling in GTA
gets jealous of videogames and actresses = "some" bad jealousy issues

I wonder what would you consider severe jealousy issues?
I agree! What are you like 13? Plus you two need counseling in general.
His wife is jealous because of a videogame, for all that is holy, how the hell is this a "you both have issues"? OP has goddamn nothing to blame, otherwise my wife should call the cops for me because I shot people in Call of Duty.
>The GTA thing is weird because you did it multiple times

Ah yes, let's start judging people for what they do in a bloody video game. How mature
"Very religious/conservative" generally means therapy is unlikely in these situations, unfortunately. At most, the wife might agree to talk to their pastor/priest or a religious therapist. The goal being to provide the husband therapy so he can no longer do "dirty" things. But it's more likely the wife takes a hardline policy and just says he needs to stop or she's leaving, because she sees it as a deal-breaking non-negotiable.

Just shut down the conversation.

1 Timothy 2:12 "But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
This is the cheat code you need OP.
Scrolled way to far for this.
Second this, major red flag.
Sounds like my ex and she turned out to have severe borderline and ended up in the locked down part of the mental hospital.
A lot of women who are raised with hyper conservative values are more or less taught that their value is their sex. Her jealousy is a symptom of something much deeper (but can be fixed).
This woman has a Delusional Disorder and cannot tell reality from fiction.
lol maybe his girlfriend is an AI
Same reason anyone would do the other stuff you listed, because it's stupid shit that is part of the game world
Or even the entire British Isles, never mind a double-decker bus…
That poor fuck had no idea what hell he was in for
That’s my take-away here. Her being upset about tv characters is odd but him sitting in the basement alone with headphones while his wife is asleep to video bang a virtual prostitute three times is very weird. Something I’d expect of a 12 year old boy.
Hiring prostitutes is definitely an old solution to a modern problem though
r/unexpectedgoodplace
Only if you yell Blake Bortles while doing it.
Malcom solves his problems with a chainsaw, and he never has the same problem twice.
I know for sure GTARP streamers that are married that are also married to someone ingame. Some of them stream for close to 10 hours with their RP spouse. 

It's weird that they probably spend more time with them than their real spouse.
Imagine explaining the situation to a judge. Hilarious. OPs wife seems kind of unhinged.
Really weird that the devs of that fighting game programmed in sex.

Not unexpected, just weird.
Sick reference!
>beating off to a video game”

Wild though. Doesn't it just show the car rocking?

Edit: ok so in V you can apparently see the hooker straddle you and stuff, but I think my point still stands. This is madness lol
Also, Kevin can only watch porn while he’s working out.
The bounce test episode was hilarious. I really liked that show and i feel like it didn’t get much credit when it was on air, for whatever reason
Always crazy when people talk of their spouses, not letting them do certain things. Not like adultery or anything immoral. But normal things. You're both adults, and if one is trying to control the other, then maybe you shouldn't be together.
Yeah it's really creepy that his wife is so controlling that she gets jealous over attractive women in TV shows and won't let him watch porn.
Forever uncleaaaaaaaan
He was holding two joysticks.
I’m always skeptical of any essay on reddit like this. 

“I have been doing this in GTA since before we met” makes me think he’s not sharing everything and this is how he gets off.
"We share a lot of the same values, but I've been doing this in GTA since before we met". Sounds like something he does to get off. I don't know why else you would describe it like that. Visiting prostitutes in gta is part of the game, but it ain't that fun. Saying it's something you've done since before you met your wife and going back for seconds and thirds sounds like a repressed fantasy.
It's pretty weak jack off material though honestly. I don't see why he wouldn't just watch porn if he's alone
I'm out of the loop on this one
She is religious/conservative so probably voting for the couch fucker anyway.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrR0yX91-Aw
It's an appeasement tactic, 'if I force her to sleep in the uncomfortable bed she'll be more mad, if I do it she'll see it as me taking punishment'
Sleeping with a prostitute is unironically required to achieve 100% completion in GTA V.
A side piece to complete the nut more like it.
First thing I thought. “Babe, do you really want to be married to a Schmuck that plays 98% of GTA? Yeah didn’t think so”
"I did this for you babe"

>  “things on TV are not real.”

My parents kept trying to have serious conversations with me when I was in college about how Runescape was going to steal my soul for the devil due to my practicing witchcraft in the game. 

There's all types out there.
This is most likely bait. The prostitute stuff is extremely tame even in GTA5. I remember being disappointed by how little happened being a teenager when it came out.
"My wife is very religious/Conservative"

That doesn't really go along with maturity or being logical and pragmatic. Of *course* she has serious issues.
I think it’s less “things on TV are not real” and more “my husband is enjoying the thought of soliciting a prostitute, and this is how he expresses that desire
Christians amirite?
His wife believes in a magic sky man who grants wishes, she has serious issues
Did that bear just take a shit
Funnily enough, Baldur's Gate 3 shows a *lot* more nudity than GTA V ever does.
Thanks, i tried
TIFU by marrying this chick

>nudity in a video game

Technically there isn't even nudity.
I cant believe some people chose to live like that.
I'm pretty sure there isn't even any actual nudity. Just a car rocking back and forth.
The part OP is describing doesn't even have nudity. Just a framed view of the back of the car, which rocks a bit, and some suggestive sounds.
Op also mentions (assuming any of this is even true) that his wife gets jealous of attractive people on the TV. Honestly, if this leads to a divorce he's better off.
my bet is ultra Christian teenagers who got married waaaaaaaaaay too fast because they wanted to have sex.
Honestly, if she gets jealous about him watching movies with attractive women in them, she needs therapy.
Also quite possible they're both really young too.  My mom and dad weren't great role models for how to have a healthy romantic relationship and I was admittedly needy, clingy and jealous unnecessarily constantly when I was young and had no positive foundation for how to actually have a relationship.  Now that I'm older though and my age is nearly double what it was when I first met my husband I've let alot of that mental immaturity stuff go.  Some chicks though, ooof they stay teenage girl levels of jealous their entire lives.  She could grow out of it but the religious conservative upbringing makes any introspection or internal growth pretty unlikely.
100%.  This shits legit wild.
Depends on which GTA we are talking about 100%
For those that dont know in GTA V the hookers and lap dances are wayyy more than just implied by the car rocking, its pretty much a pg-13 sex scene and show boobs w/ nipples out and everything, and from the first person pov. Its quite literally the closest thing to porn without showing any actual genitals. So yeah there is literally no in game reason to be going to a hooker (or even a lapdance) 3 times in a row other than just “enjoying the view.”
That's probably the more wtf thing about this story honestly.
*[grabs popcorn, heads to OP's profile]*
Do I wanna know?
I was really confused about the butt fingering comments in regards to OP but now that I know he’s a bears fan it all falls into place.
Full clothes on is the funniest part because like, bro they do HAVE boobs in the game
The person you responded to is pointing out the importance of common values in a relationship, and how the OP couple clearly has values differences. They’re not making a point about what’s objectively right/wrong

I don’t think it’s wrong either, but having to hide stuff from one’s partner really isn’t a thing in healthy relationships. Lack of common values can be a huge strain on relationships
Man, who needs that kind of drama on their life?
Both this and OP's story sound a lot to me like trauma and/or deep-rooted insecurity rather than conservative values.
I can add confirmation anecdote.  I dated a girl for a short bit in my 20s who was super insecure - didn't want me ever going to a beach because girls.  Didn't want me looking at girls in the mall.  As in at all.

That ended super quick.
If you're going to get blamed for it.. Cousin stuff time.
Yep, my most recent ex was like this, sex was *wild* but it wasn't worth the constant drama. There were certain music artists that I wasn't "allowed" to listen to because they were apparently attractive, I hadn't even seen their faces because I listened on Spotify, but she got insanely jealous over literally *everything*.

Ironically she ended up going after some other bloke (didn't cheat, I caught it before that happened, we then split up) who was also in a relationship and had a pregnant missus.
Regardless of what the workout girl was wearing, dude kept a screen shot of her. That’s weird. Is it worth breaking up over? Maybe not. But the girlfriend was right to be a little upset about it. Also many people consider porn to be cheating, that’s not uncommon.
Dr. Friedlander does couple counsling I think.
100% this. I was shocked to read that part. So can this dude just never watch any attractive people in any tv show or movie because his wife has the insecurities of a teenager? Good lord they need counseling.
The church told them they don't need counselors, only Jesus. /s

But seriously, this is a Molotov cocktail of immaturity and insecurity.  They need counseling.
She can't call the cops on you BECAUSE you were doing your duty.
Hello, officer? I'd like to report a crime. I got T-bagged by Yamumspussy69x420.
Then there’s me who is giggling like mad and actually calls my fiancé over when I find a prostitute in GTA or cyberpunk
when a guy buys gta to wait for his wife to fall asleep to fuck the prostitues couple times even if it’s not for game completion - i can deduct some information from that behaviour, yes. 
has noting to do with mature or not
The thing you need to understand is that Christians don't actually care about Bible verses, except as a gesture to affirm their religiosity. Religious conservatism doesn't work that way.
*OUR ex
Today I fucked up by getting caught hiring a priestess of Aphrodite in Grand theft chariot.
Ancient problems call for ancient solutions.
Bortles!
Sweetest Jacksonville dirtbag friend you could ever ask for.
See, I always thought it was more like people would be too disoriented without every fully functioning part of a human body so functional genitals are just part of every VR game.
Maybe he only jacks off to the part where he runs her over with the car?
The Xbox One and PS4 versions include first person camera. Guess you could at least see the prostitute bouncing on the player character
….Uh you can change camera angles in the car… and then there’s the strip club that is pretty much interactive porn.
Not in GTA 5. You can see everything except the genitals.
It's about the scenario and the fantasy.  Like if you read an erotic book there's no pictures, but it still gets people there.
Yes, and the shaking carriages in Aldia's Keep are much hotter.
His wife should train their dog like Taco did so it can smell if he jizzed and let her know.
I have done it twice.

To see if I can. And to show my wife how to when she started playing.

You can't see anything, it's not interactive, it's just a voice actor moaning a little and the car rocks.

If you jerk off to that you need therapy.
If there's one thing religious nutters love, it's a loop hole that lets them side-step the rules of their religion.
He's religious, I bet he can't watch porn. 

And also... why would he do it three times in a row?
Because of the Christian wife who he's probably worried will check his browser history.
[Get in the loop](https://i.redd.it/w8zuuqn6qhfd1.jpeg), we've got places to go!

It shouldn't be necessary, and it's not healthy. You shouldn't need to appease your SO. Discuss, identify offenses, apologize, affirm corrective action, resolve or compromise. 

They should teach basic conflict resolution in school.
Parents can punish children. If partners are attempting to punish each other, there's a problem in the relationship. Adults should try acting like adults.
Could maybe get away with it once by claiming this, but the guy hit it three times in a row 😄
Well his wife isn’t gonna help him achieve completion now so he may as well
And who doesn't enjoy completion?
\* slowly reverses back on the prostitute \*
Just caught OP using their turn signal in gta. That’s not even in the base game, OP coded in turn signals and then mapped a button on the controller to the turn signal.

What the fuck
Arf! That is a hilarious comment and even more funny when you imagine him handing over a hundred bucks into his wife's outstretched palm and then pausing and removing some bills saying she still got some way to go before she's on a professional level.
There's more
But Franklin is the symbol of his castration
Amanda would actually be fine with him doing that
See…I wish my parents had warned me of the perils of RuneScape. My  soul was stolen by the Prince of Darkness long ago and the timeline tracks. Thank you kind sir or madam for bringing awareness to this issue.
I'm 10 years clean of RuneScape. Still get the occasional urge but I stay sober for my mom.


How did that conversation go?
Can't say they were wrong
I see people who have either clearly spent many thousands of dollars on the game or 10 thousand+ hrs grinding lifelessly and getting 200mil in all stars and THAT is stealing your soul. Casual fun playing 1-2 hrs most days isnt that bad if it's a hobby. 
My wife refuses to watch scary movies with ghosts or demons in them as she believes they are in fact real demons from hell, and the movies are just ways of bringing the demons to our realm to turn humanity evil. Wackos!
I haven't played GTA since San Andreas, but I thought you couldn't even see anything? Just a car bouncing up and down.

If it was something like Witcher or BG3, it'd make more sense.
It sure as fuck ain't a Klondike bar.
The real TIFU is always in the comments
both are the same, low self-esteem, that's why
Yeah, GTA is the least disturbing part of this post.
also because religion
The very rare Hollywood production with attractive people in it. Like seriously, what movies did he watch lately that *don't* have attractive women?
For what it's worth, OP has a 18 year old son: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nhgan/aita_for_my_kid_hitting_my_neighbors_fence_with/
When you're a sheltered fundamentalist girl, rom coms are like Attenborough documentaries. But only the VHS copy your mom taped off TNT in the late 90s, as it cuts out all the cussing.
Yes! It's actually fucking hilarious and kinda weirdly wholesome in a male health is important kind of way.
I remember GTA IV had strippers with their tits out. Blew my teenager mind tbh
The llama! I read about him on a coffee mug.
The hyper religious/christian/conservative do.
Why not both?
Most of the time those are one and the same!
He was called to do it.
Yeah maybe you've got a point. I guess it is a bit odd to wait for your wife to fall asleep to fuck prostitutes in a game. I still feel like she was overreacting a little bit.
Okay, now I actually want to play Grand Theft Chariot.
Bro, murder boner!
Dammit you mean I need *more* therapy??
People jerk off to armpits.
> If you jerk off to that you need therapy.

That's pretty extreme, people jack off to swim suit catalogs.
I mean kids used to jackoff to the swimsuit edition of sports illustrated and Venus magazines......they don't even show anything.   Heck kids used to beat the meat to fuzzy porn hopping to catch a nipple here or there.

Now as an adult I agree if you are strangling the viper to GTA V you probably need to do some reflection.  There are much better ways to choke the chicken I'm the 2020s.
Way to yuck his yum.
Not to say it’s not weird af, but it’s also kinda better than watching hardcore porn isn’t it? Dude just let his imagination take over.
sounds like OP needs a good soaking
That's hilarious.
Damn.  I didn't get it either but my mind went straight to the Casting couch.
Is this actually true, or is it a smear campaign? I haven't heard of this before.
Was supposed to get an achievement, but did not see the pop up message. Had to make sure I did it the right way.
“But honey, it’s got to be every hole to get the achievement!”
Marathon Man Achievement Unlocked!
“love u babe” body squiky noises
*empties the contents of her corpse like a squeezed tube of gogurt*

I'd do anything for you, babe.
i think if you drive slow and safe enough the turn signal does automatically come on. they really did think of everything!
If anything Michael is castrating Franklin by veering him in further into the criminal game and Franklin at that point only cares about the money so he's down, at the same time literal castration is something Trevor would do
Two different convos, two different times, and I tuned them both out pretty quickly. 

By age 10 I was actively avoiding my parents, so by college I considered them pretty much the last people capable of providing advice or useful information. 

I was a homeschool kid, and extremely sheltered compared to other homeschool kids, and their insanity was obvious to me even with my flawed perspective.

I realized from a young age that I was just waiting the time out until I could escape. We're on opposite coasts and talk at most once every couple of years now.
If you pan the camera, you can see the prostitute bouncing in your lap, head bobbing, etc. but that's it. It's not graphic at all, and anyone who has spent more than 5 minutes on the internet has seen worse.
You get what you give
That's another reason for therapy.
WOW.  That's alot of years of life experience to still be as jealous as an insecure 14 yr old teenager.
They still have their tits out in GTA V.

And they bounce them in your face during a private lap dance while you slap their ass, trying not to get spotted by the bouncer.
I remember when there was a huge media controversy over some crappy sex scene in GTA and people lost their shit over some titties. If only those same people could have known what the future would bring on Steam.
A mug? It should be bells. The Drama Llama Ding Dong.
yea she was, and she has some insecurities. but his behaviour is equally weird imo. two weirdos weirding on each other
"All you had to do was follow the damn carriage"
Alas! We ride again!
It’s not coming out until 600 BC.
Wow. Red Dead Redemption is just "GTA in the Old West" and it's good enough to stand on it's own. Imagine "GTA in the ancient Roman Empire".
Basically AC: Odyssey minus the hookers
Me too, I would go absolutely bonkers for that version of the game lol
Bro...
Not anymore. Now OP has to whack his fear boner off because he’s worried his wife will catch him again.
Sorry guys I’m narcoleptic 🗣️🗣️🗣️
OP on the image is a regular in r/comics and is always posting his New Yorker rejects...this one made me laugh for sure.
Real answer: Someone made a tweet a couple of weeks ago saying that JD Vance wrote in his book from 2015, that he and several friends fucked a couch with a latex glove at a Bachelor party.

JD did write a book, but there's no mention of sexual relations with a couch.

But it's social media and funny as hell, so people are running with it.
A lot of people are saying it. Smart people. Good people. A bigly amount of people are saying it...
Can you prove he didn't fuck a couch?  I believe he did.  Look deep within your heart and ask yourself, did JD Vance fuck a couch?  You'll find your truth.
He didn’t, but considering all the lies conservatives have told about the Obamas and Biden in the last decade or so, no one really cares enough to be the voice of journalistic integrity.  More funny to make him say, “I did not have sexual relations with that couch” every time he gets in a room with the press.
Smear campaign. I checked snooes the other day and it just seems like people woke up one day and decided to make shit up. JD Vance is a psycho so I don't know why people are wasting their time lying about him instead of telling the truth which is worse.
That's fair, I'll ~~fall for~~ believe that.
This, we’ve found the keys to saving his marriage
it's science
What a great song.
I think there’s a YouTube video out there but I don’t remember. If you’re wearing a headset supposedly you can use your mike to “encourage” the stripper and help increase the like meter. This was still back in the 360/PS3 so idk if the game registered what you said or just accepted noise. Anyways this kid sounded like 10-12 doesn’t realize that on GTA online his mike is going to everyone on the server while he’s at the stripclub….
If you get to cap rep with the dancers, they give you their phone numbers and you can call them to your apts where there's no bouncers. There's like half a dozen dancers you can get their numbers like that and you can remove the numbers from your favorites in the action menu.

When you get to thousands of hours, you just start collecting random things just for the lolz
["Hot Coffee"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Coffee_(minigame\))
Or maybe he’s fully aware that as she’s very religious/conservative and get jealous of simple tv shows, it’s not worth playing a game the heavily involves drugs, sex, crime, violent etc, around her because of how offended she’d be. 

Couples don’t have to like everything the other one likes. He has his hobbies and waited till she wasn’t around to indulge because he knows she doesn’t like it. 

How is any different to watching a film she wouldn’t like without her, or going to a football game when he knows she hates it? 

Would you make your partner eat food you know they hated just because you liked it? Or would you wait to enjoy it when you were with others that liked it, or on your own? 

Nothing weird from OP
I mean maybe he waited, because he knows she will flip out?,

The multiple times things is a bit weird I'll give you that but being jealous of good-looking actresses in a TV show or videogame characters... That's beyond a bit weird. Honestly that's borderline abusive imo.
“Damn, Caesar Julius”
I saw that the issue is that the Associated Press came out and said he did not fuck a couch, but then got a lot of complaints saying unless he was followed 24/7 they couldn’t know for sure he didn’t fuck a couch. So they retracted that. So now theres a history of the Associated Press saying he did not fuck a couch and then retracting the statement. So now the joke looks like they fact checked and he DID fuck a couch
I read it on the internet, so it must be true.
All the best people from both sides. They come up to me, these big, strong men, they say "Mr. President, thank you for picking a VP who fucks couches.", because they fucked couches with their homies too.
I read this in Trump’s voice. Nice work.
Search your feelings.
If it was a velvet couch sure.
Sectional* relations
I'd like him to deny he is a witch.
You don't know he didn't.  He didn't deny it.
The couch thing is funny, the reality is sad. That’s why.
That makes it even better.
ngl that had me thinking it was true again
Well I like how the AP said “we can’t definitively say he didn’t fuck a couch so…maybe?”

Also there are some great spin off tweets further perpetuating the whole thing. All I can think of is this from Big Mouth.

https://preview.redd.it/5w38xqcsbifd1.jpeg?width=854&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1fb5ea79d591c56d641d0c4b0dd9b2692542465

I bet he doesn't float.

TIFU by turning my cat into a iPad kid 

TIFU by turning my cat into an iPad kid

Recently, my TV broke, so I decided it would be cool to replace it with a projector. A few days ago, the projector arrived, and I spent a few hours setting it up and playing around with it. Then, I had the bright idea to put on one of those videos made for cats—the ones with insects, lasers, and mice—to see how my cat would react. She fucking loved it. Naturally, I let her watch for about an hour before turning it off for the night. She protested a little, but nothing too serious—at least, not compared to what was coming.

Over the next few days, I foolishly let her watch the projector a few more times, thinking it was hilarious how excited she was about her new “toy.” However, as time went on, she started to get a bit more vocal, growling and meowing at me to get my attention. I soon realized it was because of the ads. She was throwing tantrums because she couldn’t stand waiting. 

Now, she complains whenever I turn it off, or if she gets interrupted and bonus points, my YouTube now thinks I’m a cat.

TLDR; I let my cat watch videos on my new projector, and now she throws tantrums like an impatient iPad kid when I don’t let her binge insect videos.

This is by far the best TIFU post ever 
I have almost done the same, but with our 65 inch tv and a live stream of chickens on YouTube.
There is a creator on FB, EllieWatchesTV iirc, that her cat HAS to watch TV daily and has preferred shows.
tbh this is the funniest thing i think i’ve ever read
Awwww this reminds me of my beautiful cat that passed away at 22yo a couple of years ago. His favourite game was chasing fish around on my (his) iPad in his later years 😻

I did that with my 3 cats , after a while they do get bored with it.

He will paw the screen when he wants to watch his shows. He'll swipe my phone and even tried it on my PC monitor once, too. He's always watched TV with me but I regret showing him cattv (this is actually dogtv). He's nuts about it!
I had to buy my cat his own tablet to watch shows on because he would come and try to steal my phone before bed every night 🤷🏼‍♀️ he would sit menacingly on my chest or right off my stomach, and smack my phone. I thought he wanted even more cuddles so I’d spend time playing with him and giving him attention but he would fixate on my phone until I turned on a YT video of birds or squirrels for a few minutes before I shut the lights off
Cat TV does absolutely nothing for my guy. But recorded Python demonstrations for my grad class is his jam.
Man up & pay for no ads
> my YouTube now thinks I’m a cat.

Gotta love those ads!

Honestly, this is the most adorable TIFU ever...we are just slaves to our pets.
Careful...just this morning my kitty got so excited by the mice in the video that he jumped, went splat on the wall and fell on my plant shelf xD. He definitely associates the projector with Cat TV now, and assumes viewing position on the cat tree when I turn it on.
Oh there's a whole dedicated area of YouTube for this! Cat TV! Some guy called Paul Dinning uploads 8 hour videos of birds each week.

I too have been trained by a demanding ipad cat
One of my cats got obsessed with foxes at one point. There's a fox shelter on youtube, I'd let her watch videos on my tv while I was using the PC. At some point the video ended while I was in the bathroom and I came back to find her pawing at the tv and complaining that the video had ended. 

Later, she watched His Dark Materials with me, she liked the daemons. I once found her sitting under my tv, listening to a speech James MacAvoy was giving, she really liked his voice, I think. She'd also get very close to the tv when Ruth Wilson was on screen.

Which reminds me of my late cat who watched A Series of Unfortunate Events and I swear she would realize that a character was Neil Patrick Harris in disguise and she'd get very close to my laptop's screen and go really quiet and her eyes would get really wide. That one also used to watch Pepa the Pig with my neighbor's daughter, lmao.
My cat is partial to the same kind of entertainment and, like yours, she'd get really upset when ads interrupted her viewing.

I found a fix - I downloaded a bunch of videos, put them in a directory on a local machine running Plex Media Server, installed the Plex app on my Smart TV, and added them all to a playlist. 

Now I can just turn it on and tell Plex to shuffle the playlist. No ads (and since it's all local, I'm not burdening my Internet connection).
Technology is for the better. Why live a leisure life as a cat, when you can have a leisure life with technology as a cat. Be above those other felines, the humans serve you.
So, my bf found a cat exercise wheel on Facebook Marketplace and I was oh, why not.  I made the mistake of using treats to encourage them.  The younger cat doesn't like it (it moves) and accuses me of holding out on her with the treats.  But my senior cat?  As soon as she figured out treats were involved?  Now when she sees me coming she jumps on the wheel and runs a few steps and loudly meows for her treat. She loves that wheel.  She sleeps on it now.
I turn on cat TV for my girl about an hour to 20 minutes before meal times. This way she gets mental stimulation, but then she gets food and settles right down afterwards.

Something about cat behavior, engaging in mental hunting+food reward=happy cats?
This is adorable, but also: cat tax, please.

I just turned this one into an iPad baby, too. He LOVES “cat TV” and watching my Dame and I play the vidya. She plays dead cells and he chases the characters with his eyes. I play Skyrim and he like the arrows I shoot at (all things that aren’t me).

This is Stranger. We also have a fat grey cat but she don’t care quite as much

I feel your pain
It’s time to get YouTube premium for the cat
i use my projector only to watch anime, but my cat is very entertained anyway thanks to my mouse pointer moving on the wall
Your cat owns that projector now.
Oh, I’ve done the same. I have a room I use as an office and also houses my gaming PC in. Sometimes I’ll put Cat TV on in the evening. Now if I’m working she’ll come into the room and sit staring at the screen then start meowing if I have boring things like spreadsheets on the screen and not the birds she likes watching.
Join the club, my cat loves Birder King, Tiny Kittens and British period pieces. I gave up in 2020.
Oh get this to work for you!

If you need to trim her nails or do flea treatments or anything, screen time becomes both the distraction and the reward. 

Set up a routine, screen time is not all of the time, it is specifically X time (unless you’re getting your nails trimmed). Bonus points if X time is when you need to do something you may forget, the cat will remind you - taking daily pills is a classic. My house has afternoon churu time, and there’s nothing like being pointedly stared at by three cats to be aware that it’s almost 3 pm.
If anybody hasn't mentioned it yet, you should really use a physical toy to play with her during/after this. They can get frustrated because their predator drive wants them to  actually catch something after they chase it. Cat videos and laser pointers can be fun toys that really get the cat going, but please at least give a little bit of time with a wand toy or stringy something or whatever you've got.

Omg I did the same thing to my baby girl thinking it would be cute! Now she’s like an addict! Doesn’t matter if it’s my tv, computer, iPad, or phone- she wants screen time! She even gets up in bed and just stares at me if I’m scrolling on my phone. She goes all around the screen looking for the lizard, or fish, or chipmunk, or bird. She’s crazy for it and I’m not sure how to break her habit. Oh well, at least I know she’ll be quiet at a restaurant 😹❤️
She just like me frfr
!!!!! I started playing Our Planet documentaries on my giant TV for myself and bonus my cats like it...but it gets my eldest cat all hyped up and crazy and now he expects TV time every morning (he always gets what he wants)
Awwww this is too cute and funny!

I made the mistake of trying cat tv too, but it didn’t last as long.  I would hear a huge THUD every time I put it on.  Took me a couple of times to realize she was vaulting at the TV to get the birds.  🤦🏾‍♀️🤣
I made the mistake of putting CatTV on for my cats. My living room TV has now been nothing but CatTV videos for a month straight. My neighbors probably think I have tons of birds and never sleep
This is amazing. I did the same thing except with a tablet and the friskies fish game. TYFU and I understand your pain.
My cat really enjoys hamster squid games on YouTube for his iPad baby time.
This is honestly really cute and funny
Our cats watch TV with us. Just sitting on the sofa, or on our laps.
Love this! My cat loves watching videos of squirrels and birds. I like Patsy's Garden, she has a few that are 10 hours long with no ads, and he goes nuts for them.
Firefox + unlock origin = no ads :)
This is the most wholesome TIFU I’ve ever come across, I can’t imagine my cat being entertained by anything virtual lol
We did this for one of our cats when she was fading away from cancer

The birds chirping helped calm her down
When my cat got sick I used to put on the long cat videos for her overnight (she had to stay put). This is was my final straw before I caved and bought YouTube premium 🫡
My mom came to my house the other day and I asked her if she wanted me to turn the tv on for her. My cat, who assumed I was talking to her, came running and sat in front of the tv, so my mom just let her have it.
Yeah, about a month ago we discovered “Birder King” for our cats. They get up to an hour/day, usually in 2 half-hour sessions. Before I leave in the morning, one in particular will yell at me. I don’t turn it on immediately though. But I set the sleep timer on the tv. 

The only thing is, apparently it doesn’t matter what’s on the tv now, one cat is enamored. Whatever we watch, he often will too, but not for long stretches - he has a short attention span. My only explanation: he’s orange.
does your cat have a good spot to watch out the window? my cat loves to sit on the window and watch people pass down below, or especially if there are birds. 

btw fun fact, when my mom was trying to learn to recognise bird sounds on her phone, when the cat heard the birds it would come up to my mom and start biting her forearm. we have no idea why but every time she plays bird sounds the cat starts biting her. (not strong or anything, not to blood, but usually the cat very rarely bites)
You now have her captivated by videos, so you can train her to do things for you and use it as a reward.
 Time to train your cat and post videos about it, she could be the new keyboard cat!
LMAOOOO
LOL!! My cat is the same way. Whenever I clean or do homework I put on cat TV for her and she throws fits when I don’t put it on bc she thinks it’s a toy 😭
Hey it's illegal to not post cat pictures if it's a cat story!

I can imagine she is a very very cute cat
my cat attacks the screen, he thinks the birds & mice are real, I got him a leash and take him outside now to attack real birds and mice.  Now I have 2 problems.
Bold of you to assume you can turn a cat into anything 😆.   Your cat used you.  Not sure how.  Also, cat tax!!
I did this to my cats except they have their own dedicated computer in the living room playing those vids 24/7. They only grew bored of it after like 4-5 months of near constant playing with it. However if I turn it off, they will sit next to it and complain, or paw at the screen until it’s back on. Play with it for 5 minutes then continue to ignore it. 

I suspect they do still play with it at night sometimes. 

The computer is my grandmas old all in one hp computer. It’s an old early 2010s touch screen and has a thick sheet of plexiglass over the actual monitor, so they can’t catch or break anything while clawing.

Ps; I have a premium YouTube account and my cats love that they get no ads. Just saying.
At least your cats are mostly all into nature videos—mine just wants to watch people playing Plants Versus Zombies 😂

Gonna have to buy youtube premium to get rid of the ads, obviously
These videos led me to getting the cats their own ipad.
This is a good laugh, but it also seriously scares me for children because that's exactly what happens to them without enough moderation.
I put cat tv on sometimes while I read so the cat can be entertained too, but I always end up getting distracted and watching cat tv myself while the cat is off doing fuck knows what elsewhere
That's adorable.
My cat has an obsession with slapping the ass of Obi-Wan Kenobi from the PS1 Star Wars Phantom Menace game which I play on my projector when I can’t sleep.
Cats don't have owners they have staff.
Get uBlock origin installed, then neither you or your furry toddler Will see any commercials :)
This is hilarious. Good job, cat parent. 😂👍💖
My cat really likes to watch tv/computer screens. When she's sitting with me I'll play games like BTD6 or Rimworld, something with lots of little things moving around she can watch. If I watch a nature documentary I try to call her over, because she'll sit there for like 30 minutes watching the animals.

Also, buy a birdfeeder.
Looks like you need to get your cat YouTube premium lol

Seriously though, your cat sounds super fun. Maybe you should start your own YouTube channel of your cat going nuts for YouTube?
Get that kid a YT premium subscription now please
I watch movies and TV with my dogs.  My rottweiler particularly like cartoon animals.  She doesn't much like the dragons in House Of The Dragon.
The solution is of course to buy a 2nd projector for your own use. And thats an 80 bucks toy that will never be broken by the cat
Now I wanna get my cat into tv too xD
Hey, is your cat a single cat? If so, I strongly recommend getting a second one. They're social creatures and are easily bored, and most are high-energy. I'm willing to bet your cat would much prefer the companionship and stimulation it would get from having another cat to play with.
>However, as time went on, she started to get a bit more vocal, growling and meowing at me to get my attention. I soon realized it was because of the ads. She was throwing tantrums because she couldn’t stand waiting.

Relatable.
I used to have a void cat that loved these vids. She was a strya that would jump  from my bedroom window and wake me up for TV shows and rubs before going her merry way.  Then one day she never came back.
One of my cats got really into a Simon’s Cat video we were watching the other day, then turned and strutted away the moment the credits rolled. She knew it had finished!
Make sure you install uBlock origin extension so more ads for your iPad child/cat
My dog loved watching basketball on tv. I think he liked watching people in colorful jerseys run around. If it’s a game with few fouls, he’d be so engaged. If it’s a game with a lot of stoppage and commercials, he’d just stop watching.
Lol, my German Shepherd mutt is the same way! She gets very excited when there's a dog (or any animal, really) on TV. Sometimes I put Crufts on for her.
Hahaha, just get YouTube Premium to get rid of ads. Cheaper than pretty much any other cat subscription service in existence.
my cat attacks the screen, he thinks the birds & mice are real, I got him a leash and take him outside now to attack real birds and mice.  Now I have 2 problems.
This behavior was sometimes also seen in pets when their owners would play chase the laser red dot with them. They would become overly obsessive on trying to locate the laser dot, even when the owner wasn't playing with them. 

https://wagwellpet.com/blogs/wagwell-blog/what-is-laser-pointer-syndrome
Cats yearn for the mines too.
mandatory cat tax please!
So you'll pay for your own streaming subscriptions but won't pay for YouTube Premium for your cat? Wow, why do you hate your cat?!   
/s
Just use an ad blocker. Do it for your cat.
Rats quail and fish do this too yep FML
You are literally describing my situation right now. She complains to me if I put on a rerun or if she's not in the mood to watch mice. If the TV is off and she wants to watch, she will sit by me and trill over and over until I cave. We've created cute little iPad monsters lol
my partner and i have the same problem with one of our cats lol. he needs his birder king!!! the other one doesn’t care, she watches real birds at the window
This is the cutest TIFU ever. I’m sorry it’s causing you distress.
I made the mistake of playing with one of my cats right before I went to work. Now, since he isn't great at telling time, he will meow and meow when he feels like I should be up and getting ready for work. Really doesn't help on the weekends.
Hilarious.

I don't support actual iPad kids, since it fucks them up later in life. But cats don't have a "later in life," they will always be provided for by humans and suffer no negative effects throughout their life, like a child would.
Pay for premium.  Your cat deserves it!
I turned a cat I was living with into an ipad kid by playing league of legends. She liked sitting on my lap and then that turned into her standing on my lap with her feet on the keyboard with her head in front of mine. I had to start closing the door when I wanted to play games
If you keep it up she will lose interest in her actual toys and her mental health will suffer. I’m not even joking, she’s not getting the satisfaction of “catching” anything so she is endlessly working at a goal she will never get. It’s bad for cats (also why laser pointers aren’t great if that’s the only toy) since she will get frustrated easier and lose interest in human interaction. Stop showing it to her, in a week or two she’ll forget
My cat also loves the projector. He likes watching one piece and watching me play video games!
I have an iPad bird. Whenever I am busy studying or gone for the day I make sure the TV is on for him so he has some voices and doesn't feel lonely. Now he screams at me and my wife when the TV isn't on or we interrupt his favorite shows for us to watch a movie.
We lovingly call our dog “our little iPad baby” because she LOVES watching TV. Kurt Russell is her favorite actor and The Thing is her favorite movie, but she’ll watch and seemingly enjoy almost anything. She has a clear preference for tense sci-fi or horror, but she also really loves Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood and Adventure Time. It’s made movie nights at the house even more fun, because it’s hilarious to watch her reactions.
Literally laughing my ass loose. And I'm a cat dad to 12 or so goofy cats including one who is a kinda skinny tux with a half stubbed tail. Who is the goofiest lil fucker ever. 
Did this with my cat, had the cat tree set next to the projector screen so she could climb and swipe at it. Her fav was a 10hr vid of squirrels and chipmunks.
I just played one with fish swimming for 2 of mine and they do not care...the only thing that gets a reaction from them is videos of other cats meowing

Same. She's wired. Every time I sit down and turn on my computer, she jumps on my lap and waits. Luckily she doesn't complain if I dont turn it on, otherwise I would never get any homework done 😭
we need a video of this happening
I THOUGHT THE IMAGE OF THAT ONE VIDEO WAS A JOKE WHAT?!?!?!?! THIS IS FREAKING REAL?!?!

Have you tried sending YouTube this?
I can’t even imagine, I’m literally dying laughing.
glad my misery makes for a good story 😂
Agreed! 🤣🤣🤣 can we watch your cat watching cat TV now?
Somebody get OP some gold in here!

....oh.
I also let her watch this classic, https://youtu.be/el4CQj-TCbA?si=R8YIonYdSzdLzYqL , I set up a chair because I have no willpower and I want her to be happy. I have been officially trained
that is so cute omg
I appreciate your username
Amazing, I’ll check it out! My cat’s not too sophisticated, she just wants to watch flies and mosquitoes on a blank background. she also really fucks with the cockroaches. Why are there cockroaches? Fuck if I know
We had a cat that was completely obsessed with the children's TV Show Jakers.  So much so he would always be sat on the coffee table facing the TV and chirruping away about 5 minutes before it was on.  Didn't matter what my husband was watching at the time he would always put Jakers on for the damn cat.
Im slowly coming to the realisation that I bought a £90 cat toy and I’m going to have ants projected onto my wall forever.
“no, this is very serious. we need youtube premium so there aren’t adds interrupting me.” -OPs cat, probably

my cat loved the same video.
That’s my cat’s favorite video too! …on the small screen. On my tv she loves string string thing and she gets very huffy when I want to watch things that are not her string video.
Mine have a little fire tablet I'll put bird videos on during the winter and stick on the wall the cat tree is infront of. One of them loves it, and will sit and watch for a long time. The other only occasionally seems to notice it
You saved your own life - the cat would have smothered you in your sleep otherwise.
Aww, he’s your study accountabilibuddy. That’s precious.
So that’s what she’s been screaming at me
Why not just install an ad blocker?
Mine love Birder King. My eldest perks up when he hears the little song at the start of each video and comes running
Thank you for sharing this, it made me smile so much my cheeks hurt LOL
Aww, it’s great that she’s getting her exercise!
Oh sure thing, this is her waiting for her cat tv intro to finish so she can get to business

Show us the grey cat?? You can’t just say there’s a cat and not show it??
Takes after me for sure 🫠
Actual LOL, I nearly woke up my Mum ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
I did post a few in the thread!
The cat is probably off reading your book
I'm sorry :(  I'm glad that she had you to care for & love her!
Yes, and it may be funny for some but the cat is under stress. Not a haha situation imo
What video is that? Haha - Yeah my cat is the og iPad cat 🥲
Its a real and relatable story! Since your cat is already acting like a toddler with too much screen time, perhaps you can solve it like she's a human child too. When I had to start putting major restrictions on my tiny humans tablet use, I'd always offer a replacement activity like playdoh. I think in the case of a cat, drugs might perhaps be the best route 😅. Time to score a big old bag of cat nip while you get to watch your shows lol
It's not necessarily a bad thing. You have the opportunity to sit with your cat and partake in her interests. And if you do it right by getting her into a familiar position and then putting on her show, you might be able to introduce her to different shows. Maybe an animal show from the BBC. I've seen other people do it with their animals online. It's always an accident.
100 bad days makes 100 good stories
For me, the best part is that YouTube now thinks you are a cat ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
You need to update everyone in a week so that it can be shared in r/bestofredditorupdates! You also should have your cat seek advice on r/amithecloaca
To get rid of the ads just use Opera browser! Free and no ads on YouTube when you use it, plus you can select any browser inside of it such as Google/duck duck go etc and sync accounts. Sorry but I too hate YouTube ads like your cat does, and since using it again it's been fantastic to not put up with them or pay for premium!
What happened to the medals or can you only give so many before you can't give anymore... 

Is golden shit good?
My cat took her first screenshot watching that.
That is a really great clip, though. It always makes me happy.
Have you considered getting a mini projector and letting her watch in another room?
Your story made me laugh and reminded me of when my cat was still a kitten and I would let her catch flies on my phone and she would try to catch the ball whenever I watched football. I just showed her this video and she walked out on me :( I guess we can never have it all. Either way too interested or not at all interested…. 🥲
Mine just brings all of those inside! I found half a cicada on my kitchen floor just 2 hours ago.
Oh no. Why would you go there with the cockroaches. Surely there are prettier bug videos… lady bugs or dragonflies or something!
you can always say your cat has an expensive taste in wall deco 💀
[removed]
I am surprised. I use an iPad to show my cats those videos but they always grow out of them at 4-6 months old and aren’t interested anymore. I assumed all cats grew out of them. Let her enjoy it, I say. Stimulating for her.
Could always replace the wall with a massive ant farm. The kind with the clear walls
get the cat a a cheap miniprojector and project her fun onto a different wall?
🤣
How adorable! It goes for so long too, it’s perfect! 🥰
Oh, he’s still made attempts. Especially when he had to go on a diet and I had a timer on his feeder. I truly feared for my life the first few days.
First get a bunch of content of her being mad at it. Document it all on TikTok and IG then set up a twitch live stream for her. She will be paying the YouTube bill at the very least in no time! 😂
uBlock Origin browser extension
It's likely android TV, and there are alternative apps, but you can't just add a browser extension.

Oh shore sorry me, this is Seesaw (but it is spelled like Cieorocieia from that show about games of thrones)
I forgot catnip existed when I read drugs so my mind just jumped to “I’m meant to roofie her- wait. what.”
LOL give her catnip and let her enjoy the projector while high. She'll be more  addicted like a guy doing weed + pr0n for the first time.
And I thought my Russian Blue was funny watching NASCAR and chasing the cars across my big screen, usually right before a big crash. So all you Nascar fans can probably blame my cat for a lot of "the big ones".
My cat gives exactly zero fucks about catnip
OP really needs to be kind to the poor kitty. It’s not kitty’s fault she addicted - OP introduced it! OP went and got a nice kitty, she never had any trouble before this, OP got her hooked. OP needs to take responsibility, support kitty in her time of agony. Perhaps couples counseling could help. 

Kitty could talk about how her addiction makes her feel free, but when OP stops her supply, she’s withdrawing. OP pulled a Machiavellian play here, make sure she’s hooked, then control her use. 

OP is more to blame than Kitty. Kitty needs support and recovery.
I had a dog that loved watching showjumping. Dressage, not so much.
My cat loves Scooby Doo
Picture in picture, yo. Fun for the whole family
You’ve got yourself a worthy hunter there, hahaha. She’s brought me two baby mice irl because she’s ferocious, I just keep telling myself that shes in her karate kid era and ultimately she’ll be the best little predator ever.
I got my kaiju fan of a cat a godzilla stained glass decoration,  hung it in the window,  and when she doesn't like a movie she stares at it.
You can upgrade with Cat6 cable.
Finally contributing? Omg, I’m living the dream
If reckon there would be a good 97% chance of this working and OP raking in the coin
Revanced as well
Why.not?
No worries, here’s a close up because her face is too cute

Oh my god that made me full on cackle laugh 😅😅
some good ol' warm milk and valium could help too 😂
It is both hilarious and concerning that your first thought was “let me go roofie my cat.”
That would make for a good tifu follow-up post
Hold up...are you roofieing your children?
I wonder if thats one of the sedatives that makes cats super hyper?
I love this post and your comments op! Would love a video of her watching cat TV!
Wait till you find out about cat nip tea..
So wholesome!
And setup a stream of the cat watching the projector so everyone can enjoy.
Her mommy is better. Took down a rats nest under our deck the first week she was allowed outside (former stray I found pregnant). She left at least one body right under my spot on the deck because I got to smell it for 2 weeks. I found her with a lizard last night. Though Flynnderella caught a snake last night. My daughter about had s cow. I guessed that was what she caught when I saw her.  I'm kind of glad because it's Rattlesnake birthing season so I'm perfectly good with them catching reptiles and insects.
If it works, update us. Put her profile on this post!!!😂
Maybe you can find the videos on YouTube Kids. No ads allowed on there!
I mean I would watch it
![gif](giphy|hM9zK1qvsrwek)
Because the common browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Firefox) aren't available for Android TV in the first place as their hardware requirements are to high for most TVs. There are a few no-name and barebones browsers, but to meet the available hardware they lack many common features like addons or built-in ad-blocking
So cute 😻 I wouldn't be able to say no to that face. She deserves all the insect videos that she wants!

Kevin Flynn + Cinderella? Good one!!
How does that make sense when you have phones which are also on Android, and yet have a far smaller form factor and being battery reliant?

I'm sure it's a manufacturing standard, I'm just unclear as to why that is.
No idea what's in that stuff, but child me thought it looked like the most delicious thing on the planet
Flynn from Tangled. Our cats have Disney names. Mom is Leia. We thought he was a boy until I took him to his 6 week check up. So we needed a girl name besides Rapunzel and my daughter combined it with Cinderella.
Because many smart TVs use way cheaper hardware than most phones. A dedicated client device like the NVIDIA Shield TV could handle a browser without problem, but the cheap Chinese TV from last Black Friday Special at Walmart can't.
Yeeees, it sounds so nice
Haha cool. FYI, Flynn from Tron is also a Disney movie :)
That's awesome! We started with Nemo and Simba. Added Marshmallow later. After they all passed I waited until the cat distribution system found me a cat. A pregnant baby followed me around at an apartment complex I worked at. I kidnapped her after I checked that she was a stray.

TIFU Random Flee Market Item Turns out to be Radioactive 
I bought this random item in a flee market in Berlin because it looked cool and it was cheap. It’s been in my wardrobe ever since until I took it out yesterday to take photos of it because I found out about the r/whatisthisthing page. Lots of people came back with different answers but a few people said it looked like it was radioactive and that I should go to my local fire station to check it. This morning I phoned the non-emergency fire brigade number and explained the situation. Two minutes later 3 fire engines arrive to test the object which was in fact radioactive. They then called for backup and 3 ambulances 3 police cars and a counterterrorism CBRN bomb disposal unit arrive. They evacuate all the flats in the building and after 4 hours they finally remove the object. It turned out to be Thorium (I’m not sure about the isotope number or radiation levels)

Here is the link to the original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/s/ENI2mYpVu2

TL;DR Object I bought in a flee market is identified as radioactive thanks to Reddit and fire brigade
[deleted]
You didn't FU you provided valuable low-stakes training for multiple emergency services. Good firefighting crews train/plan for so many scenarios, radioactive threats being one. This just happened to be the perfect thing to test with more real-world variables than any training/planning could account for, you're out some money but now have an awesome life story.
[deleted]
I just saw your post and immediately clicked your profile for an update. OP delivered.
Did they have any health advice for you based on what they found?

I wonder how that thing ended up in a flea market in the 1st place.
![gif](giphy|7p7z3vxucrNCw)

OP hiding from his neighbors after the four hour evacuation 😝😝😝
Oh...crap. I read the header, and assumed it was glow-in-the-dark glass you had gotten a trinket of. This is quite a different beast 😬
Thorium is relatively safe as long as it isn't ingested. The particles it emits can be stopped by a sheet of paper.
Nice try House MD patient that died in season 3
I’m a trained Radiation Protection Supervisor so  have some useful information on this (although others will have far more knowledge than me). It’s almost certainly almost entirely Th-232. This has a half life that is longer than the age of the Universe so its activity will be extremely low. It will off gas Radon-220, which is an alpha emitter that you don’t really want to breathe but it will produce this at an extremely low rate. Welding rods and the mantles for gas lanterns are both typically thoriated and pose no significant risk. Unless you’ve been licking it or inhaling powdered thorium from it I think any dose is likely to be marginal compared to background exposure. If you’ve kept it in a cupboard in its shielding for most of the time I’m pretty certain you have nothing to worry about.
Try to say something clever when the guy from CNN calls, OP.
[deleted]
😬 How long have our had it? Do you know if it was long enough/radioactive enough to be a threat to your health?
I saw that post, my hunch was a radioactive sample. Enough had commented that so I didn't bother. Hopefully your ok
Imagine if he kept thinking it was a flint and was grinding that thing against knives all day long....  Glad it worked out OK and it was identified so quickly!
Honestly you were never in danger if you didn't grind it and inhale it.  Fun fact: when I was in university and in the Nuclear Engineering program before switching to Mechanical, they used to use Coleman lantern mantles as Geiger counter check sources (likely what this device was for).  Why do they work?  Because they contain Thorium.  

They are just hanging on a hook at your local outdoor store.
how much did you pay for it?
Holy shit OP! I was hoping you posted a follow-up! I hope you're ok!
From flee market to flee the apartment.
Once upon a time, I locked my keys in my car.  There was a fire station across the street, so I walked over and asked if there was a coat hanger I could buy off them.  They said they have a tool that would work just to wait by my car someone will be over.

Five minutes later, they sent over a pickup truck, a pumper truck, and a ladder truck across the street.  A guy steps out of the pickup with a little inflatable thing he stick into the door frame, cracking open the frame so they can hit the unlock button with a rod.  Meanwhile, there was a little traffic jam forming on the street with drivers rubbernecking to see where the fire was, right in front of the fire station.

The excuse for why they sent over all the trucks was because in case there's a fire, then they can respond to it directly.  The real reason they sent over all the trucks was to juice the stats for the number of emergencies they responded to.
Holy shit, an orphan source incident in the wild and in real time- I thought we were getting to the end of these. I hope everyone is okay!
Call the boys in the lead pajamas, this isn't lupus
Op will very likely be okay. HOWEVER OP, if you develop any rashes, redness, or randomly peeling skin near or on your hands IMMEDIATELY alert a doctor and let them know you came into contact with radioactive Thorium. Again, it is very likely nothing happens as long as you didn't do something dumb with it. Also not trying to scare you, just exercise caution as they didn't tell you how "hot" the sample was.
OP, you're lucky it's Thorium. Industrial radioactive sources are common, with multitude of uses, and are generally very safe - if basic safety observed. They are usually tiny (like yours), though kept locked in bulky metal casings. But lose one, and such a thing can happen: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kramatorsk\_radiological\_accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kramatorsk_radiological_accident)

TL;DR industrial source (of Cesium-137, most common) is lost in a quarry, stone used for a block of flats building, takes 3 leukemia deaths and 9 years to find out the reason.
Thorium isn't that dangerous unless you inhale it. It's very tame as radioactive elements go, and fairly low in toxicity as heavy metals go. This is all assuming it's regular old Th-232. There is a slim chance it could be enriched in something else, presumably for the medical field, but in those quantities the chance is probably negligible. As an element collector, consider me jealous lol. That's a really neat find.
I’m sitting at a concert, waiting for the headliner to come on, kinda bored by the warm up act, and this  story is so fucking typical for today, Friday the 13th. Love Reddit!
Maybe next time don’t buy stuff from a flee market and instead stick to flea markets. Should be a lot safer.
Thank you for the update OP! Can you post another one in a few weeks to confirm you are still alive?
How long did you have this in your wardrobe and how many extra limbs do you have now?
Crazy enough, this was the basis of an episode of House MD. S2E5. The patient had a necklace with something he found at the dump. Of course House tried 50min worth of tests/procedures that didn't work, then the Aha moment. The damn thing was radioactive! Gaaaa. But they didn't need 3 firetrucks and all that stuff. How insane that OP was actually living it. Scary. Maybe a dosimeter isn't a bad thing to have around, lol.
“Flee” Market is an appropriate misspelling.
Freaking heck, it really was Thorium-229. I saw your post and immediately thought, "this looks like a 'Drop and Run' container"

OP I hope you and everyone else is ok. The authorities need to trace this back as accurately as possible
Typical reddit. 

“I bought something that’s radioactive. Hazmat is here to deal with it.”

“Bro, you misspelled a word.”

🙄
thankfully thorium is pretty chill
oh jeez I saw that post this morning 👀 what an update to come across a few hours later.
Huh. I saw the original post when you put it up and would have sworn it was a flint stick, though it was odd that it was completely encased. There was a House episode similar to this, although the radioactive object came from a dump or recycling plant, can't remember which, and the guy gave it to his teenage son as a gift, thinking it looked cool and not knowing it was radioactive. Was just supposed to be a little charm thing. Turned out much worse for the kid than you. You got a pretty interesting story out of it though. I would have still wanted to keep it.

Might be worth notifying where you got it from just in case. I doubt it, but they may have more or other radioactive things that came in the same donation/sale.
Thorium is stupidly safe. I collect pressure gas lanterns (post of collection in my profile). Thorium WAS used at one point to dose the mantles that create the light. It's yttrium now because the manufacturing process can be dangerous for the workers long term, but you can still find thorium dosed mantles. There's a chance one of my mantles has thorium in it, as some of them are old enough, but I don't have a detector to test them.

That being said, the thorium mantles make tissue paper look as strong as steel in comparison, as it is an ash latace, so when it breaks down, it becomes a powdery dust kinda like flower Accidentally breathing that powdery dust is not a good idea, so dispose of them carefully. 

The safety is mainly about understanding the material you are handling and how to do it safely. For thorium ash, when you replace a manfle, remove the old one (or ones) with the mantel downwind (wind to your back) of you so the dust can't blow back at you.

It decays (very slowly) into extreely small amounts of radium, which decays so fast it can't become concentrated enough to be dangerous (as I understand it)

Technology connections has made a cool video on these devices and demonstrates a thoriated mantle being a little radioactive and that it becomes a powder when broken down.

Well your first mistake was going to a flee market instead of a flea market. I mean, they were trying to warn you. It's right there in the name.
There's an amazing book \*​Radioactive Boy Scout\* about a teenager who nearly succeeded in creating a nuclear reactor using scavenged items. He used a Geiger counter and went to antique shops to find what he wanted.

  
His dad was crazy clueless.
He almost ended up as a Dr house episode
I suppose it actually was a 'flee market'!
*FLEA. It’s FLEA. Not flee
Flea. It's a "flea market".
Oh boy… I wonder if the flea market seller guy is gonna get a visit from some agents in black suits
This was also an episode of House M.D. Who remembers the lil trinket from the junkyard he kept on his keychain.
Shit. I saw your earlier post, knew what it was, got distracted, and forgot to followup.

Probably a good washing of your body, clothes, etc would be in order ASAP.
Thorium’s not terribly dangerous, but it’s disquieting when stuff like this turns up at flea markets, presumably being sold by someone who themselves has no idea what it is. 

There have been some really awful accidents involving radiation sources salvaged from hospital equipment.

Nuclear physicist here. Wow, OP, this is certainly a find! Do get checked out - Thorium-229 (its presence indicated by the label), decays by alpha-decay into Radon-225. Alpha particles are practically harmless, but Radon is a very toxic substance to inhale. This isotope of Radon has a short half-life, thankfully, but it's worth checking out your lungs, just in case.

The decay chain continues from this, with consectuive decays continuing after this (beta-minus and alpha decay, of which the decay products aren't that harmful), but again, it's worth getting checked out, just in case.
WHY The F WOULD WE SEND 3 FIRE TRUCKS IN THIS SITUATION?! 

Seriously, I don't see how that could possibly help
Definitely seek medical advice soon. Thorium isn't as dangerous as some other radioactive elements, but it's better to be safe than sorry when dealing with any kind of radioactive material.

How long did you have the rod before you made the post? Thorium has very weak radiation, but it can still be dangerous over long periods of time.

This was a wild ride.  Thank you OP for the update!  Good luck!
Wow, that was an unexpected follow up.
Glad you are safe
Speaking of Germany and radiation hiding in plain site: the Rosenthaler Platz subway station has bright orange uranium tiles on its walls to this day. Saw a video of someone checking it with a Geiger counter once.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenthaler_Platz_(Berlin_U-Bahn)
So this has reminded me of a wild story I heard a few years ago.  Essentially 3 villagers in the country of Georgia were out in the woods and there was a lot of snow on the ground.  They found a few canisters that were warm to the touch and had no snow around them.  They decided to make use of the heat they were giving off and made camp and used them as heat sources.  Literally sitting right next to them.  The canisters were - you guessed it - highly radioactive.  They all got very sick and I believe one died.

There are definitely more details if you look up:

Lia radiological accident on the web.
The response reminds me of something that happened when I was in college.  Someone in a chemistry lab accidentally spilled a jar of radioactive sulpher (or maybe phosphorus), which was a mild beta decay.  The spill was limited, cleaned up, and the table covered with a thick sheet to block any residue that might not have been gotten, and then they called campus security to report it (as they should).  And that should have been the end of it, except...

The security officer in charge of hazmat response was off that day, and their substitute heard "radioactive spill" and hit the panic button.  I counted a minimum of 20 Philadelphia Fire Department vehicles responding including 2 hazmat units and 5 battalion chiefs, and it took something like 2 hours for them to basically go, "Yeah, there's nothing for us to do here, the initial response was correct."  But it sure was amusing to watch from across the street (and IIRC it got me out of a class or two :D).
I would definitely flee that radioactive flea market
Thorium is safe ish, until the dust gets inside you, it isn’t the best as it gives of radon gas but it could be a lot worse, if the people who came thought you where ok then your ok

Also if you ever see some positive ion stuff online or energy emitters, anything in the same vein 7/10 times it has thorium inside the other 3 is just fraud (which is some how better) and is just some random plastic or cloth
^^232 Thorium's an alpha emitter, not great for you if you ingest it or stare at it too long, but otherwise you'll probably be okay. ^^232 Thorium has a half-life older than the Universe, so you're not gonna wait it out. It decays into ^^224 Radium, and is a source of Radon in houses. 

In other words, as long as you didn't lick it, look at it too long, or swallow any, you're probably not going to suffer any long-term effects beyond what you're already exposed to just being alive.

The response seems to suggest there might have been more to it than simple thorium, though, and that has me *very* curious.

"Flee" market.  LOL
There are some absolute horror stories of orphan sources from South America killing families and potentially infecting an entire town. 

You got lucky OP, orphan sources are dangerous
Holy shit, I read this post last night before bed and was wondering what happened. Next go get a check-up at your local doctor. I know thorium is dangerous just unsure of how short your exposure time was so in general would be a good idea.

I just read the first post and was checking for an update. That is absolutely wild.
Wow can't believe something went full circle again on Reddit 😂
I saw your post, totally thought it was a fire starter myself. This is wild!
Chills up my spine when I read the title lol


"Hope he didn't buy a discount dmon core"

Monday morning QB-ing ...you should have fled that "flee market" immediately.
This was not the update I was expecting but it's highly entertaining, sorry it didn't work out for you tho
Legit thought this was a joke follow up post. Glad you followed through with the advice in that thread OP; I hope there’s no lasting health concerns around this
Did you get your money back? /s
I coincidentally just took my rad worker refresher test yesterday.

Were they able to provide you with how much and what type of radiation it was putting off? How long were you within ~30ft of it?
I'm now picturing a market with everyone running away from it.
Unfortunately Hollywood and pop culture has caused for sole major misconceptions and undue fear of anything radioactive. Thorium is not dangerous so long as you don’t eat it or break it up and inhale the dust. You can handle it with your hand. You won’t get burns or anything. If you were to stand out side shirtless in the sun in an attempt to soak up as much ionizing radiation that would be  equivalent to a lethal dose of radiation from holding a piece of thorium, you would die from sun exposure long before you had any sort of increased risk of cancer. Plenty of old plates and floor tiles used to be more radioactive than that. The radiation is negligible. The earth itself is subject to all sorts of ionizing radiation all the time. From rocks and minerals to the sun. So as such humans have evolved to be able to absorb SOME radiation and process it. There is a certain dosage that people can safely be exposed to each year, and it is fairly high.
That one guy that loves radiation on the fire brigade. 

"Finally I get to use the radiation box"
Lol your other post showed up 3 above this one on my feed. I had just thought "well if I ever see one of those I guess I'd look it up instead of striking it to see if it's a ferro rod". In other words, you may have prevented someone else from making the same mistake in the future, so at least there is that.
You're pretty lucky that it was just thorium. Might have bumped up your change of getting lung cancer a bit, but you'll probably be fine. If that thing had been a strong gamma emitter, you could have kissed your hands goodbye.
OP - even though this absolutely was not your fault (how could you have known?) and you definitely did the right thing, you should probably bake some cookies for your neighbors as an apology. They’re probably pretty annoyed and might blame you for screwing up their day (understandable but not entirely fair).
If you weren't on the Russian aaassassin watch list in Germany you definitely are now
There’s an episode of House MD with nearly this exact plot. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with the patient until they went to the house with a Geiger counter and found a piece of metal the guy found at a flea/flee market
Wow this is crazy! I’m happy you gave us an update

Lucky this didn’t happen https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goiânia_accident
Wow what a crazy turn of events! I saw the original post and definitely thought it was a fire starter lol glad OP didn't scratch it for sparks 😅
I think all the effort was because they were not sure what it was. Thorium decays very slowly and short term exposure to a solid block should not do anything.
Holy shit. I saw that original post!
This makes me think of the House episode where the junk yard dad gave his son a mining test rod that was extremely radioactive. >!did not end well for the son, so hoping you're more lucky! !<
Holy crap! I remember you posting that! Are you and yours OK? Did you go get checked out?
Unlucky. I would have thought there would be a 50/50 chance of it giving you superpowers.
Ayyyy, thought so! Glad you looked into it
99.98% sure the isotope number is 232. Other isotopes of Thorium are extremely rare.

I hope you're doing your full health checkups more regularly than an average person. And I certainly hope you didn't try to break the black rod off by holding onto it.

How did this end up in a flea market though?
Jesus christ, they called out that many engines for a 3 inch rod? It's Thorium, not red kryptonite. Did they tell you how radioactive it was?
It’s flea market
Did they take you to the hospital for tests?
Good thing it was thorium, it is weakly radioactive. It's also common in the environment in small quantities.
Is it just me or is this TIFU ongoing? I read your original post and you seem to have manipulated this thing quite a bit. Have you been checked by medical?
No one will ever think you are boring again.
Yeah, that looks like it’s a container that is used for transporting nuclear materials, such as radioisotopes used for nuclear medicine (PET/CT, etc) scans.
So this is that house episode lol
The good news- thorium is not very dangerous. It is very mildly radioactive, and the type of radiation it gives off does not travel far (only a few inches of air is sufficient shielding to greatly attenuate alpha radiation). The biggest risk with thorium is accidental ingestion or breathing thorium particles, neither of which seems likely in this case.
This is an episode of House. Dad gives a trinket to his son and it turns out to be radioactive. Ends poorly. Hopefully you have a better outcome. 
The replies to this topic are hilarious. 

>u/SarpedonWasFramed: Not saying you're wrong, but who would store something radioactive without a warning label?

Oh that sweet summer child. Somebody hasn't read many books on 20th century physics research.
Luckily it was something low level and not cobalt 60 or the like
I’ll be honest, I saw that thing and my first thought was an alarmed ORPHAN SOURCE ORPHAN SOURCE  
Then I looked in the comments and everyone else’s response appeared to be an alarmed ORPHAN SOURCE ORPHAN SOURCE so I believed OP was in good hands.
This is why I purchased a Geiger counter!
...isn't this the same thing that was on an episode of House?

Something like a father and son were hospitalised for same kind of symptoms, turns out father had found one of those things, carried it around until he gave it to his son when he went to college.
saw the original post. funny as fuck to see the OP go from what is this thing, to today I fucked up. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🤣
Wow. Should have just kept it. Sounds like you were out a lot of trouble and lost your item.
Wow, have you or the police been in contact with the person you bought it from? 

The police should probably track down everyone that has owned it and see if they’re Ok/Alive 

That makes more sense why it’s at a Flea Market 😂

Maybe previous owners perished?
Well on the bright side, thorium's not the worst radioactive material. Thorium-232 is an alpha emitter, and alpha particles can't even penetrate human skin. Now if you like ate it or decided to cut through it with a grinder and breathed in some of the dust, that would be a problem. You could sit in a room for a couple of hours with the thorium exposed near and it would be like spending a couple of hours in the sun as far as cancer risk is concerned. Probably less. While enclosed in the shielding, it's hardly a risk at all.

Hell, you can legally buy samples of thorium-232 online in glass vials, and the glass is enough to block the radiation. So despite all the hubbub around it, you're fine, man.

I keep bringing up thorium-232 because that's one of very few isotopes it could realistically be, given that most isotopes of thorium have half-lives in the milliseconds, and about 99.9% of all thorium on earth is thorium-232. Also, everything I said about alpha particles in regard to thorium-232 also applies to the other couple of longer half-life isotopes.

I really love that you called the non-emergency line and they came out full-on emergency battle ready. But as someone else commented, they probably used this as a training scenario. Berlin Fireservice should be thanking you. They could have never set such a scenario up for basically free.
No German newspaper seems to be reporting about some people being evacuated because of something radioactive. I guess local journalism is very dead by now.
English tip, normally it's supposed to be a "flea market" (from the french, blame those bastards idk why it's called that) but in this case flee is quite apt :)
According to this site, Th-229 is super rare and they only have about 50g of it left in the world.  This flee market find could literally double the world's supply and it is used to make targeted cancer therapies.  Hopefully it does not just get trashed in a random hazmat site.  If it is indeed Th-229.

Good job calling it in, and thanks for posting a follow up!
Did you buy it at a "drop immediately and flee" market?
That's a scary box!
It’s like the Ghostbusters ghost capture box. Were they wearing proton packs?
Did they say what happens to it now?
Thanks for the update and I'm glad it got sorted. Did they happen to tell you the approximate dose rate or anything about how strong a source it was?
Saw this one in an episode of House. University student’s dad owns a scrap yard and he gives him trinket that he found to use as a keychain, that looks similar to yours, to remember where he came from. Attaches it to his backpack and it ultimately ends up killing him before House diagnoses the source of his illness because it destroys his immune system.

Sooo….. Best of luck 🤞 😅

"Flee" market is right!
I went to school for Safety and took a class in Emergency Management. We often talked about instances of Orphaned Sources (the technical term for these sorts of containers that float around unnoticed) and how to respond to them. OP's going to end up getting talked about in a classroom, training room, or on a wikipedia list, that's for sure lol!
This is a great way of looking at it. OP did good calling non emergency as well.
As a Radiation Safety Officer, my employer pays me a lot of money to develop this kind of training for our emergency responders. I would've loved to watch this scenario unfold IRL.
For 7 euros, provided there are no negative health consequences for OP, it was definitely worth it for the story.
I was thinking, "Bit of an overreaction sending multiple trucks and then even more!" but yeah, as a training exercise, brilliant!
I think the FU is the long term exposure to radiation having this thing sitting in his wardrobe.
Excellent way to think about it!  I am mad that our provincial (Ontario) government missed an opportunity to test large-scale response systems during April 8th total solar eclipse.  If the predicted number of people actually showed up in the path of totality there would have been serious, day long traffic jams (my estimate).  

This would have required activation of response plans from every level of government, something rarely tested "for real".  But as far as I can tell, there wasn't much preparation.  Opportunity lost!

The weather did not turn out great, and was predicted so the day before.  And being a Monday, I'm guessing less than \~10% of folks made the trip to the path of totality.  Good that there was not disaster.  But did ruin the eclipse for a lot of people.
Here in the US, the cops would shoot you for attacking them with deadly radiation, they'd get desk duty, and you'd be billed for wasting emergency resources(not to mention the crippling medical debt from the gunshot wounds).
Wait, wait, wait. I was expecting German fire brigade because you wrote Berlin.

So you took the whole thing on airplane to the UK?
I've gotten a lot of enjoyment from imagining this scene as you unassuredly call the non-emergency line because people on the internet said you might have a radioative object, hearing the operator casually tell you that they will "send a unit over to check on it soon. It will probably turn out to be nothing... but also wash your hands and don't handle it any longer." You step into the bathroom. By the time you exit, only a few minutes later, an array of sirens can be heard approaching from varying distances and in all directions as every governmental organization in the region sends someone to straight your apartment.
whoops
you might want to take this down. you can be doxxed very easily
''This thing might be dangerous, let's all gather around it!''
Bruh what in the Jason Bourne have you gotten yourself into .. that's crazy... Better drink some water bro... 💀
[deleted]
I’m still hoping op will explain why they bought the item/what they were hoping to use it for
Ya I read it yesterday, and just saw this. I’m glad there’s an update; but also hope OP will be ok.

Also commenting in case Kyle Hill makes a screenshot of this thread and I’ll be in his screenshot. His video series on everything nuclear are AMAZING.
Lol same
I'm by no means an expert, but OP should be okay.  Thorium primarily produces alpha and beta particles as it decays.  Alpha particles do not travel very far in general, and are definitely stopped by the casing.  Beta particles can travel further, but usually aren't super dangerous unless you have it up against your skin.  Even a layer of clothing will block most of it.

There is some gamma radiation produced, which is generally the most dangerous kind and has deep penetration even through lead.  But thorium usually doesn't produce a whole lot, and the fact that OP wasn't carrying around means they're unlikely to have gotten a dangerous dose
They said the Health Security Agency would be in touch
I'm surprised OP didn't get questioned about who he got it from tbh, if someone is out there pawning orphaned sources at flea markets they need to be stopped.
>health advice for you based on what they found?

Don't make long term plans but do get a crippling mortgage and not make  payments
When my dad's uncle died in the early 2000s we were cleaning out his house and my dad found a live hand grenade from world war 2. Old people hold onto some weird things and when they pass, the people cleaning up after them might not know what the have.
It was a "flee" market and it was called that for a reason.
Someone probably just mistook it for a keychain pill holder/flint starter. If you look at his original post it definitely looks like one. A episode of House MD was eerily similar where a junk guy gave his son this cool metal keychain and actually ended up giving him radiation poisoning because he carried it in his pocket daily. 

Luckily for OP someone who knew exactly what is was answered the post and op didn't listen to the comments of people saying scrape it with a knife it's a flint
That's what I want to know. Is OP about to become a superhero or grow a third arm?
I have a couple degrees in nuclear engineering.  OP will probably be fine.

It is worth noting that this is very likely thorium-229, not thorium-232.  Which makes it somewhere around a million times more radioactive than natural thorium.  This isn't like uranium glassware or similar, where it's so harmless you can practically eat off it, this is very much something you would not want to ingest.  It wouldn't outright kill you like Polonium-210 (it's ~20,000x less radioactive than that), but you would meaningfully increase your risk of cancer.

With that said, outside of ingesting it, there isn't much danger.  The decay chain is all alphas and betas, the layer of dead skin you naturally have on your body is enough shielding.
As long as the throium is fully contained then the risk is minimal as long as OP wasn’t walking around with the thing uncapped. The main risk comes from thorium powder leaking out, if OP breathes it in then that would put the radioactive material directly into their lungs which is definitely not good. If the fire department didn’t detect elevated radiation levels in OPs apartment after removing the device then they should be fine.
These end up in flea markets and recycling centers from decommissioned medical devices generally. 

Basically when a firm goes belly up and the inventory controls fail, allowing radioactive sources to go to the junkyard without the proper treatment and disposal. 

Compounding this is the fact that like the one op has, they look like little trinket capsules and it is relatively common (as in there’s a couple dozen incidents in the past 5 decades) where workers or scavengers find these orphan sources and pick them up to sell as a trinket.
>I wonder how that thing ended up in a flea market in the 1st place.

The Wikipedia list of [orphan source events](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_orphan_source_incidents) sheds a lot of light on how these things end up out in the wild. It is a very terrifying list.
I'M WAKING UP TO ASH AND DUST
I can always tell a Milford man
Bake up some yellow cake for your neighbors to make up for it.
OP hiding from the neighbors after they found out OP brought radioactive material from Berlin and had it sitting in their wardrobe for who knows how long.
Or an old clock with radium painted dials!
OP got the trinket that makes things glow in the dark!
I saw the original post and thought flint stick keychain 😬😬😬
Yeah, that was my expectation as well, then DOH!  😬
Coleman lantern mantles used to be made with thorium until they started using yttrium instead. They glow in a whiter light than the new ones so a lot of us actually seek them out and have piles of them sitting around.
Even if it had been something less safe, they seem to have really, really overreacted by evacuating people rather than just getting a solid container and transporting it. It is radioactive, not explosive.
I was waiting for this comment lol I was hoping he found it at a junkyard and had been keeping it in his pocket for good luck 😂
That's the first thing I thought of when I saw the original pic of the item. Very vexing.
Is that the one where the kid gets the necklace from his dad and it turns out to be radioactive? Why do we even know this lol is house that popular?
Season 2

https://house.fandom.com/wiki/Daddy%27s_Boy
Legit watched that episode yesterday, saw op’s post and immediately was thinking what if it’s radioactive 💀
I think he's right, its just a worn 637 label with the 7 having a line through it that's weirdly curved. 

~~The label looks like it says 229. Th-229 has a half life of ~8000 years. Which is certainly in the worrisome range. I'm not sure WHY it would be 229 in this format given it's only used in some specific clock applications and certain types of targeted alpha radiotherapy.~~
Seriously, OP.  You're about to be world famous for a hot minute.  You need to start thinking up some good lines.
waiting For the Daily Mail article!
Thorry-I-Um caused a panic
Put me in the screenshot
Do you have any photos of their radiation readings or any further info on the specific isotope or any other possible radioactive material?
Clearly most of them had nothing better to do
I’m hoping not, according to wiki the main danger seems to be from inhaling thorium dust, and the object OP has is enclosed in a lead lined capsule
Haha, yeah, when I saw the post I was like, damn, that looks radioactive. Then I read the top comment which suggested that it was a ferrocerium fire starter, and the folks in the thread suggested that OP try to confirm it by scraping it with a knife. I was like “oh no”
I'm kind of curious if you would be able to grind it against a knife?  No idea on the hardness of thorium vs steel, but my gut says that since Thorium is so dense, it probably wouldn't grind against a knife?
Hell, standard smoke detectors have americium-241 in them as a radiation source.
7 Euros
Third reason... they were bored.
OP is now an orphan source. POOF.
Why would we be getting to the end of them? Better regulation/tracking?
The OP is not going to get a deterministic dose from a Thorium rod and so is not going to experience the symptoms you’ve described. It may have given them a Stochastic dose, but I expect this is vanishingly small and insignificant.
They were trying to runaway not start a circus…
>But they didn't need 3 firetrucks and all that stuff. How insane that OP was actually living it.  

>>Did you just hear what dispatch said?  Some guy has a radioactive capsule.  
>>Oh where at?  I'm gonna come too that sounds interesting.  I hope the bomb disposal guys blow it up.  Last time they did that it was pretty cool.
Drop and run containers are for really nasty stuff like cobalt 60. If you ever read that warning, there’s a decent chance you’re already dead.
Yes, and righteously so.
And that's why I love reddit.
If memory serves there was a type of paint or something used in clocks? One day there’s a whole squad of hazmat dudes ransacking his shed. 

I need to read that book.
Ok I’ll call it FLEA, FLEA not FLEE
Only if it's not radioactive. If it IS radioactive, you should certainly flee the market.
When there’s radiation involved, it’s definitely a flee market.
It's not going to be Th-229 (people have misread 637 upside down as 229). In decades working with radioactive sources I have never come across a Th-229 source. If it's thorium then it'll be Th-232.

Also I'm not sure what you mean by 'worth checking out your lungs', there isn't some test that can be done after a bit of radon exposure to see if the lungs have received exposure. Radon exposure is measured with dosimetry or estimated.
Easy: there are standard responses for keywords. If the keyword is „potential radioactive incident“ there is a defined response and in that case this was it. Also you normally have different vehicles equipped for different situations so you might have to send more to cover all potential situations.
Nobody wants to under-react to a radioactive hazard, this means they’ll often need to overreact when things are at all uncertain (I.e. anytime a member of of the public thinks they might have a significant radioactive source). This is the right approach.

Edit: The fire crews are trained to deal with all manner of stuff, including dealing with radiation incidents. I assume they only got ambulances there at the initial response because they had crews free, otherwise they might have been called in after an initial assessment by fire services. You want the police there if you’re responding to anything that could turn into a major incident.
As for the bomb disposal unit, they probably have to wait a long time between using their expertise so will probably be present whenever there is a fraction of a chance of a situation needing them 🤣. Seriously though they’d be able to tell if this item could be an explosive device and should be treated appropriately. It’s a rightfully cautious approach.
Well they are pretty big vehicles that are easily seen and recognized. They could potentially use them as barriers to the building so that people don't just walk back in and stuff.  Or if you are just returning home and you see that then maybe you'll realize something very serious may be going on
Aside from the other good reasons that people have stated in this thread -- because even if they \*know\* that the source is small, localized, and not particularly harmful (and they didn't) -- it's a very rare opportunity to train in a situation that doesn't come up often. You'd \*want\* all hands possible on deck for this opportunity both in case it was worse than what it was, but also so that everyone gets some experience in how to correctly address this situation.
Because when they rolled the trucks they didn't know what was involved. Better to respond as if it's serious then scale down instead of responding as if it's somebody's radium watch and find out it's serious.
To expose as many people as possible.  Obviously.  :p
In addition to everything else people said, I would have to imagine that potential radioactive incidents are fairly rare, so the cost of overreacting to them is pretty minimal compared to the cost of *under* reacting to, like, an escaped nuke from Georgia or something like that.
They don't know how large the incident is, and Fire Departments generally have access to some degree of breathing and other appropriate PPE.  They're also used to handling evacuations and other "get people away from danger quickly" situations.
They get paid the same whether they're sitting on their butt at the fire station or they're out at the scene, so as long as they're not actively needed for some other emergency, you might as well send them out.
I'm sorry, look at it too long? Does the radiation affect the retina?
For this item, probably correct.
Back in the late 90's I worked at an electronics surplus shop (junk store type thing).  Well we had one customer that always brought a Geiger counter with him... we called him "Radiation Man".  One day he hurriedly bolted out of the store, turns out we had some military surplus that we really shouldn't have had! lol. (was a moderately high level check source).
Oh I think he's going to flee from that market forever. Vendor too, probably.

At least this one doesn't involve the finder cracking it open or shaving off pieces like so many of the more tragic orphan sources stories.

Positive consequences only please
I was thinking moreso that at least 1 of them showed up as a result of a conversation about wanting to see that.
Depending on the isotope it probably wasn't that bad. The thoriated TIG rods welders used to use were harmless as long as you didn't inhale/ ingest the dust when you ground them to a point.
This is hilarious. Tbf they could've driven through the chunnel, but still.
Apparently the casing works really well to shield the source.
:O
He fleed. It’s right in the title.
Helicopters circling, a breech team taking down the door, military rafts jetting up and down the nearest waterway. 
And a couple jets doing a flyover.
I'd like to hear the conversation between the annoyed operator and the fire Marshal or whatever. Wait what did you just say?
I was in Salisbury, UK, on the day of the Novichok attack. Walked into the call I had gone to do, walked out into a scene from a zombie film. 4 police cars? More like 30. Unmarked cars, probably from Porton Down also. Whole area  sealed off. Police and response units everywhere. 

So yeah, the authorities go nuts on this.

My only doubt is the lack of response……
I think they filmed this scene in the move ET.
Famous last words of a nuclear physicist.
Those emergency responders are gathering around it to keep the public safe
Some nice refreshing radium spring water, probably.
Not great, not terrible.

They (and hopefully the seller??) didn’t know what it was, it was just an interesting mystery object.
It was the hottest item on the sellers table!
As a proud thrifter, sometimes you just see a cool unknown thing for 5 euros and you just think "huh, a cool unknown thing" and you take it.

I went through the Nuke program when I was in the Navy ages ago and those videos just scratch a certain itch, they're super interesting.

However, if the radiation ends up in your body (e.g. ingesting it, inhaling dust, etc) then the risk is reversed: the lack of penetration of alpha and beta particles means that every single particle produced is going to damage one of your cells, generally in a fairly important part of your body (like the lungs)
We use thoriated tungsten in Tig welding.
Like, it could have been [so much worse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goiania_accident) (because gamma radiation)
Assuming the thorium is fully contained. If any thorium powder leaked out that would be a significant hazard if it’s breathed in. Unlikely but definitely something to check for.
Technically thorium doesn't produce any gamma particles, but some of its decay products do. So as bits of thorium decay you will sometimes get small amounts of some of those that will briefly emit some.
Alpha particles are like alpha males. They don't get very far, barely have any penetration but can deal a lot of damage.
Assuming it’s Th-232, it shouldn’t have any gamma emissions and barely any beta emissions since the parent daughter decay chain only includes alpha and beta decays with no meta-stable daughter products. Th-232 has a half-life of 14 billion years, while its daughter products have half-lives ranging from around 6 years to 14 nanoseconds, so there should be almost no buildup of other isotopes with different decay modes either.

Th-229 however, has meta-stable states, but is not in one by default and needs a decay product to directly interact with the nucleus which is extremely uncommon. It does however go through many beta decays in its chain which may pose a slight risk. Th-230 does have a gamma emission in its chain along with beta decays but takes a long time in our sense to build up radioactivity.

Dude has been handling it for a while and fucking around with it trying to detach it and shit. So he’ll have some radiation exposure for sure
But installing it in ex wifes vibrator could be a weird, long term, perfect murder script.  I am assuming there are easier ways to give someone cancer and a billion faster ways to murder...but it would make an interesting side note from a serial killer story.  Oh that poor man, all of his wives died of cancer.
OP , I have one question: How much did you pay for this item when you bought it?
This is probably unnecessary, but have they checked to see if you're radioactive from exposure - like if you have the radioactive material on you?
I see a future Plainly DiFFicult video coming...
We need to close the flee market loophole!
Thorium is about the safest of the radioactive materials
Not just old people…generally people will hold onto unusual/odd items. Guess it’s a matter of personal interests.
My dad brought his medic's kit, evne though for the last year of his sevrice he switched to Battallion Intelligence. By th e 60s he'd used the last of the prepackaged morphine shots, one when a firecracker went off in my aunt's hand. But plenty of rotten gauze bandages form the 40s etc.
Ah, they sell fuel fleas from reactors? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_fleas
Yeah, I saw OP's original post, just glanced over it and thought it was a flint starter, too. So if I found this in, idk, a dead relative's jammed attic, I might have tried to sell it on a flea market, too, without researching further.
Butthole cancer.
Porque no los dos, third arm man
Ugh, last night I dreamed I grew a literal 3rd leg, in the dream I noticed it switched between being a left or right leg, which let me realize it was a dream so I woke up.
OP tried to take it apart and said some of the ‘black paint’ on the rod was flaking off or had already flaked off…. I really hope they’re ok..
Old and flaking radium paint is likely to be FAR more hazardous than a Thorium rod.
As far as radiological threats are concerned, if they couldn't identify it other than it's emitting radiation, I'd say it's a fair assessment to overreact rather than under react.
Strong disagree, the first responders did everything correctly here.  They have a radioactive material protocol, they activated it when they get this report, and this is the response which their planning called for.

If this were a high activity medical source then the you'd be agreeing that the level of response was correct - but how are they going to know that *before* they've responded?

It's the same reason you'll see a half dozen engines respond to *any* fire alarm in a high rise building.  They need to be prepared for the worst until they can rule that out.
You don't take chances with radioactive material.

See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goiânia\_accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goiânia_accident) for an example.
Same. It's good to know watching House can actually save my life.
Nice try Forman
Yes it was. House was crazy popular back then and even now since it's on some streaming network somewhere.
It doesn't say 229, it's says 637 (upside down compared to the way it almost looks like 229) which is the same number as inside. It would be very unusual to be a Th-229 source.

So many comments from the original post said it was a ferrous rod and to scrape it against things. 

So many.
That was some 4chan quality advice.  BRB gonna go make some crystals with chemicals from under the sink.
It would and it's the absolute worst thing some layman could do with radioactive thorium, lol.
It's a little bit softer than hardened knife steel, so it probably works
Yep.  They should put "Do not eat" stickers on them like the desiccant bags they put in packages
Good deal as far as black market nuclear material goes. 😂
did you bring this through an airport or do you live near the flea market?
Oh mate, you got ripped off. I wouldn’t have paid more than 4. 
Honestly you got your moneys worth in terms of buying something with an insane story attached.
But why did you buy it if you didn’t even know what it was?
As an EMT this is how it goes. Usually not for us, just fire. Lol. Something interesting? Calls slow? Don’t mind if I come over and check it out
In this case, definitely FLEE, without hesitation.
No OP, in this case specifically I think you were right to spell it that way
There have been really nasty incidents caused by people pulling apart hospital radiation sources and spreading alpha, beta and gamma goodness throughout a neighborhood. I think sending 3 fire trucks is justified: those fire departments don't know if they're dealing with a few small pellets or someone's DIY radiological bomb.
Given it was an apartment complex, they may have been considering the possibility of a mass decon scenario - which would require lots of hands on deck.
You're forgetting they may have heard it over the radio, and wanted to check it out.
Absolutely this, fire crews are often waiting around and this is an excellent training opportunity in an area they will have limited practical experience.
Some extremely dangerous radiation sources say that and very much mean it
What about when they roll up with a dozen cement trucks?
I mean obviously that’s worse because it’s real and the amount of people affected. But if you go on OP’s profile you can see the radioactive item, which is small and has a metal ring that could be attached to a keychain, which is the comparison that I was making.
Funny because many people in OP's original post suggested it was a flint
Possible.  I've never worked for emergency services but I expect that would be against protocol since it removes them from their base readiness and location.   That could be a problem if the "rubberneck" site were on one side of town and a new incident were phoned in for the other side of town.
I believe they have a way of checking if you have radioactive material in your car. I was talking to a guy that taxi's people across and he said that there's been a few times that they had to halt all passport checks because one of the detectors found some radioactive material.
EVERYBODY OUT OF THE CHUNNEL!
At the same time, it's going to block x-rays and look like a big opaque cylinder. So if they took a plane...
Guess, if people wearing a scene commander vest show up, you know it's not the average cat on a tree 🤣

Those emergency responders are gathering around it because it's a great exercise for when an *actual* dangerous source turns up from some Russian sleeper agent.
The radioactivity really adds to the buzz!

Jokes aside though he said you can’t fit anything in there. 
He could have stored some of that Bruce Banner strain in it, smoked it, and become stoned Hulk
Yeah op didn't know, but I was wondering what made them give it more than a cursory glance, if they had an idea of doing something with it etc 
That is always what happens with these orphaned source incidents, but they frequently turn out badly

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_orphan_source_incidents
I really hope that OP never touched the bit on the inside of the container
Hopefully they didn't try to use it as a ferrite rod, scratching the fuck out of it with a knife to try and make sparks like some people were suggesting.
In the original post some people thought it was a ferro rod for starting fires and told him to use a steel blade to try to scrape some of it off.  Thankfully he did not.
And it's a carcinogenic health hazard! 
While there are no stable isotopes of thorium, virtually all thorium in existence is thorium-232, with a half-life of 1.4x10^10 years, or about 14 billion years. The thoriated tungsten used in welding has a very low rate of decay in this context. It decays via emission of an alpha particle, which is easily blocked by your skin, a sheet of paper, a few inches of air, that sort of thing. But alpha particles are all hell when "live" cells are exposed, such as if thorium particles get in your lungs.

This particular item almost certainly contains isotopes that have a substantially shorter half-life, meaning more "crickets" on the ol' counter.
*you* use thoriated tungsten in welding. 

*I,* a sophisticate, only use the finest lanthanated electrodes, imported from Europe.

[this is another nightmare scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lia_radiological_accident)
What made people sick in that incident was contamination with radioactive material. Same with Chernobyl, Fukushima, nuclear weapons tests, etc. 

Exposure to harmful levels of EM radiation is actually pretty rare, infamously it was the cause of death in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon\_core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core) incidents.
WTF, they were stopped by the state from securing the material, then sued by the feds for not securing the material.
can't find the original tumblr post but someone did basically exactly what op did [but found cesium](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/103plfo/the_radioactive_capsule_was_real/). lost part of the muscles on their arm and hand about it. i remember the original posts on tumblr, dude thought it was cool that it was fuckin with the camera when open
People were telling him to try strike it against something to see if it was a fire starter, so fingers crossed.

Ehhh... There's been a trend lately of shady companies making thorium-laced pendants and such, and marketing them for their positive health effects, without disclosing the thorium content. The problem is that they've been using powdered thorium and not mixing it in evenly with the plastic, perhaps even deliberately, because the unmixed thorium makes sort of a veiny marble-like look. Well, it sheds powder everywhere, fine powder, that can easily be inhaled, and just sits in the lungs (yes, I know, things can be expelled from the lungs, but when you're still inhaling a steady stream of thorium powder, that becomes moot). Inhaled radioactive materials are generally really bad.

I wouldn't go around making blanket statements about something being among the safest radioactive materials. Pretty much any of them can be very bad, depending on the form it takes, and how people are exposed to it. I mean sure, it's not plutonium, and it's not polonium-210, great, but...it can still be pretty darn bad.
This was a different isotope than the natural stuff,   apparently.   This has a  7000 year half-life vs 14.5 *billion* years for wild thorium, so the radiation comes out 200000x faster.

At first I was "big whup; you find thorium in [gas lantern mantles](https://www.orau.org/health-physics-museum/collection/consumer/products-containing-thorium/gas-lantern-mantles.html) and welding rods" but this is a different flavor.      Still not horrific,  depending on how much is there,   as long as the alpha emitter stays intact and isn't ingested.
At least my second hand sardine fork (5 tined, there are even 7 tined ones) won't harm anyone who has to clean up in case of my sudden demise.
NOBODY BUYS A BUTT DILDO AT A FLEA MARKET!!! 😨
The risk is not so much a “OMG they’re going to die of radiation poisoning” but more “Their chance of getting lung cancer in twenty years just went up a lot”.
That makes sense.
You will never know if it was too much but you will definitely know if it wasn't enough.
Wow, thanks for sharing that
One time I was traveling in the Caribbean — where I’d heard the term “island medicine” but thought people were exaggerating — and had a severe allergic reaction. When I got to the clinic I was so swollen they couldn’t take blood. The nurses kept trying so they could confirm wtf was wrong with me — like, each of three of them trying twice as I was going in and out of consciousness. It was after maybe the 5th try when, from a place of zero remaining fucks, I interrupted with “I’m not trying to tell you how to do your jobs or anything” (they look at me like This white bish is about to tell us how to do our jobs, which was accurate) but that I had watched a *lot* of House MD, and I’m *guessing* that after you manage to draw my blood you’re going to give me a bunch of steroids to bring the swelling down? (Suspicious nods) So how about you shoot the steroids into my thigh or butt or whatever, let me chug a liter of gatorade to help it circulate, and that’ll bring the swelling down so you can find a vein? 

And that’s what they did, and lo, that shit worked. Thanks to House MD and whatever channel always has a ton of episodes running late at night during holiday breaks at my mom’s house. It’s not Christmas without someone suggesting it might be Lupus! <3

Seeing as Th-229 costs about $50M per gram, I'd say it would be *highly* unusual.
I think they mean the tag, in images 1 and 2. It's hard to make out, but it might be 229.

I'll admit that was my first guess too when I saw it. It looked a lot like a ferro rod.
100% they have radiation detectors. I’m in the radiation protection business.
That's only if the radioactive material is unshielded, those detectors probably won't detect this source if it's in its lead-lined casing. Those detectors weren't put in place to prevent someone smuggling a radioactive source in, those were put in place because someone might [accidentally bring radioactively contaminated materials into the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Ju%C3%A1rez_cobalt-60_contamination_incident).
I remember when I worked travel nurses down at the Texas border, that people who had radiation seeds for cancer treatment had to carry around cards so border security didn’t think they were trying to transport a nuclear device.
That's what she said

you don't have anything radioactive *yet*
Hey, if you are in the states you should be able to look up your state’s EPA radiation department and contact them. I know cause I did it once for a couple pocket watches, and FOR FREE they will send someone to your house to test items for you!! I encourage everyone who collects old mystery junk/clocks/clockwork/toys ect, to do this. 

My grandpa was a watch maker, and i kept a ton of tools, clockwork, watches ect. Like 3-4 years back, I noticed a clock face with the green painted hands, and immediately dumped it and two others into a bucket of water and had them come out to test. The guy was very friendly, and reassured me that it “probably wasn’t” radioactive, but it was good to check and better safe than sorry… as we were walking over to the bucket 🪣. He has his testing device out + PPE on, dumps out the water and grabs it, and what do you know, his device starts going off immediately! 

He was like “…. Ah. Yup, ok, that’s radium paint all right.” 

But! That’s not all. I had ONLY thought the 3 pocket watches/ clock faces were sus. But ‘just in case,’ we had him test everything from my grandpa, and there was a number of things that pinged. 

Included on that list were: a couple of clock winders, a small folding pocket knife with a Mother of Pearl inlay, a windup spring, a few small tools- different tweezers, tiny flatheads, a watch chain, a tiny tin kid’s toy, the inner clockwork of a pocket watch that had no radium paint visible, a 1/2 cup of little knobs with gems on the top of them, 2 of the containers that were used for storing this stuff, and the sculpture of a clockwork butler I had made out of watch parts 😬😬😬

Oh yeah, and the surface of the folding table that we had dumped everything out on for him to test 😰

He said that I could keep the stuff as long as it was stored safely, because the radiation was weak enough to be stopped by a glass or plastic container. (For example, the gem-knobs didn’t register until the plastic vitamin bottle I had them in was opened.)  Or he could take them with him to be safely disposed of. I had him take everything, I mean for gods sake the tabletop that things were sitting on had gotten contact radioactive material on it. We had to scrub it several times and have him retest until there wasn’t a signature. 

So, yeah. Grandpa died of leukemia by the way… the scary part of that type of low level radiation is not what it’ll do to you from outside your body. It’s that the active isotope ‘looks’ similar enough to calcium for your body to get confused and puts in in your bones the same as calcium. That’s when you are fucked, but you’re gonna have decades of not knowing anything about it. Leukemia is cancer of the blood, which is produced in the bone marrow. 

Moral of the story, getting things tested costs nothing and can be lifesaving.
As an acquaintance of mine once said about a recent purchase, "I'm a magpie. I like shiny objects."

This is a good copypasta. Surprised I don’t see it more often for the brain dead takes we see all around.
**WARNING:** If you put warning labels on everything people stop noticing them.
Outstanding. Enjoy your upvote.
Damn I was expecting to be Rick rolled
yeah that same label gets put on wood because of sawdust.
It'd probably at least cause reproductive harm if it hit someone in the nads
It's malicious compliance - California voters passed Proposition 65, which requires companies to label products containing chemicals that might cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm.

  
Rather than figure out which products have those chemicals, companies doing business in California just started labeling all their products with the warning "just in case"
For a serious answer, probably something in the adhesive that helps hold the head on the handle (I've seen plenty of hammers that have adhesive), or in the stain or lacquer on the wood. The metal itself may even be some alloy of something carcinogenic (I could totally see some fool cheaping out and using lead). Actually, if it's brass, that would be the case. Brass has lead in it.

I have a fishing rod that came with that warning, and asked my dad about it. His response was, "It means don't eat it."
The trick with the current prop 65 is that if any part someone sells might cause cancer or whatever (paint on your hammer), using the label removes most liability as you were warned.  

Not warning/labeled opens the business up to lawyers, lots of lawyers.
It’s the adhesive on the warning label that’s carcinogenic
Sometimes the warning is because of the rust prevention oil the manufacturer puts on the tool
It’s not the hammer itself that will give you cancer. It’s the xrays after you swing and miss, and smash something up.
My favorite was getting a new pistol and having that warning on the box. The pistol isn’t even legal to be sold in California…
 Not actually true, some things just don't fit.
The problem is, most of it is basically useless information and the sheer amount of it practically drowns out more vital warnings. For example, a warning on french fries because they (and many other cooked foods) contain acrylamide. But the amount found in french fries is so low that even the American Cancer society says that you could eat 150 servings of those fresh fries, in one sitting, and still not reach the amount of acrylamide thought to raise the risk of cancer in mice. 

Prop 65 warning is required on *hotels* in California, because previous guests might have drank alcohol or smoked on the property at some point. And drinking alcohol and smoking can raise the risk of some cancers.

All wooden furniture has to carry a prop 65 warning to be sold in California. Because the level of wood dust that a sawmill worker, who's not wearing any kind of mask, is exposed to, can over a period of years, raise the risk of cancer. (As can inhaling any kind of fine dust in large enough quantities for a long enough period of time, because of the irritation and damage to the lungs) There is no way on earth a wooden chair carries enough wood dust to raise anybody's risk of cancer.

Potted trees sold in California often have a warning on them. Untill a court case  in 2018, restaurants that served coffee had to have a warning, because coffee has traces of acrylamide

There are warning required on things that  international regulators agree are not  carcinogenic hazards.

When  people see those kinds of warnings literally everywhere, they stop paying attention to them. And there is no difference in the Prop 65 warning telling you that a table contains wood, or that golden brown potatoes have acrylamide at less that 100th the dose that *might* raise the risk of cancer in mice. And a Prop 65 warning saying that a necklace marketed to little kids,(who tend to put everything in their mouth) contains lead. So the end result is that a lot of people just ignore ALL the prop 65 warning labels, because they can't tell the difference between the (many) useless ones, and the actually important ones. And most of the ones they see are the useless ones.
Ah!
Very glad to hear it OP, thanks for the update and may you never get cancer

My boyfriend was always super busy at xmas.
One xmas I snuck a xmas tree into his apartment while he slept. I took all his spoons (except 1, he’d need it to eat) and tied them on the tree with red ribbon. Put cotton puffs all over it, a banana on top, armature wire stars that looked very much like stick figure stars. For the tree skirt I put lots of crumpled clean white printer paper. I printed a screenshot of the spoon and banana talking, but with these words above it “Christmas is coming, did you bring your big spoon?” then I stuck it on his bathroom mirror because I knew he’d go there first when he’d get up at 4am. Then I went to my apartment. We're still together 25 years later.

Ow my balls!
When I was pregnant I realized that my PRENATAL vitamins had this label only after taking them for a month. A real wtf moment.
Wrongful enstupidment should be a crime.
The stickers are technically correct, the item "might" cause cancer. 

The sun might explode tomorrow. It won't, but it *might.*
It's slightly more subtle, but you've got the gist. It's just less expensive to put the warning on anything with a compound on the list, than it is to do the testing to prove it's below the actually hazardous levels.
Always good advice for fishing rods
you need more patience and lube
That’s just a lack of ambition
Well, not with *that* attitude!
This is true.  Doesn't Disneyland have a warning?

As a Nevada resident all a Prop 65 sticker means to me is "oh, we're probably in California now."

So Prop 65 is punishes anyone violating the thresholds even unintentionally under the logic that you should know exactly what you’re selling.  This is understandable but also means that every potential source of contamination is a potential source of a lawsuit from the government.

For vitamins, almost every mineral sample is inherently contaminated. Like if your supplement has 65 mg of iron and is 99.99% pure, thats 6.5 micrograms of random contaminants.  Same applies to the Calcium and the Magnesium.  Now those contaminants are random but are typically based on the source. Iron is from rocks, so other metals in the rock are often contaminants. Calcium is often from shells, so it depends on what the shelled thing ate and the water it lived in over its life.  Reducing contaminants is very expensive: going from 99.99% pure to 99.999% might increase cost ten times over.

Prop 65 says the daily limit on lead is 0.5 micrograms per day (which is the FDA maximum level for infant consumption).  0.5 micrograms per day for an adult would take a long time to have your body absorb enough lead to reach the 0.5 micrograms per deciliter in your blood that’s considered elevated as an adult. (An adult contains about 50 deciliters of blood, so you’d need to absorb 25 micrograms of lead, and lead doesn’t absorb well in the digestive system.)

Since a vitamin is daily, if they can’t reliably say that the contaminants in some batches might be a tiny bit high in lead to breach 0.5 micrograms, it’s safer on a regulatory side to add the sticker. Since the contaminants are somewhat random and the amount of contaminants is hard to get under 0.5 micrograms as a whole, it’s fairly likely that at least some batches fail just on random chance.

Companies can get a USP lab to do random batch testing on their product as well as do process verification to guarantee that contaminants are more like harmless carbon and not harmful lead, but it’s a LOT of money and is an ongoing service contract.

Now for a prenatal vitamin you should probably find one that’s USP verified, but be prepared to pay a significantly higher cost to get one. Typically they’re only brand names, which means you’re paying for the brand, and the USP verification cost also gets passed on to the consumer.

The other major buyer of USP verified supplements are drug tested athletes, since even minor contamination of a chemical byproduct in a medicine can cause false flags on tests.

Most makeup kits should have a sticker due to contamination, and finding USP certified makeup is way harder than supplements, and stuff like mercury can be absorbed through the skin.  Also organic produce should technically have a sticker if it’s intended to be consumed every day, again because of contaminants plants absorb from the soil.
Well you just so happened to be right. The sun did not explode today. It *probably* won’t explode tomorrow either but I’m not a prophet so we will see.
Agreed! They're just a little too crunchy...
This bus is going to take a long time!
Yep, all of Disneyland has a prop 65 warning. Apparently because of things like serving fried foods, and some of the rides produce diesel fumes. Even though the average park visitor will have *far less* exposure than you'd get simply existing in the average busy city. But as cities are not businesses, they don't get prop 65 warnings. Leaving people with the impression that visiting Disneyland is more dangerous than staying home. Assuming they even read the warning in the first place.

It's the UK where I don't have any specific knowledge, but I somehow doubt when nearly ever emergency department that exist shows up that someone isn't going to inform the owner of the complex. With the possibility of radioactive contamination it's probably a legal requirement.

If the police show up to your meth house they are definitely going to tell the owner about it.
Those last two sentences back to back very much feel like some kind of implication...
Of course it was Florida.
One of the worst daily things it gets used for is armor piercing ammo for tanks and cannon rounds on planes like the Warthog. Where ever those rounds are fired there's a lot of DU flakes and dust created that cause big problems for the poor sods who live there after the war is over.

I'm leaving it.
If it does explode, I will buy you a beer or other beverage of choice (must be consumed within 8 minutes, though)
Nah, my apartment building has a prop 65 warning- staying home isn’t safe. Can’t go to the hospital either- they have one outside the front door. Better just stay outside and inhale all the smoke from the nearby wildfires.
TIFU passing gas on the dance floor 
I’m a mid 30s Female. last night I went out for a Halloween dance party. I worked really hard on my costume. I was the perfect combination of warm and slutty and i was excited to strut my stuff.

The way that this bar is set up is that there is a main level upstairs, and then you can walk downstairs to go to the dance area. it’s a pretty small place so it gets crowded. 

I had taken some mushrooms earlier in the evening. And I was feeling good.

At some point in the night, I had to “cut the cheese.” I thought it would be a small one. I thought I could just crop dust it . but it was the most silent/deadly/toxic/foul mushroom stink bomb of my life. 

The smell from my ass destroyed the Dance floor. People cleared out! It was so bad people thought that someone had an accident on the floor. like they turned up the lights a little bit to see and make sure that there wasn’t a health hazard. Even the DJ made a comment.

I went upstairs because I couldn’t stand the smell of my own ass. I was up there for about 30 minutes. And when I came back down, I could still smell my ass.

It’s all anybody could talk about. They thought someone had an accident . I had to play dumb. I was so embarrassed. 

TL:DR my mushroom gas smelled so bad that it cleared out a Halloween party and the DJ even made a comment about how bad it smelled
[deleted]
Years ago I was in a big record store with no one else there but the staff. I let a silent but deadly go while I was browsing. It was so bad that I had to move over a couple of aisles. A minute later, two teenage girls came in the store and walked right into my cloud and immediately started gagging and coughing. It was hard not to laugh.
Shared this once before on Reddit. 
Many years ago, I was at work after a night of drinking. My stomach was seriously rebelling. I waited till the ladies room was empty. Ran in, unloaded the most horrific load and ran out. 
Maybe 10 minutes later a coworker innocently asked if I’d been in the ladies room this morning to which I innocently replied no. She started RANTING so loudly that the entire office got involved discussing it. She said if someone had to do “something THAT disgusting”, they should leave have gone home to go.  It was the talk of the office for WEEKS!
What’s a little embarrassment when you can give so many Redditors a good laugh?
I was shopping at Kid's r' Us once and let out this rattler fart that stunk to high heaven and the lady on the opposite side of the rounder from me  said to her partner they needed to leave because that lady just blew the back out of her pants.  LMFAO. It's the little things.
If you want to do this on purpose, eat raw garlic. The tiniest little fart clears the room. My gf at the time vomited.
The fact that the DJ made a comment is the icing on the cake.

Did the DJ play 'Sophie Ellis-Bextor - Murder On The Dancefloor'?

If not, missed opportunity.

Also I vote to make this your theme song. Lyrics like 'I'll blow you all away' take on a whole new meaning 🤣
OP's fart be like...

![gif](giphy|jmSImqrm28Vdm)
I was chilling on the bed with my Jack Russell a couple of years ago, and ripped one out that was cloyingly nasty that the dog immediately jumped off the bed and went to his water bowl in the corner to have a drink to wash his mouth out. You know that was a bad one.
Once it was me, my infant and FIL. I let out a deadly silent one. My FIL was like looks like the little one pooped, I’m like yea let me go change him up. I went to the room, killed 10 minutes and came back down.
That’s why a fart smells… for the benefit of those who didn’t hear it…
When I was in the airforce, they served boiled eggs in the cafeteria. Never been much of a boiled eggs guy, but that morning, I had an insatiable appetite for them. Ate 5 or 6 of them. 

An hour or so later, while sitting at my post, my stomach started to disagree with my diet that morning and I swear my ass released what could only be defined as a chemical weapons grade, all mighty, excessively loud and extended fart.

You know, the type of fart that would fog up the windows if you were inside a car.

Luckily, there wasnt any business other than gas, but two of my team mates quickly started to gag and had to clear the room. The third one, couldnt stop laughing at the commotion while simultaneously gagging.

I was strictly forbidden from ever having eggs again.
Murder on the dance floor 🎶
THANK YOU for posting this. I read every comment word for word. Never have done that on a post with this many replies. 

As an old retired guy, and a regular practicing skilled professional farter here is my story (sorry for the length):

I grocery shop (I like it actually) on Sunday morning. Store is basically empty because I assume everyone is at church. Had a full blown Mexican meal with my wife Saturday evening. Sunday comes around, I'm up at 5:30am regularly based on doing it for 40+ years. Made coffee, dog did her business. Watching the news. All good. It's now about 7:30am, time to head to the grocery. I'm feeling fine, but have a little morning after wind, because we'll Mexican food. I have wind most mornings anyway, just because I do.

Somewhere in the store after a few mins. (remember the store is almost empty) I feel a bubbler coming on. Look back, the aisle behind me and in front was clear. I let go. Not loud, but a good 15 seconds of walking and farting. Like walking in unison, each step was a new fart. You know the type. Since it was behind me, I smelled nothing. Around the corner behind me, a Mom and a 6ish year old toddler head right into the flatulence curtain of disgust. I'm near the end of the aisle, they at the beginning. I hear the boy start telling mommie it was really stinky, and that someone must have farted. I'm now smiling. I then hear the little boy tell mommie he was feeling sick, and he was going to throw up. I'm now tuned in, but facing away from them. Mommie ignores the boy. I then I hear the "barf wince" noise that accompanies throwing up. 

He coughs and tosses cookies all over the freshly mopped white floor. 

I'm literally at the end of the aisle, turn to see what they look like, and see if they noticed me. Mommie is holding his head, while there was a huge strewn barf pile on the floor. They didn't see me. 

I've never laughed so hard in my life. I was stifling the laughter so I wouldn't be caught as the offender. 

Kept with the shopping trip. Didn't see them again.

Went home and told my wife. She wasn't as impressed as I was. I guess you had to be there.

It was so classic. Perfect wind distribution. Thanks for the memory.
Did you go as Oppenheimer?
Oops my CD just skipped.
My proudest fart resulted in a building maintenance ticket being logged (lol, I said log). 


I've been on a weight loss kick, decided that I needed more fibre, and tried Metamucil. It didn't change anything except for causing the most noxious, miasmatic and voluminous farts I've ever jettisoned.


Being the hilarious, mature and well adjusted adult that I am, I had a monster brewing when I got in the lift at work at the start of the day, and something in my DNA convinced me that it would be quite sophisticatedly humorous to pay it forward. I let it all go very carefully, and stepped out on my floor very slowly, to minimise disturbing turbulence.


Later I learned that the lift had gone straight to pick up another passenger, and it nearly killed her, and she logged (lol) a job with maintenance, thinking something was dead in the bottom (lol) of the lift well. The maintenance guys had put the lift out of service and were crawling around below the car, but of course found nothing by then, an hour after my Magnum Anus.


Nobody must ever know.
I did the same thing once on a remote military base in the arctic.  There had been a lot of travel, a lot of commissary food, and a lot of beer.  Almost last call... 
i was on the dance floor and felt the urge...  thought, it'll be a wee one....
Nope, exactly as you described.
To. The. Letter!
The burn, the waft, the quick escape...
I acted all casual at the bar and got a last pint as the dance floor cleared.

OP, one time in high school I was doing one of those SAT prep classes at night. One day I had to shit, so I rushed to the ladies room and did my thing cause no one was out of their class at the time. As I walk out of the stall, two popular girls came in and it was obvious they noticed the smell. So I tried to play it off like “wow, whoever was in here must’ve dropped a bomb!”. But I think it was super clear that it was, in fact, me who just dropped a bombed in there. I very much regretted saying anything and still wish I simply walked out in shameful silence instead. I never saw them again, but recently I decided to share this with my sister who I was swapping telling embarrassing moments with. I have not heard the end of it since lol
Had one linger in the back room of a top secret Marine Corps Communications Center (think giant bank vault) for over 30 mins.  We had an air handler that would suck paperwork off my desk so I figured I was safe. Hell no, cleared out the back room for over 30 mins. The general can wait on his messages......
talk about Panic at the disco!
One time I dropped a FILTHY one the restroom at a retail spot I worked at. 2 dudes were already poopin, but my smell was crushing theirs. As I walk out, this 9 year old kid walks in. I go back to my station at work and see a lady running the 9 year old out of the store. My coworker saw the kid run out of the bathroom and vomit all over the hallway. 🤢😅
This story reminded me of a funny memory lol

Several years ago, my gf was visiting me at work, and while she was there she ripped the most absolutely foul ass. Everyone was laughing until the blast hit us, then we all cleared out of the room. The manager was crying, someone was in the bathroom throwing up, and the guy who was NEVER phased by farts was holding onto the back door and dry heaving. It was such an absolutely monumental fart, and honestly to this day I am still SO fucking proud of that girl
This thread has confirmed for me yet again that farts are *always* funny.
I was at an outdoor festival 15 years ago. Treasure Island Music Festival. It’s a cool setup; they have two stages, but only one band will play at a time, while the next sets up on the other. So you kind of go back and forth between the stages but there’s a large middle sweet spot where everyone sits and is able to see both stages by turning around. You’re not super close but you hear the music and can still get a decent view. 

I had eaten some mushrooms as well and mushies just do not agree with me. I dropped a few farts and I knew they were bad but I was holding it best I could. But I was close to stage on one side and would need to cross the area where everyone was sitting to get to the bathrooms. It was a beautiful day out sun out great lineup and everyone was chilling in the grass, enjoying whatever high or psychedelic they were on. 

Until I walked by. 

It was BAD, like someone had left a dozen eggs in a car over an entire summer. And everybody got some right at face level. People were falling to the ground, rolling around, yelping out in surprise or pain or disgust, frantically waving their hands in front of their faces, some looking to and fro for the perpetrator. It was a trail of destruction San Francisco hadn’t seen since the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989. And my fart lasted probably just as long. An entire swath across the lawn, like the mark of Voldemort on Harry’s head, was decimated. 

And my girlfriend was laughing her ass off.
DJ was like

This reminds me of a fuck up I had with someone I fancied. 

We worked for the same company and talked now and then but didn’t hang out because it was different offices. We were at a forced team building event at this fancy resort and we both got there early and were sat in the bar which had these really awkward beanbag couches. We were sat next to each other laughing and joking and making plans to team up and beat the other coworkers.

Well the bells rang and I had to run to the bathroom (IBS), so I told her I had to run to the bathroom and she said it was a good idea and she’d go to. We were laughing about how we felt like beached whales and decided that because it was a badly designed low beanbag couch you had to kinda roll to get momentum to stand up.  I roll to the right to get up and I didn’t realize she’d also decided to roll right. In such a way her face was directly in line with my ass. Her two eyes briefly stared at where my brown eye. 

As I released a bubble fart so bad I swear her hair ruffled in the breeze. I was chewing on it and my mouth was 4ft away from ground zero. 

She just looked hurt. Didn’t talk to me the rest of that weekend. It was some months before she even talked to me about anything non work related.
I'm legit laughing so hard outloud about this and my son keeps asking me what's wrong with me 😂 legit tears are about to come out of me.
I was diagnosed with UC at 11yo. In seventh grade math, dead of winter I let one rip. It was vile, like a burning dumpster full of loaded diapers and rotten eggs from the deepest pit of hell. While we were all gagging and coughing over it, my teacher was very excited to try out her new air fresheners.  The choice was vanilla or orange,  we picked orange. It didn't work and just added to the funk, making it worse and resulting in us having to open all the windows and bundle up for the rest of class. And that's the story of how I invented the scent of shitrus.

OP on the dancefloor.
I once had awful, paint-peeling turds at home. I turned on the bathroom fan, closed the door really tight, and hoped no one would notice. The fan worked great, blowing my terrible fumes right out through the roof.

A few minutes later, I hear the neighbors in their back yard. "PHWAAAW! WHAT IS THAT?" 

"I think we have a sewage leak!!!"

"EEEEEAGHH Let's go inside!"

Yes. I had a shit so foul it drove the neighbors out of their own back yard.
I had the weirdest fart ever on the come up of my first acid trip, weird in the sense that, it just didn't want to stop! Didn't particularly smell of much but I must have sat there for a good 30 seconds straight tooting the longest most glorious toot I've ever heard. And it was a loud one!
I farted in the grocery store. I was a couple aisles away when I heard a guy loudly proclaim "je$u$ chri$t  .  .  .  you can't even get away from it"
It's murder on the dance floor

But you better not kill the groove
EVEN THE DJ MADE A COMMENT LMFAOOO THIS SOME SITCOM SHIT😂😂😂😂
Patty melt sandwich and 2 pitchers of Coors Light. Almost killed 3 family members, and left an entire 2500 sq ft house uninhabitable for 30 minutes.
My brother almost got people trampled to death with a fart.  (MM- this is you, circa 1982).  We were at a very crowded Phi Tau college party - hundreds of people jammed into a house, more trying to get in, and Mike lets one go.  

It was a nauseating fecal fog of a fart. Those of us closest to ground zero pushed our way, gagging, toward the exit and fresh air. Due to the crowd still pushing in, it was tough going. We could hear the “that’s gross”, and “oh my god”, and “did someone shit their pants?” repeating over the music. 

But, we were not faster than the fart. People near us were catching the scent, and our panic, and joining the push to the door.  Our initial group of 5 became a pack of a dozen and grew,  pushing to open doors and climbing out open windows, all while people outside were still pushing in (and paying a dollar).  The fire alarm started going off about the time I made it to the porch.  

We regrouped across the street as the first fire engine arrived to the house with people pouring out the doors, climbing out the windows, including to the porch roof.  A couple kids were puking on the lawn (more likely drunk than gassed).  I was in favor of staying across the street to watch the chaos. The group elected to move along to another party, afraid Mike would be recognized as the perpetrator of the “Fart that cleared Phi Tau”.
Pregnancy really makes me gassy for some reason. When I was pregnant with my first I was releasing a bunch of silent but deadlies while on the couch watching TV with my dog. 

My husband came in the room and starts looking for something. He’s checking the corners, behind the couch, underneath the entertainment center and circles back around. I ask him what he’s looking for and he says, “I think the dog shit on the floor but I can’t find it.” 

And then I had to look that man dead in the face and tell him the dog didn’t shit on the floor 😞

The only fuck up is that you didn't go in a toxic gas costume - at least for the purposes of telling this story.

Thanks for the laugh. My dogs were checking to see if I was okay because I was laughing so hard I was wheezing.
Airborne Toxic Event meets Panic! at the Disco
My turn. I cleared out a whole gymnasium in high school. I had just returned from a trip to Bali. Now as people know there is an illness called Bali Belly where your guys aren't right for weeks. We were getting changed before sports class and I let out what can only be described as Satan's breath from my ass. It wafted there were a few comments then some dry heaving. Then the same from the girls locker room. This abomination spread throughout the gym requiring evacuation for the next 2 classes.
Best such story I heard was about an investment banker entertaining clients. After nights of alcohol binging he found himself on a private jet with his boss and the clients. After battling the demon in his bowels he called over the flight attendant for guidance. Unlike commercial jets this jet didn’t have a bathroom. The attendant had one of the clients get up and under the cushion was a wooden bowl, hand crafted, and never used. All pretences had passed and he announced his intentions, dropped his pants, and unleashed the foulest  mess into that hand sanded bowl. He gassed the whole fuselage and remained seated while still sweating. The passengers, his boss and the clients were forced to sit and smell his rancid ass for the rest of the flight.
A long time ago, I was helping repair a local high schools bleachers by the football field.  On day 3 of eating White Castles for lunch, I ripped one so foul it stayed under the bleachers in the wind for a couple of minutes.  I was proud and disgusted by the stench I created; and my cousin and the other person ran for safety.   I let one later at home, and my mom threw out my remaining burgers from the Crave Case I had bought. My cousin still brings this up when I get White Castle.
Omg thank you for this I laughed so hard
Years upon years ago I had gastric bypass. Istg my gas went from normal everyday people gas prior to surgery to OMG what crawled up your ass and died gas. I was in a larger shopette with my kids when they were way younger, like pre-teen/teen ages and could not hold it in. I left the aisle quickly to one aisle over with my kids silently mouthing a disgusted MOM! When out of nowhere we hear loud as day, Somebody done busted ass! My kids were mortified, it was the funniest thing ever istg
 Is this worse than Protein farts?
I once got drunk with a buddy on cheap boxed wine. It was so disgusting that we had to chug it down in big gulps. It was also so disgusting, and strong, that my buddy violently threw up. I was laughing so damn hard, like belly laughing like I never had before. Sitting sideways on a picnic table bench, with one leg on each side, I leaned back to fart, and shot liquid poop down both legs of my pants all the way to the backs of my knees. 

We were about a quarter mile from the barracks. The longest walk of my life. Both of us in very bad shape.
I’ve posted this before, but this post made me laugh so here it is:

A few years ago, prior to all the lockdown malarky, I was in London for a 2 day conference thing on robotics and automation - it was interesting, informative and to be honest a ‘jolly’ (UK term for a company expensed couple of days out)

I discovered that an old colleague and friend, Jim, was due to be there. Jim is the absolute best, he’s funny, crude, brilliant, personable and gives no fucks. I love Jim, he’s the guy I want by my side when things are dull. The 2 day conference was interesting, but dull, Jim and I caught up and on the evening of the first night, we went for burritos (from my favourite burrito place near Trafalgar Square) and beers. And a few more beers 

You know where this is going - Burritos from that place has an effect on me. Not a good one if you’re in close vicinity

The first morning session was fine, but in the second, my tummy was making noise. Hot, rumbling noise. The second session was a medium sized, packed conference room. PACKED. With no air conditioning. Jim was sat next to me and I leaned over to him and said - “Jim, I’m sorry”

The look of confusion on his face, makes me laugh even today. The look of horror on his face as he breathed in the rat death stench that blew from my ass was something to behold. Cue my giggling, your own farts don’t offend you and the first few were ok, the next few offended even me and it just got worse

Did I mention that the room was packed?. The people sat near me were first confused and then offended - a few left the room muttering phrases at me - there was no question that it was me, I was too busy trying to hold my laugh in. Jim was giggling too and regularly calling me a “smelly dirty bastard”

The presentation, I’ve no idea what it was about at all, but the memory and thought of that, genuinely makes me laugh to this day 🙂

Not the first time this has happened either,. I’ve cleared a train carriage before. And it was just as funny 🙈🙂
Lolling at the idea that you blew your own costume’s tail off, or something, and someone holding it aloft like some radioactive Cinderella shoe, trying to find who it “fits”.

That and the DJ doing the classic record scratch when it was discovered (which wouldn’t happen now with MP3s)

I know this isn’t how it went down but can’t stop lolling at the imagery. It sounds like you successfully evaded justice so well done for that.
Thanks for the laugh OP! I'm currently at work and read your story and all the comments and I was not disappointed. 

I've ate shrooms plenty of times but luckily never had any issues or farting while tripping. Now I'm going to be more cognizant of this when I trip again soon. 🤣
I once killed a house party with my wind. Thanks for the reminder and laugh, OP.
Shrooming with a mate whilst out wild swimming and enjoying nature...walking up a little country foot path surrounded by high hedges. Both farting and stinking, even we gagged. Little old lady walked by and we said careful "smells like a badgers ass and like somethings died down there"...her gags and her wafting her little hands made us brake are bolloxs laughing, making us fart more gagging like fuck at each other till i laughed,farted and fkn shat my self...in shorts...was in my trainers the lot and the smell made my mate throw up...Great times!!!
Did this at a club at The Hard Rock in Vegas. Figured the music was loud and nobody would hear it so I let it fly. I DID NOT consider the smell and oh man did it smell. A guy dancing next to my group looked directly at me? I shrugged and also acted disgusted.
Hahahahaha thank you
Coulda been worse someone might have had their nose down there when it happened
A friend of mine dropped ass like that in a small room.  Everyone cleared out and he was the last to walk out.  Everyone literally clapped as he emerged from the stink room.
Farts will never not be funny.
I farted in a cave once during a cave tour, we moved on but during the return trip an hour later it the smell was still there. Caves are dangerous
I was shopping near TJ Maxx one day and my stomach started cramping so badly I was sweating. So I ran into the TJ Maxx’s bathroom, which was thankfully empty, and started with the worst bout of diarrhea I’ve had in a long time. 


One unfortunate moment later, I heard the door open, the click-clack of heels, and then an old southern woman exclaim “Ewwwww LAWD”. The next thing I knew, her heels were scuttling as she quickly exited the bathroom before the door had even shut. 


I silently cried laughing.
I had to fart / poop so bad I fast walked all straight into a bathroom, sat down on the throne and it was go time. I could see shoes in the two stalls next to me. I was apologizing before it happened. So much air came out of my ass, it must had been 2 minutes straight of rocket boosting. I’m certain I sustained enough pressure to keep the water parted in the bowl. There was definitely poop and splashing. All I could think about is how much of a monster that my poor stall neighbors must have thought of me. I’ll never forget it, it was embarrassing and hilarious to me. I was probably yelling in sorry, while having tears in my eyes from how insanely maniacal and out of hand the situation was.
I haven't cleared a dancefloor.  That is a heroic effort.  But I have made my dog scream and never sleep in a particular place again.  
Turns out felafels and I don't get on well.  
Wife and I had felafel kebabs for dinner with all the trimmings.  
For a few hours I was fine.  A little after midnight, the ol tum-tum started to rumble.  Then it gurgle.  And then a fart.  
It woke my wife.  She shouted at me to go to the spare bedroom.  It was pretty bad.  Even I knew it was bad.  I heard the bedroom window open (middle of winter!).  Fans on. 
So I'm curled up in the spare bed.  Tooting away and feeling largely miserable at the smell.  Wife had to go to the bathroom.  Which involved walking past the spare-bedroom.  "F#$K SAKE!  SHUT THIS F#$KING DOOR!"  Slammed the door shut to spare bedroom.  
So now I'm stewing in the spare bedroom.  No choice for it.  Time to open the bedroom window.  (It was cold and there weren't enough blankets/doonas in the spare room).  
The room started to vent.  
My dog used to like sleeping in the garden bed outside the bedroom window (A very fluffy dog).  
About 40 seconds after opening the window I heard the loudest yelp I've ever heard from my dog and then a sound of him running away making a noise that can only be described as "YIIYIIYIYIIIYIIIYIIIYIIIIYIIIII"  
He never slept in that garden bed again.  
And that's the story of why I'm banned from eating felafels.
Not a fuck up, that is a fart I dream of having, but while strolling the busiest boomer aisle at Walmart or something. Then look at them like they let that out.
Worked on the 5th floor of a bank when I was younger and one morning a group of about 5 of us was waiting for the the elevator. The doors opened up to the empty elevator and we all started to pile on and I was at the back and the next thing I know everyone in front of me reversed and got off the elevator. I didn’t even make it on the elevator because someone left the foulest fart on it that stop all those people in front of me in their tracks.
This reminds me of my top post from several years ago:

Last night my family and I had to go make a Home Depot run and grab some dinner. We'd been working all day on stuff around the house, and I hadn't taken the time for my mid-day poop (it just never really...came up...) Once we finally settled down to grab a bite to eat, things started to settle in my bowels too. It was a quick dinner (Firehouse subs) and off to Home Depot. After letting things settle while eating (and eating to start getting things moving) the walking around Home Depot had started the gas factory into full churn mode. I crop dusted a few random aisles in Home Depot before we got into the car. Nothing major. But on the way home, I started to feel the warning rumbles of something I knew would be foul. I tried to be polite. I really did. I opened the window. My wife...she should have known this was a sign of something. We almost never drive with the windows open. Did she ask me why I opened the window? No. Did she pause to consider that there might have been a reason I opened it? No. She just said "Close the window!" And my daughter immediately followed suit, "Yea, close the window, please." (At least she used manners)

Well...I closed it without a word. Then let loose the longest warmest SBD I've done in a while. It was one of those farts that you could just tell by the way it felt that you just KNOW it's going to be foul. And foul, it was. Now, [everyone likes their own brand, don't they?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6PRtt_jLUE) But it was pretty foul even for me. It was a slow traveler too. I got it first, and I think it might have melted my nose hairs... but I sat silently and waited. It hit my wife a few seconds later who loudly proclaimed "WHOA! Jesus Christ, SgtMac!" Then my daughter pipes up with, "What? What's the mat-- OH MY GOD!" My son...boy he's a man after my own heart. He and I just laughed our asses off as I left the windows closed and everyone died just a little, and the interior of my car began to melt under the penetrating fury of my biological attack.

Next time someone in the car decides to randomly open the window, you might want to pause and ask why.

TL;DR, Got dinner, ran errands, filled the car up with gas.
When I was nursing I crop dusted a whole respiratory unit thinking it would be fine (had not eaten anything that would cause horrific gas). 

These poor bastards are almost all there for cancer (lung & throat mostly) & I can only imagine that I caused a little more damage with whatever the fuck seeped out of my arse that day.
Funkadelic
Thought it was just me that gets bubble guts from mushrooms. Glad to know I’m not alone.
Impressive 
It's murder on the dance floor  
You better not kill the groove  
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
Why are fart and poo stories so dang funny?  We ALL have them.  We have all had OOPS events.  

I was forced to go to a strip club with co-workers.  Honestly, I'm just not in to them.  But whatever.  

My co-workers and I were in the main room sitting around the stage.  I let one squeak out.  I'm not exaggerating. CLEARED the room - a good 100 people left the room.  It was SO bad.  The only people left in the room was my coworkers and I and the stripper.  And we were alternating between gagging and laughing our asses off.  She was too.

Stripper confronted us, I blamed it on my coworker. 

He bought a table dance from her JUST to clear his name.  Hahaha.  She came back from the table and told me that I had something seriously wrong in my colon.
You only fkd up if you got caught
Okay the DJ commenting is hilarious but the LIGHTS holy shit THE LIGHTS. Like the fire department was 5 seconds away from being called.  The SWAT team was gonna repel down from the rafters. That party was about to get full on shut down. I'm impressed. This story made my night, thank you ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
When i was going to jail frequently (in my younger days), I would save my  oranges till i had 8-9. Eat em all at once and wait for the fun. The trick is you can't laugh or they'll know it's was you. Lasts about 12 hours or so
Concert. Standing room only. Korean fried chicken for dinner...

We had the clearest view in the whole place.
When I was in college, one of the most popular guys from my high school (he went to the same college) asked me on a date when I was home one weekend. 

Mr Popular walked me to the back door and was kissing me good night. My brother was home, and not knowing we were just outside the door, let the biggest fart rip.  

I was mortified, but also was absolutely howling with laughter. Not sure if my bro scared him off, but that was our only date.
One time in college, my group of friends, guys and gals were on an early semester lake trip, on the road in the heat. I had to cram in the back of our friends mom’s econoline van which had me irritated but half way through we were stopping and switching places at a gas station to grab drinks and mixers. In all my 21 year old wisdom I though it would be hilarious as the last one off the van to let one loose… I was a 21 year old, protein shake, beer and pizza fueled college kid. This was a terrible idea. We went inside to grab our refreshments for the road and this van sat in the sun BAKING! When we came back they opened the back to throw in all the soda beer and took my gas right to the face. One of the funniest moments in my college career but it turned the entire parking lot into mayhem, everyone screaming and yelling about what happened, tear were rolling down my face and I couldn’t hide the fact that I was the perp. Well, after about 15 minutes running the air and windows down we piled back in and I was forced to forfeit my seat change privilege. Also I was basically shunned by the girls the rest of the trip. 

Got some real consequences haha…. But honestly, I REGRET NOTHING!!! Haha sorry it happened to you OP but I say OWN IT haha this is amazing, thank you for the laugh.
There's a place in Atlanta called the masquerade right? Well there's two floors, heaven and hell. I was in heaven and farted right next to where they served food and drinks and cleared the area. The singer for the band literally said on the mic "drinks will resume being served when the smell of eggs has cleared the area". So don't feel bad. It happens.
I’m sitting on a couch at my gym reading this,I just crop dusted the free weight area so bad that the gym attendant is over there mopping the area.
Just be glad nothing followed it....
I have done this also. Not a great feeling to clear a dance floor and have ppl audibly gasp and curse
Dude, that was you???
Worst one I have ever had was in High School. Has a fellow student that thought it was funny to get up and fart in front of me several times during self study. I had loaded taco salad brewing and released the most silent, burning wheeze of a fart I have ever done. I then got up and went into the bathroom to clear out the system. When I came out everyone but said student was in the hallway and the teachers aide was on her 2nd can of Lysol air freshener. Said serial farter was stuck in the back corner having to deal with the nose burner. Was told by the teacher after class that if I ever let another one of those go I was banned from his classroom.
My dad broke wind in ou basement and set off the smoke detector! My mom thought for sure Dad was smoking in the basement but it was his fart. Us 5 kids laughed for years over that one! I had no idea crop dusting could be like methane and trigger the smoke detector.
My husband once farted on an escalator. It sat like a cloud and we saw everyone behind us get smacked in the face by it.
I had a friend who had previously been a sheet metal worker. One night after work he rerouted the bathroom exhaust fan venting into his boss’s hvac ductwork in his adjacent office. Yep, every time someone left a steamer the bathroom fan routed it to the boss’s office. It took a while for him to figure out where the smells were coming from. My friend didn’t get in real trouble but did have to eventually fix the ductwork. I’m honestly envious, my boss also had an office next door to the bathroom but I don’t have my friends sheet metal skills…
There are probably a million bars with the layout you describe but there is a bar in Chicago called Matilda’s with a main bar on the ground floor and then a dance floor downstairs. Funny part is in the downstairs area, there is a giant light up sign that just says “ASS”. I’d like to think that’s where you were when this happened lmfaoo
[deleted]
One time, I apparently let one go while I was sleeping.  I sat straight up in bed thinking that the house was on fire.
I had a colleague that when under pressure used to produce farts of the rotten dead stuff grade.

Once we went to a convention for work at one of those big Marriott's palaces. We were exiting from those big slow revolving doors at the entrance.

The little mofo was at the door section in front of us, he let out one of his deadly products. One of the longest moments in my life waiting for the door to revolve, to escape the intoxicated enclosure, in the meanwhile that criminal of our colleague was in front of us watching from the other side of the glass.
One time the set of men in black had to evacuate because of will smiths .. talents .. as well

[Brought of memories of a post from many years back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/qkr1ux/comment/hiz9xuz/)
No joke, but my worst fear would be passing gas during a pivotal moment in my life. Whether that be approaching a girl for a date (costing me a potential relationship), during a job interview, meeting the president of the world,   or alerting my enemies to my presence as I try to escape their base of operation (prisoner).
At work we have to wear CO monitors. I was eating lunch one day when I felt the urge. It felt like a silent one, so I let it slip out. 30 seconds go by and next thing I know, my CO monitor starts alerting with both flashing lights and sound so everyone can see that I'm the culprit. Terrible way to learn that CO monitors pick up farts
one time i had to pee really badly after watching a movie, so i went to the cinema bathroom to a fairly packed post-movie bathroom. started to pee and for some inexplicable reason, i started whistling, high pitch whistling, from my ass. I tried stopping and resuming, to see if i could stop whistling. I couldn't. I just started laughing and peed away with a weeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEE background.
Many years ago while working at a public library, I let loose a true SBD while shelving in the Children’s DVD area. True bunker buster — Imagine opening a bag of Lays and, instead of chips, it’s a portal to the most sulfurous den of hell (though still with a notably oil and potato-y flair for some reason).

A mom and her little kid, maybe three years old, were browsing and the lady starts gagging but is trying to hold it together. She gets down on eye-level with her toddler (right behind me) and asks “Buddy, do you need to poop?” Kid denies it vehemently, but she doesn’t believe him whatsoever and ends up dragging him kicking and screaming to the bathroom up front. I shelve one more VeggieTales DVD and make my way to the break room to hang my head in shame for letting little man take the heat.
my ex and i both had really bad gas, and we would let them rip pretty freely around one another. one time, we had just eaten pizza and were getting picked up by his sister and brother-in-law to go hang out. we both had gurgly stomachs and were talking about it when the car pulled up. we (somehow) mutually decided to fart before getting into the car so we wouldn't have to be uncomfortable the whole ride (i'm not sure if this was coincidence or we coordinated it)

didn't exactly go as planned, lmao. we both farted, opened the doors, and jumped into the backseat - and completely misjudged it. you see, it was winter, and we had heavy layers of pants on. the call was coming from inside the house. it wasn't until about a minute later both stinks HIT, and everyone was trapped at that point. i remember his sister gagging and BIL going "dude, what the fuck" and rolling down a window. 

similar thing happened several times on the subway as well - one of us would let one rip on the platform, hop on the train, and as the doors close realize in horror that the stink boarded the train, too. once had a 85 year old man shove a tissue up his nostrils to block it out and had to sit there with the straightest of faces as if i too were a victim of circumstance and didn't just nuke the car.
I was once at a concert in Denver seing one of my favorite bands. The band was on stage doing their sound check, I was in the front row, and I had to release a little air from my rectum. It was fairly loud in the venue, so there was no audio clue, but about 30 seconds after I vented, I see the bassist look over at the guitarist and go "dude, do you smell that fart?" I figured with fans and a massive HVAC system in the place it would dissipate quickly, but it did not.
Was having a convo with an elderly Irish woman who lives across the alley, just general talk about family etc. While telling me a story about her kids growing up she let fly with a perfect monotone ripper, one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand four, one thousand five, while never hesitating in the story, no acknowledgement of any kind while continuing in her brogue which is hard enough to understand, and never breaking eye contact. It was long enough before I could get past 'well that just happened' enough to pay attention and apparently missed whatever the heartwarming point of the story was. And she frowned like it was on me for zoning out of the conversation
Thing about dance farts is when it's mostly women the dude always catches the blame. Everytime with the eyes lmao
Back in college, my new roommate's first night in town, his first bar, my favorite watering hole...He farted so hard, and the absolute sheer terror on his face when the smell hit him. He looked like death was facing him, pure white, eyes bulging. He said "we've got to go, we have go right now, RIGHT NOW" and the crowd cleared out and parted like the Red Sea. Frat boys were dry heaving, we went right out the front entrance and left a wake of destruction. Then he got drunk at the bar next door and bought 3 hot dogs off a street vendor and threw them inside some asshole's open jeep, mustard flying and all.
Rocked out with your knock out!!  Lol
That's a moment of pride!
Never trust the shroom farts. They are wicked.
Well at least you in a club where you could leave , imagine in a plane ?
Was there a mushroom cloud too?
To be fair, there should have been enough fresh air coming in and stale air exhausting, especially in a night club, for that to not linger so long.
Had a similar issue on the dance floor of a wedding. They served tacos at the reception and after a few hours of digestion and dancing, a stinky skunk snuck out. I cleared about half the dance floor and someone blurted “someone needs some toilet paper!” Moral of the story tacos and dancing is a dangerous combo
Same story happened to me but I was chilling and someone ripped ass twice bad on the floor
> mushroom gas smelled so bad that it cleared out a Halloween party and the DJ even made a comment about how bad it smelled

Not me, but I've experienced the worst smell on a fishing tournament trip. A family friend owns an A frame on a lake in Vermont. six of us bunk there for a BASS tournament once a year. One guy decides to have a burger with a portabello mushroom. That read it's head when we were playing cards later that night. That smell plus the small house equated to what could be classified as a gas-chamber.
Ignore this comment. Just need to save this thread to read later. I’m a few posts in and laughing my face off. I’m at work and can’t laugh as hard as I want right now
thank you for this story...morning chuckles
So this wasn’t an actual fart, but in high school I was a band geek. I was in the percussion section, and we sat behind the clarinets. 

One morning a fellow percussionist pulled out a tube of “fart spray” he got from Spencers, and snuck behind the xylophone to spray under the clarinet players. 

While the rest of the band is practicing, the clarinetists suddenly stop playing and yell “Ewwwww!” The band director and everyone but the percussion section is confused by the commotion. Meanwhile we’re trying not to laugh too hard and give ourselves away.
I stealthily squeaked out an SBD during class my freshman year of high school. I could visualize the growing cloud of toxic gas floating through the room as student after student began waving their notebooks and gagging, then yelling about who could have possibly done such a thing. The teacher made everybody open the windows and the big ceiling fans were turned on. But I never got ID'd. 

I realize 20 years later that I was not a good actor and everybody probably assumed it was me and were just being nice not bringing it up.
Reminds me of the [Post Office Fart](https://youtu.be/VNlM-U_Jwnw?si=w5SSDL5p3I09FEho) story from MFM animated!
A bunch of coworkers and I went to a mexican place once, and one, who somewhat recently became lactose intolerant, went. He is pretty good at making sure to not get any dairy in his stuff. Even a single shred of cheese can set him off into some mild symptoms, but a lot won't completely seal him up. The mexican place forgot that he asked no dairy, so he took one bite, realized it was full of queso and then just decided to bite the bullet and continue eating. After a bit he got to the point where he needed to go to the bathroom. After about 5 minutes we saw a walk into the bathroom and immediately leave with all the color on his face gone like he had seen a ghost.
I once took a shit at a Dick's sporting goods that cleared oit the entire fishing section because the smell from the bathroom had wafted out of the bathroom and flooded the 5 or 6 aisles outside of it. My stepdad saw people fleeing there swearing and came over to check on me. He was always very resistant to smells, after all he married my mother, so he just open the door and asked if I was okay, because it smelled like raw sewage out there. I don't know if anyone else ever identified it was me, but man was that rank.
About 15-20 years ago, I was in a video rental store with my girlfriend at the time. This was in Southern California, I had just had some menudo from the little Mexican place around the corner, and I felt a fart coming on. So I told my gf that I was going to check out some of the horror movies, since that corner of the store wasn't busy. Anyway, I go to release it, and, no kidding, I felt it roll down my leg. I seriously thought I had just shit myself, but there was nothing on the floor, and I checked later and no. But it stunk. Like a dead animal. I came back over and she asked me if I had found anything, and I said, "No, I might go check in a minute again though. Smells funny over there." I was waiting with the smell to dissipate, but it never did. I smelled it every time I went there, and I saw several people go over there and gag. The smell lingered there like it was a solid. They actually had everyone leave the store, because they thought some animal had died in the vent and maybe that was making it stink, so they were going to have building maintenance come and check it out. And I said nothing! My girlfriend was right next to me!
My claim to fame was clearing out a party full of hockey players after a particularly raucous blast of ass. Have you ever smelled sweaty, stale, hockey gear? It's really saying something when the guys who put that gear on almost daily have to leave the room because of the unpleasant aroma...
Legitimately horrifying, but this pic that was in my feed immediately after your post was....well.....🤣

For some reason, my farts become generally stinkless over the last few years.   I mean, yes, sometimes they do, but not like the old days.  Meds, maybe, happened after some righteous antibiotics and med changes.

Anyway -generally is not never stink.

Got cocky this morning let a small one go, right into the space heater beside me.   Wow.   

  
Years ago, ate a whole tin of cashews, went to bed.   Stench woke me up, I kicked the dog outside,went back to bed, and farted.  It was me, and it was lethal.   Went to let Bear back in the house, and he refused.

24 hours of that plus playdough poops.
This is the funniest post I’ve ever read.  I am laughing so hard, I’m crying 🤣🤣🤣
My Mom used to do this everywhere. To make it worse she would cut one in a store, walk off, then im standing there in the green fog looking guilty.

Accidentally got her back years later. We were in a McDonalds and both went to the bathroom. I first went into the stall just to blow my nose. She went in after me and shortly started yelling that I had left pee on the toilet seat. I said nope thats not my pee. Ewwwww.
Was going to night school and had diarrhea.  As soon as class was over, I booked it out of there.  I had some bad cramps and something had to give. Cue the blue lights behind me just as I let out the kind of fart that becomes an entity in a Stephen King novel.  I’ll never forget the way that poor cop stuck his head in the window and then pulled back, like I was radioactive. I think the only reason he went back to the cruiser was because he was waiting for the air to clear.  Didn’t get a ticket, though.
I once ripped ass so bad in a line on a cruise ship that a person close by asked a staff member if the ship was having sewage issues.
One December I was out shopping with the wife. I had  been drinking the night before and my gas was rank. While my wife was waiting in line, I was standing a little ways off. 

I let out a sizable, silent, and deadly one. I inconspicuously repositioned from that area, but within observation range. 

Not long after I had moved, two teenage girls, chatting, stepped into the space I just vacated. Within seconds their faces cringed and I heard one of them say “Oh my god, it smells like fart in here!!” And they quickly moved away. 

Unfortunately, my wife had to walk through that area, and she got a taste too. She immediately looked at me and gave me the annoyed wife snarl of disgust. 

It was a good day.
I had to save this post to come back to the comments because I should be sleeping but this is the most I've laughed in a while and I need to return at some point to continue reading/laughing. THANK YOU OP for blessing us with such cheerful content.
I once shat the most disgusting little fella in a stall at work. Like it really stung within the nose. Another coworker walked in the bathroom and yelled OH MY GOD! turned around and left with gagging notices. The bathroom had no windows so imagine the mists of Avalon slowly creeping through the hallways into the offices. People left the building while I was still sitting in there working on my exit plan.
Sometimes I sleep with the sheet thrown over my head. I must have farted in my sleep, but it was the smell that woke me. I will never forget telling my friend and him just going "you realize that you farted so bad that your brain thought you were at threat of dying and woke you out of a dead sleep to save you?"
I did this at work once. Ripped it right before the shift started and one of my coworkers walked right by me and froze… he turned to someone else and uttered, “What smells like death?!”
The best part of this is calling it "passing gas".
LMFAO
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Don’t worry OP, it wasn’t you. I was at the same bar and accidentally stepped on a diseased mouse eating a rotten egg.
This was the giggle I needed for the day, thank you.
I think I'm in love!!
The psilocybin farts be somethin’ else lol.
How bad must it have been? I've let off toxic bombs because of my lactose intolerance and nobody even blinked. The amount of cologne and perfume present at a club is typically overwhelming.
💩🤣🤣💩🤣🤣💩💩🔥💪 atta girl 
I would be so proud of myself if I did this.
Girl this is funny as fuck. I love that you were vibing on mushies. Sorry you were embarrassed. But it made a great story 😂
🎶THE MOTHER OF TOXIC GAS AND CHEMICAL WARFARE! HER DARK CREATION HAS BEEN REVEALED. 🎶
Nice try Government, women don’t fart
I had a good one in a small wine shop/bar once . Wasn’t that loud just a little quack , my friends thought it was the floor creaking . Went outside and had to wait for someone . Saw through the window the moment it hit the poor woman who was sat in that room and starting gagging and coughing and punching her bf blaming him for it 😂. I might have ruined a relationship there 🤔🙈🤷‍♂️😂
Thanks for posting this!

The funniest one that I was responsible for was in that small enclosed car used in Universal Studios old Simpsons ride.  

It was basically just a car that fit 2 families in it at a time, and would move and shake in front of a huge screen to match the movements.

Anyway, I usually avoid super greasy food, but had some because I was in a theme park!  About halfway through the ride I let this long, silent one go.  But it felt super warm so I knew it would be awful...that poor family behind me!   Just then the screen showed Marge changing Maggie's diaper.  The mom behind me then said "Oh wow, it even SMELLS like baby diapers, impressive!"   The smell lasted the rest of the trip, not sure if they suspected but my wife instantly recognized me lol
I once tried to squeak out a fart on the dance floor at senior prom. I actually released a long, silent fart that cleared out the dance floor.
[The post immediately beneath this one](https://www.reddit.com/u/Legend_of_Mushroom/s/n48R9Fv1mP)
My son was in sixth grade, ripped one so bad in class. The teacher thought it was a natural gas leak stop the class and they called the fire department.
One basketball practice in high school my stomach was acting up (ibs) so I ripped one at mid court, as the offense dribbled down to practice the play we were working on the guard brining up the ball audible starts gagging and laughing going “ holy shit wtf” my dad who was the coach cones over waving his hands and getting mad until he enters the death cloud and starts gagging too. At this point said ass cloud has expanded to most of the court and the whole team was crying laughing and gagging and practice stopped for about 15 minutes. Still proud to this day
I had a big shart on shrooms. The evil exited my body in smell and substance. Never fart on shrooms!
Years ago I was out in a bar in Calgary with a bunch of people. Prior I was drinking this home made pilsner beer my buddy made, along with  copious amount of vegetables from a veggie tray. It was a deadly combination. As I was standing talking to a guy, I let a silent but life altering fart go. We both stepped back from the shock of the smell. There was an empty table next to us and this hot young blonde came rushing up and started to ask if the table was taken, and she stopped mid sentence when it hit her. One of the most hilarious looks I've ever seen on a person's face. She looked up at us with disgust, and then turned and left. The stank just hung around, multiple people kept saying what's that smell. I consider it a life achievement to be able to clear a whole section of bar.
Caused panic at the disco, apparently.
IT WAS YOU!!!!!!
I too have clear both a dance floor and a nightclub 

I was DJing at this small club, warm up set, I was playing bangers but couldn't seem to keep people on the floor. There was a window behind me which I had opened to let a breeze on the dance floor.

I knew I was dropping gusters but figured if I couldn't smell it, it wasn't that bad. 

Until about half way through my set I dropped a particularly large gust of a fart. I lifted my head to see 2 young lasses gag in front of me and run off the dancefloor  - fuck - I look around and can dimly see people hanging around the edge of the floor giving me dirty looks. Now they knew I knew. Two bangers later all was forgotten, or so I tell myself...
I work in a meat department, I was walking the counter with my boss when I let out a silent but deadly. 10 seconds later my boss says somethings rotten in here, and starts sniffing packages down for line for about 10 feet. Until she gets pissed I wasn't helping.
We had a guy leave his current company and one of the things that sold him was our building was bigger so he didn’t have to share the bathroom with 6 ladies anymore.  He worked in a small branch office with 1 bathroom.  Dude would leave and go to McDonald’s rather than use the crapper at his own office.
My grandfather is partially deaf. I think he forgot farts make noise or he doesn't care. Last time I was out with him he parted in the bank line, it was horrible smelling! I told him I'd wait in the car. He got all huffy and said it's natural. I was not the only one to leave.  


Other story, my MIL is living with us temporarily. She farts everywhere. Dinner table, living room, middle of conversations and while she's walking past someone. It is always loud. She gives a tiny, excuse me, and carries on like it's nothing. I've had to tell my kids only the elderly can do this because my 6 and 8 year old decided to start farting openly in public. She has no table manners and cares not. It's really hard to teach my kids when she is around
I'm lactose intolerant but if I take Lact-aid, it usually helps. Well my husband brought home a new ice cream flavor to try. I popped my lactaid and dug in to a bowl. We watch our movie without event and go to bed shortly after. 

Well there was something else in this ice cream that didn't agree with me or something because my stomach started bubbling. We also had cabbage soup for dinner so that didn't help. 

My husband is asleep already and I finally start to doze off. I guess I relaxed too much and the biggest fart just ripped right out of me. It was loud enough to wake him up and when he sat up, he could smell it...like sour milk and old cabbage. The smell had me gagging as well. He yells "WHAT THE FUCK DIESEL" (our poor innocent dog). He was fully convinced our dog shit on the floor. He starts throwing lights on to check the floor and I am suffocating my laughter in the blankets.
I farted out a real stink bomb once at McDonald’s at a family sitting next to me for allowing their kids to be annoying.  Table got silent all of a sudden.
Just make sure you are the first to comment “ My god who dropped that” it always works for me 😂
I remember attending a middle school dance once. As me and a friend were trying to maneuver through the packed dance floor, a female teacher presses her backside up against me and fucking farts on me, and then quickly takes off through the crowed. That shit was ripe and caused me to gag a few times. The smell was so horrid that even after 20 years I haven’t forgotten what that filthy b!tch did…lol
I was probably 13 when my family took us to Disney world for the first time. We rode the train ride in the big silver sphere, which is essentially an open-air inside train that two people face outward toward the vignettes. 
I let one go, possibly one of the top five worst of my life. 
As the train kept progressing, the vile cloud stayed put, exposing the unwitting passengers behind me to the horrible stench. 
You could hear as they entered the cloud, gasping for air one car at a time as they passed through. 
That was 30 years ago and I still remember it fondly.
OMG!! Reminds me of my experience while stationed in Germany back in the 90s.

I LOVED to get absolutely trashed. I was always going to the club with my friends and we'd dance most of the night, sometimes with the ladies, often just us guys. 

I was feeling most excellent and ripped a big one. Since I was feeling so good, I'd been dancing with my eyes closed. When I opened them, I was the only idiot on the dance floor while everyone around was fanning the air back at me.

I just shrugged and kept dancing. Not much else I could do at that point!
“I went upstairs because I couldn’t stand the smell of my own ass” 

Is fuckin golden lol, I am 100% dropping that line into something in the immediate future.
I cleared an ENTIRE HOUSE at a house party. After the previous day beer and broccoli dinner. It was so impressive I had to claim it
That's awesome!! One time I had gas real bad so I took 3 dryer sheets and molded them to the seat of my pants between my briefs. It was hilarious. I smelled like gain really strong then sharp cheddar shit smell at the end.
It was wintertime in Texas. My mother, brother, and I went out to buy our first real Christmas tree. We stopped to pick up Sonic on the way there. I don't remember how my brother convinced my mother as he is lactose intolerant, but we ended up with milkshakes. Big. Mistake. Immediately his stomach is waging war on the occupants of the vehicle. It was like he gave birth to The Golgothan right there in the back of the car. Of course he's howling with laughter while my mother and I are having to hang our heads out the windows. The air inside was far too toxic. It was so horrible that my mother was threatening to leave him on the side of the road. 

Eventually, we got to the spot to pick out a Christmas tree and probably spent over an hour there. By this point, we had forgotten about the turd ghost, but it didn't forget us because it was still lingering in the car! He was promptly banned from having milkshakes.
I had to step out of the office once to the mezzanine outside to release my own SBD, when my work crush comes and stands next to me to chat for a second and then goes "Do you smell rotten eggs?" I was like "Uhh...hm nope no I don't smell anything maybe that trashcan is full hey look at that bird oh nope that's a leaf or no wait it is a bird weird so what are you uh what do how's the weekend how bye"
Oh man you can tell the mushroom noobs when you smell them. The pros are at home with chill music in a place of comfort.
The best thing about hilarious fart posts is that everyone else starts sharing their best fart stories.
I, unfortunately, do not have an incredible fart story to share (yet) though I have never been able to forget [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fn5gr/comment/c1hdgwv/) that I read years and years ago. Absolute *gold.* One of the greatest comments I have *ever* read on Reddit.
in hs I was doing sit ups and ripped ass on the way up and I was mortified esp cuz there was someone holding my feet and like 20 other ppl in the room (half also doing sit ups) I’m dying again while reliving this
My younger brother and I grew up between states because our parents were divorced. We spent a lot of time going back and forth. On one flight we had multiple layovers. Up down, up down. From cali to seattle. On our last leg when we were heading back up from our Portland stop an awful smell hit the cabin.  It spread quickly even the flight attendants quickly checked the bathrooms for some sort of error. My younger brother who was 10 at the time kept giggling and playing his Gameboy, (yeah I feel old). Two rows back a baby started crying upon our altitude gain. The older woman to my left states how she wished the mother had taken the landing and departure of seats to change the baby's diaper. Upon hearing that my brother laughed loudly and made things kinda awkward, never looking up from his gameboy. People began turning on the air to try and cycle the God awful death smell out of the cabin only to eviscerate the entire cabin more quickly. Meanwhile everyone in the cabin with small kids is doing the butt smell.  The lady with the crying baby literally at one point said loud enough for others to hear, " its not my baby the diapers clean" Finally we hit Seattle! I've never seen a plane de boarded more quickly and in such an orderly fashion. Heading up the ramp my brother is giggling and laughing. At this point I'm like what the hell are you laughing at. As we are just about to meet my mom at the end of the ramp he says, " that was me, we will remember this flight for the rest of our lives." We still both talk about this and laugh a lot about how a 10 yo killed an entire aircraft with the flatulence.
I'm crying!
>a real gas giant

Fucking gold
When I was in 7th grade we had a math test and I can feel my gut turning. At the beginning of it. I keep holding in my parts because I'm not trying to make a scene just take the stupid test. I finally can't hold it in anymore and rip a super loud one. Everyone but the teacher and myself busts out laughing for a good few mins. It's only obvious it was me. The teacher holds me after class to call my mom and tell her I was farting all through class and laughing about it. My mom worked nights so she was woken up in the middle of the day for it and when I got home I thought she'd be mad at me for getting her woken up. She wasn't and we still joke about it to this day.
Imagine the kids just panicking trying to get out of the tunnel LMAO
Upvoted for the geeky gas giant reference. 👍
O this is classic!!! 😂
Omg Robert is that you 🤣🤣🤣🔥💩
I farted so loud in my 6th grade class that no one could identify it as coming from a human.   Everyone thought it was a car backfire.
Not as good as yours and only tangentially related (on two points), but when I was younger in a dark room at a planetarium I really had to pee. Being young and dumb I thought that I could pee just a little to relieve the pressure and go about my day. So I felt my way to a secluded corner and started. I only meant to go for like a couple seconds, but when I went to stop I just…couldn’t. 

I peed so long and so much I had to start backing out of the corner and spraying it on the walls to not let the sound of water pouring into a puddle give me away. I never got caught but I did hear an adult scream from the dark room “oh come on! What the hell!?!?”
I'm dead


Lol
Real stories in the comments moment!
The new "Make Your Own Gas Chamber" from Whammo
I can tell from your username this was a formative experience.  I had to get out of bed because I was shaking it so much from trying to laugh quietly.  Husband snored, turned over and said “stop it”.  Which got me going again.

Ripped ass and gas giant are glued into my brain now,  thank you.  🙏

Here it is
Oh no I thought we stopped gas chambering children
I just picture 6 years later you walking at graduation and turning to yell at the class, Jim Carey style, "it was MEEEEEE. Starlab was MEEEEEE!"
I did that in a clear plastic bubble tent on the side of a lake that is used for changing out of wet fishing waders, etc back in to street clothes during the cold, winter months. Days of rich jerky, seafood, and beer had everyone gagging and running for the exits half-dressed.
Oh nooo, I’m so sorry.  I’m just going to say I looked up Starlab and that thing looks awesome!  I mean, not what the gaseous emissions but otherwise, very cool!
Oh my gosh core memory unlocked! Those Star labs were so cool! But uh definitely Dutch ovens 🤣
This is what space smells like.
I've taught in those star bubbles at grade schools. Let me tell you, you are not the first or the last to dutch oven those things. Also, ours had a rule of no shoes, so all the kids had to take their shoes off at the entrance and some of those kids needed their parents to do laundry like 2 weeks ago.

 Boss and I would keep febreeze next to the intake fan and spray it so it would get pulled in after the worst of smells. (We weren't allowed to spray inside the actual bubble.)
I bought gold for the first time just for you. Heck, it’s my birthday. Thanks for making me *almost* choke while I ate my chocolate pie. You’re hilarious.
I did this to a group of college kids at blockbuster. Ripped a gnarly fart and moved over to the next isle. Then 3 college kids walk right into the cloud. They started cussing saying what in the fuck is that smell. My friend and I started dying laughing, and they had to know it was one of us.
My dad would do this in grocery stores -- lay a stink bomb at one end of the aisle, then race down to the end of the aisle and peek around the corner to see who would walk into it.
My gorgeous daughter used to sneak up to me in the library and fart, then run away.
I recently crop dusted an old timer at a Lowes, in the garden section. He heard it and called me a sonofabitch.
I snuck away to a hidden bathroom no one else used. I don't know what I ate, but it was awful, and like mid session, someone walked in said "what the hell," and then gagged while running away. I should have been embarrassed but I couldn't stop laughing.
If she actually thinks that people need to asses the caliber of the shit they're about to take and then GO HOME to handle it shes fucking insane. Besides, If you gotta handle a heinous bowel movement you generally dont have all the time in the world. Unhinged bro
My last boss made us leave the fan off. You should never know what your co-worker's shit smells like!
I had a girlfriend who warned me near the beginning of the relationship that passing gas, for her, was sometimes a dangerous experience for people near the area. She said it was noxious. Her dad asked me once if I had experienced the gas, I said no. Her brother also gave me fair warning. 3x warned about this. 

One day we are laying in bed, and my bed sat against the wall. I was against the wall. Out of nowhere, she just says "Oh no...oh you gotta leave!" And I was quite warm and comfy in bed, so I said "Just fan it out, it can't be that bad," because she had passed gas around me before and it didn't blow me away. So I'd figured the gas was blown out of proportion. 

Boy was I wrong. I tried to fan it out, it immediately overwhelmed me. That shit burnt my eyes. I couldn't really run away from it. I tripped getting out of bed. I tried to take a breath and I couldn't. I ran to the kitchen, it followed me. 30 minutes passed. We couldn't go to bed, even she couldn't go in the room. It finally aired out. In the meantime I asked her politely, but firmly, to do that... since she apparently knew when it was coming, in the bathroom with the fan on.
I had this happen to me except I was in the stall and people came in. My intestines felt like they were in knots. Two co-workers came in and I could overhear them talking about how bad it smelled. "Wow, it smells like something died in here." "Just make sure you don't light a match." 😭
Ah, a fellow poop ninja. When i worked in an office, I got really good at this.
Gone home to go? 
1) how are you gonna know it’s that bad in advance? and 
B) you think I’m gonna risk waiting till I get somewhere else? That’s just asking to shit yourself!
When I was in college (guy here) was dating a girl and first time she slept over with me I had to work very early and I told her to sleep in if she wants and leave whenever, just make sure the door is locked. So I open my door and then realized I forgot my server apron so I close the door. So she thinks I'm gone now. I walk back to my room and right when I put my hand on the door to open it I hear a brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and another brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I'm like 'wtf?!?!?!?!?!'. And I had to get my apron or I would be late. I open the door and she immediately screams and says NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I said 'did you just' and she said 'yeah.........a lot.....'. Then she put the covers over her head and pretty much cried. Thankfully, I had my first morning fart coming on and I just say "hey" and I let it rip and she laughs and thanked me for doing that. Never been complimented for farting before. And after that we were fart buddies, she was damn gassy though I learned, she farted all the time. Every time we did rimjobs (we were kinky) I prayed she wouldn't let one loose.
Someone at my work apparently had a really rotten stomach day.  


We thought there was a sewage leak and actually shut down the women's room for half the day trying to find it ...
There was this dude at my last job that did *something* in the bathroom several times a day. 

He'd be in there for *at least* fifteen minutes, his record was an hour. He'd also use an assload of toilet paper. One time, I went in right before him, and right after- when I'd left the first time, the TP was nearly gone. When I went in the second, the TP was still nearly gone, but there was a bit *more* of it. Dude had used what was left of the first roll and almost all of a second. 

Also, he took the bus home. Even when a coworker that lived nearby him offered him rides home, he declined without giving a reason. We eventually figured out that the bus had a toilet- and he couldn't risk the twenty minute ride home without access to a bathroom. 

One time the bus was out and he *had* to accept the ride home. The coworker had to stop at a gas station so he could use the restroom, but the first one he passed the guy said he couldn't go there, because he was banned from their restrooms. 


What else...oh, the screaming. 

I worked in a room with a few other people that was right next to the bathroom. Dude literally screamed bloody murder several times throughout his stay. When he left, I went in out of curiosity- no remnants. No smell, no stains, nothing. But whatever he was doing was apparently extremely painful.
As a man, that would be the dream outcome from the situation. Everyday people talk about it, I would just keep playing dumb, add fuel to the gossip fire, then go home and laugh about it.
I have done this before. My coworker was loudly saying she felt like whoever did that to the bathroom should see a doctor
Okay to be fair I understand the argument but honestly it’s a fucking bathroom lol workers have a right to poop at their place of work and not everyone has perfect rosy shits 100% of the time like, jesus christ. Lots of people have bowel issues that make them really uncomfortable and embarrassed but we all need to do what we need to do and it’s kind of fucked up of these coworkers to police the fucking poops happening at work..if anything that’s more embarrassing for them to be obsessing so much about someone else’s shit
Amazing how this person has never heard of IBS/Crohn’s/colitis/celiac disease 🙄

She should thank her lucky stars that holding it long enough to go home is even  an option for her body. Also, what kind of office allows someone to go home to poop and then come back?

Oh and was the actual poop the talk of the office or her unhinged rant?
I’m the type that would not be able to not laugh and admit it was me. 

We all have to poop and who would make it home in a case like that?
ah, be glad you never worked in engineering, the warehouse crapper was where the lads would go to unload. I feel queesy, 30 years later, thinking about some of the bio hazards that could be smelt from there.
Don't feel too bad. [A passenger once took such a smelly poop on a flight from London to Dubai that they were forced to land.](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-31908620)
yeah, I told my friend, he said that if I didn’t post it to Reddit, he wouldn’t be friends with me anymore
Honestly posts like this and the ensuing comments make my day. I can be having the worst time ever and funny fart stories cheer me right up.
hahahahahah that’s so much worse. Yours practically had a siren attached.
I have heard of many fart types, but this is the first time I heard one described as a ***rattler***
![gif](giphy|DqU4wVBxXOhNu)
My husband says ‘that smells like the air fresh off a turd’
Twice I have dropped some stank so bad in the grocery store I needed to leave the aisle to come back later. Both times shortly after I heard someone enter the aisle with a child, who started crying. I don't know for sure, [but...](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tT95zSP5L._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg)
A bit more choke and she'd have started!
Hello, fellow allicin intolerant human! Just wait. The “fun” can ramp up from there, over the years. 

I love garlic but it doesn’t love me, and everyone around me *really* doesn’t love it when I eat it anyway. Small amounts of garlic powder, or really well cooked garlic are sometimes OK. Raw? Sweet bb jeebus, no. 

It does vary from garlic to garlic; some will be fine and some will be akin to a successful Trinity test.

She nuked it, but not from orbit which was originally suggested
Lmao I had one of these a few years ago in the bedroom with only my dog in the room. He walked to the end of the bed, turned around and gave me a look, then jumped down and left the room.
I get it.  I had a hamster when I was about ten years old. I eased out an old one cheek sneak fart that was rotten.  My hamster stopped running on his exercise wheel,  looked around, and started washing his face! I almost died laughing
I had a rescue cat that suffered from IBD after years of neglect. The owner's dementia was so bad he thought he had six cats around his house when there were in fact more than 40. The first day the cat was there he squatted in a corner of my studio and ripped the loudest, stinkiest fart I've ever heard or smelled from a living creature. I didn't think a cat could fart that bad you had to open a window to not puke.
I used to be a vegetarian. 

One day I was laying on my bed with my daughter and our french poodle, and then I farted. 

It was so bad our dog vomited on the spot and left the room. My daughter also left the room, horrified by the smell. 

Vegetarian farts are no joke.
I farted while my cat was cuddling next to me and he glared at me and then bit my ass cheek and ran away
I had the opposite happen with my dog years ago.  He farted in his sleep while on my bed of course and it was so bad it woke him up. He starts barking which wakes me up and I sit up to see what the hell is going on and am blasted with the most foul smelling fart stench you can possibly imagine….. He looks at me and then looks at his butt like WTF. I got up and quickly took him out to potty and I could hear him blasting the grass from all the way across the yard.  Have no idea what he got into but man did it give him troubles.
Lol the cat was in the bathroom with me one time while I was taking a particularly nasty shit. He started scratching at the ground like he was trying to bury it.
Omg I swear my mother in law did this once. She was holding our 5mo baby for a while, and when she handed him back to me she said “I think he needs a diaper change.” When I took him from her, I got a whiff of… something. My baby was exclusively breastfed at that time and I was very familiar with how his poops smelled, but I checked his diaper anyway.

It was not him.
This is a joke in the Deaf community

"Why did God make farts stinky?"

"So that Deaf people could enjoy them too!"
Been there in the Army. Had breakfast at the dining facility, options weren't that great that day, so I managed with oatmeal, a few boiled eggs, some yogurt, and milk.

Worked on attack helicopters, letting one go before needing a technical inspector was a great way to take an hour break because he wouldn't go up there and had told the other inspectors what death awaited them.
I was trying to do a bodybuilding diet and my friend suggested drinking a carton of egg whites.   I thought I'd give it a try.   My co-workers basically had to stage an intervention after that.
Or… 

🎶Evacuate the dance floor

There was some panic at the disco for sure.
“Flatulence curtain of disgust” has me in tears oh my god!
"Not loud, but a good 15 seconds of walking and farting." - a.k.a. "Smuggling ducks".
>Not loud, but a good 15 seconds of walking and farting. Like walking in unison, each step was a new fart.

A really elegant string of pearls configuration. Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.
Poor kid , lmao
What a wordsmith.
thank you for sharing this story. you probably didn't expect this response, but, it's very reminiscent of something my dad would do and how he would talk about it and it warmed my heart because I miss him and his stoic absurdity
My dad once confided in me that he once ripped a rancid one in the checkout line at the grocery store.  

Apparently a mom thought that the little kid had shit his pants and started chewing him out and threatening punishment because he's old enough to do better, etc.

Dad was like "I don't like the kid getting in trouble, but I also can't just say "Ma'am, I'm the degenerate who dropped ass on everyone nearby - it's not your son's fault ""
This story isn't getting nearly as much attention as it should!
Forget your wife, I am very impressed
Oooh, slutty Oppenheimer
Now everyone just heard you let one rip
Give a little puhpuhp it’s oka-
Farting in an elevator is my favorite thing. I like to think I am a mature, well adjusted, woman in her early 60’s but fart’s just make me laugh. All farts. Mine, someone else’s, the dogs.  I also enjoy blaming my kids, even now, and they are in their 30’s!  My kids are less amused. 🤣🤣
I had a tenant tell me that there was escaping sewer gasses in the bathroom and tried to get me to get a plumber.  Eventually her housemate just explained that someone had let one rip in the bathroom and she was blowing things out of proportion.
The burn, the waft, the quick escape

You're proud of this one though aren't you?
I am just dying with all these stories. What the heck did she eat?

The worst I ever had was a fart that smelled like rotten egg, but my boyfriend was an idiot and was all appalled and I'm like it happens to the best of us 🤷
The only time I caused a smell that bad was in the hospital, after intestinal surgery. I asked the nurse for some deodorizing spray because I was so embarrassed about that stench coming from my body. She said not to worry about it, that they'd smelled much worse (I doubt it). But she gave me a little bottle of spray to use. After a few hours my "emissions" smelled normal.

Good move. 
Definitely a keeper.
The last sentence made me cackle
Yep! Annnddddd, it also confirms my theory that I never vibe with people who feel otherwise!
Lmao I’m sitting on the bus unable to stop laughing and equally unable to stop reading.
The way I laughed so hard at this comment 😂😂
Omg I cannot stop laughing my ass off at this🤣🤣💀
😂😂😂🎉
Acid does this to me every time. Gloriously long farts
That must have been so weird especially with the dilation of time acid has! I had terrible farts on 2CI and was disappointed they didn’t have colors. 
My husband had this effect from an off brand pie once. I could hear it from down the hall, it just went on and on and on. I thought, “Oh man! Poor guy!” Then my thoughts wandered elsewhere. After a minute I tuned back in to realize he was still farting that SAME fart! I didn’t know a human body could hold that much fart. Poor man.
There are a lot of great stories here, but this one had me cry-laughing.
😂😂😂😂
White Castle farts are the best, as you can smell each individual part of the burger in the cloud of toxic ass stench. 

You're still going to die from the ass particles launched at Trinity levels into the shitshroom cloud of despair, but you'll also detect the undertones of the beef, pickles, ketchup, onions, and bread buns. Amazingly, this works with both getting them fresh from the Department of Anal Devastation locations, and when you need to hit the black market to get your anal nuclear warheads with the rest of your groceries.
There motto is “you eat them tonight, they eat you in the morning!”
mushroom farts can put protein farts to shame. It also didn’t help that I blended the mushrooms with chocolate protein powder to have a “healthy trip”
It's all shits and giggles till someone giggles and shits.
this comment section is killing me. I’m laughing so hard.
It’s the descriptions of the smells! Dying!!
You’re definitely not alone. One time shrooms completely destroyed my stomach and I was tripping out on the toilet. 

My roommate brought a girl home that night . 

He said they could hear and smell my ass from the entryway.  They turned around and noped right out.
TBH I didn’t expect it to get much traction. The common section is killing me. I swear this is probably gonna end up on Smosh or something.
At a different job I worked in a warehouse by myself. So I farted at will. I had one particularly bad day, I think it was around the time I was trying to quit smoking with a prescription medication that made me fart REALLY bad, like I could gas myself out of a room bad. So I was farting away and suddenly my boss shows up. I had just let a huge fart go at the opposite end of the aisle we were in. My fart slowly made its way over and I could see his face contort as he smelled it. He was SO disgusted. I was mortified
They may not know you, but they will never forget you.
yeah, apparently using the word fart is against community guidelines. I had to rewrite it without the word fart in it
I was crying after the first paragraph!  Tears of knowing anticipation….
Same here!
Just like those poor kids u/sbutt7 gassed in the Starlab.
Just reading this ,I'm laughing pretty hard...farts are funny period ! ..anyone who says they are disgusting is an uptight asshole ...pun intended...natural body function..and I get there is a time and a place.. but when you can't hold it....lol

Yet it is.
Woke moms up for farts. Mannnn I wish that was me. My exact words: Fk you want me to do, put a cork in it?
WTH was wrong with that teacher. If I were your mom, I’d be livid to be bothered about farting, I’d say “deal with it” and hang up and go back to sleep.
Sixth or seventh grade for me. I had to sneeze, but I sneeze really loud, so I held the first two sneezes in, but the third sneeze released my sphincter and I iet put the loudest fart I've ever blasted. The whole class laughed, so when I nervously laughed too, a kid near me high fived me. The teacher made me go into the hall so she could chew me out for farting and laughing about it. I explained to her that I could either be embarrassed and teased about it or laugh about it and everyone would forget about it in a few days. She angrily huffed and said "Don't do it again!"
Like bitch, I didn't do it on purpose the first time!
So everyone laughed at you and then the teacher decided to pin all of that on you to your mom.
Kids trying to get out of a tunnel was what caused the problem to begin with…

My pee story was from the 3rd grade. We had a bathroom in our room and being the fucked up kid that I was, I absolutely believed there was a monster in there. Truth be told, I believe I convinced myself of the monster because I didn't want anyone to know that I had to go to the bathroom. As if going to the damn bathroom would make my classmates laugh at me... Anyhoo, I held my waste all day long and then ran home from school to piss and shit. I believed this was all normal until one day I had to pee so damn bad. We were taking a test and  that made me more nervous. It was getting bad and I was rocking back and forth, getting crazy trying to hold it instead of just raising my hand to go to the bathroom. Like the above story, I thought - okay, I'll just go a little in my pants and that would relieve the pressure - so I started and couldn't shut the damn faucet off. Panicking I just continue to take my test and the pee was coming out in a raging river, soaking my pants and dripping off my seat. Of course, I pretended like nothing was happening. Pretty soon, the teacher,who had been walking around the room, came down my aisle and noticed the small pond of pee and said "Joe are you okay?" and the fucked up kid that I was, responded - "Yeah, I'm fine". Of course all the kids realized what was going on and started whispering. I was sent to the nurse's office with a classmate as an escort and the kid was like - "what happened? and I said " "Oh nothing" as the bottom half of my shirt and my pants were completely soaked. Shit, my damn shoes were filled with pee and there was a sloshing sound with every step I took. 

I was a fucked up kid.
I had to get up and go to the bathroom before reading anymore stories because I was afraid I'd pee in my pajamas.
Diabolical dad stuff
Ah yes, the old Clearance Aisle.
My mom once told me that she let out an SBD (silent but deadly) in the bread isle and she immediately looked at the people next to her, gave them a stink face and said “Wow, what’s that?!” and quickly walked away 😂
Your dad is my newest hero.
I would do that in the deli or the bread aisle. Just cut loose an SBD and then pretend i took a breath and comment "oh, the bread/popcorn/deli meats/whatever smell really fresh today". Then laugh so hard when my wife and kids take a deep sniff through their nose. Its now to a point that if they smell a fart they immediately look at me. My reaponse now is "did i say anything smelled fresh? So it wasnt me." Trying to not laugh at them is so hard because of the looks on their faces is just *chefs kiss*
my cat does this 😂
Donny?
Same! I was in a stall and someone came in and went to a urinal. I turned loose a series of sharp, trumpeting flatulence that went on for what felt like forever. Dude at the front just said "God DAMN" and gagged and walked out. I absolutely could not stop laughing. Almost felt proud, it was weird.
This is so funny, omg
This sounds like a story that could be put to music. Country style.
I had a coworker once who found a "hidden" bathroom on the roof of our office building. He came back to his desk one day and said he was pulling toilet paper out of the dispenser and a bag of white powder and razor fell out. The next day the bathroom door up there was padlocked shut.
Taking a dump in a public bathroom, and I hear somebody blasting away in another stall.  Dude closer than I gives this plaintive "Oh,fuck, buddy, why?"
Reminds me of a time I walked in and it wasn’t particularly smelly but these two guys are in stalls and one says “LAVA… I’m shutting LAAVAA”
Shit like this always makes me laugh.
Oh she was DEFINITELY insane!  Little old buddy who literally would spend 5 minutes “adjusting” ONE piece of hair in her bangs till it was perfect! 🤪
Agree 4000%. What does she think bathrooms are for?
There are some Office Biddies that just live for complaining. Doesn't make any sense to go home to poop, unless you're really ill, but that's not going to stop an office busybody from talking about restroom stink all day.
Why? I'm dying here. Your boss was legit like "You let that cook! No fan! yessss, YESSSSS! No ventilation!!!"

Whyyyy?
I fucked up and took a job without knowing what the office/bathroom situation was...

Turns out I was right near to the men's bathroom, a single stall type...

So I got to listen to every person shit, piss, fart, and sometimes vomit if they had a rough night...

And the smells...oh god.... i didn't miss that place.

Our office has little cans of air freshener in the toilets for these situations.
Did he have a seat smelling kink?

The AC/ heat at my job is transitioning for winter. Some parts of work are freezing, and others are an 80° oven. The break room bathrooms, you guessed it. They're the oven. 🫠
Rule is if you’re the one who’s gotta fart bad enough you’re asking someone to leave, you should be the one to leave!
Is this the reason you broke up with her 😂
She sounds like a fellow Sleeper Cell Farter.

I'd say about 90% of my farts have no smell. I'm convinced it's because all of the smell from all of the farts concentrates into one little loop in my bowels for a Sleeper Cell Fart to lie in wait. Never know when it will finally make an appearance, but when it does it will singe nose hairs and make angels weep.
Lmao I had a buddy like that and he fuckin cleared a room once I was in so I sat him down and said "Listen man, I get you really like milk, but you're black...you're almost certainly lactose intolerant. *Knock it off*". And he did, within about a month he was no longer regularly clearing rooms. His skin improved too but who knows if that was related.
To quote Cinema Therapy, your relationship is probably not toxic but it does have some noxious fumes.
But… lighting a match is one of the few things that would have *helped* the situation, coworkers! Guess they weren’t hired for their quick problem-solving abilities! ;) I’m so sorry that happened to you, OP.
There was a poop ninja in Vancouver years ago. They'd wait in a stall in a public washroom then when someone took a dump in the stall adjacent and was standing up to flush (this was before automatic flushing) they'd snake their arm up into the bowl and steal the turd. There was a rash of incidents in malls downtown and I don't know if they ever caught the person. It happened to a friend. They came out of the bathroom in a hurry trying to find security. Eventually they did but by then the poop ninja had fled. The security said it was something like the 3rd time this month they'd had a report of this.


Anyway, I just want to say it's really brave and kinda wild of you to admit being a poop ninja. I just have one question: why?
I had an employee that always had to go home to go, because she always had to be completely naked to poop. I don’t know why, I didn’t ask.
I once dropped a silent fart at work when I worked in a maintenance office. I was the only woman so no one suspected me. One person came in and started looking around for a sewage leak, another assumed someone had left a dirty mop laying around somewhere. Meanwhile I was at my desk, red faced and silently shaking with laughter.
I wonder if he had celiac disease. I've got it, and the period of time I had to go back on gluten was a month long nightmare. Every time I had to sit on the loo it felt like lava. I cried, multiple times during that month from the sheer pain. And sometimes almost no warning, just "you're about to shit yourself you have 1 minute to find a toilet", and well I used the ladies room quite often at work because the one shitter in the male restroom was usually occupied (30 men to 2 ladies at that workplace.)

There often wasn't much of a smell, but I'd be on the loo for nearly an hour each time because there was always more lava...

Highly not recommended if you can avoid it.
"WHO DOES NUMBER TWO WORK FOR??!!"
This is why I love working from home! Pooping on my own toilet!
Jesus shit roses?  I bet the thorns hurt!
She made Such A big deal out of it and involved the other 8 people in our department! There was NO way I was admitting to it. I joined the crowd and complained too 😆😆
That is a good good friend! Tell them we all had a good laugh and put our pitchforks away!
It's relatable, who hasn't cleared a room, or tear'd some eyes?
It was loud, you know like a wet ass cheeks slapping each other, glad I didn't shit my pants kind of thing.
I remember once after a particularly powerful fart, my dad said "ooh, that was a bun-flapper"
“The fizz, the fazz, the fizz-fazz. The rip-shit, tear-ass, and the one that just goes ‘pffffffffffff’” ~ George Carlin. I think he missed a few.
I don't know,  it felt a little wet and the cheeks rattled as the bubble went up my crack and out into the world.
I call it hot poop air... now try saying my user3x fast 😂
Sometimes, I'm like , let's just move it along to the spouse or the kids,  I just want to get them clear before they get caught in the cloud of stank.  I have since learned thafarts mean you need to poop and I try to dump my load before I get to that point, but I no longer have a gall bladder and that sometimes decides for me about whether I fart in public.
It is WMD. Weapons of mass destruction of your sinuses
Sharts! No wait...




Honestly it works if you know how absolutely horrible they smell.  
I'm just having a hard time imagining a fart so heinous it lasts 30 minutes, let alone in a big active place.
We had a dog who was the laziest thug ever. The only thing that would get him moving was food. However, if we ever saw him get up an leave a room for no apparent reason, we knew he had just dropped a stink bomb that would clear the room as soon as it spread.
🎵Ooh that smell

Can't you smell that smell

Ooh that smell

The smell of death surrounds you🎵
Somebody call 9 1 1!

Shawty‘s farty burning on the dance floor… ohohoh
Come to think of it, the sounds produced were infact old duck quacks. I'm old, so these old ducks sounded extremely old and hoarse. Smuggled some laryngitis ducks down the aisle.
What got me was him saying "you know the type." LOL I do! how do you know?! 🤣
My eldest aunt once did this fart-walk through an airport. As kids, we all thought she was a god.
At my work (hospital), we call that walk, “farting like a show pony.”
elegant string of pearls conflatulation
It's gotta be an old guy thing. Or just a typical guy thing - maybe. I relish the opportunity to crop dust anyone at any time. Just me. The guys I used to hang with long ago, also practiced the fart game. I just assumed it was part of being a guy. My Dad practiced on us kids, (me and my sister) so I continued the practice. 

Tried to teach my daughters (grown now). Worked when they were younger. Now it's just a "gross Dad" thing.

I'll vividly remember the grocery crop dusting, and the poor little boy that hurled on the floor because of me probably forever. 

Memories.
Brought a tear to my eye. Your Dad and I would be close friends today. Either you or him are welcome for a beer any day of the week. 

Here's to your Dad.
She whispers in a sexy voice: I have become death.

Closest ive ever been to having a superpower tbh. 😎
It's been about 7 years so I can't *fully* remember - all I know for sure is that she had gotten something from Subway. Knowing her, it was probably a meatball sub with mayo and honey mustard. Yes, I know that's a "what the fuck" order. No, I don't understand it. 🤣
I once ate an entire 8 pack of hotdogs in one 2-3 hour sitting, and let me tell you, the gas that came from my body later that day was fucking awful. Like it made me gag, on my own farts. You never gag yourself! It's always someone else's fart that makes you gag! but no, this was mine, and I owned it.
Look up the "reddit story" of Swamps of Dagobah. They have definitely smelled worse lol.
Omg this was me! My husband even came out from our game room cause I was giggling/ laughing so much to check on me and when I showed him the post and the responses then he definitely began laughing also and then we where both tangled up in the giggles and laughing and making each other laugh the more the other did yo the point we couldnt even look at each other for a moment... lol and now our youngest son 11 probably thinks where both loosing it 🤣
Not gna lie it was confusing, I must have thought to myself "surely it's about to be over" about 5 times before it actually was.
I once mixed mine into a five guys poutine.

#Never. Again.
Yea test that dancefloor for radiation now!
"But it was the most silent/deadly toxic/foul mushroom stink bomb of my life"

This line took me out and I had to hold back my laughing because I work in a restaurant. 🤣🤣🤣
Did you have to let it linger, I’m such a fool for you!!🤣🤣
Oh my god 😂😂. Years ago 2 of my best friends and I rented a cabin together that had one bathroom and that bathroom had these weird walls that stopped like 3 feet from the ceiling…so zero insulation.
Anyways, we proceeded to do a ton of shrooms and eat a vegan lasagna.
All three of us had the shits and farts from hell. It was surreal. I remember us having to take turns on the toilet, tripping so hard that we couldn’t stop laughing, and my one friend kept cranking up an Aerosmith album to drown out the tuba concert in that bathroom.
We’re still great friends and I swear we still die laughing about that night at least twice a year 😂😂😂.
Every time I've ever done shrooms I've ended up spending at least the first 10-30 minutes of my trip absolutely demolishing the bathroom. [and my poor, poor asshole] 

Like as soon as I start to feel/see stuff, it's poop o' clock. Bathrooms with textured ceilings ended up becoming a huge W for me.

But then I tried these extracted psilosin capsules a chemist friend of mine made and it was so much better! 

No bathroom trip. Not even a heinous fart. And they even kicked in a lot faster.
Mushroom shits are something else, man. 

Anytime I do Any psychedelic I almost always have to shit once it hits. 

I blame it on finally being so relaxed it just happens. 

But gawd how is it always so FUNKY.
Hahaha that's amazing, especially considering what the f stands for in the community.
I’ve been laughing from the start but “I had just turned into a real gas giant” sent me
Opening sentence did me in!
Lol yeah. I was hoping the second paragraph would have ended with a “… I think you know where this s is going…”

> Except it was very dark, you had to crawl through a tunnel to get in and out, and I suddenly felt super claustrophobic. “… I think you know where this is going? Correct. Uranus…”

But the story delivers regardless.
I lost it at the tunnel part.
Sbutt7 stands for spacebutt7
Pretty much her reaction when I got home.
Seriously! Like, is he sick enough that he needs to come home? No? Just a bathroom? Did you let him, you know, go to the fucking bathroom? The hell are you calling me for?
Grade school teachers and power tripping, name a more classic combo. And people wonder why kids hate their classroom so much...
Dude, I feel you so hard. I'm a petite woman, and I sneeze like an old man, lol. Loud enough that holding in a sneeze physically hurts my chest area. My brother could hear me in the basement, when I was up on the second floor. 🤣

 It doesn't help that I'm allergic to so many things that it's easier to tell people what I'm not allergic to. I've impressed in-house allergy clinic specialists. (They called him an expert.)
Geez man.   I hope you made it to adulthood in relatively reasonable shape?
The only time I ever accidentally let out an audible fart in class happened to be the same day the guy behind me brought in a whoopie cushion. I whipped around immediately and looked at him accusingly as the class laughed at him, and he never said a word. Steve, you’re a real one.
That's hilarious.  What makes my story funniest to me is that my daughter is always  perfectly groomed, dresses very stylishly,  has excellent "ladylike "manners in public, but sneaks in very crass moments just for the shock value
Holy shit, thought the same thing. What a strange adjective to use there.
This has me ROLLING
'GOD DAMN' or 'GAWDDAMMM!!'
is like the official stamp of approval for a good fart. If you hear that, it was a success.
Ahhh I've done that once, had a similar exclamation of surprise from the random in the restroom, and I just said "Hey man, at least *you* get to leave"

We had a good laugh.
I think he was worried about the utility bill personally. He was a total dick! I can't wait to leave a review 😂

He literally put a handwritten sign on the door. And it was an employee's only bathroom.
My then wife, it was hot that day. Her and I were in the back seat of her mom's car and I felt one coming on. I let it go as I knew it would be silent. Big mistake. It was an extremely hot fart so I knew it was going to smell bad. 1 second later she looks at me and asks if I farted, I was embarassed and said no. Her mom responded with 'oh, its probably just raw sewage we drove by'. Yes it was definitely raw sewage........from my ass. To this day I have not admitted it was me. It is still the worst smelling fart I have ever done. I've no idea what I ate but jesus christ I almost threw up from the smell.
At my old office we had one guy that would rip ass while  using the urinal every damn time. Just endless pissing and farting.
That sounds just as bad as the people I work with leaving the door open to the bathroom after they take a dump. Why is it bad? The bathroom opens right into the workroom where we all work. So, you think we all want to smell what you had for lunch? Shut the damned door, and leave the fan on! It is so bad I actually keep air freshener so I can stealth spray so we don't all die from shit and ass fumes.
I used to work in an office where it was a single room, only 6 members of staff, and the toilets were inside that room. The walls were thick enough to not hear anything but you’d inadvertently become aware of how long someone was in there and the stories in this thread of discreetly running in and out while the coast was clear wouldn’t be possible. 
I checked for burn holes in my sheets
But just getting off the bed could’ve involuntarily unleashed it, so having him leave was really safer
No lol
Maybe they were worried the methane would explode?
Does any one still keep a large box of old school matches in their bathroom? My grandparents did back in the 80s until my cousin “accidentally” tried to burn down the house.
That's not a poop ninja, it's a straight up turd burglar.
What the fuck did I just read??

Holy fucking shit i just howled laughing. How in the hell..haha
That is a Turd Burglar.
That’s just your local Jenkem dealer sourcing their supply
POOP NINJA! Band Name I Call It!!!! Haha
What you're not constantly paranoid you might shit on your shirt tails? You are now.
Reverse cowgirl?
Did this employee tell you their process for pooping? They were like "Hey boss, I need to go home to shit every day because I need to get naked when I do it."
Crohn's disease.   This describes my life.  That butt-cheek-clench-of-death hoping to find a restroom, any restroom, in time.
My sister will projectil vomit if she has gluten. And not just once. It's like for an hour straight. I've never heard anyone puke so hard before in my life. And like you said, when it comes on, she has about 30 seconds to figure out what direction it's gonna take. I feel so bad for ya'll. From watching her our whole lives, I know that shit sucks.
Omg, all the follow up replies are hilarious
I hope you made uncomfortable eye contact and smirked
Was it itchy when it dried?
🤣🤣🤣🔥
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time. I can’t breathe!
It’s so bad if I deliberately play garlic roulette and lose. Or something is suspiciously delicious and I’m just like “wow this is so unusually well seasoned and tasty!”

I spend hours just cramping, and moaning about what a dumb dumb I am. I am so happy when I can finally fart about it… but nobody else is. My poor long suffering spouse.
Yikes. I had a cold once and ate 4 massive cloves chopped fine in my lentil stew. Nearly asphyxiated myself.
I can only imagine it was hot and humid from the dancing, and the poor bastards had no real windows to open. Mushrooms themselves are also really easily... fermented. 

Most drugs can make you gassy, actually.
I had a beagle growing up that if you fed him a certain dog biscuit (I forget the brand, I don't think they are made anymore), hours later he would produce the rankest gas that if the military used anything close it, it would be a war crime. 

We stopped feeding him those biscuits after a few incidents where he would be sleeping on my parents' bed while my dad watched TV, and from across the house we would hear dad shout "OH MY GOD! THIS DAMN DOG DID IT AGAIN!"

When you love mustard, you really love mustard!
mayo is absolutely criminal what the hell lmfao
One time when I was extremely hungover, I ripped it so bad the smell made me puke. Granted I was already nauseated
I'm about to have dinner. No thanks.
That's a classic!
Yes the classic. It's been years since I read it last time. Thanks for reminding me lmao
Try mixing corned beef, cabbage, and whiskey. The good ole Irish rose. My house and my brother-in-laws house are considered biological war zones the week of St Patricks day.
What a trip, though, amirite.
Completely off topic: five guys have poutine?!
Omg I am absolutely dying at this 😂💀
The first time I took acid I had to take a shit. There was this brown towel on the rack in front of the toilet. A Mayan calendar wouldn’t stop flying out of that thing into my face.
The whole thing was hilarious from start to finish, but it was the earnest “I’m not sure how much anyone learned about space that day” that REALLY got me.
Lol. Ehhh, I still have battle scars, but I'm doing alright.
Same man. Poop and fart stories of these types just get me every single time. Like, there is no foul or harm done, but the "victims" are so damn offended by something you can't help.
I would've added to the sign: "No flushing either."
We literally have a sign that says to leave the fan on in our bathrooms. If I walk by and see that someone turned it off, I make sure to turn it back on. I don’t want to smell your smoked venison shit, Carl!
Maybe he had a fart / poop smelling fetish
Holy shit. I'd give him a nickel a week and tell him to keep the change.
Wait till someone else quits and leave a review pretending to be them 🤣
That might have been me. I save them up and then like to hear the reverb at the urinal, the acoustics are great.
 remember now! sometimes rain comes with thunder.
Omg, all these stories and comments like this are making this my favorite Reddit thread of all time
That was the joke 🤣
That’s what we call whoever cleans the litter box for the cats, a turd burglar.
If I’m ever wearing a shirt that goes past my waist I pull it up to my rips and hold the shirt up by pinning my arms to my side while in the bathroom
How else are you supposed to keep tally?
No!?  I just pull my shirt up then sit down.  It's not difficult at all
It's the correct position, because then you have a little shelf for your comic book and chocolate milk.
I feel ya, Crohns has me too. No time for ethical bathroom visits. If I can sit, I shit. (Yes small toddler toilet included if it's the only free one).
It really makes you change how you plan out your day.

"Okay it's an hour long car ride so I won't eat anything in the morning, and I'll spend all morning on the loo to empty myself out, and hopefully I won't have to use a toilet before I get home in 3 hours."
I did. Kind of a "Did I do that?" Steven Urkel look.
it wasn't really wet, it was like humid. I didn't shart.
Garlic roulette. For me it’s chipotle hot sauce. I feel the match burn twice. 

Bonus if you get popular culture reference from the 90s.
Ha! I don’t have any symptoms other than biochemical warfare on the nose
I've been trying to tell her that for YEARS 😭
A bunch of friends were laying around my house in joshua tree watching a movie. All the seats were taken so my friend was laying on his belly on the floor… he was notorious for farts that would literally stop you in your tracks if you walked into one.  
Anyhow, he brought along his new little kitten that was asleep on my friend’s butt. A lot of jokes about what happens if my friend rips one.    
Eventually he does just that. We pause the movie and watch as the kitten wakes up, looks around confused, stands up, sniffs our friend’s butt and projectile pukes all over his jeans.      
I don’t know if any of us ever laughed that hard again in our lives.
I gagged laughing so much
Oh dear God! 😲😂
Oh I fucking *love* shrooms. Just don't love what they tend to make me do to the toilet. 

Mixing it with that poutine [in addition to a burger ofc] made it at least 100x worse. We moved out of that place around five years ago, and I'd wager the bathroom still smells a bit off.
Could be a Canada-specific thing for all I know
And in the middle of a fart thread you asked the most important question!  That was my immediate thought. “Hold the farts, Five Guys has poutine!?”
They learned about the amount of space a fart can take up
I wanted to start leaving the light on and put signs in the empty boardrooms that said leave the lights off when not in use LOL
Omg dickbutt you’re killing me on this thread, big “fan” of your work (no pun intended)
Exactly!
He didn't even use that bathroom!
This is the way
Oh man, that warm swamp gas that just kinda eases out? 😂😂😂
I have never ever described a fart as humid but I know exactly what you mean somehow
🤮
This happened pretty recently. Where we live, we get the smell of rancid cow ass in the spring, blowing in through the windows. Like BAM, cow shit stench filling the house. It always intensifies on the humid night air. 

So… one night last spring I got extra nasty accidental garlic farts late at night. Just Dutch ovening the fuck out of both of us. I thought he was dead asleep and I’d gotten away with it. 

The next day he was like “gawd the cow fields were blowing in the window so bad last night” and I was like… ohhhh. Hmm. Yep. Those darn cows! Gee whiz!
If walls could talk, your bathroom would be screaming.
Yup, it was a Canada-specific question, unfortunately there are no 5guys branches near us but I’ll get there eventually… In the meantime I guess I’ll stick with Freshburger
Sometimes the planets align and students are fortunate to witness a real-world example of the very thing they're studying. Like when I was in 9th grade biology, we were right in the middle of a discussion about diffusion, and some brave soul offered up his own gas to be diffused. It really drove home the concept, that within seconds the entire classroom was gagging equally; it did not remain concentrated around the source.
I would have wired the fan to be on 24/7.
That’s Doctor dickbutt to you
Exactly, never had an issue that way. Its in a stall anyways so it’s not like its flashing anyone
it was kind of ballistic,  like notice me.....
That’s mine. I know if I have a warm one people better run.  I’m not allowed to eat eggs at family functions anymore.
Damp, you know, not really wet, but not really dry.
It makes sense farts would have a humidity range, but damn was I surprised the first time I found out they can have a *temperature* range. The hot ones are dangerous, it's a warning to leave and let others deal with the aftermath
I once farted on a car ride with my nan and she said "ooh I can smell the countryside".
I'm pretty sure they *were* screaming that night, but it could've just been the shrooms..

*Edit:* or my partner/housemate at the time
My place of employment shares a parking lot with a five guys
Yep they do and they’re very good, you can get them with the Cajun fries too.
I’m skeptical of his credentials

Whaddayaknow, turns out there’s one not far from Wonderland now, I’ll check it out
TIFU by telling my girlfriend my “type.”
TL;DR TIFU by essentially telling my girlfriend that my type was the exact opposite of her. Sad times ensue.  

Obligatory “happened a couple months ago,” but realized I fucked up this morning.

Some time back, I brought up the topic of ‘types.’ I mentioned it because her best friend and I seem to damn near be the exact same individual, just of different genders, and I joked that she must have a type. 

She took it a bit more seriously than I intended and proceeded to tell me she wasn’t sure she had a type, but she did like it when men were comfortable with expressing femininity, and that she thought tattoos were cool. Then she asked me my type, and I told her that generally it’s been curvy blondes with long hair, big chests and blue eyes. She lightly teased me for having basic tastes and we moved on.

The past couple of months, she’s been asking for constant reassurance. Asking if I’m sure I like her immediately after moments of intimacy, asking if I find her attractive, etc. She also stopped coming with me to the gym, which was strange because she loves weightlifting, and has lost a lot of her muscle tone.

This morning, a woman walked past our car at a red light. I sincerely didn’t notice her, but my girlfriend said, “Wow, look at her. She’s exactly your type.” I hadn’t thought about that conversation since it happened, but everything made sense, instantly. I told my girlfriend that she was my type, she said, “Not even close” and started crying. I have only seen her cry one other time in the four years I’ve known her.

My girlfriend is tall, flat-chested, muscular and has short brown hair and brown eyes. She’s beautifully androgynous and occasionally people mistake her for a very pretty teenage boy. (I love and am attracted to every bit of this about her more than any other ‘type’ that exists because she’s her.)

She said when she spoke about her type, she said she described a vague style pretty much anyone could embody (and I do dress and style myself a bit adventurously for a man), meanwhile I described an individual person she was in no way similar to, but always felt like she was expected to be. She said she couldn’t go to the gym anymore because she’d tell herself I was checking out other girls (I glance sometimes but not egregiously, and we used to do this together) and all she could think about was how unlike my ideal she was.

That one throwaway conversation has been eating away at and completely wrecked her self-esteem for months and I only just realized. Looking back,  she definitely did try to bring it up once before early on, and I brushed it off with “you’re perfect for me baby don’t worry about stupid stuff” not understanding how bad she was feeling.

So yeah, I feel like I fucked up. Not sure what to do about it.
Tell her this.  All of this.  Except for the teenage boy stuff.
This got locked in her vault for good
You should’ve replied with the gospel of the great reverend Rae Sremmurd…

“And the shepherd said “I ain’t got no type. Bad bitches is the only thing that I like” and the heavens rejoiced and no fights with the partners were had.”
The problem is you validated her insecurities.  She looks in the mirror and goes "I wish my chest was bigger."   After you told her your type is a big chest she think her boyfriend sees that same problems she sees everyday.

Then they don't feel sexy around you anymore and it is a downhill spiral from there.

You have to lay on the complements THICK that you are happy with her the way she is and would not pick anyone else.
When you shared: " meanwhile I described an individual person she was in no way similar to, but always felt like she was expected to be. " ... This is telling. I would bet she's felt this way since early childhood and it probably got reinforced by her peers and family growing up. There's no way you single-handedly triggered her this bad all at once. Your comment was just the last straw that sent her over the edge...  


As far as what to do about it, that's a tough one. When people get an idea like this firmly implanted into their minds, I haven't heard many cases of them coming out of it quickly or easily. I wish I had an answer for that.
“occasionally people mistake her for a very pretty teenage boy. (I love and am attracted to every bit of this”

![gif](giphy|ba5g4ID9g5cT6)
my gf is my type, there are no other types, there are no other girls, they are not my concern
My wife and I have been together for 27 years. Her type is tall, painfully thin and a bit edgy. I am none of those things. I am a perfectly average guy, average height, average weight (when we started dating). I was a soccer player and a bit on the stocky side for the sport. She is my type, or more to the point my type became her. I find my attractions being people that remind me of her. When I look at adult content, I look for women that remind me of her. Throughout the years it has been hard for me at times knowing that I am not her type. I have finally come to a place that I must be something special for her to stay attracted to me even though I wouldn’t be the first guy to catch her eye across a crowded room.
Yeah, you don’t tell your girlfriend your type is the exact opposite of her. Of course this hurt her feelings. She will never forget what you said.
A type is like the comfort meal you gravitate towards. If your girlfriend is fucking filet mignon, it doesn't matter that your usual go to is mac n cheese.
TIFU by saying my girlfriend looks like a teenage boy.
“What’s your type?” 

“You’re my type.” 

Is how that should’ve gone
Every day I marvel at the low emotional intelligence exhibited on this sub.
Relatable. My boyfriend of several years is very shy/private about his sexual desires. I asked him if there was anything in particular he found hot and for once, he actually replied.

His reply was “Asian women”. I’m a 100% Caucasian woman 🤡 and I agree, there are many many stunning Asian women. But Asian is something I can never ever be. Rip my self esteem lol. I wanted to know about things he liked that he and I could explore together, which I still have none of lmao ☠️

Edit: I agree, white men fetishising Asian women is completely fucked up. I work in an industry that already has a high rate of 0 respect for women, and my non white friends are treated even more poorly. It goes without saying that it is so wrong and no one should ever have to experience that. Our society is fucked, the casual and overt racism is appalling.

I agree his comment was in poor taste. In my bf’s case, I really do believe it was a thoughtless, spur of the moment comment because I am constantly pestering him about his sexual interests. I am sex obsessed and have thoroughly explored my sexuality/kinks etc, he has not, he likes it pretty vanilla. He has a general interest in all attractive women, regardless of race lol. He has never indicated that his type is Asian women, never seen any evidence of an obsession etc etc as some people are saying in their replies.

My partner definitely isn’t racist, and he definitely isn’t misogynistic.

He doesn’t talk about his sex life because of childhood trauma, I was being completely self indulgent in my original comment. Reading the OPs story brought the feeling of that moment in time back for me.

We have explored different sexual avenues together, he’s getting therapy. Too easy to make snap judgments based on a tiny minuscule fraction of peoples lives.

Hope everyone has a good day, unless you contribute to racial fetishisation/are generally racist/are misogynistic, in which case, have a very very very bad awful day 🤗
She's probably thinking that if you meet someone a lot like her but with those physical features then you'll want to be with them rather than her. Unfortunately, I have zero advice.
Your GF shared a personality and style type, and you responded with a body type. That's the big difference, and the big fuck-up you made. It's not about how you need to somehow be dishonest with her or she too fragile or some such; it's that she was conversing about things that are fully within a person's ability to change (and which she *likes already* about you), and you responded with something she could never be (and shouldn't feel pressured to try to be).


Imagine your GF had stated her type is a guy who's got a different body shape, coloring, height than you--opposite of you, really. Wouldn't that feel a lot different to you than what she did say? Don't you see the difference?
Sounds to me like you need a fully honest and fully apologetic conversation.  Maybe something that sounds like...

"Baby, I'm so sorry.  I remember that conversation we had that one time... That wasn't meant to be serious but I see that this is very serious and I'm taking you seriously.  It's taken too long to see I hurt you and I want to start making restorations.  I love you beyond the moon & the stars, you are beautiful, wonderful, and sexy.  You deserve to feel like a billion dollars every day, and I want to be the one to make you feel that way."  

Here's the key part.... over the next several days & weeks, do some things that make her feel like a billion dollars.  If you've heard of the "five love languages" it's rather cliché nowadays but it works.  If her love language is words of affirmation, write some love notes and hide it for her to find.  If it's gifts, it doesn't have to be expensive but it has to show that you put time & thought into it.  Etc, etc.  You can read more about the love languages for the googling.  

Hope that helps!  --an old married guy
As someone who has been that girlfriend before, and also is similar to the description of your girlfriend. I can 99% guarantee it only hurt her because you hit every single one of her insecurities. 

Every tall girl wishes she was shorter, because they always get picked. Every toned muscular girl has moments where she feels like men just aren’t attracted to that. Every brunette thinks blondes girls look softer and cuter. Etc. 

And then sometimes, girls like us are the ones who get picked. And so we let the insecurities go for a minute. And as soon as they get reaffirmed, you think about it, every day. And it picks and picks. 

Ultimately you did nothing wrong, said nothing wrong. But she really just needs validation that you love everything about her looks and maybe you used to prefer other things, but now theres nothing youd want more than her
You told her all that while looking straight into her face and knowing she doesnt look anything like that. I’d be mad at you too not because you have a type but because you lack basic decency and awareness. It only took you until she pointed out for you to figure out what you said made her feel bad.
Some people is telling you to never be honest, or to never share you type. I have to disagree. What you need to tell is what your personality’s type is. You don’t tell small and busty. Those are not changing naturally and can be quite hurtful. Instead you say something among the lines of “I’ve come to realize I usually like secure girls, who know how to stand up for themselves and are crazy smart” (This is just an example but you know what I mean). If they push further into physical appearance just say something you like they have, but don’t lie. 

Which is, btw, what she did. 

Instead, just learn from this and reassure her a lot, she is gonna need it.
Why the fuck would you tell her that???
This is something I’ve wanted to know for years. How and why did you choose a woman who isn’t your type? If you can explain it to me, I bet you can explain it to her. That might really reassure her. If I were your girlfriend, I would be wondering if you were just settling for me, or if I were a placeholder until you found your hot blonde.
There is no circumstances where telling someone she's not your type but you like her anyway is going to get a good response. "Yeah, I like skinny blondes, it's fine that you're fat with brown hair" is tone-deaf. She's going to spend every single moment of being naked around you wondering if her boobs are right, if you actually think she's hot, if she looks too much like a dude, whatever.

Once bitten, twice shy. You're fucked.
Honestly is not the best policy, thinking carefully before saying anything is the best policy.
My wife told me that she always *had* a type until we met.  She tended to gravitate toward (and thought she'd end up with) some kind of tractor-driving country boy.  And then there's *me*... I'm not remotely "country."  I have zero interest in hunting or fishing, I don't drive a truck, I have no experience with horses or cattle, etc.  I'm a city boy who likes medieval literature, classic rock, Superman, cheeseball action movies, and Broadway musicals.  And yet, we just immediately clicked.  Now she says that I'm "everything she didn't know she needed."

I guess my point is that having a "type" doesn't always mean that much.  Sometimes the right person for you may be someone you didn't really expect.
" I certainly never described that as my ideal and I think she’s the sexiest creature to ever walk this planet,  "

But that's not what you said to her and that's not what she heard.
There are really only two possibilities with what you said: you couldn't land someone your type so you settled or you found someone so special and gorgeous outside your type that you had to have her. She thinks the first, you feel the second. 

You could say something along the lines of "yeah maybe I have a type, but someone would have to be really special for me to stray from it. It's not like I'm desperate."
"When you asked me about my type, I just described generally people I thought were attractive in the past. That's not the only thing I find attractive or even the type I find *most* attractive. If you want to know what type I find most attractive, the answer is you and only you.

I'm attracted to you, the gym you, the you that I've been dating for X months. I'm attracted to the entire you, obviously your looks, but also who you are as a person."

Also at some point she might want to consider therapy for her insecurity and potential body issues. But that's a whole other conversation on a very different day
There’s a lot of societal pressure for women who are less feminine looking, especially when so much emphasis is placed on being curvy and petite. As a woman who is similarly outside that ‘ideal,’ I can also say that it’s so pervasive that sometimes you don’t even know how heavily it weighs on you until an offhand comment punches you in the gut. 

For me? I’d want my partner to take some time to apologize for hurting me (with no rationalizations or excuses, just recognizing that it was harmful and that my feelings are valid) and explicitly tell me all the things he finds attractive about me (not just physically, but including some of that as well). Depending on her reaction you could even try explaining what she has/can do that you find attractive/you like about your relationship that the ‘type’ you described doesn’t/can’t. Maybe do this during a long date night, where neither of us had any other obligations, or in a letter if that’s more your style. 

If we had previously been going to a gym together, I’d probably like for my partner to say he missed me working out with him, and to invite me to work out at a time (or location) where the probability of other girls being around was low, so I could focus on our gym time and not on who else was around. I’d want my partner to specifically tell me that he thought my muscles/athletic ability was attractive and that he liked seeing me push myself at the gym (or similar, adjusted for his truth). (I *wouldn’t* want my partner pointing out that I’d lost muscle mass, because that could feed into feeling inadequate, and like nothing I do will make me attractive enough!) 

And after that apology and trying to accommodate my insecurities with respect to activities I still might want to do with my partner, I’d need a lot of smaller confidence boosts, like compliments that specifically point out something my partner found attractive (specific like “I love how long your legs look in those jeans” vs “Damn, you’re hot”—the second one still feels good, but the first tells me my partner has specific things he’s looking at on me and finds attractive, AND includes a bonus in that it reinforces that he likes something in *my* build that his alleged ‘type’ doesn’t have). Another thing my partner does that works well for me is we’ll shop for clothes together, and he’ll sometimes buy me something he picked for me to try on because he likes the way it highlights a particular attribute of my figure he likes. 

It’d take time, a thorough apology, and a lot of encouragement and support to help her rebuild that confidence. It may or may not shake out, but that’s what I’d recommend you try. Good luck OP
Yeah reminds me of my ex whos type was the same as yours, then he cheated on me. Tho it wasnt with a blonde. Completely did trigger my anxiety tho
How can you possibly be that stupid. I'm speechless.
That's gonna sting for years. I've lost 100 lbs since my partner told me he wasn't attracted to me over 7 years ago, and I still feel the hurt whenever the doubt creeps in. I'm pretty sure my partner also feels insecurities when he thinks about my preference for females.

Honestly, just do your best to reassure her that's she's more than her body, and you value things above that. Also, specific compliments about things related to her will help, but it'll take a long time.
Dude you sound like you have very low emotional intelligence. I would suggest you start really thinking about how your girlfriend is feeling at the moment. You sound oblivious to her feelings even when she tries to bring it up to you.
Other than trying to give her reassurance you can stop checking out other women in front of your girlfriend. 

You might think you only give "glances" but it was enough for her to stop going to the gym with you because of it. It's pretty much a real time reminder that she's not your type.
Well, at least you know how to answer this in your next relationship. The answer is always, "You. You and only you are my type. I wouldn't change a thing."
My dude I'm sorry to tell you this but what you said is now burned into her brain. Elephants have long memories but women never forget shit like that. Ever. 

My sweet husband, while we were dating made the mistake of telling me a joke about female anatomy and a certain smell. 🙃  I'm a women's health RN and extremely meticulous about my female body care. I'm very aware what women's bodies smell like at different times. However this "smell" denotes an infection. The joke fell flat, and I honestly ripped him a new one that moment. This man LOVES to give, if you catch my drift. Ever since that statement/joke, it's now burned into my brain. I am hyper conscious of my body and wont let him near my lower half unless im freshly bathed. He wasn't even joking about me, just goofing on something he saw on IG. I chose to overlook his shortcomings LOL but damn if I'll keep that in my brain to my grave. 

You have this same situation on your hands. She's not gonna forget, least not easily. You're gonna have to overpower that thought with LOTS of reassuring. 

May the odds be ever in your favor my dude.
I made a very similar mistake. My girlfriend had brought up types and she told me her type was Chris Evans. I am very much not Chris Evans and I am so far from being anything like him, but I am content and I didn't care about it. She asked me what my type was and I told her it was short red-heads with long hair, glasses and nerdy. I explained that I had a crush on Batgirl from the Batman animated tv show and that's where it comes from. My girlfriend is very far from a short nerdy red head with long hair and she always brings it up out of no where. 

The correct thing to do is never share your type with your gf. That is a surefire trap.
OP has described his GF as “flat-chested,” “teenage boy,” and having “masculine features,” and basically saying he loves her regardless.

OP either has one of the worst cases of foot-in-mouth disorder that I’ve ever seen, or is in denial that he’s content in this relationship because wtf😭

Either way OP does not seem too bright. You need to learn much more self awareness, awareness of others’ feelings, and tact in general.
You're an idiot. When she told you her type she told you that she found YOU attractive. She specifically mentioned things that YOU HAVE. She used the opportunity to tell you that she liked YOU. 

When you told her your type, you told her she wasn't attractive. That your favorite thing is the exact opposite of what she is. What a fucking idiot. What the hell dude you deserve what you get.

She took the opportunity to build you up, and you took the opportunity to make her feel like trash. What a douche.

DO YOU THINK IT WAS A HAPPY ACCIDENT THAT THE THING SHE MENTIONED AS BEING HER TYPE WERE THINGS THAT CORRELATED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE? SHE ADJUSTED HER ANSWER TO MAKE SURE YOU FELT GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.
My wife told me her 'type' a little while ago, and, well, I'm the opposite of a thick Latin person... lolol
Bro, if she told you she normally only dated buff, bearded, well-endowed black men before she met you, you would almost certainly keep a part of that convo in the back of your mind.
The whole concept of a "type" is fuckin stupid to begin with. When did we get to start choosing who we're attracted to? You're even pointing out how absolutely stupid it is by being with someone completely different from your "type".
You need to double down on telling her how beautiful and sexy she is everyday. Gaze at her randomly and appreciate her beauty, then when she turns and asks you "what?" Tell her she is beautiful. Lay it on extra thick, even if it's cheesy. Don't just adore her, act like you Adore her. Replace her bad memory of what you said with extra love and affection and you guys will move past it (may take a long time).
Bruh, the problem is that you answered this question with your libido not your head, because I get it, that's kinda a throwaway question between guys, in that context it's basically a question of, if somehow you could have sex with a person who looked exactly like what you would want, what would that person look like. It doesn't take into account who that person is or what they do, it's almost like, what sort of sex doll would you buy. But women don't really mean that when they talk about type, they for whatever reason mean like what type of person would you like to have sex with. It's a fundamental difference based on the fact that men and women typically view sex differently, and when you are making a decision about who to penetrate it can be as surface level as what person-shape do you find prettiest, but when you are making a decision about who to let penetrate you, the criteria becomes much different, and it would become more about the person's actual characteristics, because you want to trust this person, but also be intrigued and thrill by them, so that question is rarely as surface level as it can be for men.

My advice is to tell her that you didn't understand what context she was talking about, and you were only considering it topically and uncritically, because questions like that always seem too ethereal to really consider, and that your real type is her (make sure to note the parts of her personality or demeanor that you find attractive primarily, and maybe some of her enjoyable physical qualities as well). Part of the situation is on her, if you are honest and articulate about your feelings then it is on her if she can feel OK with that or not. If not then consider a bullet dodged, but give her a chance to be reasonable with her behavior once you tell her and it will likely improve your relationship.
You deserve everything that happens to you. Not because you are a bad person, but because you are fucking stupid. Everything bad that comes your way from being so fucking dumb will eventually make you smarter. So, really, I am on your side here. I want you to be better, you fucking moron.
What’s a player gotta do when his favorite flavor is new?
Maybe you should spend time talking to her specifically about it. The problem with "types" is that it's generally describing someone physical and that isn't the marker of a good partner. If I ended up with my "type" that person would be completely different from my partner, but that wouldn't be what I really wanted. 

There's a quote from 500 Days of Summer that reminds me of this situation, and maybe it can give you a little inspiration, but here it is:

> “I think technically the girl of my dreams would probably have a really bodacious rack, maybe different hair, she'd probably be a little more into sports. But truthfully, Robin is better than the girl of my dreams. She's real.”

And your partner is real too, she's not a fantasy and that's why she's better than any sort of physical trait that tends to draw you in and why you're with her. Make sure to remind her of this. But make sure to listen to her side of it when she talks about it as these emotions are very real and deep for her, no more brushing it off since you're now aware how much it has affected her.
Sorry, but it's true. That was def a mistake and can't be taken back. 

Years ago, I discovered my husband's "type" is petite Asian chicks.  He watched too much porn on my computer and got a virus. While removing the virus, I saw all the history. 

It ruined me.  I can never be that.  I'm so fucking far from it.  I can never become his preferred type.  It's bothered me ever since.  How can I compete with a completely different nationality? Did he settle by being with me?

I'm sorry I don't have any helpful advice. I've never gotten past it, so I can't tell you how to get her past it. It's been in the back of my mind for 17 years now.
My husband and I went through this. He just kept reinforcing me. He told me every day something different about me that he loved. He started touching/grabbing the parts of me that I was self conscious about all the time in a loving way. I would bat him away playfully but he insisted he loved those parts so much. He stopped looking at anyone when I was around (or just got really good at looking in ways I couldn’t tell). If I spoke about another woman, no matter how hot, he’d say “she’s fine but she’s not you”. 

It sounds hokey but it worked. And all these years later he still does all of this. He trained himself to believe that I’m the most gorgeous woman on earth because I’m his. He still makes me blush. I no longer need his reinforcement but he gives it so genuinely.
Yeah dude, you fucked up lol. She will probably literally never forget you said that. Just don’t complain when she needs constant reassurance because she’ll never feel good enough or like she’s someone you genuinely want. Compliment her all the time. Tell her you were speaking of your type in the past, not your current type. Make her feel special. Probably won’t erase it completely, but it might help.
If my partner described the exact opposite of me as being their type, I think it would eventually be over and never be the same.
Heres where you fucked up. We can never view a conversation with our loved ones as throw away convos. You have to view every convo as an opportunity youre lucky to have. It'll completely change your thinking so stuff like this wont happen. But it does require constantly thinking critically, and choosing to be loving and grateful even when it's hard.
How could you possibly fuck up this bad 😭
Couples counseling.  You don't have to be married for it.
Damn, son. Got any other bombs to drop on your girlfriend, or was Hiroshima there enough for you? Brutal, unnecessary, and yeah man, a major FUp.

Likely no chance of a full recovery.
Never tell your type if you have one to your gf, especially if she isn't like your type. It is just common sense
Yeah you fucked up. If your 'type' is the polar opposite of your current gf, then no matter what happens - some things are just best left unsaid. It doesn't affect how much you love her, but it will/probably has absolutely crushed her, inside.

You have a lot of work to do mate.
I’m going to put myself, a woman, in your girlfriend’s shoes for a sec. If my “boyfriend” described his “type” as the complete opposite of what I am and look like, my initial reaction would be “Why is he even dating me then if I am not what he likes?” I might even think that he insinuated that he “settled” for me and couldn’t find someone better to date. And then it would probably end up in a break up because I would always be slightly worried he’d find a beautiful blonde haired, blue eyed woman he’d want to trade up for.
I've had a few boyfriends tell me I'm not their "usual type" and it felt horrible. You definitely fucked up, friend 😂😭💀
Yeah dude. I've been the gf on the side of this coin. It hurts like all fucking hell and truthfully I'm not sure how you can fix this, but I'm also kinda psycho
Rookie move fella. I’ll take that information to my grave.
Not everything in your head needs to be said out loud, even if it's your "objective truth"
what the hell is wrong with you man, you fucked up so badly. idk how to lay this out to you in a nicer way, but this will stay with her forever, if not forever then it’ll stick with her for a long, LONG time. you don’t just do that shit. every time she will see a girl she considers prettier than herself, she’ll be reminded of this. every time she sees a girl fitting the description you gave, she will think of what you said. and the fact that it took you so long to realize… jesus fuck dude. do better. i feel so bad for her
When she asks for your type, you have to spin it in a way that talks about them. 

Validation in a relationship is as important to women as sex is to men. -- or perhaps its more apt to say, men get their validation through sex, while women get it through compliments/ commitment.

 "Youre not really my type" is the male equivalent to when women say "it felt good, but Ive had a bigger in my past", both comments are like a parasites that will eat away the trust on the relationship.

Yes, women want you to lie to them about how beautiful they are. The same way men want women to lie to them about how great they are in bed.

I know im coming of very Reddit rn, but I do feel for the OP, this is by no means readily available knowledge, nor is it "common sense" as people like to say, its a particularity of the human nature that you often learn through experience.
I've been through this. I'm still hurting. Yet to be anyone's type. I feel for the gf. I know this pain deeply.
[deleted]
Man, not even the girl you described wants to hear their mans type is big boob blonde hair blue eye
I read somewhere once "You don't have a type, you have a pattern". So maybe you just broke a pattern that no longer suited you.
I'm just very fascinated about the fact that someone can have such a specific type mentioning a particular eye color, hair color etc

Well, she's not gonna forget this, and oh boy that's how you get insecurities.
Edit: how old are you?

*This is def 18+ advice lol*

Time to put in some work

She thinks you engage sexually with a specific type. She thinks you’re more open to sexually indulging with a specific type. She thinks you will play in your mind this other body type and she sees all the times you don’t do any of that with her.

You should tell her of like crushes you used to have on cartoon characters or whatever. Let her know that 1. Your ‘fantasies’ and feelings of attraction weren’t always entirely rational but also 2. You outgrew them and changed

They belong to another you that doesn’t have her

And then you guys just be naked and hang out for a long while. Repeat multiple times

If it’s in her head for a long time, even after giving her attention in a way she says she wants, you can go over jealousy, attraction, desire all that stuff. Maybe talk about it via media (TikTok drama and such) so there’s no direct engagement, insecurity and conflict. It doesn’t have to be a fight

She just wants to know that you want her. She wants to know that your body wants her the way you’ve said it wants other types of people
Jesus. You seem like a very nice person but I just have to say…men are…so fucking dumb. I feel for your poor girlfriend. She sounds like an angel
You think that you used to stare at girls together at the gym but in reality, she was watching how YOU stared at those blonde gyms girls. And she noticed something that you still probably haven’t noticed yourself. And that’s probably why she asked that question about your type in the first place. She was probably hoping that what you said would soothe the insecurities she had. But all you did was confirm them. And now here you are. Maybe if you weren’t busy staring at girls in the gym you would’ve noticed how your gf felt. I’m guessing the “cool gf” act finally wore off and she got tired of you checking out other girls. At least you told the truth so she won’t find out the hard way… good luck to your relationship buddy.
People have more than one type.

But people don't always BELIEVE that this is the case.

And now you've driven a steak through her heart, either it won't heal over, or it'll take SERIOUS time.

source: been there :(

Put the hours in to make her feel special again, my friend, or this gig's up.
Types are dumb. You fall in love with someones brain and behavior. Sure, you might initially think blondes are attractive, but in the end it would never work, because you have found a great personality to match you in this brunette. And when you find someone who is in character amazing, you find their body more attractive, because you start to associate it with the person you're in love with. No blondes can top that.
I was never able to get over my ex telling me i’m the exact opposite of his type. you fucked up guy.
Probably depends on how you put that. I told my partner (with who I am for the better part of a decade) that his looks are pretty out of my usual "prey profile", but I followed up in the same sentence that he certainly was the most charming, caring and nicest man I ever dated pretty early on in the relationship.  Didn't faze him at all.
My husband isn't my "type" (I actually have a couple), but he's my TYPE.  His features may not be the sort I go for,  but mentally he does it for me, and I would not trade him for my five favorite eye- candy guy and a beach front mansion for us to live in.   Physical attraction only gets you so far.  For a good relationship,  you need someone who understands you,  who treats you with respect,  and can share and support each other's goals.  My husband is my best friend, and I am his.  Despite health challenges,  we still enjoy a decent sex life,  more than 15 years in, and there is nobody else I'd rather snuggle.  All of that is what attracts me to him - and yes,  perhaps because of it,  I do feel physically attracted,  too.  He looks wonderful to me.
Try to use this line from 500 Days of Summer https://youtu.be/4HkPuttj4R8
I've learned that "types" are one of those things that you always lie about, especially if your partner doesn't fit your usual type. I had this exact experience but opposite - was dating a very curvy woman whereas my type is usually a leaner build. She asked what my type was, I told her, and afterward she could never believe I was attracted to her. She eventually started to bring up mmy supposed lack of attraction to her if we argued or had a fight, despite it having absolutely no relevance or basis in truth. That ended up making me actually lose attraction to her and we eventually broke up.
This is very normal. Your ideal partner never is the partner you might end up with… sometimes personality trumps all and you learn to love this person who also loves you. That’s what it’s all about.
As a practice of empathy, imagine if you were a pale white man, 5’10, small end of average sized peen, stocky and your girlfriend, who you had been with for a while, told you her type was 6’5, fit slender man with huge wang and perfect dark brown skin. Allow yourself to imagine how that would make you feel about yourself and then sit her down lovingly and tell her you’re sorry for doing all that.
Whatever you do don't start listing off all of her friends that you find more attractive next.
My husband once told me when he sees a pair of big boobs he loses his mind. I have small boobs. He said that maybe 6 years ago… yeah that really fucked me up. Good luck.
i learned this lesson the hard way

"whats your type"

the answer is always "you". 

and for the love of god, dont go into detail. its "you" and "what about me" is answered with "everything". 2 words, no more. don't fuck it up
You gotta watch what you say. Once you say it you can't unsay it.

I had a similar conversation, and I had to tread very lightly and carefully.  Inside my head I'm thinking one thing but I can't say that out loud.  So instead I just focused on the reasons why I liked her (versus the attributes that she doesn't have and I'd prefer).

Now you'll have to show her with your actions and apologize profusely.
Just don't make it worse by saying like me ex, "Yes it was true when I said you aren't my physical type and I only find you attractive because I love your spirit why can't that be enough for you?"
...just, don't. Ever. If it is true, leave her for the love of God and do her a favor.
There's nothing you can do. It's all in her head, you can't go in there and take it out.
> She’s beautifully androgynous and occasionally people mistake her for a very pretty teenage boy. (I love and am attracted to every bit of this about her more than any other ‘type’ that exists because she’s her.)

Bro what are you even trying to say with this. What kind of an analogy lol
I would be heartbroken if my husband described his type as the exact opposite of me. I feel really bad for her. She deserves better.
Honestly, this is probably a perspective thing, but I don’t think being with someone who isn’t your type is a bad thing. I’m not curvy by any means, and while my SO has never said I’m not his type, I’ve seen pics of his exes, and I don’t match. They’re very similar looking with curvy bodies and I have more of an athletic build. Small boobs, etc. 

But he’s gone above and beyond for me, and treats me in ways that show me there’s no comparison. I have no doubt he’s never loved anyone like he loves me. 

And frankly, I feel pretty special that I don’t just fit the basic mold he’s been into in the past. He loves me for me and he shows me how crazy he is about me (including my body) all the time. He can’t keep his hands off of me. There’s never been a day that I don’t feel beautiful/attractive in his eyes. 

I think you should definitely explain that she is perfect for you, but more importantly, I think you should find ways to show it on a daily basis. This is an insecurity that stems deeper than what you said a few months ago, you simply (unconsciously) re-opened a wound. She’s the only one who can truly heal herself, but you can help her in the process by showing her how much you love each and every thing that makes her unique. The key is to show her, actions speak louder than words.
Hello! I’m married to an idiot who did this to me. I still married him though haha. I say idiot with love, though it was probably the most hurtful thing he did to me, intentionally or unintentionally, throughout the entire 11 years we have been together. His type is athletic, shorter girls with dark straight hair, large bums, and smaller breasts- more pear shaped. I’m taller than him- my hair is curly, I have very large breasts, negative butt, just zero ass, and not athletic.

If you guys stay together, I guarantee that info will live rent free in her head forever and pop up when both of you least expect it. 

I feel like I did what your girlfriend did, I described my “type” as being someone bookish, who never lost the drive to learn new things, who was a bit more into nerdy stuff, was confident in how they carried themselves, etc. I didn’t describe the way someone looked, because well.. I don’t have a type in that regard? That’s not to say I find everyone attractive but I don’t favor one ethnicity or body shape over another. 

My husband has said before he chose me for my brain and that should be better than him choosing me for my looks. Please don’t say that. It is like a knife to the heart. I wanted to be both brains and beauty for someone. 

I wanted- and I’m sure your girlfriend feels the same- to be the person my partner found to be their perfect person. You fit her mold. She realized she didn’t fit in yours. She will never not feel like you didn’t settle for her to some degree. 

The best you can do is gradually try and convince her that being with her has changed your type to be what she is, and you wouldn’t change a thing about her. She’ll never believe you fully, but it will help. Get some home gym equipment, and work out with her at home. Try to not ogle people in front of her. 

I can’t stress enough how this is actually the single biggest thing I resent about my spouse. In the throes of postpartum depression, I became very much suicidal over it when my body changed even further- I gained weight, my boobs got even bigger- and had to go on medication for intrusive thoughts (it didn’t help he was inappropriately messaging someone who was perfectly his type at that time and I found out). 

Sometimes I feel like I’ve forgotten about it, for a while. Months might pass. Years sometimes. But then boom, I see something like this post (yay Reddit!) and I’m right back in time and he told me all this just moments before. And it hurts. And honestly? Sometimes I wish I had never married him and had broken up with him at that point and found someone whose type I was, because then I wouldn’t have to live with this knowledge that I’d never be what my partner wanted, and couldn’t become that no matter how hard I tried. 

He’s a very supportive, loving husband. A lot of good qualities. In many ways I doubt I could have a better spouse. But yeah. You fucked up. I’m really sad for your girlfriend and hope others see your post and my comment as a PSA against doing this. If someone asks you your type and you have like… a body shape type or something similar, and it isn’t exactly what your partner is, just DON’T say it.
Yeah take that shit to your grave
100% agree. Starr off with, "I'm sorry if I made you feel like you're not my type, I feel horrible. I had no idea you were bringing up that conversation and I brushed it off. *insert in the "you're my type because and why"*
My experience on Reddit suggests that "Tall and flat chested" actually means like 5'6" and B cups.
Exactly. Now it's a wound that's festering.
My wife brought up types before, and thankfully I was smart enough to respond “you.”

Her type is tall, lanky, goofy-looking guys. She proceeded to give examples.

Self-image still hasn’t recovered lol
[deleted]
I bet it did. My partner told me his type was tall, thin, leggy blondes. I’m mixed, on the shorter side, and naturally muscular. Like complete opposite. Definitely messed with my head. Careless comment with lasting hurt.
With good reason. Saying your type is something completely different than her...yeah that's a pretty big fuck up.
People don't understand this enough. Once you say something, it can NEVER be unsaid. Guard your words people. All it takes is 1 angry sentence to car your partner forever.
Core memory right there bro. Sorry
Just like in Inside Out.

The only appropriate response. 

(also saving this for future reference)
This is honestly his best way out. Also once you’re with someone long enough physical appearance doesn’t hold as much weight, it’s more about how you grow with each other, get along, understand & compromise. I’d stress that she’s a bad bitch and he loves her no matter what, if I were him. Boom
Rae Sremmurd is two people
This one for sure. It’s not even that she’s not his type, it’s that his type is exactly what all women are told that is the “ideal” woman. So it’s a double whammy
He also described her as flat chested.  

Not smaller breasted.  But flat chested.  Ouch.
If I was the girl in the situation, I would not think that the compliments are genuine and he is just trying to placate me.  I wouldn't believe them.
But not thick in a cheesy way because we can tell when you are trying to “make nice” to fix a stupid mistake.
"I do have a type, but you are so beautiful that I don't even think about that when I see you or are with you. I dont want anyone else." Or something like that, I dunno. 

What will probably come out of his mouth is: "I do have a type, but you and your so beautiful with your flat chest and teenage boy face that I don't even care about big boobs anymor- why are you crying?"
I was talking to my husband when my husbands best friends sister was brought up. She is a tall, blonde, model. I said “I wonder what my life would have been like if I was tall, blonde, and beautiful” and my husband said “probably weird for your parents” and It seriously changed the way I thought about myself permanently! I no longer wish I was tall and blonde, I’m exactly who I’m supposed to be (:
I had one ex years ago say someone about me being "lippy" down there and I've never gotten over it. 

I've been with plenty of men, no complaints, and even one that specifically called out that he liked my situation and gave very specific reasons why. 

But that one comment, not even said to be mean, still totally ruined oral for me, and took my sexual self esteem down a notch.
I second this. As someone who has an athletic build, I didn’t see a lot of women in media who look like me when I was a teenager. She probably has that same sort of insecurity, based on her description and the comments she made.
Yea when he described his ideal woman he described " the ideal woman" for society for the most part .   Blond hair, blue eyes and big boobs lol.   His poor girlfriend
There’s hope still here. But it’s gonna take some concentrated effort. 

In my mind—careful where you trod—I can see OP staging an incredibly intimate and romantic setting that could be described also as a spiritual ritual. 

This can be as involved as OP is willing but it includes both parties naked in both physical and soul-baring vulnerability. 

Look into her eyes. Tell you are sorry that you spoke without thinking. Tell her that what you said was an old generic response to a shallow question about types and you responded from a solid place of security in your relationship because you can’t imagine feeling more secure than you feel in your attraction to her. 

Then touch her face. Tell her what you love about her face. Tell her how it makes you feel just to be able to see her face every day. Tell her that you can see this face forever and never tire of it. Don’t hold back your adoration. 

Continue to her neck, then her shoulders and when you get to her breasts, hold them close together and kiss them. Use your palms to hold them both. Don’t go straight to the nipples. Love the whole of her chest. 

Then give her a full body massage slowly and with oil. Talk about everything you love about her body. Take this moment to share with her all the things you love about her. 

There’s so much you can do with this. There is so much potential for healing and bringing healing energy to both of you. 

Have some fancy snacks that you can feed her as you blanket her with your love and adoration. Make everything all about her.

Hi, sorry. She doesn’t look underage, she’s 29. Sometimes people 60+ years old thinks she’s a boy (but never a grown man, hence the “teenage” comment). She doesn’t look like a teenager, but I do find her ‘masculine’ features very beautiful, is what I meant to say 😥
lmao I cackled so loud

Thank you! I needed this laugh lol. I didn’t even pick up on the awkwardness of the wording when I read it the first time!

Lol. Absolutely epic placement.
Ha!!!!!!!!!

i’m weak 😂😂😂
I don't like women. I like my wife and that's it
As simple as that!
I love that and can only imagine how secure she is with you.   I want that
This is the way!
This is my woman. There aren’t many like her, and she is mine.

My woman is my best friend. She is my life. I must master her as I must master my life.

Without me, my woman is useless. Without my woman, I am useless…

>Throughout the years it has been hard for me at times knowing that I am not her type. I have finally come to a place that I must be something special for her to stay attracted to me even though I wouldn’t be the first guy to catch her eye across a crowded room.

Echoing this from the female perspective!

My boyfriend is 100% my type physically and personality wise. Meanwhile, his physical type is tall, slender brunettes and I am a short blonde who is pretty petite but more muscular than delicate in nature. He's never dated a single blonde before me and has dated several incredibly beautiful women who totally fit his physical type. Sometimes I feel badly that he's my dream man and I'm lacking the physical presentation of his dream woman. On the flip side, I know he wouldn't be with me if he found me generally unattractive and I know he loves me for the person I am and not just for my surface level appearance.

Even if someone has a type, I've never met a person who feels everyone outside of that type is unattractive. And, at the end of the day, personality is what impacts attraction the most. We're in relationships with people, not pictures. 

I empathize with the emotional conflict OP's girlfriend is having and I hope she can get to a place where she can see it as a compliment rather than an insult.
I fucked up by seeing what kind of porn my partner is into and it’s the exact opposite of me as well. “Chubby, mature milfs with red hair” and I’m a petite young blonde. I know it’s just something to look at. And maybe he’s not my ideal type either but for some reason it makes me really insecure.
"my wife is my standard of beauty"
Almost exactly the same situation. I'm not my wife's type, which is typically a really thin and punk aesthetic. I'm not that, at all. 

I always chose to view it optimistically. My wife chose me despite me not being her type, which means that I must have something really good going on for her to deviate so far from what she would normally look for.
Once I was talking to my husband's co-worker encouraging her to go out with another guy they worked with because he is a great guy who had expressed an interest in her. She responded, he isn't my type. I looked at her and pointed at my husband and said, this is not my type... She looked at me totally shocked, we are considered 'couples goals' at  his work. I said, he isn't my physical type but he is the love of my life. You never know what the person you love the most will look like. I am wildly attracted to him because of my love for him but if I saw him on the street I probably wouldn't look at him again. He knows I love me a big tall man but also know I only have eyes for him.
This exactly! My bf and I are neither each other's types, but I've noticed in the past 2 years my types have been developing into a combination of my old type + traits of my bf. And a similar situation is happening to him as well. Although we still have a preference for our usual types, it's interesting how our traits are starting to bleed into that.
Now they just have to play the game that it must be true love since he can move past the typing with such immense ease.

Good luck, they'll need it.
It’s probably one of those situations where lying is kinder, even if you actually have a very specific type that is vastly different from your current partner
Especially when she goes effectively "you, dummy" first. Like if she threw out some movie star this could be said as a joke if it fits the mood, but yeah, like there's no excuse here.
or it changed, for real i think i told my SO, this in the past, that my type was another entirely, and it changed because of her.
If you're really tempted to be that honest, say "it was (this type)... but then I met you".
Yeah, ducking madman maneuver.
Are there some parts of yourself you just shouldn't share in a relationship?
Bruh this is such a perfect explanation. Saving this for future reference. "Types are just comfort food." Perfection.
See, both are subjective. We're getting into psychology and how effective communication is vital. Because a partner might think of themselves as filet mignon, but worried that it's too much for you when you want mac & cheese, but in reality your partner is a tofu sandwich.

Crap, I've gotten lost in the analogy and can't recall my point... brb
Exactly. Rephrased as a script for OP:

"Usually when I go out to a restaurant I know I like pasta so I'll order pasta. But then I went to a new place called 'Our Relationship', tried something new, and had the filet mignon. It was amazing and now that's my favorite."
.... I do still like a side of mac n cheese to go with filet mignon though
Bro this was poetry
This is the wisest thing I've heard someone say in a long time. Bravo
Yeah I think the gf needs to work on her insecurity and they both need to work on their communication but jesus fucking christ my guy lol. Anyone would feel not great about a comment like that. Also don’t fucking look at other women in front of your girlfriend. If she noticed and brought it up, then it’s likely not “just” a glance.
OP couldn't have fucked up any harder. Mistakes were made here but we are all human though and shit happens.
Ideally, Danny DeVito. But you are a close second.

i wonder how op even got a gf in the first place saying that dumb shit
As an Asian femme, I wish I could speak on behalf of all Asian femmes and declare: we do not want him.
I am… so sorry he said that. 🫠
Omg my ex boyfriend said the SAME thing. He's 100% white.  He kept telling me how great I'd look with black hair or in cheongsams. I am 0% Asian. When we broke up he went straight for his type and is dating an Asian lady. Like dude... just be honest with yourself lol. No wonder I felt undesired.
[deleted]
ew 🤢 whenever someone answeres the “what’s your type” question with an ethnicity a lot of the time it’s bcuz they fetishize that that ethnicity. men who are obsessed w asian women are a different breed of creepy too due to how they tend to sexualize their existence.
I'm in the same boat as you haha My bf of several years said his type is short South Asian women or Latinas. I'm white like paper and not petite and can never be his type, obviously. Even though I never brought it up since and it's all in my head, it's something I will remember/be insecure about forever unless we break up I guess
I had the same thoughts...I would feel the exact same way
You *nailed* it. The individual's level of control over the traits listed is gonna affect their reaction to you saying that you prefer those things.

If most--or, god forbid, all--of the characteristics that you list aren't things that the person can realistically change, the potential for hurt is so much greater because it feels like you're implying "Not only are you not what I **really** want, but you're also never *going* to be."
Yep op repeat this guys exact words verbatim while reading from your phone
I would most definitely hate it if my boyfriend all of a sudden went from no compliments to over-the-top cheesy. It makes me cringe inside and I’d feel like it was all totally insincere. Don’t go over the top “over the next few days.” 

Just be you and if the topic comes up or feels like it’s lingering on the edge, just tell her how much you love her. Don’t complement her appearance toooooo much or too strongly, or else it will feel like pandering.   
  
That’s just one woman’s opinion though!
Yep. If this was me I'd immediately forgive and just feel a whole lot better. It just feels so sweet and genuine, and oftentimes, that's enough.
The thing that would've hit me the most is being flat chested and being told he likes busty women. That would really get to me.
Yeah when pretty much everything you've seen your whole life has reinforced the fact that women with long blonde hair, blue eyes, and big boobs are the "ideal", it hurts to have your partner essentially affirm that. You can't really help what your "type" is, but come on, OP should have known that wouldn't go over well.
dependent thumb rob boat wild ugly many ripe subsequent vase ` this post was mass deleted with www.Redact.dev `
Yeah I’d leave OP not because I’m not his type but because he’s a fucking buffoon.
This is good advice! But not for me… I like pathetic men. I don’t think saying that will make them feel good lmao
>What you need to tell is what your personality’s type is.

If personality was the default aspects when thought of when asked about type, there would be a difference. 

But it is nearly always about physical traits.
TBH, it's also ok to talk about looks too so long as you relate it to your partner. Ie: "Generally, I've been into XYZ in the past. I know that's not you, but you are definitely redefining my type because I find you so attractive."
I don’t fully disagree with you but I also don’t see how your example is that much better. Being secure and crazy smart aren’t givens either. If anything I can dye my hair, I can’t magically make myself “crazy smart”.
He doesn’t seem too smart.
Because he is stupid
Because types are not a hard set of what you like you can find things other than that strict type attractive and fall in love and that's not even taken into consideration the personality part of it
See, that's the ideal. "You're my type now" and make sure they know it's true before you tactfully share any previous preferences. Because if your partner isn't your type now, then that's not a lot of people's idea if a romantic/loving pairing.
i was going to comment the same thing. those are the types of people they “look” at so who’s to say that when they’re in a relationship they just stop looking.
Why is this so far down 💀 dude has wandering eyes and porn brain, wonders why girlfriend is insecure
Tbf she did the exact same thing as you did, then it's not weird that you'd think the first part is okay with hearing that.
Genuine question: at what point does the fact that you have to hide things from your SO get to the point where you should start thinking about whether you're actually a good match for each other?

I used to have a female friend and it was like.. The good moments were extra good, but the bad moments were extra bad. She was very emotionally sensitive to the point where I had to be careful of what I said, otherwise she'd spent the next few days being upset about it, and it sucked. She was okay as a friend overall, I guess, but I definitely don't envy her husband.
Kinda seems like a harsh double standard.
Damn, the constantly bringing up stuff out of nowhere shit is horrible, you’re just trying to chill and all of a sudden you’re hit with that one thing you’ve talked out 100 times already
right like what the fk😭 this guy really went ahead and said “oh my type is, girls who look exactly the opposite of what you look like” and didnt see a single thing wrong with it until months later after brushing her fucking feelings away
I don't even get it either just because you have a type doesn't mean you can't see and be attracted to the beauty in others
I get where you're coming from but it also kind of sounds like "men see women as sex dolls while women see men as people" which is... sad
I had never really considered why men and women found sex different,  but you really nailed it with that explanation. Thanks for that, definitely something I'll think about in the future.
Do you think about anyone but yourself? You didn’t ask questions about her quitting weightlifting? She stopped a beloved activity that is VERY beneficial for health and you just went “la di da, just another day in eyewhiner world, guess I’ll skip off to the gym alone”? Jfc dude, jfc, treat the next one better
THANK YOU! I thought I was the only one who caught that. And everyone else here telling OP he f'ed up by telling the truth, well I think he f'ed up by dishonestly dating someone he didn't prefer in the first place. This is all the consequence of his own actions. His (possibly soon-to-be-ex) gf deserves so much better.
Thank you for the visual of driving a steak (meat) through someone’s heart 😅 rather than a stake.
And to Reddit
Yea fr wtf was that ab
You would make it a even worse fuck up if you did this
Ditch the if and this is a great response.
I call it a soul wound. Those don't heal so good and can kill you as sure as a bullet.
See I don't get this.   


It's just as devastating to hear the other way around, but because it's a dude getting his self image destroyed, it's just a "lol"
I am the opposite of anybody my wife has dated or been in a relationship with. It's entirely possible to have a type and have your mind changed by somebody that comes along. My wife wasn't my "type" and still isn't in some ways, but I love her more than anything.

I think what we both realized was how important the right attitude was to both of us and that was far and away more important than any specific physical feature
I hope you realize that "type" means absolutely nothing in the long run for a lot of people. I have a very distinctive physical type based on what type of celebrities I like looking at, and what type of person my eyes are drawn to in a bar. To the point where when my best friend watches TV with me, she can immediately tell exactly which characters I find attractive. 

Guess what, no one that I've developed actual romantic feelings for even sort of resembled that type. But I still found all of the people I actually liked absolutely gorgeous, because at a certain point when you care for someone that way, their appearance just becomes exactly what you want to look at, regardless of what you might have thought if you just saw a photo of them before knowing them. Also, I find that the actual chemistry you feel with someone in person has only so much to do with what they look like.

So basically, if you have a good relationship with your husband, I really really doubt that you not being his normal type means that he doesn't find you perfectly stunning and gorgeous.
I love pizza in almost any context, even when it's frozen and not very good. But sometimes I go out and eat a meal that tastes amazing in a way I didn't know was possible. In that moment, it would be ridiculous to be disappointed that I am not eating a frozen pizza instead. What I'm saying is sometimes the world serves you up something better than what you thought you wanted.
Literally the only reason I'm okay with my huge ass is because my husband has made it abundantly clear that he loves it.
Same here. He also gave examples of people we ACTUALLY KNOW to back up his type. 

The big difference is something I can’t change - my ethnicity and skin colour.
I definitely get this! I was flat chested when I was younger, and if a guy had told me that he preferred busty women, I would have felt pretty bad. Your partner really shouldn’t have said that to you.

On top of the fact that OP’s gf knows she isn’t his type, I think there may be an extra layer of hurt because his type is consistent with what’s considered conventionally beautiful, and based on OP’s description, she is more unconventionally beautiful. Women tend to be pretty aware of all the ways we “fall short” of our culture’s beauty standard. I kind of wonder whether she would have had such a strong reaction if the situation was switched up such that she was blonde, blue eyed and curvy, and OP told her that his type was tall, muscular, androgynous looking brunettes.
So stupid. Almost as stupid as the guy who rated his gf a 7 and a hookup a 10. He brought up the subject but if your gf/bf asks you who your type is, never lay out the characteristics they *dont* have. That’s so.. empty headed. He should’ve said something about the things he likes about her. “I like fit women, women with a good sense of style/ humor, women who take care of themselves, who are sweet, fun, adventurous..“ anything of that sort.
[deleted]
I’m not sure where I’m going to use this knowledge but thank you for the correction.
Especially if they have been liking posts, following or commenting on randoms with that body type. It highlights all of those insecurities
Yeah this is like the worst ‘type’ to say you have. It’s like saying you’re into the female beauty ideal/ busty Barbie.
I've never heard anyone described as small breasted, but that seems a lot crueler than flat chested.
I love this!

It was the best thing he could have said, snapping you out of any kind of downward spiral with truth and a twist of humor.
That's a great response!
So perfect
That response is GOLD
What? I don't get it. What did he mean by that?
"Probably weird for your butt ugly parents"
I was with a woman for a bit who was hesitant to let me go down. She enjoyed it but was always paranoid about taste and smell because of some comments someone (I assume her previous long term ex) made.

She smelled and tasted like a normal woman and despite me telling her I love going down (which I genuinely do), she never got over it.

Oof. I feel you on this. I was a ballet dancer but built more like a gymnast (very short- bustier than a ballet dancer should be and some very muscular legs I had a stupid degree of hate for growing up). When knee high boots first came in style I would feel so much shame having to buy specially sized boots to fit over my killer calves. 

I like my body now in my 30s and realize a lot of people would like to look like me but then I also had 15 years of severe illness take almost all of that muscle mass from me and would sure give anything to live in that body that could do some really amazing things and not even think twice about it.
I was unprepared to be subjected to such levels of  rizz today

As a woman, just reading this is making me melt and want to cry from happiness, ask for his babies, and then fall into a swoon from the imaginary man who would do this with me. In that order.

Can I be your type?
This is the way!!
Wow, I was going to recommend you help her get into counseling and you do the little things to remind her you care every day. But, this will do if you are Don Juan.  Just remember this is big risk, big reward.  You need the resolve of a snake charmer to pull this off well and if you muck it up it will be just as fatal as a snake bite to your relationship.  Just do whatever fits your personality, because it has to be authentic to work.
😅 is anyone else kinda hot?? *whew* 🥵
[removed]
Ikr u cant make this shit up
I totally understood what you meant, I just found the phrasing to be unfortunate/comical.  :)
Heads up dude. When you talk to her about this never use any of the terms you have been using to describe her here to us, to her.

Do not call her masculine, do not call her flat, or boyish, even if you like those things about her. She is very insecure about that and it will not go well for you.
For the love of god, don’t tell her you love her masculine features! She’ll never get over it
If you want a more easily understood way to put that, just say they're "tomboyish".
I hope you see this.

Tell her what you told us, and elaborate better/clean it up (maybe don't mention the teenage boy part LOL).

It sounds like you were describing the most common type of woman you tended to date before you met her, while she was in a headspace of "What women do you find attractive". 

She is VERY likely self conscious about her chest, for starters - even if she's never told you. She also may have caught flack for being "manly" and even tall. What you said, while completely casual and with no malice, pretty much shattered her confidence in your attraction to her.

You know her better than me. But if this happened to me, this is what would make me feel better:

"I want you to know I was just listing off the most common traits across all my girlfriends/women I wanted to pursue. I've been thinking harder about it, and I'd say my type is more (list her qualities, physical and personality wise - like, if you love how muscular her thighs are, or her butt, etc, mention that in a general sense - 'I like muscular legs. I like strong arms.' etc)

I don't want to be with anyone else more than you. I didn't even notice that woman the other day. I never wish you looked different. You're so hot, you're (insert favorite trait here - funny, loving, etc, all of the above), and I am so sorry that I said what I said without clarifying. You are PERFECT, babe."

It doesn't need to be a whole speech but, if you reassure her like this I bet she'll cry and hug you. Bonus points if said over her favorite meal. 😂

You're a sweetheart. I hope she feels better. You didn't do anything wrong, just...us women have hangups about our bodies that rear their ugly heads at the worst times. Then our insecurities are like a dog with a bone; our brains won't let them fuckin rest, and we overanalyze everything, it drives us nuts. Having a supportive partner helps a ton there, as does being super honest. I just tell my other half outright: "Dude, I don't believe this. I promise I don't think this about you. But my anxiety is yelling at me so can you just reassure my dumb ass please" lmao. Let her know she can be open about how she's feeling and you will help. It feels so much better to be able to ask my boyfriend to help me fight my shitty inner voice 😂
Definitely work on your communication skills. Your story is full of think before you talk examples.
The real TIFU is in the comments
I'm imagining you trying to comfort your GF by telling her how much you love her masculine features, lmao. 

This fuckup, the first of many.
OP youre a fucking asshole by saying her insecurities are stupid
never say this to a woman sincerely a guy who is 42  and is happily married. 

touch grass
Stop putting your foot in your mouth.
And for the original post you should have never said that word gets around and it's disrespectful.
Bro you desperately need to STOP describing what you like in women. Keep it to YOURSELF. You keep shooting yourself in the foot hahah 😂
![gif](giphy|22oIrkwS0RQEfZJI5P|downsized)
she has insecurities too, but she feels so secure with me. I love her so much
I fell in love with my best friend - by the time we got together I had known him for about 10 years, 9 of which I quite honestly wasn't particularly attracted to him at all - he's a relatively good looking guy, never had issues attracting the ladies, but isn't really my 'type' as such.

There's a quote from the film "The Truth About Cats & Dogs" that has always struck a nerve with me and epitomises exactly how I feel about my husband now.

“You know how someone's appearance can change the longer you know them? How a really attractive person, if you don't like them, can become more and more ugly; whereas someone you might not have even have noticed... that you wouldn't look at more than once, if you love them, can become the most beautiful thing you've ever seen. All you want to do is be near them.”
Very well said. I had a very specific type when I was a teenager/my early twenties. I’m now 37, and I’ve been with tall and short, thin and chubby, tatts and no tatts, bald, long hair etc etc. 

I love my partner and find him extremely hot, even though he wouldn’t fit what 20 year old me liked. I did NOT like beard and chest hair back then for example. But on him? Rawr.. ;) 

As I’ve grown older, I think my “visual” type has become broader, now personality and values are much more important. My partner is incredibly selfless, he’s funny, clever, thoughtful, kind and sexy. 

With maturity comes different perspective, I guess.
You saw A type of porn he looks at.
There are a lot of things I wank to that I absolutely would not want IRL.
If you were a chubby mature milf with red hair, he would be watching porn with petite young blondes.

Fantasy is an escape from, or an alternative to, reality. At the end of the day, when what they want in real life is you, that's what matters.
This is a complex issue. People complain all day about how the other sex just views them as a sex object.

Ultimately there are more characteristics people take into account other than physical. They often don’t mention these when discussing type. It’s also impossible to match every type.
Idk if this helps but in my experience the porn you watch on a whim and your actual type are very different, unless it’s a 100% of all porn watched type of fixation maybe
Something makes me think he doesn't mind petite young blondes lmao. Plus why would he watch porn that matches what he's already getting?
Ah yes, all guys I know *hate* petite young blondes. Disgusting.

As a porn watcher myself, you need to know a few things:

1. Porn is like food. Sometimes we crave burgers. Sometimes we crave sushi. The wonderful thing about porn is it's all available, all the time. Whatever you're craving at the moment is what you watch. It says literally nothing about how they feel about a real life partner.
2. It's pretty common to watch the exact opposite of your significant other when watching porn. Let's say burgers are your favorite food and you love burgers and cook them and eat them at home every day. When you go out to eat, you probably aren't going to order a burger every time. It doesn't mean you don't like burgers... they're still your favorite.

In short stop worrying about it.

Also now I'm hungry or horny and I'm not sure which.
he's with you. that should be a lot more significant than the kind of sex doll he'd buy.
I wish OP included their ages, because if they’re young they can move past it as they mature. This stuff would’ve wrecked me in my early 20s, now it wouldn’t bother me so much in my 30s.
I mean  I would argue that if you genuinely find your GF super hot, then she's ALSO your type, and your type isn't as set as it was in the past. Preferences change. Telling your partber you only like busty blondes if she is a skinny brunette is never going to end well.

Just tell your partber that your type has varied from partner to partner, and you find her sexy. That's all any partner wants to hear on that topic.
“My type is whoever I’m attracted to” is an entirely honest answer and blandly diplomatic for anyone wondering how to answer this question.
My partner has told me something similar and I just found it flattering and sweet. But obviously people are different and what’s a compliment to one person can be an insult to someone else.
There's really no great solution if they already have a response in her head.

My ex was a tallish blonde and she asked me the same thing. I said I generally notice blondes more but only find a few actually attractive.

Few weeks after we broke up I found out she was telling my friends that "he likes them tall and blonde."

Ok I do like them a little tall but she's literally the 2nd girl Ive dated who's blonde.

And she wasnt even a real blonde so wtf.
Just don't do this,
Thanks!
[deleted]
I dunno what your point is either, but I do know that if I called my imaginary partner a tofu sandwich, I'd be sleeping on the couch.
That was my first thought as well. If my boyfriend’s comfort food was mac’n cheese, I wouldn’t want him to never get to have it.
A delicious threesome.
This made me laugh. But gahdamn, the people here are advanced stupid lol.
[removed]
He had every chance in the world to cage, sidestep or straight up refuse to answer.  But he did this.  


Shit my wife and I NOW mock each other for our "types" and our exes.  But thats in a damn near 20 year relationship.
*Yeah...*

Any time a dude says they're into "Asian women" (as if that's a monolith), I'm immediately wary; way too much fetishizing there.
That's a fair addendum... it has to be genuine!
My husband is around your height, and he is a stocky dude. He is shorter than the other men in his family, and it was a sore spot for him when he was younger. He also has a bit of a belly, and I tell him all the time how gorgeous he is. I deeply love him, and make sure to tell him daily. I compliment his eyes, his gorgeous lashes, all sorts of different things about him that he may not feel good about that day. 

I really do wish more people would sincerely compliment and affirm their partners 🫂
I’m 5’2 and I’ll fully admit I prefer dating “shorter” men. Like.. I fully recognize I am little lol dating a man who is on the shorter size is ideal because it makes communicating better, eye contact is better, they’re not putting important things up out of sight or reach all the time… also simple intimate things like slow dancing. I can’t dance with a guy who is 6’2 lol and kissing.. he would need to either bend down making me feel like a child or I need a stool.
Seriously. I can't believe how many upvotes this shit has.
Well, no, but anyway, what are you doing on friday?
“A man who is comfortable being vulnerable and is unafraid of showing his emotions around other people”
Well, some are into that lmao
Depends on the man, I guess? Some people are just looking for someone to give them a chance at love despite their imperfections.
LMAOOO
But when she talked about her type, it was personality traits: "men who are comfortable expressing femininity" and "tattoos" (which is physical but it's a choice that often reflects you as a person, and not an inherent genetic blessing). OP responded by listing literally only physical traits (hair color, hair length, body type, body type, body type). 

And for what it's worth, OP was probably referring to personality/behavior when he compared himself to her best friend. Presumably he was not comparing how they both have long blonde hair, blue eyes, curvy bodies, and big tits. It was most likely stuff like "we're both sarcastic" or "we both love cheesy horror movies" or things like that. You know, the way people describe their affinities for other people that they're not objectifying.
But if you could choose what your partner looks like, you’d 100% go for your type. That’s why I always roll my eyes when people say that types don’t matter.
Yeah if someone is comfortable with telling their SO that they have a very specific type that does not match their SO at all, then they need to be comfortable with hearing something similar in return.
Personally, if there's a decent relationship happening, it's actually very hard to hide stuff, after an extended period of time together.  If you really get to know them, their body language, in particular, will tell you more than their mouths.  But people aren't frequently observant, and miss a lot of cues.

I'm coming up on 40 years married.  I know what his "type" is, simply by seeing where his eyes linger that extra 1/2 second longer, when we're out in public.  I don't care.  We're married, he likes ME, and I have no reason, whatsoever, to believe he'll step out. It never made me feel insecure, because we had a great intimate life that has only slowed down because of age, and he clearly enjoyed my body.  I don't need affirmations.  I am who I am, I look like I do, I'm not getting plastic surgery to fix anything, and our long lives together have meant some battle scars.  I would add that he, too, has aged.  

I know him.  He can't lie to me - I know his tell.  He doesn't bother trying.  But that's not to say that we say EVERYTHING our loud because we also have feelings that we'd rather not hurt. You can say things kindly, tactfully, and with love. But sometimes, it's just best to keep it zipped, for the sake of feelings.
You shouldn't hide things from your SO, but you're not inclined to share things like "hey I saw a totally attractive person on the train today and I imagined my life with that person for a split second".

If you start hiding inconsequential things from your friends/partner then you should get out.
As a woman, I'd second the statement above. We are literally allowing a foreign object that we cannot control to enter our body and hope that the person that is doing it has the best intentions with us. It's a very vulnerable and submissive (by nature) position to be in
Reddit is our grave

Dang I didn't even notice the "if" but you're so right. I definitely do this all the time.
It creates resentment in a relationship, one of the four horsemen… not a good sign.
I didn’t know there was a name for that feeling but it’s perfect description! I have felt it and it’s deep pain 😞
Emotional damage.
I got grouped up with a bunch of goobers haha. I get compared to many things, but I’ve never had anybody tell me I was “goofy-looking.”
probably because men haven't historically been valued for only their looks
Dude he's loling himself, it's a bit different to be able to laugh at yourself in this situation than it would be to laugh at someone else in the same position
I totally agree, but I think hearing your partner say that out loud when they’re deep into a relationship with you is just hard to reconcile, you know? He wasn’t intentionally malicious, but OP definitely messed up
Same story over here. I’m just my partners type but she is the opposite of most people I dated. She even jokes about it to others. But she is so much better than anyone I’ve ever known and perfect for me.
My “type” has changed over the years with however my husband changes.
[deleted]

So very well stated!
Thank you for this comment, it’s a very valuable lesson that I wish more people understood. I didn’t really either for a long time. Life experience is the greatest teacher. My whole life 100% of my crushes have been blonde guys with bright eyes to the point that it was a running joke for awhile, and 100% of the men who have taken my heart to have been brunette with dark eyes. 

I think sometimes our “type” is more reflective of features that draw attention than actually are attractive to us. Actually attractive is a whole different thing that most people won’t understand until they’ve had their heart broke a few times by following what draws their attention instead of what draws their heart.

Brunettes aren’t my type either, the fact that all the winners have been brunette is a coincidence of what I found when looking for what my type actually is, and it’s far deeper and longer lasting than anything looks-wise. Your type is the most beautiful anyone has ever been, whatever they look like.
I’d be really sad if i was the frozen pizza in this analogy.
This should be top comment. Often the things you aren't looking for are the best things in life.
Wow! What a great way to describe it!
As someone going through this in their own relationship, I needed this. Thanks for this analogy.
They're a duo on Mike Will's label called Ear Drummers (read it backwards and be enlightened).

The group consists or Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi
Idk, flat chested sounds crueler.  Someone with small breasts aren’t literally flat chested, like a child.
I agree I seriously couldn’t argue with it so I immediately accepted it
And for those that fit this description: 

> curvy blondes with long hair, big chests and blue eyes

Not all hope is lost. I'm your guy.
I don’t get it can you explain?
My parents are both short, dark, Sicilians (as am I), who come from a very long line of short, dark, Sicilians. If they suddenly birthed a tall, blonde, daughter, that would have been weird for them. I'm assuming the husband meant something similar.
lol
That sort of thing is so damaging. Ugh. I had a close friend who is bisexual and it was the first girl she was ever with who straight up refused to reciprocate oral and told my poor friend she was “gross” down there and my friend never got over it. She’s way more sexually adventurous and open and bold than I will ever be but that awful comment from an ignorant teenage girl- not something my friend has ever been able to get over. And I still feel so angry on her behalf that it was another woman who said to her. Yuck. 

(For what it’s worth I’m a lesbian and I happen to think vulvas are pretty damn magical. Lol. And few things would bum me out more than a partner who could not relax and enjoy receiving oral sex.)
Yes this, I have a hidden one and for years I was ambivalent about oral and clit play because it never did anything for me. A guy even commented on it. Until I found people who were very good at oral despite my small size! So maybe my other partners just sucked (poorly)
I have never noticed clit size.
Um, honestly, who can fit 11 inches? That’s as long as my forearm. Maybe anally. But I’m more inclined to believe those men lied to her and she just took their word for it.
Muscular legged woman checking in here, and I know your pain. My calves absolutely never fit in the knee high boots that were popular in the 2000s. I once went to Macy’s as a teenager and asked a sales associate to help me find a pair that I could zip up- after pulling out a bunch of different pairs which didn’t work, he finally suggested that Naturalizers was the only brand that might accommodate me (not what a 17 year old wants to hear and I had a shame response similar to yours). And the last time I went skiing, I had to get the widest pair of boots they had and even then, my calves were constricted all day. 

It’s a very tough issue to fix, if one is inclined to try. Like you, I eventually lost a bunch of muscle mass without intending it (during the pandemic), and I was finally ok with my thighs and calves. However, the loss of muscle was absolutely not a *healthy* development. 

It’s a real mindfuck when you find that your legs/other body parts look more *conventionally* attractive *because* you’re ill, starving or have lost muscle due to becoming super sedentary. Beauty is generally said to indicate health, but it indicates quite the opposite sometimes. I’m sorry about your illness.
i know right!

honestly if someone ever paid this much attention to me i would cry and run away lol

^(My goodness. As a woman, just reading this is making me melt and want to cry from happiness, ask for his babies, and then fall into a swoon from the imaginary man who would do this with me. In that order.)
Well I guess his type really isn't curvy big boobed blondes with blue eyes. Lol
Ooof OP kind of dense...  😆
I understood what he meant but here's some free advice for OP: many GFs may not appreciate being told they have "masculine" features...
I don’t know how you found that GIF but it is PHENOMENAL
That like when your girlfriend says " i love your really tiny penis" lol
Say toned instead of muscular. If she is toned w/small breasts, tall, she has a pixie-cut or bob and is androgynously pretty…I feel like she might be a sexy, toned, long-legged wood-nymph. If this is true, feel free to swap some words here and there for ones with better connotations.
100%, but I feel OP may already have
YES
Thissssss. It’s just slap after slap.
100%. He just keeps digging.
No she freaking won't! My COWORKER once told me i had "boxy strong shoulders" i'm a 5'1F and have just felt "boxy" ever since she said this to me😐 like who actually thinks that sounds nice
Right

Like bro

Stop. Fixing. Things.

*you're hurting her*
Or attractively, impishly androgynous.

Edit; I actually typed this before I  registered that he basically already wrote that.
[deleted]
>maybe don't mention the teenage boy part

SURELY don't mention the teenage boy part.
This is such a generous response to OP (especially given so much unkindness in some of the other comments). Thanks for writing it--if they take your advice, I really think that will make for two significantly happier people!
>It sounds like you were describing the most common type of woman you tended to date before you met her, while she was in a headspace of "What women do you find attractive".

THIS. This is exactly it. Great reply.

And OP, you sound like a good dude. I hope you're able to articulate all of this to her and that you'll move forward together even stronger than before.
Even though it's not possible since this is a reply, \*this\* should be the top comment.  
I also really hope that OP reads this, since it's one of the most helpful and empathetic comments I've seen on this site. I had to double check that the subreddit wasn't r/relationship_advice  😂
OP sounds like he’s on the spectrum.
"Babe it's okay. I love that you don't look like a blonde bombshell and look like a man instead!"
I’m picturing Michael Scott at the moment
Yes of course and I love that for her.
Damn, screenwriter was cribbing from Roald Dahl
[deleted]
Yeah, this was a snap shot in the kaleidoscope that is his porn habits.
Also, porn is about extreme wish fulfillment, of something one doesn't already have. It's not surprising people masturbate to porn of something they *don't* have in their life. Like, why masturbate to your partner's characteristics in someone else when you could just have sex with your partner?
Fr I've wanked to people I'd never think about getting with just because the scene had good chemistry even tho they were Hella unattractive
Some people seem to think you only can be attracted to one type and if your not you secretly arnt into them it's crazy tbh
Horngry
I actually don't understand the people here saying they look for people that remind them of their partner. I wouldn't want to imagine my partner ontop of a porno.  


Thats not a association that sits well with me lol.
> Sometimes we crave burgers. Sometimes we crave sushi. The wonderful thing about porn is it's all available, all the time. Whatever you're craving at the moment is what you watch.

Yeah, if youre a guy wanting to watch a specific type of a woman. If youre a woman and want to watch a man there is no such thing as whatever youre craving at the moment you can watch. No categories for how men look like or camera angles on them.
[deleted]
She's 29 per one of OPs comments
OP says in another comment his girlfriend is 29
Right? All of my past partners have been skinny, small chested, and blonde or brunette. My current partner is a little thiccer than average, LARGE chested, and has a different hair color every few weeks, but goddamn if she isn't an absolute goddess in my eyes, fuck. This is why I don't really believe in types. If I had a type, I'd say it's anyone who I can love and can love me back the same 🤷
Yeah nothing wrong with being honest. 
“I always thought my type was X, until I met you. Now YOU’RE my type, and I think you’re so much hotter/more beautiful/whatever than anyone else.” 

Then add some stuff about how, “I didn’t even notice that woman you pointed out… you look great now but I really miss going to the gym w you and how buff we got together… etc”
Yule I think both can be flattering  if handled well. Being told you looked so hot that you're the first time theyve fallen for a short redheaded guy (or whatever) because you dudbt realise anyone could BE that sexy, can be flattering. 

 Likewise you can say you've always loved androgynous brunettes, and you didn't stand a chance meeting her because she'a the sexiest brunette you've ever seen and her eyes literally rendered you speechless. 

And both can make people feel insecure if handled badly. Nobody wants to be just another blonde booby sex doll notch on your bed post, they want to fe like they natter to you as an individual. And nobody wants to find out that you only like people who are a foot taller than them and look much more conventionally attractive.

Ideally I would ignore the concept of types altogether and just focus on the fact that you find HER attractive.  Not your exes. Not a type.
Yeah, if you and/or your partner aren't emotionally mature or stable enough for it not to be a problem, then there is literally no good outcome out of the question other than "you, duh".

For one thing, just because something is your type doesn't mean that's the only thing you like or is even the thing you like the most. Like, if I said my go-to food is sushi, don't be insulted because you made me steak.
Okay! I got it. My point is we continue growing throughout the years. Tastebuds literally change over the years. You develop your palette. 

In the end, food nourishes and sustains us, just like relationships do. If looked at in this perspective, I bet more adults wouldn't correlate filet mignon, mac & cheese, or tofu sandwich with themselves. We all have to eat.

Just like many folks can learn to love tofu, or filet mignon, or mac & cheese. OP can work on explaining how feelings and being attracted to his partner is DEF a thing.

PS, smort and good call on not calling your partner a tofu sandwich... especially without context. Best scenario is sleeping on the couch... worst case scenario is probably being on a sanctioned 72 hour hold in a padded cell.
Dropping in late just to say I admire your mental hygiene and discipline. The very thought of slighting someone who doesn't exist sends you into a self imposed correction mode for conditioning.
It's funny you mention this because a friend on mine legit bought ez mac the other day.. hadn't had it in 15+ years... then he proceeded to say how nasty it was lol. I asked if checked the expiration because it was at his desk in the office... Maybe it was stale?

And he said it was fine date wise, then "how the hell did I eat 3-4 of those daily when I got home from school?"
"You were a teenager. We were all in that phase of being a garbage disposal at some point during  puberty"
I mean you can also answer “my type is (insert things they fit)” but yeah same basic concept. Don’t even have to lie, my girlfriend is similar to some past crushes/dates/interests and in other ways very different. I just say my type is the similarities.
As a 6’3” guy dating a 5’2” girl, the neck pain is real. Either she’s craning her head and I’m bending down or I sit down and we’ve simply traded positions lmao
that’s not pathetic
I mean, my husband is exactly my type. And I am exactly his...   we never had any trouble attracting who we wanted before we met.  So I'm kinda inclined to agree.

Plus, it definitely feels good to know we are each others physical type, and we really like each other too. So idk. Yea, I'd be sad to hear I'm not his "type" physically.   And I am super glad I don't have to deal with that. I wouldn't deal well. Lol
Agreed. My SO and I have different types from each other, but who cares? A "type" is just the ideal physical look and not *nearly* the only thing you like about a person.
What a sad place to rest for eternity
lol now I want a sign for my bathroom door that says..

“RIP

Reddit In Peace”
Comrade
Obviously OP just needs to clarify that his girlfriend perfectly matches his ideal *male* type. Easy mixup to make. She'll be so relieved!
And apparently that’s the *only* thing he likes about his girlfriend!  /s
I just died laughing at this comment 😂😂
The other three?
Yeah. That's exactly what it is. When your SO describes the opposite of you as what they desire...how do you even come back from that? That shit hurts. I never recovered from mine and I'm bout ready to just cut the rest of this necrotic crap off. Words mean things, even if they weren't supposed to.
Not just historically. My sons are constantly praised for their manners, their intelligence, etc. The first compliment everyone gives my daughter is about her looks. Yes, she's stinking adorable - we've had multiple offers for modeling contracts - but she's just as smart, polite, and kind as her brothers, too. And they’re cute, too. One of my boys is blonde, with huge brown eyes, dimples, and a killer smile. The other looks like Peter Pan. So it's not like her looks stand out compared to theirs. 
And it’s not a local problem, either. We recently took a 3 week long, 6,000 mile road trip across the nation. Same thing, all over the country. 
Girls are still constantly being told their value is in their looks.
I'm a redhead. I'm quite aware that my wife was fairly anti-redheads before me. I'm not bothered by it. It feels good to know I'm good enough to have changed her mind.
What you're saying sounds a lot like what my wife used to say about herself. She's been in behavioral health therapy for a few years now and ultimately, I think just become more secure with herself and who she is. She knows her flaws, physical and not, but has really started rocking her strengths. And that attitude has been more attractive than anything else.

Look at employment and it's the same - you get paid for your strengths (talents). 

Just some food for thought for ya. I hope you're able to continue to grow to love yourself more and be the best version of you that you can be.
My type has changed several times in my life, right after meeting someone who spins me right round.
No one is the frozen pizza in this analogy. The frozen pizza is the person's "type," it's the thing they thought they wanted which is clearly not as good as what they ended up finding. OP's gf is the amazing meal they didn't know was possible.
no no no, you're like the good kind of frozen pizza. The one that costs $15 not $11
Well sure, when you miss the analogy. The person was saying the “type” is pizza, but the current partner is the type of food you didn’t expect to really love that makes you not think about pizza.
You're actually the box he ate the frozen pizza off, that was then too dirty to recycle.
I agree. I’m a busty lesbian who tends to prefer women on the smaller side (at least up top. I’m a hips and ass kinda gal lol). I literally don’t think I’ve ever described another woman as “flat”. Yikes. I have legitimately told partners I loved that they were smaller than me. And a whole lot of women are smaller busted than me so eh? I hope I never offended anyone. 

But I’m also not a dude or dating hetero women and will ramble off (adorably, I’m told) about the magic of “same/similar but different” and how flipping much I love being a woman who loves women. So I don’t think there’s any mistaking such a comparison is a favorable one coming from me specifically.
I would agree. Flat chested makes me think of a 10 year old child. Small breasted is just that, she has breasts they’re just small.
I have a friend who is literally flat chested. No elevation there at all. Small chests are a range, which includes flat.

But to your point, I would normally use the descriptor small.
I have a group of female friends who are all quite attractive but are smaller in that regard. They refer to themselves as the "Itty-bitty Titty Committee"
Aw. That's so wholesome, you got yourself a man of wisdom
He’s a good egg
Her parents would be confused when their kid looks nothing like them lol
Yeah it's unfortunate one person can do so much damage that can take years of trust and reassurance to undo. Especially over something so subjective.

I feel like taste/smell is the female equivalent of size for men. Preference is subjective, you have no control over it (mostly), and the truth is the vast majority of people are perfect the way they are.
You can’t not notice the large ones. Trust me
Most people have no clue.

https://v.redd.it/0plhr91t8qpa1
I seriously envy u/RoundComplete9333's girlfriend/wife lol, I have a feeling she is one happy, happy lady.

As another said, this level of emotional awareness and intelligence is only something many women can only dream of.


Men, not just OP, take notes. 


This is shoujo manga panel, scream-into-your-pillow, giggling worthy, my word..
Her type is clearly Himbo!
"You know, you're a real handsome broad. I mean that as a compliment."
Having a flashback to the time my dad called me "stocky" driving me home from work and I immediately burst into tears. Poor guy didn't know how to handle it, so he just started crying too.
My wife is a “big girl” because she’s 5’10”…
Try calling them "handsome" instead of pretty, works 10/10 /s
Yeah that's a quick way to be single or not get laid at the very least
Also applies to BFs not liking being called ‘beautiful’ or have ‘feminine features’. Just say you love the way they look. That’s it

I'd be alright with this, least she wouldn't lie to me and make it out to be bigger than it is in a vain attempt to upsell what we're working with. Honesty works on people that aren't emotional trainwrecks riddled with self doubt.

Fun sized would also be an acceptable response.

Problem is, so many people are insecure these days one little comment sends them into a downward spiral and scorches the earth of an entire relationship because the other one had a single moment of not fully thinking about what was asked or said. Half the time it's a setup by the other party and they still get upset when you steer them into saying something you'll take personally.

Keep in mind, the Honesty thing only works if both parties are secure and have good humor. If you're in an incredibly emotional Rollercoaster of a relationship. Build the foundation of your love on lies and hope for the best.
As someone on the spectrum, if OP isn't, I can file a motion to make him an honorary spectrumie in his behalf.

I know lots of people on the spectrum and idk if this is the result of autism or just an empty head
Damn guys of course he doesn’t! Like you can’t say something wrong or put your foot in your mouth or accidentally hurt someone’s feelings unless you’re on the spectrum? If that’s the case then we’re all on that spectrum
I also think we just become less shallow over time. I don’t want anyone to misconstrue this as me saying we “settle” as we become older - quite the opposite. We mature and we learn what to truly appreciate in a partner. 

I also just want to jump my partners bones all the time, and moreso the better I’ve gotten to know him over almost 2 years. Thinking about him and looking at him brings me a ton of very precious both intimate and non-intimate memories. 

I hope she will be your fiancee soon!

Edit: I’m down with corona and think snot has replaced my brain, so I’m pretty bad at expressing myself at the moment. But I think you get it
When you fall in love, this crazy thing happens where the object of your love becomes the most beautiful wo/man in the world to you, their flaws sort of fade into the background, their face becomes perfect in a way that only a model’s would have been before, and other people can’t compare. They start to outshine everyone because of your feelings towards them. 

When that happens, your “type” often morphs into whatever they are, even if that wasn’t what you’d gravitated towards before. So then you end up finding elements of them in other people. Like, “Last time, I fell in love with someone with X traits, so maybe i could fall in love with this other person with X traits.” This worked last time so maybe it’ll work next time. Yhere’s an element of familiarity to it.  

But sometimes you fall in love with someone totally different next time, and your “type” morphs again.
That is some fantastic wordplay right there.
Straight males are undoubtedly the target audience of most porn, because they are far and away the largest consumer demographic for said porn. But there are definitely options for what type of guys you're looking for. (If you have a specific request let me know and I'll help you out.)

I agree. Preferences exist, but they can change. Looking back, the women I've dated or been intimate with had a wide range of figure types, hair colours, and facial features. The things they had in common usually were personality traits, interests, that kind of thing. 

I've also noticed that my preferences have changed according to my partner at the time - when my GF ten years ago was a slender redhead with a smaller chest, I found that attractive in other women as well. My partner today has typical Danish blonde hair, blue eyes, and is very generously endowed and that's what I like. Preferences aren't set in stone. There are still things I find attractive in general, but that's nowhere near a decisive factor.
It isn't really about emotional maturity, though. Certainly an overwhelming percentage of people with very healthy amounts of emotional maturity would be hurt to have their partner discuss what they are attracted to and explicitly avoid anything that remotely describes themselves.

We all want our partners to be attracted to us. Of course we do. In our society, we are all bombarded with visual aesthetics that are extremely hard to achieve. Asking explicitly for validation (which is exactly what this kind of question is) and not receiving it will be unpleasant for anyone to hear, though I do think that emotionally mature people will be able to process it better and heal from it faster.

Just because you can logically create a argumentative construct that doesn't mean that you were failing to provide validation doesn't mean that your partner should be fine so long as they are emotionally mature.
So true lol I’m dating someone who’s 6’2 now and it’s interesting learning how to adjust. 
A tip I will give you is to discuss any disagreements while both parties are seated— my boyfriend brought up he makes that effort to do this to avoid absolutely dominating the physical space during the disagreement.  
He’s a good one. 

& your username checks out lol
Same here lol. Me and my man both grew up wanting to date someone like each other. I feel bad for anyone that isn’t their partners type.
Who said anything about rest?
Don't lie, y'all be browsing Reddit in heaven instead of spending time with Jesus.
Criticism, contempt (resentment), defensiveness, and stonewalling! John Gottman’s theory.
This, and it really sucks.
This was probably the greatest way to suggest external help for internal tribulations I have read on this site. Well done.
This. It's amazing what conventionally "unattractive" things have become the cutest things to me once I start dating people with those traits.
Who is buying $11 frozen pizzas let alone $15?
Absolutely agree with that video!! ♥️ After 6in it just hurts really bad.
Told a girl she has broad shoulders and should join our football team back in high school. She cried and I was very confused.
[deleted]
I've gotten that one.
Always did like a girl with sturdy feet.
I was lamenting my size at 16, wishing I was petite and delicate (I wasn’t fat at all, just not delicate). My aunt in trying to make me feel better said I was wholesome. Yeah, just what every 16-year-old girl wants to hear. It’s a running joke between hubby and I for 33 years now. Wholesome….that’s me.
This is so funny
Lord, I’ve never forgotten the time my freaking doctor described me with that word as a teenager. It may have been the same bizarre appointment she should’ve technically told me I freaking had PCOS because I had all the symptoms (and I absolutely do have PCOS though it’d be a lot more misery and several more years before I’d learn that) and even the elevated testosterone level and she merely told me that part with an “But it’s cool, you’re stronger than other girls!”

Female doc, no less. I was freaking 14 and insecure af and just had my first freaking pelvic exam and Pap smear due to those menstrual issues I mentioned. God it was bad. I did really like the doc which helped a little? But damn if I didn’t hear “stocky, high testosterone, muscular- you’re basically a failure at femininity” in my head hard through the rest of my teen years.
LMFAOOO

>Poor guy didn't know how to handle it, so he just started crying too.
I'm 6'. Everybody used to call me "big" and at the age of 5, I had already figured out that that wasn't what girls were "supposed" to be. Cue a decade and a half of eating disorders. It's f*d up what we do to people who outlie the expected norms.
The phrase I use for this in my head is "a girl and a half in every direction!", especially when the woman in question is tall AND thick AND well-endowed. I picked it up from a novel where it's meant as a compliment, but I never use it out loud because I doubt anyone would ever interpret it as a compliment.
oh shit, I'm HUGE! (6 ft. woman here)
No one has fun with Chris Hansen. 😄
I got "It's so cute!"
"People might mistake you for a girl, but it's exactly what I love about you!"
Omg lmao!
Where do you write in for that sort of thing? I don’t think I am being fairly represented enough by the UAW spectrhomies.
If he’s not on the spectrum, they need to make it a little longer.
lol true!
I love your username
Comedy gold
If i want to rest, i *will* rest. You cannot stop me.
Bold of you to assume any of us (especially me) are going to heaven
Contempt is not the same as resentment. Contempt is when you utterly disrespect someone, find them disgusting, hateable, irredeemable, valueless. Resentment is when you harbor a grievance over time and it festers and undermines connection.
like my boyfriends gap teeth…
You're a monster 🤣.
We called a girl linebacker in middle school for the same reason. She never cried but shed punch us and tell us to shutup lol
I'd think about this every single day for the rest of my life if someone said this to me lmaooo
But babe! Think of the absolute units we could create! Our kid would be the first Sumo World Champion from Duluth, Minnesota. Just one of our kids is going to need a whole ass canoe to traverse a lake simply due to mass alone. Babe. Babe we could create physical monoliths. You get two of them on a football team together and you've got an impenetrable wall. Honey with your thighs and my torso our kids could be like prize bulls. Just massive. Imagine your ass on a dude. You'd need seventeen forklifts to get him to flinch. And your *forearms.* Babe if you were a dude and worked out you'd have Arnold Schwarzenegger arms. You've got this sexy Popeye linebacker thing going on and I dig it. When God made you it's like he thought "What if John Goodman was a woman?"
Not my current boyfriend referring to our friends as me being “built like a howitzer”
How wholesome of her to say that. /j
I used to always be told I had "swimmer's shoulders" aka broad shoulders for a woman. It made me self concious for years. On behalf of someone who dealt with similar comments from family members, I absolutely feel your pain <3
i was an early bloomer and i’ve been tall my whole life. i got upset once when my mom wouldn’t let me wear a cute little justice bikini when i was 11-ish (and already about 5’7 and a d-cup) because it “wasn’t right” on me and i was “too developed” to be wearing cutesy clothes designed for other girls my age. when this (understandably) made me feel ugly and weird, she tried comfort me by saying i was “beautiful and womanly and statuesque.” *statuesque* bro… exactly what a tween wants to hear lol
This shit is always weird to me. I’m 6’3” and I don’t think I ever thought for a second about how tall a girl was outside of, “she looks strong, that’s kind of hot” on rare occasions until my now wife brought up how she was tall for a woman and all her thoughts on it, in my mid twenties.

Just literally zero thoughts about it beyond noticing one person is taller or shorter than the person next to them in the most neutral way possible. 

Hearing what my wife experienced like you was a weird roller coaster, mostly because I pushed back a little the first few times she called herself tall. Didn’t really get it outside of understanding statistics.
Fellow 6 ft woman here high five!! I'm Asian and am regarded as an absolute giant here!!
I do. I calls him Chris handsome
Oof
You’re not wrong but resentment can turn in to contempt if issues aren’t addressed and dealt with.
For the purpose of Gottman’s works, resentment is what directly leads to contempt, but I believe it’s mentioned that it can lead to criticism as well. OP’s girlfriend bringing up a girl that is OP’s type is almost an exact example used in the focus on contempt. Instilling “fondness and admiration” would be the next step to try to fix this, but it’s difficult to repair a relationship after contempt.
Is this a joke or genuinely? Just curious
She cried at home
She took it like a guy then?
I’m laughing so hard I’m crying!
Ok I was laughing until the last line. Ouch. 😂
I like ya and I want ya, now we can do this the easy way or the hard way, the choice is yours
I'm not looking for no little boys, I'm looking for a man's butt.
Also once "that feels so good I wish it was your forearm".  I caught a lot of strays with her
For the sake of this psychological concept as well, they're mostly considered the same thing. They almost always lead directly into the other, and are pretty much the proof that a marriage is on the way out/nearly beyond repair.
genuinely
he has a gap in his teeth and i find it so hot + cute 🥵
I mean i guess so
Nooooo! I even read that in the voice!
One of my gfs canine teeth is bent a bit outwards and looks like a little fang. Everytime she smiles her lip first is stuck but then "plops" off. She's insecure about it but I think it's adorable af. For an outsider it probably sounds weird but Idk, I love it.
TIFU by telling my roommate to drop his Japanese fetish.
My roommate only likes Japanese girls. He has never met a Japanese person in his life, everything he knows he's learned from anime. He has shown me his dating profiles on mixerdates which I thought was straight up delusional. But since I didn’t wanna have an uncomfortable conversation with him and was certain he wouldn’t hit, I didn’t bring it up.

But recently he actually brought a girl over who looked decent and really cute. An actual real-life Japanese girl. She swings by for his date and I’m trying so hard to contain myself and want to high-five him so bad. Anyhow he goes out with her and turns out she got really weirded out by him cos he kept bringing up these anime references thinking she would get it and reciprocate. I don’t know what to say, except I knew it would happen. 

He’s a really nice guy, just that he needs to drop the Japanese girl anime pedestal thing and be more normal. So i sit him down, and start telling him how it’s super weird to real females and how they aren’t like that and how if he gets out of this mentality, it would definitely improve his chances.. He starts crying and doesnt want to talk to me anymore, he is also moving out next week. I lost a friend and someone to help pay the rent.

TL;DR: Don't try and get someone out of their fantasy place, regardless of what good you think you are doing for them.
"He has never met a Japanese person in his life, everything he knows he's learned from anime." That is all I needed to hear
The girl cracked his whole identity's skull and then you came in with a steel chair outta nowhere.

Tho that might just what he needed.
Bruh I love anime, but if this guy isn’t letting a friend help him out and overreacting after his freakish date, let him run. Can’t save someone who doesn’t want help.

Just let him know you’ll be waiting
> he is also moving out next week. I lost a friend and someone to help pay the rent.

Is he on the lease?  If so he can't just leave.
Play the long game. Go to art school, take drawing classes, specific anime. Then create a popular anime that is a thinly veiled story of your roommate. Then let him read it. that is the only way he will understand
Totally get it.

I am Australian.  If I went back to a Japanese woman's place and she had an AU flag above her bed, Fosters beer in the fridge, stuffed kangaroos, and portraits of Steve Irwin around her house, I'd be nope right away.
anime women are very different from japanese women. They are figments of the mangaka's imagination. No japanese woman is going to act like the ones in anime.
Nah you didn’t fuck up. What he was doing was weird and generalizing all Japanese women to a stereotype. He needed to hear that. I wouldn’t apologize but I would try to explain I’m coming from a good place and that it’s not worth ditching the friendship and living situation over. Give it a bit of time.
As an Asian woman who has lived in Japan I can confidently say your friend is one of my worst nightmares
Guys like that make Japan's immigration policies understandable.
This wasn’t a fuck up; you did right by him and your conscious
There are so many foreign guys like that in Japan, it’s honestly so pathetic and honestly just racist. Creeps like him who fetishize an entire ethnicity are not welcome.
Just tell him Japanese women are just women. They aren’t special anime characters, they don’t act like that in real life. They are just people, and they don’t like weirdos either.  Otaku isn’t a term of endearment, it’s not a badge to be worn with pride.
Not very kawaii of him
The way you said “real females” 💀
Also, call them women, not females
Maybe he needs to focus more so on trying to find someone with common interests like anime than their nationality and comparing them to the characters. Anime is awesome and there's lots of good communities built around it. Maybe that would be good for him and he could meet a woman more organically through that.
My god, just call them women.
>*it’s super weird to real females*

Women, bud. They're women.
Asian woman here. We can smell the fetish on you, we can feel the ick when you look at us. We give these guys a wide berth, we’re not human people with feelings to these guys.
Nah, not a fuck up for you man, honestly bullet dodged for the girl in this situation too. I've been living in Japan the last 10yr and many/most Japanese girls and women would find him very creepy. My coworkers (from various jobs) have lamented to me over the years at how creepy non-Japanese otaku men can be. To the point some of them assumed American men are all creepy otaku/Japanese fetishizers.
> Don't try and get someone out of their fantasy place

Always try and get someone out of their fantasy place if it affects their ability to operate as an adult in the real world.
No. You told someone the truth and they didn't like it. Honestly, I'm over the anime obsessed weebs. They live in a very delusional world and expect women to be just like their Japanese anime. It's kinda sick and extremely ridiculous.
Doesn't sound like you came from a place of malice. He's probably embarrassed bc he realizes you've probably thought that way for a while. And he's misplacing his hurt emotions from the girl onto you. Just let him know the door to your friendship is still open if he chooses.
Fetishizing people from another county or ethnicity is really gross and racist. You did good
Calling women "females" is also super weird if you aren't a Ferengi
You lost a delusional loser.
he needed to hear that, seriously, as an Asian person thank you
“Females”
I live in Japan. Japanese girls like some anime but 90%+ are not otaku/weeaboo level at all, and find such dudes here cringe as hell. Japanese girls are more likely to like Disney or Ghibli than whatever anime Japanese otaku dudes (much less American dudes) are into.

And the fictionalized version of Japanese women in male oriented comics is usually playing to fetishes of either cutesy ditz sexy girls or powerful superheroines than anything reflective of real life.

Real life is boring, and anime/manga is generally escapism, not reality. Most Japanese girls are just normal people, not anime characters. They like fashion, cafes, cute animals, drinking at bars and variety television. I know hundreds of Japanese girls and very few are hardcore into anime and manga.
Should have told him, even in Japan, Japanese women don't want to fuck anime nerds.
Dude. You did the right thing.
Is it not borderline racist to think all Japanese girls know all your anime references?
AI
I live in Japan. You've just described a weeb. These losers come to Japan and act just like your roommate, except they go further and think the whole of Japan will be totally GRATEFUL and AMAZED that they have a J-fetish and will welcome them as one of them.

Cue reality. Suddenly they're calling the Japanese racist (!) for not indulging them in their racist fetish. The number of depressed foreigners here is through the roof.

Scenario 2 is they meet some batshit crazy J-chick that has the same type of fetish for westerners and you get stories so crazy they'd make Amber Turd seem normal.
You didn't FU. He did. As a fan of anime since '90s, I thought it's obvious that Japanese people don't talk like in anime. Also recently I learned even more. Most Japanese people don't even like anime at all. And I know this from an actual Japanese person, who is also a linguist. So that friend is just a weeb. Cringe weeb. Also if he can't take criticism and moves out after throwing a tantrum, then he wasn't a good friend in the first place. Real friend would not do something like that. And that reaction is of someone who knows what you told is true, but he doesn't want to admit it. Normal person would not react that way.
Let me tell you about a bizarre dating experience I had once.  There was this girl I knew in college like 20 years ago.  She was OBSESSED with Anime and Manga.  You might not realize it but back then it was borderline socially weird, but I was okay with it as I was just starting to really get into some of that stuff as well.  I was also one of the very few Asian men on my campus and she really didn’t interact with a lot of Asian dudes apparently.  She had a Japanese boyfriend for a short bit she told me but it wasn’t anything that was too unusual.  Long story short, I was deeply fetishized in her eyes and it was WEIRD.  Like WEIRD for me.  As an Asian male in the 80’s and 90’s, being Asian felt like more of a liability to me than anything so it was a full turnabout from what I had experienced and it was strange.  I’ll admit, I enjoyed it at first but it got REAL old REAL Fast and her issues quickly become apparently and I noped out of that relationship.
Bro needed to hear it. Can’t keep living in fantasy land
This relates a bit, but I just want to offer a different perspective. I was adopted and my parents didn’t educate me before I entered the dating scene about Japanese girl fetishes. I had nooo idea that would be something I’d encounter.

When guys started looking at my body for the features that I hadn’t really related to my entire life it was the most bizarre thing and almost like viewing those relationships from outside a window. 

The guy sitting across the table who does this to you. It’s degrading, humiliating, and really just gross. Even friends who bring you around a convention to purchase bunny girl figures, hentai, or get anime girl tattoos are tbh, gross for it. 

You didn’t fuck up, OP. That person sucked, and the way he reduced women to a stereotype sucked. We’re not anime call girls.
This isn’t your fuck up- guy has to learn and you tried to help. 

Either he realizes you were right after he calms down, or he retreats further into his delusion in case there isn’t really anything you can do.
I once had to explain to a friend of mine that his deep desire to move to Japan would NOT end with the women falling at his feet for being a white American and getting a government issued wifu. That was a long day
Your only fuck-up was referring to women as “females”.

Hopefully he’ll reflect on what you said and recalibrate. You did him a solid.

But seriously, *women*, not *females*.
"Females" 🤓👆
I don't think this is a TIFU tbh, he's the weirdo.
You fucked up by not telling him sooner. What he was doing was wrong. He can go cry about it some more.
out of all reactions CRYING wasnt the expected one. you cant help him, let him go! on the bright side your new roommate might be more mature and less weird?
You did the right thing. Nothing wrong with having a type, but it’s weird to fetishize a whole race. He’s hurt and reacting like that because he knows you’re right. Sounds like he just needs to go to an anime con.
I thank God every day my weeb phase ran its course before I was interested in dating. I have enough going against me in that regard.
 Bruh you didn't fk up, he just realized that he's weird and didn't want to deal with it, thus rejecting you. You did a good thing. Hopefully sometime from now when he realizes this for himself he'll reach back out and thank you for caring about him enough to try

Think of all the Japanese women he is going to creep out later.... The worst thing is that he isn't seeing these women as people. He's unfortunately a "nice" guy. Maybe he can learn to grow out of it, I hope
Not a FU, you did the right thing by him and by every person he interacts with.  He needs to dial it back.
No fuck that. You did him and every woman he tries to interact with a huge favor. Fuck that weeb. Yeah it sucks you lost a roommate but you could find another one. Someone had to tell him the truth do not feel bad about that.
Jeez you did guy a favor imo. Stop fetishizing Japanese women. That is so offensive and gross. Like a gal because she's fun and smart and has a great personality, not because of her race. Creepy af, that.
FWIW, we don't like being called "females" either.
 It's reductive and dehumanizing
Fuck this japanese fetish how are you going to pay rent
You didn’t f-up, it is an odd fetish, if it is one sided. Good friends should be able to speak honestly to one another about things like that. Sorry about that
Talk to him in a day when he’s level headed and apologize. He might stay and eventually he’ll hear the truth and be grateful for your heart to heart
I think you did the right thing. A real friend wouldn’t let their friend carry on being weird.
"real females" yuck
Lol, what a weeb. You gave him a reality check and he didn't like it. Not your fault he is delusional.
Let him find out the hard way, dudes stereotyping Japanese women. I'm a weeb myself but I have a functioning brain and can separate fiction from reality and have dated asian women without inserting weeb shit into a date. Too many times have I seen dudes who only watch anime and think that's all Japanese/Asian girls are. Never understood that thinking either, it's obviously a piece of fiction and a stereotype. Makes me cringe when stuff like this happens.
A real friend says the truth to his brother. You discharged your duty. If he can grow from the experience he will thank you. Or he will double down and get weird and then he is no friend to you. A good friend of mine helped me stop smoking.  I was pissed that he went into my house and ripped up all my cigs. But at the end I had to laugh and hug him because he cared so much and made such a crazy mess.
you talked to him like an adult , he reacted like a child. nothing you can do about it
Weebs gonna weeb
You told the truth. You did the right thing.

The tears of a weeaboo are a small price to pay for a clear conscience and knowing that you are, despite his reaction, a good friend. An honest friend, who cares for people's futures.
Some people you can't really help. I knew a guy like this in high school, he would try to speak what little Japanese he learned from anime to any Japanese looking women he saw and they would just look at him in bewilderment. Problem was that most of the foreign students we had there were Chinese, not Japanese. Weeb's gonna weeb though.

The fact that buddy doubled down shows he doesn't want to change. Not much you can do. He can't find a real relationship like that, real ones are commitments full of compromises. He'll have to either learn that eventually or he will just struggle with it forever.
my skin crawled reading this. i’m only half japanese and yet fetishizers ONLY recognize that part of me..  it’s soooo off putting and weird. especially when they assume i’m a huge anime fan.
This doesn’t mean don’t help people… but helping people isn’t as simple as telling them what to do & they’re fixed. Most people aren’t ready to hear the identity of their personality is creepy & delusional.

Assuming they want help, you have to be interested in them and ask them questions… “why do you think she felt uncomfortable?”

“How are you feeling after that?”

“The next girl you go on a date with, how are you going to connect with her?”

Even the way you ask the questions will spur different thoughts… 

But text your friend, ask to apologize to him, tell him you care about him, and you don’t want him to leave.

Tell him he didn’t ask for your advice, and what you shared was harsh, but you care about him.

His reaction is a result of his insecurities, he needs friends just as much as you do.

>and be more normal

>So i sit him down, and start telling him how it’s super weird to real females and how they aren’t like that and how if he gets out of this mentality, it would definitely improve his chances..


Hrmm just wondering here is if it possible that you are actually kinda a creep but are better at masking? 

You didnt say he should be a better person and treat all women like people but immediately jumped to improving his chances and referred to women as females, that's kinda messed up imo.

You both might need to hear some things.
I think we’ve all been on both sides of this type of situation before and I’ve learned it’s usually best to not offer unsolicited advice to people. People don’t change until they’re ready to. If they’re at a place where they can accept advice without getting their feelings hurt they will probably ask for it. Otherwise it’s natural for people to get defensive. No one likes being wrong. Deep down he probably knows you’re right, but he is probably embarrassed. 

It sounds like you genuinely care about his well-being so maybe you can figure out a way to let him know it’s safe to do dumb things around you and you guys will still be friends. Idk. Other than that I know it sucks breaking up with a friend but it happens. You gotta let people do what they’re gonna do. Everybody is on their own path in life and learns things in their own way on their own time.
I love anime, manga, and novels but not pushing my likes to anyone and not looking for partners specifically from the same country where anime originated or because they look the same. If I can find a partner who likes the same thing as I do that would be great but if not I'll respect that, we all have our preferences. Look at them for who they are.
He....cried?!
So basically you sat him down and told him a truth that he needed to hear, and he is a fucking whiney crying baby and cant take it.

NTA.    let the guy move out and he can room with his anime waifu body pillow.
Almost nobody likes to be fetishized, because on some level you always understand that the person is in ot for the fetish and not for you.
>I don't know what to say, except I knew it would happen.

Did you now? Because two phrases ago you said "I'm trying so hard to contain myself and want to high-five him so bad." Looks like the opposite of you knowing it would get screwed up eventually by your friend.

>weird to real females

I'm going to help you like you tried helping your friend. Don't say "real females," say "women" or "girls." You're welcome.

>TL;DR: Don't try and get someone out of their fantasy place, regardless of what good you think you are doing for them.

Why not? If they're your friend and you think something they're doing is wrong you try helping them. Also that's a conclusion not a TL;DR.
Most guys who "only like Japanese girls" can't even tell a Chinese, Korean and a Japanese girl apart.
>  He’s a really nice guy, 


Nah man. I think what you meant to say is that he isn't obviously horrible person. More specifically that he doesn't do obviously horrible things to you. Let's pick the bar off the ground. 
The word you’re looking for is “fetishizing” and referring to women as females is also gross.
A long time ago I met a guy who was not American and he asked me out. (I am American-- US.) He picked me up in his fancy car and when we got away from my parents house, he was all over me. I was NOT happy and only got him away when he realised that I was on my period, which grossed him out. (I was in college, 198X)

Knowing that I was safe (I had no clue about people being drugged, although it did happen, but he was fine.) He insisted on still buying me dinner and what he told me was, "I thought American women liked that." He had seen movies of American women being "sexually free." I was like, 'NOOOOO! We still get pregnant! What about STDs?' AIDS was still new and this dude traveled the world with his parents. We didn't stay in touch-- he realised that I was as uptight as the girls back in his country, although we did part civilly.  

I wonder if anime does for Japanese women what regular American movies did for American women 40 years ago. 

Onto your friend, you did him a favour even if he wasn't reciprocating of it. You don't want him as a rent helper, what if he turns your apartment into a crime scene with one of his fantasies? (Am I taking it to an extreme? I don't know. Reality and fantasy sometimes blur with delusional people.) If nothing else, you might feel super weird when he brings his friends over and you are spared that.
You did him a favor. You can tell him but you can’t make him listen
Ask him to tell you anything about her besides “she’s Japanese”. She rightfully got weirded out because he wasn’t interested in her, only in her having the same nationality as his fetish.
If he continues to not understand that women are regular people (and soon) he’ll be a woman-hating hermit with a sex doll by 40
If anybody likes Japanese "culture" too much, then that probably means that they aren't all that smart. When they realise that anime is only an absolutely tiny part of Japanese culture, they will be in for a shock.
You did your self and him a favour. Wierd as shit fetishing cultures.
Fetishizing a race is about as racist as hating it. Asians are people, not a sex toy or something to ogle at.
it sucks but you did the right thing imo
Tough love isn't always appreciated, but it's always needed. But no good deed goes unpunished either.
Somebody had to break it to him, and you wanted to help, not hurt him, it's on him if he'd rather live a lie. Such it is a lot of times in life, you have to break the news to someone if you're honest and wish to help them, even if they hate you for it. I think him moving out ha more to do with feeling ashamed that you know about his shameful date.

I don't think you've done anything wrong dude and maybe he'll come around and see it eventually too.
No you didn't f*** up.  This person needs to hear the hard truth.  It's f****** creepy.  They need to grow up.

There's nothing wrong with having an interest in anime Manga.  

 You're absolutely right he's feticizing  Something that's not real, onto real women.    The guy needs a reality check.  And you wouldn't be helping them  By Lying and enabling the behavior.  

You did this person a kindness.  He needed to be told the truth.
Nah you did good. Dudes a weirdo and a creep. 100% needs a talking too. He cried because he knows it's true and is now facing the reality of change.
I’m excited to get to Japan because of all the Pokémon I wanna catch.
Good riddance, what a weirdo.
You're better off before he kidnaps some Japanese girl and keeps her locked in the closet
you didn't fuck up.  you were trying to help and maybe gave him the best advice he could ever get.  you planted a seed that should bear good fruit later
If your roommate isn't Asian, typically the type of Asian girls who want to date non-Asians aren't the type that enjoy stuff like anime
Your friend is a wierdo.  All those dudes with a creepy school girl anime fetish are cringey as hell.
I’m a big fan of anime and manga but I can never get how people are so disillusioned with reality and think that people in real life would be the same as the people in their fictional stories. Bro actually landed a date also and brought up all these references without even knowing if the girl was a fan of anime ? lol just assumed she was a fan cause she was Japanese 🤦
My wife is Japanese and this was one of the first things I recall her telling me when we first started dating. She came here for school and she got really creeped out by some of the people who were obsessed with Japanese culture and anime.  I hear it from our Japanese friends group as well, creeped out by it and have little respect for those sort of individuals.
Nah delete the TL;DR. Some people absolutely need to brought back to reality
Naw, you did the right thing. And TBH, his views of Japanese women are ironically kinda racist and dehumanizing as he can only see them through his fetish and misguided stereotyping.
NTA it might suck for him to hear, but he needs the reality check. Women, Japanese or other wise, are not a monolith, and don't deserve to be fetishized.

  
Also OP, with all kindness - you're an adult, I'm assuming your roommate and that the people he's interested in seeing are adults (I hope) - say "women", not "females". 

I know it's can be a bit of a hot topic on the internet, but if you wouldn't say "males" in a discussion like this, but always say "females", that can immediately give weird incel vibes. Using dehumanizing language isn't going to help *anyone's* romantic chances. Women are humans too :)
Here's the thing:  this dummy can find any number of girls who will share the same interests as him, including anime.  But frankly it's kind of racist to assume a girl of Japanese heritage/from Japan is into anime.  Just open up the field a bit and he can find someone he can talk about anime to all damn day and they'll be into it.  I go to cons with my son, and there's no shortage of very pretty girls who are way nerdier about that stuff than either of us are.
A real friend will call out a friend on their flaws instead of encouraging them with false platitudes.

Cringe aside, this was probably a shock to his system. Hopefully he reflects and learns from this experience, but right now, he may just need time to process. I love anime so much that it landed me my current job, but that guy has some stuff to work through.

You did the right thing, which isn’t always the easy thing. In fact, it rarely is.
This man fetishizes these women of course they don't want him
Sad thing is, if he stopped looking for Japanese girls and focused on girls who are into anime, he probably would have had a better chance. Anime as a hobby is not the issue. Being delusional is.
If he’s a real friend I’m sure he’ll come back around and realize what you were talking about!
Nothing you said was out of line. If he can't emotionally handle that, it's not your fault. Hopefully this is the start of him learning how to cope a bit better when someone offers genuinely constructive criticism.
You did the right thing OP
The fact you used the phrase “real females” makes me believe this entire story is bs and you have no idea what a woman is.
If he actually internalized what you told him, then it isn’t a FU. You did him a favor. Japanese people aren’t cartoon characters, and he needs to learn that.
Take him out for a beer before he leaves if he's been a good friend.

If you wanna keep being friends say you are sorry and just got frustrated because you wanted him to succeed because he's your friend. Your friend is weird, and probably knows it, but hearing someone else call you weird and confirm it isn't always easy. If your friend is weird, you are probably weird too, weird people are usually better anyway.

Maybe tell him to figure out if they like anime too \*before\* going on a date. And that people can have interests, but obsessions; nobody feels comfortable with. Tell him to keep obsessions on the down low with new people!
“He’s a really nice guy…”

Uh huh
Your friend is a fucking weirdo. It's probably better that he doesn't breed. Some people just need to be alone with their hentai.
You did the right thing man; homie needed to hear that, whether he realises it right now or not. You were being a good friend by telling him. The only way he’s ever going to bag himself any woman, let alone a Japanese one, is by toning it down.

I mean, I love anime and Japanese culture (and women!) as much as the next nerd and also dated a Japanese girl for a little while. I never really mentioned any of that stuff to her, not unless she brought it up first. One day she actually said to me that she’d dated or been hit on by so many guys who obviously just had an overbearing Asian/anime fetish and it always made her super uncomfortable.

Unbelievably, women don’t want to feel fetishised, they want somebody who likes them for them. My last gf was Brazilian, another highly fetishised nationality, and she said much the same.

So no dude, you didn’t fuck up. But homie will if he doesn’t grow up and listen to what you said to him.
…Why would you want to be friends with a racist misogynist? 
You didn't fuck up. You didn't go far enough. Someone needs to knock the weeb out of this guy. He fumbled his one shot because of the creepy obsession.
He needs to realize that Japanese Anime girls are written by men.
Seriously, call them women, not females.
He's actually not a nice guy. He's a creep who doesn't think about women in terms of them being actual human beings, but rather as if they're a product that comes in different flavours. 

And now he is upset because he somehow managed to get a hold of one in the flavour he has decided he wants, and she turned out not to fit the unrealistic image he had in his head of who and what she is supposed to be. 

And then instead of doing the tiniest bit of self reflection, he got mad at you for suggesting he work on his mentality. 

You didn't fuck up by telling him he needs to work on himself. If anything, you fucked up by not being clearer about just how fucking weird his mentality is.
He needs to learn the hard way
You shouldve put it in terms he’ll understand better. If a woman came to him and only talked about how much she liked family guy, south part, sponge bob and peppa pig. Idealize lobster from sponge bob. That’s how weird he is.
You honestly did nothing wrong here, your roomate is reacting poorly to some much needed life advice, and he will come to realize his mistake over time.
That’s rough, man. I’ve been in similar situations but took the coward’s approach and didn’t get involved. It’s a tough decision. I think you did the right thing. I wish I had sometimes too.
You did what a real friend needs to do. It sucks, but someone had to tell him.
Tell him to read peepo choo.  It's about this exact situation.
That was a good thing to do. If you now could also replace 'females' with 'humans don't like to be fetishized', that would be another step into the right direction.
As a turbo anime nerd this type of person makes me embarrassed to like anime 
The guys needed to hear what u told him. Hopefully he will eventually realize his mistake and you guys can reconnect
Your friend is a delusional moron for thinking anime 1:1 represents actual japanese people
Fun fact it’s also weird to refer to women as females. Most of us cringe when we hear it.
Sounds like a dude who needs therapy
you did the right thing. you can't blame yourself for him not being ready to hear it. Your words will most likely stick with him.
The thing about intervention is the person may not be ready to hear it, may react badly, but in the future he's likely to look back when he turns himself around and appreciate your care.
He needs therapy ASAP
Don't think you did anything wrong. That kind of obsession is off putting for other people and bad for him who might not be able to find someone inviting his type of attention.  
You were a good friend, brave enough to tell the truth to his face. He just seems to have a lot of issues he needs to deal with before he can open his mind. He will regret not listening to you in time.
I had a friend date a Japanese woman and she was weirded out by him doing the same thing talking about certain anime’s. He finally figured it out after I explained that all the anime’s he is talking about are not “main stream” at all. It was the equivalent of an American saying all their favorite movies and shows only air on late night skinimax.
There’s a short story that conveys the ideas of breaking people’s illusions with good intentions.  The Wild Duck by Henrik Ibsen. 
You didn't do a bad thing. He needs a reality check.
Show him "weeaboo" by filthy frank.
My boyfriends older brother(29) is like that. He's a very nice guy and would do anything for anyone, but he will not open himself up to dating in his town. He only wants to date women who are Asian. He's backed away from only wanting a woman from Japan when he turned 26, now he just specifies Asian. Makes me sad for him. 

He's got a internet honey that supposedly lives in Japan and swoons over her constantly. My bf has luckily managed to prevent any money being spent on her.
Wow that is actually sad. 

Yeah you can’t help with that, these situations and him coming to the realization that he isn’t being truly himself like pinnochio trying to be a real boy, is what’s needed for him to get out of it. 

Like pinnochio he has to get out of acting like a “real boy” and just be who he naturally is, then like pinnochio he’ll realize that people he sees as “real” can’t seem to do that, which is the key, pinnochio had to see that there are humans who don’t act like “real boys” because they think it’s about acting like you’re something you aren’t. 

Like in the story he became a “real boy” when he let go of trying to be a human boy and just was ok with being himself. 

Which is what the growing nose concept was about, he had to stop lying to himself, to be himself. 

He’s doing what pinnochio is doing, and even worse because he’s trying to make a woman that doesn’t exist in his mind, to fit whatever his mind is thinking Asian women are supposed to be. 

Which to him means to be into anime and scream “kyaaaaaaa” 

Which is the same reasoning behind why porn addicts have a hard time getting women, they think all the women are supposed to just be porn women and approach things that way. 

Sadly it may take him 20 years to get that, but in 20 years he will know you were right. 

It’s sad, people have to go through that…..

In a lot of ways people are wrong when they say other people don’t have the answers for your personal life, that’s not always true, sometimes like this one, it is true, and people just don’t want to accept it. 

But when they are ready to grow…..they will, in their own time.
Nah you did the right thing
OP you didn’t fuck up, your friend is living in lala land and that Japanese girl knew it too.
Nah, you didn't fuck up. You had a necessary conversation with him that will help him in the long run.
Sometimes the advice a person needs to hear has to be delivered in a way that is rough.

Advice needing that is the he bitterest and hardest advice to hear but must be.

Sometimes it is the only way to get through to someone.

I have been a recipient a couple of times, the most recent of which was this afternoon.  It was tough but absolutely necessary, even I'll admit that 

One of my closest friends doled it out.  To my shame every single thing he pointed out was spot on.

You know why he did it?

Because he cares and saw I wasn't aware of what I was doing to others around me.  I am so very lucky to have friends that care and lookout for me.
He needed to know to chill
Always found people like this weird. I have a very white wife and a child, but I still have an intense attraction to many people of Asian descent (not all countries/ethnicities of course) and I love anime.

So (before I met my wife) I met and hung out with many Japanese people that are still friends to this day and I learned more about the culture itself and fell in love with many aspects of that.

To just do the bare minimum in terms of effort but then want to find a lifelong partner based solely on that...wild and delusional.
Hindsight is always 20/20, but in those situations you gotta ask him why the date went wrong and have him figure out he’s delusional on his own.  No other way to convince a crazy that their unrealistic
You did him a favour. He needed to hear it.
Kid is going down a real bad spiral. I don't think you fucked up, OP, you had to do an intervention. But these are tough and you can only learn by doing... I think you should try talking to him again, perhaps with other friends who know about this issue and can help moderate.
You did him a favor. As much as I and many others enjoy anime, the language style is really childish compared to real spoken japanese. It's like going on a date and someone making little kid show references
You are wrong. When people are delusional, but not violent, talking to them about it the best thing you can do for them.
I listen to a podcast from someone living thirty years in Japan and in one episode it is told how people get an impression from anime and then *actually move* to Japan with those expectations!
sucks that you lost a friend but this guy has some growing up to do
This isn't on you. This could easily be a TIFU from his side: "TIFU by getting so buried in my infantile sexualize fantasies of Japanese women that I screwed up a good thing and now I can't face my roommate/friend anymore."
>start telling him how it's super weird to real females and how they aren't like that

You know what's also super weird to real "females?" Calling them females. They're called women ffs
I learned most of what I know about women from Baywatch and America’s Got Talent. I’m hoping its enough. Wish me luck!
> start telling him how it’s super weird to real females 

FYI, so is calling women "females" as a noun, it also gives off nasty vibes.
If he can’t accept a reality check or fair criticism then oh well. You tried to help. Not your fault he had a meltdown over it, and… well let’s be real: he wouldn’t be so insecure about it if he didn’t secretly know there’s some serious truth to what you said 
>start telling him how it’s super weird to real females and how they aren’t like that

Please know that it's also super fucking weird to call women "females"
Just a heads up, women typically don’t like being referred to as females either and it’s a typical talking rhetoric of people who discriminate against women and the trans community
Please be bait. For the love of god, I hope no one is actually like that IRL
> I lost a friend and someone to help pay the rent.

Nah you just lost someone to help pay rent. It would've gone down a weirder rabbit hole the further you went along.
You didn’t fuck up. Homie needs a reality check.
Exoticism is gross.
I think this is an ad for mixerusa.
To be a good friend, you have to risk losing a good friend. You did what you thought was right, unfortunately it wasn't well received.
maybe he's moving to Japan...
My nieces are Asian. Men like this are something they actively avoid. The guy isn't dating you, he's dating an idea.
I dated a guy like this because I didn't realize how creepy and obsessive he was about it until he kept buying thousand dollar figures of underdressed underage anime lolis. He displayed them in glass cases in the living room 😶
As an anime fan, this is what i worry how regular people view me when i tell then i'm an anime fan
Oh that poor girl
Ethno fetishism is weird and in my experience people with them are culturally tone deaf.  About 15 years ago I knew this guy who kept referring to his partner as "my Chinese girlfriend" in front of her, which was weird but I didn't give it much thought.  At one point he left the room and I was shooting the shit with her and she says "Yeah back home in Taiwan..." I almost choked on what I was eating.  I pulled the guy aside and said "Bro first off not everyone who is from east Asia is Chinese.  Second....of all the places a person could be from that it would be offensive to refer to them as that....like do you know the history of Taiwan and China?"

So Paul gave me shit and said I was overreacting and she didn't mind.  I said well if she doesn't mind that's between you and her, but how would you feel if I called you "My Russian Friend"?  He said he wouldn't mind so I dropped it.

They didn't last long and my friendship with Paul drifted into nothing over the n ext few years.  Just busy people with very different lives.

This was probably just around 2010

The thing is, Paul came to Florida in the 90's....from Crimea.  I wonder if he understands now.

  
Edit: sucks to lose a roommate but you did him a favor and he's being a baby
You told him what he needed to hear. If you didn't he'd just keep having failed relationship after failed relationship with no clue why.
This is hilarious
Female humans are called women. 
You have some growing up to do. 

The friend is a lost cause.
No, you didn't fuck up dude. You did what all of us wish we could do when it comes to these weeb weirdoes. They think anime is some kind of documentation of Japanese culture, when really half of it isn't even written or produced by Japanese people, and it's ... Fucking cartoons. It's like if someone watched, idk Family Guy and South Park and then assumed that was how all Americans are, and was upset when someone told them that most American men aren't like Peter Griffin. The difference is that anime waaaayyyy oversexualizes women, especially young/young looking women and girls.

Your roommate is cringe and delusional, and someone had to at least try to snap him out of it. I'm sorry you lost a friend.
Ironically, your roommate should know from anime that most japanese girls find this extreme otaku behaviour weird and even a tad creepy. 


That said, maybe it is for the best that he is moving out. It seems a bit extreme to move out after your conversation 
I'd send him this thread and let him read it all, it will definitely hurt but might open his eyes before it's too late to bring the delusion back
What makes me laugh in this is that if he watches anime he should know damn well a lot of Japanese folk tend to look down on weebs, American and Japanese alike lol why didn't he see this coming?! He had so many hit titles to prepare him!
Yeah dude, I have a coworker that thought it would be his day if someone needed to speak Japanese because he watches anime. A Japanese man walked up to him and spoke to him and coworker said "he was talking too fast, I wasn't sure what language he was speaking" We still give him shit about it.
Yeah the crying after an interaction with the opposite sex was pretty much a given....
god I can just imagine the smell in the apartment LOL
Fucking weebs.
Sick t-shirt your avatar got dude
Where did that chair come from!? Ohh the Humanity!
>That girl cracked his whole identity's skull...

Not a chance, that'd require self-awareness. Guarantee you he's just thinking "what a bitch..."

At least until OP gave him a talking to, even then the denial might be strong enough that he hasn't gotten the picture.
nah, people like him are delusional - he will just be more and more introverted and refuse any logic
He don't wanna be saved, don't save em
> let him run

Naruto style
The only thing that would worry me is that he might be on the incel pathway if he doesn't have close friends to keep him even keeled with his obsession. I know it might seem like overreaction, but the more out of touch he gets, then the more susceptible he becomes to radicalization and next thing you know he's listening to Nick Fuentes.
True story, I grew up seriously hating on anime and weebs, not that interested in Japan in general. And then I'm having a house party and this really cute Japanese girl starts talking to me, and would you believe it? 10 years later, we're married. Lol
Same here, been watching for a while, over 100 on my list. That is so weird. As soon as I read Japanese in this post, I knew it.

Second I read Anime, I wished this was rage bait. OP, pls tell us this is a legitimate karma whoring post and you successfully did it!

I refuse to believe this people are real, from the Todoroki girl cosplayers that freak me out on Tiktok, to the guys like OP's roommate that think all of Japanese people love and care about Anime.... I don't want to be associated with any of these.

Literally weirdos, both of them.

Japanese girls do look good, don't get me wrong, but so do many other nations (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, yes, I'm talking about you there!)
Or, this guy is just really looking for the Taiga to his Ryuji.  The railgun to his Toma, the…
Yeah OP please see this. You sound like some young college students. Weeb roomie doesn't just get to bail on a lease lol. Real life doesn't work like that. Unless they aren't on the lease, which if thats the case...oof life lesson for you this week.
Based on the timing right now, it could just be up next week. Summer's almost over and their original lease probably started in July or August. He probably just wasn't renewing his lease anyway.
If the payments aren’t separate, yes he can.

I had a group of friends leave without subletting or getting off the lease and the landlord didn’t go after them, so I had to. And in the end only got about 2/3 of the rent back that I had covered for them (if I didn’t cover it I would’ve been evicted).
There are monthly leases out there friend….
That might be tomorrows TIFU.
Uh yeah he can they did it on an episode of DragonBall Z
they *can* leave but will still have to pay as if they lived there. Sooo new game room, wooooo!
In before someone says you don’t read anime
I was expecting this to go a different direction when I read art school.
But then what happens if he doesn’t get accepted to art school
Read it.
art schools hate anime/manga style art
This 100%
I would be surprised if there isn't one about this specific subject already
She would then throw you references from crocodile dundee and expect you to be him.
Me too- but I'm German... So it would be, uhm, slightly worse
> Fosters beer in the fridge

Definitely a red flag.
You're memeing but I dated an asian lass in uni. Her crush before me was a tall blonde guy, I'm a tall blonde guy, and after we broke up she dated and eventually married another tall blonde guy. 


 When we were together she started this "dumb joke" that we both had yellow fever, but with hindsight maybe she wasn't joking. 
But is she a keeper if she screams Steve Irwin exclamations in bed? CRIKEY, HARDER!
One girl I dated was *nuts* about Woody from Toy Story. Woody bed sheets, pillow cases, shower curtains, toothbrushes, dolls - the works. She was an undergraduate student in her early 20s (kinda feel I need to make her age clear).

So yeah she was clearly a bit of a nutcase but good LORD she was the best sex I have ever had. Hands down. I get this is Reddit and it’s bad to proclaim you have sex, but have you *really* lived if you haven’t [blown your load with a Woody plushy staring you down](https://imgur.com/a/Eb761VR) in your peripheral vision?

What I’m saying is, if you meet a girl with Fosters beer in the fridge, stuffed kangaroos, and portraits of Steve Irwin around her house, just give her a chance.

Also Jeanette all is forgiven let’s get married
Idk that sounds like an all round good time to me
>  I'd be nope right after doing all the naked stuff

Most blokes would, anyway.
She sounds kinda cool
Shrimp on the barbie
I wish it was as easy to get VB as Fosters in the US......which ironically enough is not drunken much in Australia, or at least seemed to be the case when I was there years and years ago
Wake up. Gotta get me brekkie at a Hungry Jacks. Make sure I say 'gday mate' to the live sized portrait of Steve Irwin by the front door. Check my boots for any snakes, spiders and scorpions. I leave the house. But tragedy! I forgot to wear my Sky Harness - and plummet violently upwards into the clouds the moment I step outside.
don't lie, you would nope out the next day
That basically does happen if I date tourists here in Scotland xD
There's a scene in The Wrestler (2008) where Mickey Rourke's character is taken home by a woman who is like this, but with firefighters instead of Australians
>portraits of Steve Irwin around her house

Would you though?
Yeah everyone knows we keep our shrine to Irwin in the backyard next to the pool, man people just don't get aussies sometimes
I'm German, and I'm not even going to say more.
You have described the perfect woman. This is treason. Unhook your tether and fall into space before you get The Boot
What if she serves u bbq shrimp and blooming onions? Mmm
Freezer full of Golden Gaytimes.
Well yeah, she drinks fosters bro.  Fuckin bullet dodged. 


You forgot boomerangs and didgeridoos though
If Midnight Oil was playing in the background? Would that help?
Nah you’d put a baby in her dingo. Don’t lie bro
What about bluey ?
Good call. That way you avoid the “Hahaha, that’s not a penis… this is a penis” moment.
You wouldn't put your shrimp in her barbie first?
https://i.redd.it/cyctgob2obdd1.gif
What if she had VB?

What if it were a long neck?
I dont get this, i grew up watching anime in the 80s because it was the coolest cartoons around, it was just so different from western cartoons. And as such i have been a huge animefan all my life and once i got fibre in the 90s i watched so much anime it was silly. 

But, never once in my life have i thought that these cartoons had anything to do with the real world. 

How come these basement dwellers have such a skewed view of reality?
I live in Japan, and there are a few who act like that. A few. Like 1 in a thousand
OP should have made sure his roommate doesn't ever get close to a school instead of worrying about losing a friend.
Yep! It is creepy to think Japanese girls are (automatically) anime girls.
This.

You say he's nice...but he's not. He's misguided and he's training himself into a fetish that will hobble his ability to appreciate or firm relationships with real actual women, Japanese or otherwise.

He's creepy, and objectifies Jaoanese women because he expects them to live up to some weird stereotypes from anime. Real Japanese people are diverse and want someone to love them for who they are, not for their nationality or whether they fulfil someone's hentai kink. ManyJapanese women arent into anime at all. And real people don't behave like cartoon characters.  Does he see anything interesting about them besides objectifying them?  does he socialise with women as normal human beings outside of trying to find an anime girl to fuck? There's your clue as to what's going wrong. And it ain't bevause you told him the truth.

Honestly that girl had a lucky escape. He needs to hear it, or he's going to live his life as an incel, wondering why all the women he tries to date find him creepy.
Why, what's wrong with obsessive fiction based racial fetishization of "females"?

^^/s ^^for ^^those ^^who ^^need ^^it
He won the lotto and spent on a single day.
It’s referred to as “yellow fever” by my Japanese friends.
I wonder if there's a Japanese person out there who fetishises looney toons or Scooby-Doo
[deleted]
The chances that he thinks much better about women in general is pretty fucking low.
"Just women" is what the guy's trying to avoid.
Because it was very Kowaii of him.
That's the real fuckup.

The comments in here trying to use semantics to justify the use of the word female is.... as expected to be honest. People can't just listen to women when we say, we don't like being referred to as FEEEEmales and to call us women. Cant just be accepted and respected, gotta argue about it.
I’m surprised this is so far down, along with “real life Japanese girl”. wtf? Maybe this explains why op has a roommate who’s racist
Huge indicator of the kind of person OP sees himself as. Red flag
Yep, OP fucked up.

This is creative writing by someone who probably needs to go outside a bit themselves lmao
Thank you
Right! That was my thought, too. Maybe he just needs to find himself a woman who loves anime and cosplaying. Sounds way more sustainable than trying to specifically date Japanese women and force his ideals on her.

 Hell, my hubby and I watch so much anime that our son learned how to read quickly when he was little so he would know what was going on, lol. Now he's 15 and recommending different animes to me.
When a woman walks into his presence, I wonder if he feels the urge to shout "REAL FEMALES!!" lol

After living in Japan, I can confirm I did develop a fetish. My love for the Japanese trains in Tokyo. I wish the rest of the world could have trains as reliable as them, or as cheap as them.
Don’t apologize, OP. That will make your friend think this was okay
That day will likely never come.
Alright buddy you went a bit far at the end there
"People can't change."

-This person
I wonder if he thinks Japanese women actual grab each other's tits all the time.
I really don't think this is true. I mean, I know that weebs are looked down on in Japan. But I get the impression that your Western weeaboo seems to think that the Japanese love them. Like, they think Japan is a holy land where they'll finally be accepted.
I watch a lot of anime and there really hasn't been much in there to imply that people look down on megaweebs, you have to interact with people to get that message.
*Just like the simulations!*
Lol, good luck understanding real life japanese from watching animes xD. Does work the other way around though, just remember some catchphrases and throw them at your japanese guests (im a waitress) and 9/10 times they are sooooo impressed ;)
Good God! Good God! He broke him in half!
Some chairs have a lesson behind them.
Yeah this probably tracks more. Obsessive or dangerous viewpoints on how women are or should be isn't limited to the anime fandom and in that context I've seen quite a few of them.

Most don't become self aware of the toxicity they spew when something like this happens, instead they place the blame in the woman. 

Hopefully OP got through to this one.
Fool me one time, shame on you
You didn’t save my life, you ruined my death!
That's not my man, don't claim him
Bro literally looks at Japanese women like they are a one dimensional object and OP feels bad for giving him advice? (Honestly, I would’ve been way more blunt/harsh) 

OP, the older you get the shorter your patience will be for shit this offensive. Let him leave and get a new roommate. Lol.
*sad flute song plays in the distance*
I like the way you think.
Probably better to not be a weeb in this case lmao
So... you like Japanese and... Scandinavian.
> Weeb roomie doesn't just get to bail on a lease lol.

I mean people can move out and live wherever they want.  That doesn't change any legal contract they signed.  THey can move out all they want....they're still going to be responsible for their half of the rent.  Buuuuuuuut that is all assuming there was a legal signed contract involved...
Nah I totally took it as he means go to art school, create famous manga that gets out into shounen jump, that THEN gets popular enough to get an anime adaption, that his friend watches eventually and finally understands
Actually, if you're a sub over dub person you do ;p
Bro you're too late
Idk i read the subtitles a lot.
I'm sorry my friend, I don't understand a single word of japanese... so yeah, I do in fact *read* Anime.
I call mangas and stuff "reading anime"

Both to insult people who watch anime and to simply explain action to those who do not. To be fair, I also watch subbed anime exclusively so I'm reading that too technically.
why was I thinking this too? what is wrong with me
Same 💀
Well someone failing art school did lead to anime

Damn, really?
The young woman dons a wide brimmed cap, oversized corks dangling from the rim. She shakes her head, the tiny wooden pieces comically bouncing around. You would’ve laughed, except for the large knife she brandished, the crocodile sheath strapped to her belt. “Uhh… Misaki, you maybe want to put that away? I’m sure you’re comfortable enough with knives, but I just don’t feel that safe with the way you’re holding it.”


“Misaki? Yeah, nah, I’ve no idea what you’re on about, mate, moi names Sheila.” The raven-haired woman stumbled over the couch, knife still in hand. Her poorly-fitting jacket hung loosely on her shoulders - she claimed it was made of kangaroo skin. You’re fairly sure it was from Target. Maybe Kmart.


You duck away into your bedroom and shut the door. You hear her faintly from the other side “Oiiiii” she whines while rattling the doorknob violently “don’t be a shitcunt, yewww fackin drongo. Look at meeee, look at moiiii”. You look around your room at your plastic anime figurines and tsundere body pillow. “Don’t worry,” you whisper to yourself. “Your decades of watching Japanese cartoons have prepared you for this.”
"That ain't a knife..."
She would make him a vegemite sandwich. She probably has a friend from Brussels, full of muscles.
As awkward  as it is for a Japanese woman to go on a date with a weeaboo, being German and going on a date with a wehraboo has got to be another level.

What? Don’t wants to go back to a girls place and see pictures of heavy machinery and rheinmetall products on all the walls? She would also probably hand you a giant beer and brat as soon as you get there too!
yellow fever because you're blonde? lmao
Well, most people have their types.
Solid joke. At least she is aware, which is exactly what OPs issue is.
Reminds of those white chicks who only date Korean dudes. There is definitely a type but low key fetish dating is a bit strange. I guess if it works out in the end and they marry more power to them.  As long as it’s not just objectifying a fetish.
"Crikey, look at the size of that thing!"
Sounds like a normal Aussie Sheila

I had a one night stand right after college where she *insisted* on keeping her tiny, white, fluffy, fits-in-handbag dog ON THE BED while we were going at it. The look in this poor creature’s eyes while he watched me banging his mom is seared into the fabric of my very soul. 
Yea ngl, as an American I would’ve have the same sentiment as

I've watched anime since I was a kid and somehow didn't end up this way either. I don't know if it's something about the media itself or some genre of it, but it feels gross to even associate with it anymore just because of how creepy some of the fans are.  

The last anime I watched before Dungeon Meshi was Attack on Titan, I just don't find the appeal to all the mass produced crap that is out there now. Far, FAR too many isekais. Who even asked for all these isekais? Meshi was really good though, I might grab the books.
I grew up watching anime too and I gotta say you're wrong. If I don't train like Goku how am I gonna reach his level? Come on, less talking, 20 more reps.

Because they never ventured out of their basements to see how - gasp - women are in the wild
> How come these basement dwellers have such a skewed view of reality?

It's not just basement dwellers. Look at how many celebrities have stories about people thinking their film/tv characters ARE them. Jack Gleeson isn't the only one to be virtually bullied out of the business by fans.
Because they don't go out much

Even in America nobody act how TV characters do, most people know this but there's always a group of people who don't see enough of the real world to realize that and it fucks with them when they do finally go out
Imagine some japanese dude comes to the US and is upset the world isn't like Looney Tunes.
I mean there’s a few girls in the US that act like that too. I imagine most countries are like that
Fetishizing to the max 😭

I've had a few people also automatically assume I'm very submissive because I'm Asian lol... I'm like. The total opposite. Let me peg ya.
If you think about it, that attitude is racist as fuck. OP is well rid of the guy
I think she should be called woman here, because part of the anime I have understood is to infantalise the women.

I had anime crazy people as friends and knew more from art school. It is really off putting. Also I saw a doc how girls are fetizised more than women and the culture has pedo tendencies of girls dressing up as scool teen girls to do sex work. Same in hentai.
He's nice\*

\*when you are not a potential sexual partner
Yes! He said he was a nice guy... but what does that mean? Nice to you? Plus he's trying to move out and leave you with the rent, that doesn't sound so nice. Also I've known a couple guys who are relatively attractive but cannot get a woman to date them ever. Then you ask them what are they saying and doing; and then yep, you find out real quick they are just creepy, disrespectful, and have a very one-sided view of women.
No doubt. I used to date some girls from a foreign student club (they went to the same dance club/raves I did) when I was in my early 20s and you know, other than a couple of cultural oddities (to me) and the language differences, they're just people like everyone else. One was a relatively conservative girl who listened to pop music and just wanted to be a housewife with a job at a shop. Another was a punk rock girl who played saxophone in a ska band. Another was an artist who was always making something, painting something, etc. And another was just a girl who was interested in looking cool. Being Japanese had nothing to do with it. They were just... people. Doing stuff People do. 

The guy the OP is talking about sounds like those guys who go to Japan and carry around a Waifu pillow wondering why girls aren't just dropping panties for them everywhere.
Why does the op call her “real life Japanese girl” in one sentence and then “female” in another? Something is suspicious
I call them LBHs. Losers Back Home. 

I live in Japan and it's truly obnoxious how many delusional men exist here. Like I've never seen so many delusional men in my life until moving here.
I always thought that Yellow Fever meant an Asian fetish which is also creepy but not as bad as singling out an ethnicity
They’re called Westaboos
This is truth… one of my exes was this white/latina woman who would slip like…anime girl mannerisms into her every day life. It was immensely cringe.
Ferengi detection technique activated
This is how I assume any man that uses "females" actually looks
Like is it actually so hard to use the noun that we were all taught from kindergarten to use???
I think simple rule of thumb is female is an adjective, not a noun. A person is not a female, they might be a female pilot, or a female doctor, if there is some need to specifically point out the sex of the person. 

If they are pointing out a singular person is female, I suppose "female human" would be grammatically correct, but you are going to sound even weirder than just saying "female".

I suppose you are right and it is best to avoid the word when possible when talking about people.
"What's wrong with "females?" I have no problem with saying that when I go out on a Males Night Out that it's just me and my males!" /s
How about "Mu'h Laidy"? Does that get your ovaries running?
Typical male behavior to call women females

Edit: I’m a male, I was calling out the hypocrisy of women who constantly refer to men as males but can’t handle being referred to as female. Sorry I don’t think anyone got that
It's the tldr. Instead of being an actual tldr and summarising the post it's some kind of lesson learned thing, AI always seems to do that for some reason.
Totally understandable fetish. Add the fact that people line up to wait for others to get off first... A truly awesome sight!
I think he can apologize for hurting his feelings without back tracking about it being true. Certain things are hard to hear but people who feel it important enough to say it usually care a lot.
He gets in bed with her and belike, wtf is this thing not supposed to be blurred?? 
To be fair, some of my Japanese friends at uni grabbed my boobs to compare sizes 🤣 I didn't care, but warned them not everyone might take it as well haha
As a Western man married to a Japanese woman, I have to admit I am constantly telling her we don’t do that sort of thing here.

Also a lot of times rental agreements are written where all parties are held responsible for the full amount, so if he moves out and stops paying it's on OP to pay the full rent amount and then sue for the money back from the former-roommate. Depends on how the contract is written.
The manga is adapted into 2 highly rated seasons of anime, which is not renewed for a third season in spite of overwhelmingly positive reviews and high sales numbers for the remaining manga and light novels.
Why not apply to art school, get rejected and go for genocide and suicide in the end
Go to art school, you know. Maybe take over Germany.  Whos to say?
I literally took it as create the popular anime then let him read the storyboards...
Or take the animation branch of art school. That's doable too. Kinda skips a few steps. 
Go full tilt Bakuman!

Push ex roommate to get into voice acting. Then he'll audition for the main character for the anime adaptation. Rekindle the friendship and get closer in the creative process.
Whadayaknow, they were made for each other all along. 
Ditch "real females" altogether and build an art studio for him. Bang, roomies again!
Dang
He went to art school and then took a quantum physics doctorate so he can go back in time and make it.
Sounds like you have a struggle. You should write a book on it.
So what's the solution?
They don't like illustration in general, according to my mom. But she also hates anime/manga for the same anatomy -based reasoning the other comment describes. Then I remind her Spirited Away counts as anime and she's like "oh yeah that movie's beautiful." 


Usually new students are doing deviantart level anime. Art school wants you to learn WHAT you're stylizing before you stylize it, so they focus on that DaVinci realism. They're not wrong, it does help. They are also pretentious about it. 
yeah it doesn't *generally* follow anatomy fundamentals among other issues that comes down to stylistic choices and art teacher have a chip on the shoulders when it come to that , but in any case after you learn the fundamentals they can't stop you from doing manga style in your own time.
I was specifically told to not include manga art in my portfolio. I dont draw manga so it was a moot point for me but the portfolio reviewer mentioned they sometimes get whole portfolios of manga and that style of drawing obfuscates your knowledge of anatomy, proportion, perspective, etc. They want to see that you have the potential to grow as an artist and aren't stuck in one path. Art school is also about exploring different styles and mediums of illustration , not just pencil and ink.
Lmao this is amazing 😂

This always stands out to me when you go to r/AskAnAmerican and someone asks about a thing they saw in movies. There's always respondents getting really mad at it asking "don't you know movies aren't real" but the point is that for us non-Americans, Hollywood movies show a ton of things that make no sense to us, but some of them are actually real and some of them aren't and there's not much of a way for us to know the difference. I assume it's the same thing with anime, it's not that easy to know what is weird anime stuff and what is a genuine cultural difference.

To give you a random example going the other way, I always assumed that all the extracurriculars happening at school in American media were a plot device to not have to introduce yet another location or group, because where I'm from you play sports or learn an instrument at an independent sports club or music school, and schools only do the actual school part.
This is what scares me, these people have been to school, yet they lack critical thinking skills. It's the same with people who think actors are the people they play. How can humans be this fundamentally stupid. 

I have always had a hard time with this. Where i grew up people were smart, we had like 1 kid who wasn't, but he was mentally challenged....

I used to think everyone was smart and dumb people were the exception, the rise of the internet showed me my perceived statistics was wrong and it's the other way around. 

But im still struggling with it. It's the one thing in life that makes me lose hope. People being dumb as bricks.
Yeah, I mean OP says it in his post. The roommate had never even met a Japanese person before so he had nothing to disprove his stereotypes. 

But it all honesty I think only stupid people assume that the media they watch is completely representative of another culture. Especially nowadays, you just have to go on the Internet to see how wrong your preconceived notions are.
You can actually make a gun shoot mouse fart quiet, but only if it's shooting subsonic ammo. There's plenty of examples on YouTube where the bullet hitting the steel target is louder than the gun firing. You have to be very deliberate about the ammunition and the fine-tuning of the firearm, but it is actually quite possible to do. Also the suppressors that can actually do it are expensive as fuck and you can't buy any of them without a federal registration in advance.
My girlfriend (who got me into ainme in the first place) is absolutely addicted to isekais. She'll watch a lot of other genres too, but a good percentage of her watch list is isekai.
RIP your inbox
as an asian man, asian women for sure never ever struck me as submissive. my mother and most asian moms always held the upper hand with the dads. also it's called battle hymn of the tiger MOTHER for a reason.

submissive energy is not gender specific. i've found men with that submissive energy- and funny enough asian women love to see that from what i've seen. anime shows one slice of one personality type of one fetish of chauvinistic anime producers and basement dwelling NEETs just eat it up.
This is why I find those passport bros hilarious.

My mom is a classical tiger mom.

If you disrespect her, she's not afraid to get in your face and make you wish the ground would just swallow you up whole.

Same with her sister.

And their mom. 

And their mom's mom.

But these bros still think they can go to our home country to find some submissive owo waifu to marry who will wash their asses for them. 

My bf's buddy is a white American man married to a woman from Japan and guess who gets final say in everything?

I'll give you a hint, it ain't the guy ;).
> Let me peg ya.

Don't make a promise you aren't going to keep.
Doesn’t help that anime has some serious issues with “Lolita” characters
Gross! They wanted a bang maid
Don't threaten me with a good time.
Is that too different from the "Catholic School Girl" fetish? Albeit probably more prevalent.
Yeah I accidentally went to a street in Osaka where they sat outside of houses dressed as school girls and (I think) there was a pimp next to them. Cannot be sure but it felt like a red district.
the culture values youth to a extreme, ironically despite being known for having a lot of long lived people in the country. While I love anime myself, I try to be a normal person as possible, and obviously it means I don't bring anime up at all until they know how weird I am.
"real females" made me barf in my mouth a bit ngl. i was scrolling to see if anyone else picked up on that lol.

It actually does refer to Asians as a whole, but they are both equally as bad and creepy imo...
Not gonna lie, i though yellow fever was something people in the wild west got, like 1860s and such.
You'd think that some people spend most of their time in kindergarden eating nail glue
>If they are pointing out a singular person is female, I suppose “female human” would be grammatically correct.

And possibly necessary, if the present group includes say Orcs, Elves, and Dwarves not speaking Common, in addition to Humans. But that situation doesn’t come up all that often. Whenever you say “female human,” then you can just say “woman” anyway, most likely.

Jokes aside, the exception off the top of my head would be comparative biology.
Only if we are at a renfaire and you're doing schtick. Otherwise you will be getting a rant about medieval European class structure and gender. I'll have to venmo you for the Viagra you'll need just to *find* it for a while after. :D

Not a single dude I know calls women "females". Except the doctor, sometimes.

There’s been a trend in college towns to have each roommate sign an individual lease for their portion of the rent. The good news is that it protects OP from having to suddenly pay for the full apartment if the former roommate stops paying. The bad news is that it generally means the complex can move any rando into the space that’s now available.
Hey, they are finally giving Spice and Wolf another shot. Dont be so cynical.

That trope's been done to death.
Yeah, I really thought that's where that was going. Bit more extreme than making a comic but it'd get the point across.
You could even involve the Japanese somehow, uuh... let's say you partner up somehow.
This here was my first thought hahahaha
Er, something tells me that going to animation school is the worst way tp try and get an anime made. 1. You will end up working in advertising if your lucky. And mcdonalds if you're not. 2. Even if yoy could stomach to low wages to work for an anime studio, you will never get to make you're own shit, you'll probably just be tweening arms and legs for 25 years.
I'm learning German so I think I should name it mei-
Take a holiday to Poland?
I think it depends on the school, most have a painting and illustration track. But they want to see variety and accuracy of anatomy before you move into stylization for sure.

edit to add using the da vinci metaphor its like you started with mannerism before exporing realism :p

I'm currently learning Italian just to fuck with my brother in law.
How do you think it would have gone during your teenage years if you met her then? I always had the impression that being a proper weeb goes a bit further than merely watching anime though, and that it means doing things like going on a jog with someone and deciding to Naruto run because you think it looks really cool. 

A wehraboo though would still be a whole lot more awkward. It would be like if she came to your house for the first time and she saw the old japanese imperial flag plastered across your wall, an old imperial army uniform and sword, and you looked her dead serious in the eye and said "Nippon banzai!"
*That* oughtta piss 'im off!
Oi, 'e's a wiley one

Well there's your problem
We have club teams too, for most sports.  American sports have youth leagues that get you up to about 10 to 12, and then you start to join travel teams/clubs and school teams.

And definitely, for musicians, most of the serious ones take private lessons or have a music school they attend at a young age.

The marriage between schools and activities, I think it's a function of the US being so large and the pop density being much less.  Also, the early paradigm for education in the US was the community schools system, where the school functioned as a community hub, providing athletic resources like fields, courts, pools and tracks to the community or neighborhood use.

That's gone out of style in the last 40 years with mostly negative consequences, especially in urban/rural neighborhoods.  But for football, especially, the school team functions like a u18 club centered around the geography of the school's district and our college teams like a u25 semi pro team.
I think Deadpool had a great spoof about that "Hero Landing" with the knee and fist on the ground and it's like... Yeah, do that in real life and you're going to be limping around like an idiot for awhile afterwards.
Best way to think of it is movies and tv are exaggerations of truths. There’s usually a hint of truth in much of it. And occasionally real life is stranger than fiction, it’s the occasional thing that happens that can trip people up when that happens.
Everyone loves escapasism
Exactly!!! I don't fking know where the hell "Asian women are submissive" stereotype came from because any Asian family would fking know the moment you disobey your mom, she will give you the slipper of doom (half joking) 😂

But fr, most Asian moms run the goddamn household, and NOT in the abusive "I have to do this or I'll be kicked out" way lol
I don't wanna break your image, but I doubt they'd even want the woman to wash their ass for them. They probably think it will make them gay :p
The worst part is when they introduce them late into the show. You're just happily watching a silly show about a loser who gets reincarnated as a slime monster, makes friends with monsters etc. 


Then bam! 12 year old character in a bikini. half the guys making these shows should be under observation.
As an anime fan, there’s nothing worse than starting a new show all excited about the premise only to be smacked in the face by loli shit. 

Looking at you, Dragon Maid.
Pretty sure you stepped in Tobita Shinchi (or other Shinchi), it's pretty hard to accidently step in there because those place have nothing else but red light district....
Referring to women as “females” is always an incel red flag.

And even in fantasy writing, it’s typically less awkward to use the race rather than the gender as the adjective. Elvish woman, orcish man, etc.
I know plenty that do. Just because you haven't experienced it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
I’ve heard it a couple times outside of medical contexts. Always struck me as odd to hear someone say it in real life.
I'm a dude and I hear other dudes use it all the time. It's weird as fuck. It's also weird af when guys refer to women as girls.
Yeah it's entirely possible to do that. 

It's what he needs to hear, that said there's a reason why "time and place" is a thing. If I already was down from a rough date and my friend came in with a steel chair I'd probably just move out and be depressed on my own tbh.
My only regret was too young for lisa bonet
This is how it is in my college town apartment. I've had 2 roommates get evicted and my rent stayed the same. Great idea for all college towns honestly.
My wife’s college apartment was this way. Three bedroom apartment, three tenants, three leases. If you wanna poke holes she ended up paying half of what a regular apartment would be, so the place ended up getting about 50% more per unit than you’d normally get but what are you gonna do
The new Spice and Wolf anime is a remake, not a continuation. :O
Wait, the guy travels back in time so others can kill him?
Maybe this time it will end differently
Oh yeah, I completely understand. I didn't necessarily mean "get one conceptualized, picked up and published".   


  You could, quite literally, slap a short together, show the roommate and leave him to reflect. Once you have the skills, anyway.


 Another alternative would be to make an abridged-style cut and Voice it.

Probably from post WW2 american soldiers bringing home asian women. They didn't know the culture that much, so the isolation maybe made them a bit shy? More importantly, [the 50s propaganda](https://old.reddit.com/r/PropagandaPosters/comments/11fv8dm/do_japanese_women_make_better_wives_1953_jet/) probably had something to do with this.
>But fr, most Asian moms run the goddamn household, and NOT in the abusive "I have to do this or I'll be kicked out" way lol

The title of the show didn't tip you off it could have weird sex shit?
We were walking to the city from some temple in the middle of the day and I swear it was an accidental choice of a street. I was with my sister.
I've said it (as a woman) before when I meant "women and girls" and just wanted to use one word to encompass both. (I would also use "males" to mean "men and boys.") I was surprised to learn the noun was offensive, but it makes sense why it's no longer preferred, so I've started using it as an adjective only. I do understand that some older people (like me) are still catching up. 


That said, if a 20-something guy is using it, I also get major incel vibes. Not great from OP given the subject under discussion.
They can when they smell waifu.
my only regret was too young for nia long
It still seems like they are going to go further than the original and also animate LN 4, which they skipped originally.
The further back you go, the easier it is to find someone willing to do it.
Well Germany could need a new "Autobahn"...
No. That's a pretty big beer I guess.
I said most.... NOT ALL . If this does not apply to you, then it don't. We all know abusive people exist in all shapes and sizes.
Now all I’m left with is hoes from reality shows
Now all im left with is hoes from reality shows
LN4 is going to be new. Going further is unknown at the moment, though I do hope for a complete adaptation.
We have'em in America, too, they're called bullfrogs.
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn’t read along
That's a bootable offence!
It's just a little kick in the bum.
TIFU by accidentally cooking the turkey upside down
I don’t really think this is a huge deal but all of the older people in my family are freaking out at me. I was in charge of cooking the Christmas turkey for the first time this year so I got up early, seasoned it, and put it in the oven. I’ve been basting every hour or so and I just pulled it out of the oven. Then my mom and grandma started freaking out because I cooked the turkey breast side down. I genuinely didn’t know that there was a right side up for cooking a turkey. It is thoroughly cooked and it’s not burnt or anything but they are acting like I ruined Christmas. Now they are saying that they can’t trust me to do anything and I’m completely incompetent. They are trying to figure out where to get a turkey in a hurry since this one is ruined. I was in the middle of baking a cake but now I’ve been ejected from the kitchen until it is time for me to do the dishes (usually the people who cook the meal don’t have to do dishes in my family).

TLDR: I cooked the turkey upside down and now I’m banned from the kitchen

Update: The guys of the house and I ate the turkey and it was genuinely the best turkey I ever had! The ladies sat there glaring the whole meal and refused to touch anything I made. I helped with dishes just to keep the peace since I’m home from college for another almost 2 weeks. Many lessons were learned today and I am probably going to cook the turkey upside down for the rest of my life!
Congratulations on having a very moist and totally edible turkey. I've done mine upside down for years.
Seriously? I cooked the Turkey upside down (my first time too) this Thanksgiving and it was delicious! My parents called it an Australian Turkey. Your family is overreacting, the turkey is edible.
Cooking a turkey breast side down is actually a technique to stop the breast meat from drying out. In no way is the turkey "ruined". Your family is just abusive.
Refuse to do the dishes. Clean your dish and leave everything else. You volunteered to cook not do dishes. AND A BIRD CAN BE COOKED MULTIPLE WAYS...since it sounds like your family has been cooking under a rock.
I'm and old lady around your grandma's age, I bet. I cook the turkey upside down *on purpose!*

Sure, it's not as pretty, but it makes the white meat moister. My brother, who dislikes turkey, loves it when I cook it because it's so moist.

You did everyone a favour and gave them the least dried up turkey they will ever eat!
I accidentally did the same thing during thanksgiving this year. I didn’t figure it out until I tried carving the turkey and couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t cut through it.  We bought a free range turkey from a local farm and I was stumped what was happening. It looked the same as right side up. We finally figure it out and had a good laugh. We flipped it right side up and the meat was perfectly cooked and delicious!!
That is abusive behavior by your family, cooking it breast side down is valid.
Your family is out of their minds. Tell them to make their own damned dinner next time. Merry Christmas 🤷‍♂️
Get a new turkey? Are they having a laugh?
We start our turkey breast side down for the first hour than flip it. The juices flow down and keep the breast meat moist. No FU there. Your family needs to chill.
[deleted]
you family are being jerks. Eat the turkey. some of them will find fault with it b/c they've already decided its "bad" no matter how well it's cooked. Serve it anyway.
Some folks swear by upside down turkey, the breast is juicier, and dark meat can cook better. Depending on everyone’s palette, some may find this way more desirable
My mom did this once by mistake many years ago and my father loves to tell the story because it was the best turkey she’s ever made.
They don’t like it? They don’t have to eat it then.
People need some shit to freak out about and blame someone else for something so insignificant it helps them forget about their miserable choices for just a short moment.family is fucking awesome
Now you're faced with a dilemma:

1) Show them all  these comments to prove that it's fine, and say you intended all along to cook it upside down.

2) Let them think you effed up and get a kitchen duty pass forever.
Sorry friend, your family is just being abusive. Cooking poultry breast side down is a great way to keep the breast from drying out. You can flip it halfway through or towards the end for added crisp but you didn’t do it wrong.

Tell them to stop acting like assholes. You’re not dumb, you didn’t ruin anything.
Always breast side down. Learned it from a nice guy at my very first job. Then flip it for the last 20-30. I finally figured out an easy way to flip it is to put Gallon zip lock bags over oven mitts, and just pick it up.
I always cook breast down, you didn’t screw up, bet that was some moist breast meat….
It’s actually going to be better that way—the breast meat has been somewhat protected and constantly basted. Tell them to get stuffed.
I work in catering and cook a lot of turkeys. We cook all of them breast down to ensure the breasts are not dried out. Your family is crazy.
Most people rotate it. Breast side down then vreast side up, no? 

Also what the fuck r they gonna do with the fucking turkey now?
I accidentally cooked mine upside down last year, no big deal, looked a little funny, tasted great. Cooked it the right way up this year, everyone nicely asked if we could have it upside again down next year. 🤷‍♀️
I'm so sorry you have to deal with incompetent boomers who don't know what good turkey tastes like. No joke every single turkey I ever had growing up, mostly my dad's, but also my mother in law's, my aunt's and one time my mom's, they all overcooked their turkey and the only way to stomach eating it was drowning it in mashed potatoes and gravy. I seriously thought turkey was the worst part about Thanksgiving/X-mas my entire life, and always dreaded eating one.

Then I decided to make my own turkeys. My mother in law died, and my dad moved to another town so there was noone else's house to migrate to for the holidays. My first year alone was the best turkey I had ever had in my life. I thawed it out a few days, then did a dry salt brine on it and let it sit in the fridge for 3 days until Thanksgiving. It came out so moist, so tender, so juicy and flavorful. This was when I realized that everyone I know sucks at making turkey, they just suck so hard.

Now my turkeys are just getting better every year. I decided on spatchcocking it every year now, as it cooks more evenly and a LOT quicker. I add herbs and spices, always trying new things. Next year make your own turkey and show your family how incompetent they really are...
One of my teachers in culinary school taught us 'ass up, breast down' for first half of cooking, then flip. Of course you could cook it ass up the whole time but I've found you get nice golden color all around from flipping it. My best turkeys have been made this way.
If they ate it and were just trying to tease you but just sucked at it whatever just show them recipes doing it that way. If they’re were being mean for nothing and refused to eat it I would comment on every single thing they cook at parties about how they’re doing it wrong even if it right you know like they did.
March back into that kitchen and reclaim it! 

No way in hell will they get out of doing these dishes!
If they have a problem with it, they can cook the next one—and do the dishes.
It’s salvageable. [here’s an article about cooking turkeys breast side down](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/holidays/thanksgiving-ideas/a26165/turkey-upside-down/)

The hard part is flipping a hot turkey over to crisp the breast skin at the end. If your family is all about the turkey being a showpiece, it makes sense they’re upset. But they should laugh it off and make it work
We always cook ours upside down to keep the moisture in the white meat!
Cooking it breast side down is how I keep my turkey from drying out without having to constantly baste it.
Breast down is actually the best method as it keeps it juicy
Your relatives are dummies, this is an actual way to cook birds that some people use.
I'm sorry you have to deal with that abuse. There's nothing wrong with the turkey, except that the bottom skin got crispy instead of the top.  

I also grew up with an abusive family. I now host all holidays. Sure it's more work, but if anyone wants to be abusive, I toss them out. It's amazing how much more peaceful holidays are now.
My mom always cooked it upside down.  "Looks bad, tastes great!"
Many people very deliberately cook it upside-down. This results in a moist and delicious turkey, because rather than just running out into the pan, all the juices run to the breast and stay in the turkey. 

I would tell them that *they* are doing the dishes, I am not doing them because I was cooking just fine before they freaked out and decided to throw out the results of my labor, either they can do the dishes or the dishes won't get done.

And I'd go out and have dinner elsewhere. If they can't be kind to me, they don't deserve my company.
OP accidentally discovered two important things: the best way to cook a turkey and also that their family sucks.

Pro tip: next time do it the same way, but turn it upside down again after it's cooked and roast that bird at 500F for like 8 minutes to crisp the skin.
Chef here, you are awesome and did nothing wrong.
tell, them the internet said they are the idiots and try the turkey before dumping on you.
Sounds like you should flip the bird ;)
I cook mine “upside down” on purpose. Have your family read these comments so they can learn how dense they are
What? When you cook it breast side down, the juices from the dark meat settle into the white meat, and it's less dry. It's definitely not 'ruined'. Has you family had too much eggnog?
Cooking the turkey upside down is NOT a fail. The juices run to the breasts and it's delicious. If you flip the turkey for the last hour or so the skin crisps. I think you did it perfectly!
Deliberately cooking a turkey upside down is actually a technique to help stop the turkey breast from drying out. 

I cook my turkey this way every thanksgiving.

It's not ruined.
The best way to cook turkey is breast side down until the end so that the fats sink into the white meat and keep it moist.  Then just before you take it out, flip it and broil it for a bit to brown the skin.  Even if you don't brown the skin this is going to give you the best, most juicy, breast meat.  You did it right, you just didn't get the chance to do the last step.
No biggie! Still edible. Wife and I on the other hand made our biscuits this morning with Baking Soda, not powder. Lol, we wondered why they were so bitter!
Some would argue that it's better to cook turkey this way. The breasts get cooked slower, and the dark meat gets overcooked, which makes it better imo

It's not ad pretty, but who cares?
You accidentally discovered a better way to cook turkey.
Done this before. Was actually a better turnout than other years.
Freeze your perfectly edible turkey and use it for casseroles, etc.  Ask your mom why she never taught you how to roast a turkey. She’s a terrible mother.
I did that once.  Was wondering what was wrong with it, splitting in half and looking weird, it freaked me out.  It tasted fine.

Thanks to this post I find out that people do it on purpose.
We've been doing this for years makes the breasts much juicier.

**edit** By we, i mean my wife.. i just follow directions lol
Honestly, you’re well within your right to refuse to do dishes.
Lol are they nuts? Don’t do the dishes they are over reacting! This should have been cause for a giggle and some ribbing not nuclear apocalypse!
Uhm.uhm...that doesn't produce quite as  visually impressive a result but it DOES give you a wonderfully tender, juicy breast with the dark meat fully cooked. 
I am all about the outcome and I think breast down (or spatchcocked) gives a tastier result than the traditional "breast up"
alot of people do it that way

ive heard it helps the dark meat cook faster so the breast doesn't dry out
I always cook breast side down and then flip at the last baste so the skin darkens up. Keep those breasts nice and juicy.
OMG I did this to a chicken in college. We all got high and we're excited to eat homemade roast chicken. We thought there wasn't much meat on it but it was delicious. Until someone turned it over!! The sound of awe and excitement was everything!! Round 2 munchies commenced!
Cooking Turkey breast side down produces juicier breast meat.  Mom and grandma don’t know Jack.

Bet it was delish!
How old are you? Do you live there? If not I would just take the "inedible" turkey with me since they've made it clear they aren't going to eat it and let them deal with dishes.
My grandma always did it upside down so the juices go into the breast meat. You didn’t ruin Christmas, but your family sure did. 💔
What the hell it’s not ruined it’s going to be absolutely delicious
Aren't you supposed to do it breast side down so it stays moist?
All turkeys were cooked upside down (ducks too) before TV in the 50's. It turns out the upside-down turkey didn't look as good on TV, so they flipped it.

Thats where the dry turkey constantly needing basting comes from. That is all.
Upside down is the future. Dinosaurs
Hi! You're currently experiencing why most people are choosing to spend Christmas, and most holidays, with the people they care about, instead of their families!

 Nobody who cares about you would ever do this, and you should remember it for next year!
I’d sit down to dinner and let them freak out themselves.
We cook ours breast down on purpose so it isn't dry 🙂
I normally cook breast side down for about an hour and then flip it. Tell them to chill the fuck out
I also did this the firs time I made a turkey. It still tasted delicious and all the more experienced cooks in my family cheer me up with their own stories of what they messed up when they were learning to cook. And I come from a family of great cooks.   


They all need to calm down. Do your best to tune them out while they try to "solve" this non-problem.
[https://www.marthastewart.com/1508319/why-you-should-cook-your-thanksgiving-turkey-upside-down](https://www.marthastewart.com/1508319/why-you-should-cook-your-thanksgiving-turkey-upside-down) Show them this!
Upside down is fine if not preferable. Just flip it for the last hour or two to brown it. Don't baste it even once though.
How exactly is it ruined?
Just flip it over and put it under the broiler to crisp up the skin
I do this every year and it’s the best!
Your family is being mean.
As has been said, your family can suck it. Breast down is perfectly valid. As long as it hit the right internal temperature there is no issue.
I'm sorry, but fuck them. This is the kind of attitude that shames people into never trying anything because they'll be "cast out" or criticized to death. It's not ruined, and I hope you try cooking another turkey at some point.
Please march back in the kitchen and frost the bottom of the cake!
Honestly, I always cook it upside down because it makes the breast juicier.
I like to cook meats fat side up so it drips down and moistens the leaner meat. You did it just right.
Your mom and grandma are BOTH wrong here. 

Cooking a turkey breast side down is how you get flavorful, not-dry breast meat. 

Cooking it breast side up means it's pretty, but inedible. 

My family has slow-roasted our turkeys for my entire life and breast side down is the RIGHT way to do it.
lol your family are idiots, i'm sorry
Breast side down results in jucier breasts. Your family was being very not nice.
When I used to do thanksgiving in the BOH at restaurants the ONLY way to cook the turkeys was breast side down.  Gravity works so the extra juice in the dark meat being higher up naturally bastes the turkey from inside as it cooks and drips down while the breast sits in the juices and stays naturally tender.  Your family doesn't honestly think someone in a restaurant is hand basting like 35 -40 turkeys roasting in multiple ovens do they?  This is the professional's way for sure!  I bet it was delicious!
Tell em it's Australian style
I intentionally cook breast side down and flip for the last 20 minutes to brown the skin.  Too dry otherwise.
What possible makes them think this Turkey is inedible?
Your mum and gran are wrong. 

There’s a school of thought that it’s much better to cook poultry upside down. The juices run downward into the breast and make it lovely and moist, (I’ve cooked chicken this way a few times).

Just turn it back over to serve, I can guarantee it will be delicious.
I cooked my first turkey this year and I cut all the corners I could cut. I buttered and seasoned the outside, barely made it through getting the neck and other stuff out, used an injected with butter and herbs in it as well as on the skin. I stuck it in an oven bag and as it wasn’t a big turkey it was done fast. All the tips I got were useless I just figured it out alone. Someone did suggest cooking it upside down so it would be moist but that’s where the oven bag came in I did it the other way in the oven bag with no stuffing and it was good. We all have a certain way to do things.
I only cook birds breast side down
It's more moist
Is it your house or theirs if it's your house put your foot down and tell them bitches to go sit the fuck down be fore they break a hip 

The turkey will be the most moist turkey their ass have ever tasted they can get the fuck over it 

If it's done go into the kitchen  and start cutting you off some to eat and when asked what your doing say not letting food go to waste because they are fucking stupid
Show them the Cooks Illustrated recipe (credible publication) that recommends doing just that, for the reasons posted by others here. You have literature precedent!!
Breast side down is recommended by Joy of Cooking. We have a V shaped rack just for that purpose
Breast side down is the correct way for a juicy flavorful turkey.
I roast mine this way every year.  Thirty minutes before it’s done I flip it so the breast can brown.  Breast meat is always juicy and tender.  You didn’t fu, you are just expanding your cooking horizons.
That’s the only way I cook it!! So moist and delicious!
I cooked
My first turkey upside down. People laughed, thanked me for cooking, then carved it and ate it. It was fine. 
Your family is being dramatic and unnecessarily cruel. It was your first time cooking a turkey and you worked hard to make a nice holiday dinner for them. Maybe they could have offered a helping hand at the beginning or invited you to learn in past years instead of expecting you to do it perfectly with no guidance.
Your family is a toxic bunch, and really incompetent to boot. Breast side down is the best way to cook a turkey so all the fat from the dark meat renders down throughout, and keeps the rest of the meat juicy. Tell them we all said they're a bunch of idiots.
Cooking it upside down causes the juices from the dark meat to "drain" into the breast and gives you a better tasting bird, but less pretty presentation. I'll take taste over presentation anytime.
Jesus, it sounds like you need to ban your family from Christmas. I bet your turkey was just fine! Who gives a shit if it got cooked “upside down.” I thought family was supposed to be supportive, geez. And it’s Christmas! Love? Joy? Spreading cheer???? 🙄🤦‍♀️
Upside down is the only way I cook turkeys. You get the fat and juices from the dark meat dripping down into the breast meat instead of being wasted in the pan. No offense, but your family have no idea how to cook a turkey. Congrats. You accidentally did it the best way.
I \*always\* do mine upside down, and get rave reviews.  Sure, it doesn't look as pretty, but there is NO beating how lovely it tastes!
Your mom and grandma are idiots.
You’re actually supposed to flip it halfway through anyways and a lot of people don’t know that which is why they have dry turkey. The fact that you were thrown out of the kitchen for cooking your turkey upside down tells me your family usually makes dry turkey.
You did cook. No dishes for you. If they don’t like it, most Chinese restaurants are open today
That’s the best way to cook a turkey. I bet everyone else will agree but they might not be honest.
You dodged a bullet. You don't want to have to cook for these people in the future
That's how I cook mine, take that entire delicious moist turkey home with you.
I thought that’s what you did on purpose to make the breast meat more juicy
I was in charge of the turkey this year for Thanksgiving. I had to run my boy to the ER (broke his arm playing with his sister) right before it was supposed to go in. My wife took over and when I got back, it was upside down. I about had a heart attack. BUT, my wife knew her stuff and that was one of the most tender turkeys I've ever had. IMO, you did your family a solid and they are missing out.
They're all idiots. Breast down is better anyways
They were looking for a reason to make sure you’re never asked to cook for the family again. Keep cooking that turkey upside down and enjoy how much more flavorful than bird will be!
My PROFESSIONAL chef of a husband cooks ours upside down and then right side up.
I always cook my turkey breast side down. The back fat goes down into the breast meat and keeps it moist.
Sounds like you hit on a good method! And if those people didn't want any, no prob--more for you and the guys! You are going to run into [redacted] people like this for the rest of your life. When you do, do what you did here--persevere with your plan, ignore them, and enjoy the fruits of your labors with the people who appreciate YOU.
Breast side down keeps the moisture in the breast meat, which usually dries out easily.

Your realtives freaking out were wrong. You did good!
My family cooks our turkeys upside down for years now because it makes the breast meat soo yummy and juicy! Not sure how it started, but one year my mom did it and then there was no going back.
The fat collects in the breast meat and makes it yummier. Nice job.
Many professional chefs cook the turkey this way! Doing this allows the juices to flow to the breast. Mom needs to chill.
I read a number of years ago to put the turkey upside down (breast side down) because it will make the breast meat more moist and tender.  So I do it that way on purpose!
My wife had always done it upside down to hold the juice in the breast.  Always comes out great. Let them ladies be hungry.  You and the fellas eat up! And hopefully they'll speak up and want yours again next year.
Always a sad moment when you realize the older people in your family are actually morons.
Been hosting turkey thanksgiving for years.  Turkeys are always cooked upside down.

People get but hurt because upside down sometimes causes the breast skin to peel, but it keeps the driest part of the turkey in its own juices.  The haters are operating on tradition which is often wrong.

Tradition is the corpse of wisdom.
Uh, that’s actually a legitimate professional cooking technique. The theory is it results in juicier white meat. 

How many chefs do you need to tell them this to make your point?
Next time immediately play it off as an innovative new way to cook it, like when everyone discovered the soaking a cheesecloth in butter and keep basting more juice onto the cloth while the turkey is covered
this is genuinely abusive as fuck. your family sounds awful and extremely wasteful. i am so sorry you are dealing with this, you didn’t fuck up, they did. don’t touch a single dish from those schmucks
My mom always does to make the breast meat juicy.
is the turkey not still edible?  fuck that noise
I always cook mine breast down.  It's lovely and moist that way.  But we place it on the table already carved and ready to eat.  It's only a big deal to your crazy relatives.
Hey man, im sorry, but your family sounds like a bunch of tools. Id love some of that turkey right now, screw em if they dont want it haha
I think they have more issues than a turkey being cooked upside down. Honestly i would have taken the food and just gone home. All the presents i grought too. These people are just selfish and ungreatful.
Your Turkey is fine, I worry about the toughness of the other old birds you’re talking about.
I just did this on Thanksgiving and it was fine
We cook ours half the time breast side up then flip it, baste and cook breast side down for the other half of the time
Makes for moist breast meat.  Have someone help you turn it over and let the skin cook under the broiler for a bit and it will be just fine!
many cook it that way on purpose. it cooks more evenly and the white meat is more tender.  The breast meat is protected from direct heat, so it doesn't get overcooked.
Um I intentionally cook it upside down to maintain a moist breast. Then I flip it over 3/4 of the way through and uncover it to crisp up the skin. It's just another way of doing it.
If it’s your house give them the boot
I thought you were SUPPOSED to cook a turkey breast down so that the juices made the breast meat moist because it's prone to being dry. Tell them to naff off.
Like many, at family gatherings you are surrounded by idiots. Ignore them. 
Happy Holidays!
I just served the best turkey I've ever cooked -- 325° at the appropriate time for weight, face down, liberally sprinkled with sage, and a whole stick of butter distributed between the cavity and under the skin above the wings. Wonderfully moist and flavorful, and it might even have been a little overcooked, since the internal temperature was over 185° when I took it out (let it rest about 30 minutes).

Note: This was an eatin' turkey, not a lookin' turkey -- I don't much care about having a crisp skin for a Norman Rockwell photo-op.
Flip it and hit the broiler at the end... Should crisp up.
Your family can't cook for shit.

I always start cooking my turkeys breast side down, then flip it halfway through.  Helps keep the breast moister, and flipping it makes the skin crisp on the breast.  I usually cook mine Cajun style though and stuff it with peppers, onions, and celery so moistness is generally not a problem.

Either way, total dick move on your family's part and I would never cook for them again after that kind of treatment.
It is not ruined, that's a legit way to cook a turkey, keeps breast from drying out.  Absolutely delicious, just not pretty.

Flip the bird (ha) breast side up, baste with some melted butter and place in really hot oven to brown and crisp the skin up some.

I am guessing they might not be quite the experts they think they are if they thought it unsafe if at proper temps for breast and thigh
Have them google it. Cooking a turkey upside down makes the breast meat juicier and allows to the dark meat to cook quicker (which also makes the breast meat more tender). It may not look like the standard photo, but the turkey actually tastes better (unless they are into dry breast meat).
Wtf😁 if it's cooked it's cooked, who cares in what position? If they freak out, just tell them they should have teached you better😁
I always cook my turkey breast side down, flip it for the last 45 min or so, and it's always perfect. This method keeps the white meat nice and juicy/moist.

Your family are being jerks. They need to chill, it's Christmas.
LOL.  Well that worked out well then.
I cook mine breast down for a majority of the cook time .  Turn it over with about 2 hours left to baste it a little, then turn the broiler on last to make the skin crispy
I'd go in there and flip it over in front of them.. They sound mean. If you cooked a turkey for the first time by yourself & didn't burn it, I would call that a success
Honestly could prob fix it by sticking it under the grill after flipping it for a few mins to crisp up the skin. Tell ‘em to shove it with the dishes. You cooked a perfectly edible turkey. They’re just stuck in “conventional” land despite roasting a turkey (or any fowl) upside down being a better way to cook them.
Always start the chicken meats upside down ! That way it doesn’t dry out. I finish them in the other side to brown the top.
So you didn’t fuckup and your family doesn’t really know how to cook.
Let them google "cooking a turkey upside down" and then tell them all they can go fuck themselves
My family cooks our turkey upside down every year as we found the white meat is moister when we do that, definitely not a fuck up and way overreaction on their part.
That’s a tried and true technique for keeping the best moist, it gets all juicy in the chicken juices. Then you turn it right side up to crisp up the skin at the last like 15-20 minutes. Look it up and show them proof that this is not ruined, it’s actually probably better
I prefer to cook it that way. It cooks more evenly as the breasts need less time so keeping them down helps keep them moist. If possible, I’ll flip it toward the end to try and get a little crispy skin on the breasts.
It’s not wrong. It’s totally fine and I’m sure it will be delicious.
I ALWAYS cook a turkey breast down. You get tons more crunchy delicious skin and the breast meat is cooked in its juices the WHOLE time and is never dry. Your people are hysterical idiots. Just wait until they hear about spatchcocking. Their heads will explode.
I would kick mom and grandma out and enjoy my perfectly moist wonderful turkey, and tell them they can find somewhere else to go next Christmas. Fuck em.
You're being told you fucked up, but you haven't. Don't worry about it.
No you did not. That was perfectly fine. If it cooked to 165F you were fine. 

I would eat your turkey and screw 'em. They can fend for themselves if they don't want it. 

If you are not at your  own house, I would take my turkey (pot and all) and leave.
What? I cook my bird upside down, the lack of "Crispy skin" on the breast is checked and destroyed by the sheer moistness of the breast.  

Fuck em, sit back, eat your bird and tell them to get McDonalds instead
I brown my turkey on a higher heat for 20 mins or so, then turn it upside down to bake. Everyone always races about how juicy it is, and it's done slightly faster this way.

Your family might have an antiquated view of things or they just might be cruel. You can bake my turkey anytime
It’s sometimes recommended to do that in some cook books.  It’s supposed to keep the white meat moister.  I’ve never tried it, I steam mine so not a problem with drying out.
I accidentally cooked the turkey like this one year in an electric turkey roaster. Turned out to be the juiciest turkey ever. Let them hate all they want, but this is not a true FU. We now cook the turkey upside down every time.
Next year do a full deconstruction and cook the white meat separately from the dark
Your family are nuts. Cooking a turkey upside makes all the meat moist and spreads all the flavour from the fat through the bird. 

The only downside is it's not the pretty picture perfect Hallmark card bird. The breast side skin also doesn't get super crispy. 

But the bird is not ruined. It will taste great.
Your fine OP, Sounds like your family learned to cook through tradition instead of from someone who actually knows how to cook
I cook my turkeys breast side down on purpose as well, it turns out juicier and doesn't dry out. You didn't FU anything at all. Even Martha Stewart has articles out there about "flipping the bird."
One year my dad offered to cook the turkey.  He cooked it fine, but he didn't know how to position the wings. When he brought it to the table we all discovered at the same time that he had tied the wings back behind the back like it was being arrested. We still laugh about it.
That's funny as fuck, and should be a GREAT story. Sorry your people are bent out of shape .. it's a TURKEY, there are other things to eat, and it's probably fine.

I'd make it a new tradition to always cook it upside down from here on out.

I spatchcocked and smoked my turkey for Thanksgiving, my people can deal with the idiosyncrasies... it was delicious.
I find a combo works best, upside down and then right side up. But let's be honest, flipping a bird is easy to type, but it's harder than it looks. Enjoy the turkey. Enjoy the knowledge that if you put something in a hot box, eventually it's safe to eat.
Your mom and grandma are fucking morons. Cooking a turkey upside down is actually better as it keeps the turkey from drying out as easy.
Forgetting to remove the bag of inners is a problem…upside down is not!
Try flipping them the bird.
This is such a weird thing for your family to get this pissed off over. My mom did that on accident a few years ago and we just thought it was funny because it looked ridiculous when she took it out. But cooking it upside down also made the bread meat super tender and juicy.

You really didn't fuck up and the turkey most likely isn't ruined, you just have assholes for family.
Lots of people cook it that way on purpose. It makes the meat more moist.
Best turkey I've had was up side down.
A couple years ago I cooked a turkey and when it was done and came out I kept saying to my Husband it looks funny (I get fibro fog a lot) . Well he pointed out it was upside down from what he was used to and thought I had a secret recipe. It tasted the same as usual. We still joke about it. 

Ignore anyone who's harping on it. Your nor incompetent you're just cooking it the 2023 way!!! Happy Holidays.
Old people are stuck in their tradition.

Upside down makes the breast meat (usually the driest) lay in the moisture throughout the cooking process.
How else does one  cook turkey in Australia?
Lol you've probably got more issues than a turkey that isn't cooked the way some old birds wanted. And by this I mean therapist issues, I suggest focusing on being the child of emotionally immature parents.
It's a gourmet method. They're just stuck in older ways.

Most people cook it breast side up. But it's way better to cook it breast side down because ot makes the breast tender snd juicy. If that's the way you did it  well done!
They're freaking out coz they'll have to sit upside down to eat the turkey, and that's just inconvenient. Have you ever sat around a table upside down? It's messy, and sometimes the juices dribble up into your nose.
OP, you're totally fine. Tons of people cook it like on purpose. My MIL does it that way every year.
I always cook it breasts side down for over twenty years. Never had complaints and turkey is always gone in a few days. Traditional method is obsolete. 

Show the relics these posts to shut them up
I'm not sure I could stand being around these people. They would irritate the hell out of me.

As a lot of people have pointed out, this is actually one of the best ways to cook the turkey to ensure the breast doesn't dry out.

But, honestly to think your family thinks you ruined Christmas by cooking the turkey in a slightly different fashion without even trying it... Omg... People should try to be more open minded and receptive to new ideas. You might have unintentionally saved Christmas! Congratulations open on the happy accident.
When I did that I said darn I bought a dark meat turkey. And lived with that gloom until 2 days later when I flipped it and found the breast.
they *could be* grateful that you cooked for them, and that it’s still gonna taste good. 

don’t let this one thing ruin your day. stay strong and enjoy it :)
I cook all my chickens and turkeys breast side down. It isn't as "pretty" with the golden brown breast, but it is usually more moist this way.

Added bonus is if you brine the bird before hand. Even better!
You should always cook upside down. Your family are ridiculous
Your family sounds like a bunch of shitty people
This is exactly how you get a moist turkey breast as the fat is on the back and in the thighs. I always cook it like this then turn it breast side up for 10 min at the end. Reclaim your rightful place as a top cook and tell them we all said YOU did it the right way. 
Honestly some people.
That is the only way I’ll cook my turkey. It’s truly a game changer in regards to flavor and keeping the breasts moist(for lack of a better word)!
FFS. I cooked a chicken upside down once by accident and everyone congratulated on me on how juicy and tender it was. 

It may well have turned out even better then usual. Ruined, it certainly would not have been.
to cook a turkey, evenly, you're supposed to start it upside down.  Just throw the turkey in the front yard, and leave.
It's a great way to help the breast meat stay moist. No worries here.
Kick your family out the kitchen and eat the turkey all alone.
I just hope we got to you in time. You did nothing wrong, you actually did something very right. Don't let them gaslight you, make them eat the bird
If you want moist breast, flip it upside down! It doesn't have that big chesty brown finish, but at least the white meat isn't inedible sawdust!
Not only does it mean the breast meat is juicier I think you could argue with them that the birds technically the right way up!
I accidentally did this once! It came out super juicy and delicious! Your family were definitely way too harsh about it, don’t beat yourself up.
That breast will be delicious and very moist, you just need to turn it over and brown it under the broiler for a couple of minutes.

It has been my experience that less intelligent people really can not handle anything done in a manner outside their usual procedure.  You will never change or convince them, regardless of how good the turkey is. From now on, keep as much distance as possible, and never volunteer for important jobs.  If they want to be hypercritical and controlling, then they get to everything - their own way.
Sounds like your family has some other emotional issues they need to work out. I am sorry that they made you feel bad for something that is definitely not a big deal!! You should go in the kitchen and finish your cake anyways and tell them that they should consider seeing a therapist
Upside down and in a cooking bag is the best way. Otherwise the breast meat is dry..
Actually, that is the best way to roast one! Look it up! :D
Happens, bet that us the juiciest best they will ever eat. It's still fine to eat.
Many restaurants cook their breast down. I’ve been cooking a very long time & many many times I’ve on purpose cooked breast down especially if I knew there was sandwiches from leftovers
Can you leave? Even if you had ruined it--which you didn't--them saying you're incompetent and whatnot is not okay.
Don't let your family gaslight you, or react to their stupid pointless hissy fit. You are on your way to bigger and brighter things.
700 comments turkey cooked upside down
smile doll divide worthless alive bright somber insurance attempt modern
When I decide to cook a turkey .it lays on a side for an hour then I add stuff to ' prop up ' on spine then I add a can of beer  poured inside for moisture .
It’s better to cook it breast side down. The driest turkeys I have ever had were done the “traditional” breast side up. With it upside down, the natural juices flow down into the breast making the breast meat more juicy.
You are not incompetent and you cooked a whole turkey and did a good job. You rock and I’m sorry they’re being jerks. 

Ignore those haters.
That’s a “secret” to moist and delicious white meat. Chill fam. Geez.
Actually, cooking the turkey breast down makes it more moist, and you just need to flip it to crisp the skin. 

It’s a real thing, hubby and I found out about years ago. That’s how we do ours.
There are so many ways to cook a turkey, you can't really ruin it unless its raw (just cook it for longer) or if you turned it into charcoal. But hey, congrats on accidentally making juicy turkey breasts
Eat the turkey yourself, fuck the dishes, and your family lol
Just tell them that’s how they do it in Australia.
If you think that's bad, try bringing a spatchcock.
IMO it's the better way all around but some people want that "traditional look" that leaves the bird unevenly cooked and often dried out. Spatchcock fixes both.
All you needed to do was put the turkey breast side up under the broiler for 10 mins, that skin would dry up and the turkey would still be moist....
Breast down is actually the right way if you want moist meat.
Upside down is the best way to do it. My mom used to cook turkeys like that when I was a kid and they turned out so good and juicy.
Umm, this is a way to actually cook a turkey… you might not get as crispy & roasted skin on the breast side, but you’ll get more tender & juicy breast meat!
I would take myself out for something else and say f them. You didn’t f****g ruin the damn turkey. This pisses me off so much. Tell them to get a grip.
I'm SO sorry. I don't know what's wrong with your family. Take your beautifully cooked bird home and enjoy the leftovers in 11 different ways!
Are they stupid or was there something else wrong with it? Cause just cooking it "upside down" is just... Really not even worth fussing over.
They're fucking stupid. There's a reason the meat on the back of the bird is the best. Is spends the whole time cooking in own juices. The only thing that is ruined is the look of the bird by cooking it breast side down. It should taste amazing. They're being dramaqueens because the table isn't going to look good for pictures.
Excellent way to do it !
Hi, designated holiday family cook for both sides here 🙋🏻‍♀️  

The way you cooked the Turkey, upside down, is the way most good cooks recommend. It keeps the thighs and breast juicy. 

You should be in charge of the Turkey from now on since you’re the only one in your family who seems to know what they are doing.
Sounds like your mom and grandma wanted Turkey jerky.
Upside down is better. Ass juice from the dark meat marinated it. All those upset people can just piss off. If you over cooked it however you dun goofed
You’re no idiot. You just cooked a good turkey!! My dad did this for the first time last year and will do it like that for now on!!
Leave it in the oven, once the time is done enjoy the moistest turkey of your life. Chin up. You just accidentally discovered the secret for perfect turkey
Just tell them you’ll take Martha Stewart’s advice over theirs, thanks.

https://www.marthastewart.com/1164831/upside-down-turkey
They can make fun of you all they want… While they eat your delicious bird!!
Your family is full of unrepentant shitheads. I would leave.
Lots of people do this on purpose. Enjoy your turkey.
Damn, I feel ya, my family sucks too.
I would take the turkey and leave
I know I'm coming into this late but tell your family they don't know what they're talking about. You can totally cook a turkey like that. In fact there are people that do it like that on purpose. They need to chill out and just enjoy it and appreciate that you made it.
I cooked my family’s turkey upside down last year, and only realized after people were going back for seconds and I figured out why the wings were at the top.

The white meat was way better that way though.
There are tons of recipes cooking it upside down. It keeps the breast juicier. You did great.
Horseshit obnoxious family behavior.
Wonder how they'd act if you made a pineapple upside down cake, right side up.  OH. THE. HUMANITY!
Titties down is arguably the more correct way to cook a turkey if you want a moist flavorful turkey. Titties up is more aesthetic but drier and less tasty.
(Qualifications - culinary school grad)
I love listening to music.
Seriously? Your mom and gramma are dumb and wrong. Breast side down makes for a less dry turkey
Ignore the old fuddy-duddies. All the juices flow down into the breast that way and keep it moist and delicious. You did exactly right.

Unless you don’t want to cook again. If that was your aim, you’re screwed. You’re gonna have to make the turkey every year.
Yes. Honestly thinking about it, the fat from the bottom will naturally baste the white breast meat. That may be the best way to cook a turkey. People are mean
They are the ones who are unable to cook - you should cook Turkey and chicken with the breast down to prevent dryness. You did this right
Emm... TITW,  Today I totally Won.

They don't want you in the kitchen for major holidays any more, which means now YOU don't have to spend hours planning, buying, prepping, and cooking.
I cooked my turkey breast upside down. I had a stupid amount of compound butter shoved under the skin, and it kept falling out, so I just figured I'd cook it upside down until the butter melted. It turned out pretty good if I do say so myself.
Cooking it upside-down is the way to go!!! It keeps the breast meat moist and juice and doesn't give it that paper texture while chewing. Turkey that looks "bad" but tastes delicious is better than those hallmark movie turkeys that need to be smothered in gravey to be edible.
WTF.  You’re supposed to cook it breast side down.  Dark meat takes the longest.  You pulled a Homer, not a fuck up
A lady that I work with (who raises her own turkeys) swears by cooking them upside down. She says it keeps the breast from getting dry. You did just fine!
Actually cooking the turkey like that keeps the breast meat from drying out.  It's a well-known tip.  You are supposed to flip it over for the last hour or so, but that's not necessary.
I used to cook all my turkeys upsidedown. It actually helps the breast meat to stay moist. You just don't get the crispy skin, and the dry ass meat! You did perfectly fine. Your family are the idiots!
OP no disrespect but your family are all fucking amateur losers!! Cooking the turkey upside down is well known as the best way to get a turkey that’s still moist. Tell them to go fuck themselves.
The only thing you should do is turn it right side up and cook uncovered to brown it.  Your breast meat should be really juicy now!  I've made them upside down before.
You always have to flip the bird!
One of the major cooking magazines did some research a few years ago and found that cooking a turkey breast side down produced the most moist meat. You did a great job!
What? It’s not ruined in any way. I cooked mine upside down once by accident, and it was so good that do it that way on purpose now.

Will you get the Norman Rockwell photo of a whole browned bird on a platter at the table? No. Do you need that? Absolutely not. Flip it over, carve it, and enjoy turkey with a breast that isn’t dried out and flavorless.

I’m sorry your family are being such asses.
So they left you to it without instruction then went batshit when you didn’t do it how they wanted you to? Nice
Man you should have spatchcocked it and completely broke their brains.
Found out yesterday that cooking it upside down keeps breast meat moist. Happy accident! They suck for not even checking it.
nta. i've been cooking mine breast side down for years. you lose the crispy skin in exchange for some delicious, self-basted meat.
You have a shit family.
I did that accidentally one year. I didn't say anything, just served everyone their plates of Christmas dinner as usual and **nobody**. **noticed** 


The turkey is fine. Your relatives are not. Life is hard for anyone who lives at that level of petty pain in the arse!
You're SUPPOSED TO cook it upside down til the end your family can't cook apparently lmao
How rude of “the ladies.” They missed out because it was more important to them to be judgmental and mean.   I accidentally did that with a chicken once. No big deal.
Your family doesn’t know what they’re talking about. Cooking a turkey breast down makes for some flavorful, moist white meat.
Do they believe in trickle down economics as well?
If anything it makes it more moist because it cooks in the juices/gravy you didn’t ruin anything they are being overly dramatic tell them to kick rocks
Seriously, the only way I have ever cooked a turkey. It comes out so good!
Same I find it keeps the breast moist to cook it upside down. I did it on accident one year and haven't switched back since.
Exactly, this is my favorite method. Super moist… not great looking, but who cares. They’ll stop complaining once you start slicing up the breast meat.
This!! I do this every year and then carefully rotate it the last half an hour to crisp the skin!!!
You mean right side up?
I do my breast side down until the last hour then flip it to crisp the skin. Comes out moist and delicious every time!
This was all I was thinking. I cook chicken upside down and it’s a game changer.
Wow. OP’s story vs your story is an incredibly clear and concise depiction of unhealthy vs healthy family dynamics: 
 
“You always ruin everything and we can never trust you again” vs 
  
“We’ll call it an Australian turkey lol! Tastes great!”
Breast side down is a great way to cook it! It makes the breast meat more juicy.
> Australian Turkey

Okay, your parents are hilarious, and I'm stealing this if I ever have a need to cook a turkey.
Aw, Australian turkey. That’s so cute.
> Australian Turkey

Love this name for it!
I accidentially did it upside down this Christmas too and it was a hit. People who are typically more picky about their turkeys liked my upside down turkey this year. I had no idea until my SO started carving it who couldn't carve it figured out that I was upside down. We served it cut up and on a plate and everyone loved it including my children.
I love that! Australian turkey? Perfection! I'm definitely using that.
Lol I once mixed up some measurements on a Boston Crème Pie and added like a whole extra cup of vegetable oil and we called it a Houston Crème Pie bc you could blot the oil out of it with a paper towel it was just seeping. Understandably it wasn’t edible but no one yelled at me regardless and we at least saw it through to see if it was. It was hilarious and we have been laughing about it for like a decade. OPs family sucks.
Was about to say this as well. I've definitely read a few methods that suggest this.
Former professional executive chef, now only a home chef. If you are after crispy breast skin you might find it challenging, but as said above, cooking breast side down is a well known (in professional circles) technique. Tell them the proof is in the eating and to close their yappers until it is time to insert turkey.


UTA: I find most turkey skin disappointing, unlike chicken skin, but as many have suggested, rotating the turkey during cooking can still yield crispy skin.
We purposefully bake the turkey with the breast on the bottom of the roaster so it's moist and juicy, not dry and gross.  You did them a favor, they are just too crappy to see it.  Hopefully, they notice how good it is!
Yeah I've tried it this way. You're supposed to flip it the last hour so the skin gets crispy. It's a pain in the ass, so I don't do it this way, but that breast meat was 10/10
My mom did it intentionally for years.  Great turkey dinners resulted.
I do this every year and sometimes flip it to brown the breast but usually not, best turkeys I've ever eaten because the breast meat is juicy and tender.
Yeah, this was a big deal a while back. Martha Stewart has done it.
For real! We all have funny holiday meal stories of someone leaving a bag of giblets inside or oven doors shattering.  They are supposed to be laughed off.  Her family should’ve enjoyed their Australian style turkey and thanked OP for the privilege.
If they think it’s ruined, what are they doing with it?
And don't want to do the dishes so they're making a fuss to get out of it.

I bet if OP took the turkey and shared with no one, they'd change their tune. Suddenly it would be edible.
We don’t roast it breast down, but it’s always been my family’s practice (going back to my great-grandmother) to flip the turkey when it comes out of the oven for the reason others have cited. You’re not the ruiner at all.
I would have thought it would have been the other way around. I wouldn't care. I'd still eat it, nothing some gravy can't fix.

If it was less dry than we'll I would have found a new way to cook turkeys.
They're asshole *and* they don't know shit about cooking.
Abusive. That's the word I was searching for.
Yes came here to say the same. OP’s family is toxic af and also being ‘completely incompetent’ I would say I couldn’t do the dishes as an incompetent person
Yep. Cook breast side down until the thickest part of the breast reaches 130°F, then flip and crank the heat to 400°F and continue cooking until the breast reaches 160°F. Take out and rest for 30 min. Your light meat should be a perfect 135°F, dark meat 180°F, and skin a crispy brown.
>AND A BIRD CAN BE COOKED MULTIPLE WAYS

>your family has been cooking under a rock.

Truly it seems a bird can be cooked multiple ways. I haven't heard of that one.
>A BIRD CAN BE COOKED MULTIPLE WAYS

Yeeeep... I've been spatchcocking my turkeys the last few years and won't go back to cooking a whole bird again if I can help it. I'd hate to see OP's family's reaction to that one.
Ironically cooking a bird under a rock (brick) is also completely valid. 

This family sucks ass
Man I hope OP is angrily reading all these responses to their family, because fuck em
I just flip it at the end and slap on broil to make it prettier.
We did the same thing this year ! With the same result. It was delicious. Will be cooking breast side down from now on !
Right? What the fuck do they think is gonna make it inedible?
#ABSOLUTELY FUCKING DO NOT DO THE DISHES OP. JESUS CHRIST
Headline: Op cooks great bird for a bunch of turkeys.
I had a vision of next year, where OP cooks his turkey in the newly discovered way and serves Oscar Meyer sliced turkey to the rest of his ungrateful, overreacting family. 

Enjoy that juicy breast meat OP! Makes great soup btw.
Seriously, even if it did get a little messed up or wasn't as unpresentable, it should be thought that counts. They spent hours cooking for family, put a ton of work into it and the people receiving it should always be grateful.

In my family, even if the turkey comes out a little dry, everyone says thank you. There's usually so many side dishes that people who don't even like turkey can have their fill with mashed potatoes or mac cheese, or stuffing.
Yeah this is the REALLY insane part. Really puts the cherry on top of the whole toxic cake
Yeah, good luck with that.
More like get a new family. OP's is ruined
Interesting, so juicy, but still crispy skin? Sounds like a tad bit more work, but maybe worth it!
“They suck for not knowing something so obvious”

💯!!!
And she didn’t keep making it that way?
It’s meat, it’s in a hot area. You have to try REALLY hard to fuck it up unless you overcook it.

Doesn’t matter if it’s at 275 or 390. Watch the temp.

Side note: I think I just fucked up a prime rib by letting it go to 140 when I was going to pull it at 125…
Op please choose chaos and show them this thread.
I’m trying that next year! It was the best turkey I’ve ever had and next year I’ll have my own apartment so no one can stop me 😂
It really was the best turkey I ever had in my life 😂
They wanted to throw the turkey out but my dad swooped in and stopped them. The guys and I ate it while the women in the family sat and stewed because they can’t stand being wrong
This was the best turkey I have ever had! I brined it for a day but I might try longer next time! Thanks for the tips!!
They didn’t eat anything I made today. In my opinion I’m one of the best cooks in the family because I actually season my food and I don’t overcook everything 😂
It was definitely the juiciest turkey I’ve ever had!
Can't believe I had to scroll so far to see this most excellent comment

(...and definitely not the turkey, OP. Flip to your whole dang family)
This
I guess OPs family like overcooking til its dry and burnt. They probably think juicy is undercooked (obviously in some cases, yes, but they don't know about cooking til the internal temperature is just right)
Cooking it breast side down just helps keep the breast meat extra moist, it doesn't in anyway ruin the turkey. Sounds like some people are way too picky.
I've never cooked one upside down, but I don't know why it would be a big deal to anyone. 

I've got mine about to finish breast-up on the Treager right now. You can't fail with the Traeger, they always come out juicy and perfect.
I'm on the fence about the dark meat flavor getting into the white meat. 

I tried splatchcocking a whole chicken and see some promise in this method over upside down birding. Each of the meats retains their normal flavor and don't dry out. 

But the presentation isn't 'traditional' so if that's your priority skip the above.
It's "by accident", not "on accident".
Judging by how he described their reaction, they won't. I have half a family like that that would rather eat pretty cardboard.
I don't understand the fixation on presenting the bird whole and carving it at the table. A beautifully cooked bird that's been cut and presented on a nice serving platter seems like the superior way, to me.
I love flip the bird time!
🤣
With a side of .. “ but don’t worry we’ll still trust you to do the job that no one else wants“
Yeah, Reddit does nothing but make me incredibly glad I have the family that I do. The only edition would be that my family would then ruthlessly tease me about it for the rest of the year as they were eating it and Australian turkey would then become the new tradition. There would be horrific Australian accents and my father would by the gods carve it while quoting Crocodile Dundee
I mean there's ways to mess up the turkey but cooking it upside down is not one of them.
Yea.

A normal family would just say "oh I have always done it the other way, looks great tho"

And asshole family does what OPs did.
Yep. Cooking upside down protects the breast meat from over cooking.
How big *is* an emu anyways?
I was taught that you flip it halfway through. It's definitely a thing. I've been called on as the "big strong man" to flip the heavy turkey a few times.
I usually do it upside down and then flip it over for the last half hour to crisp the skin.
*America's Test Kitchen* has a section about cooking the turkey in their *Best Recipe* cookbook. They explain the science of the brine (which is fascinating) and recommend roasting 45 minutes breast down, 15 minutes on each side, and finish breast up to brown the breast. Beautiful, juicy, and delicious every time!
This is how my mother has done it since the 80's, and I as well. Dave Maynard's Bottoms Up Turkey.
I love it crispy chicken skin. But I feel like turkey. skin is almost always disappointing.
Me too. I flip it for the last little bit.
Never tried pit pig?
Chicken under a brick is a thing. A heated rock would do the same thing. In ll the years that humans have eaten birds I'd bet a huge number of them have been in pits with rocks on top to retain heat.
I've cooked chicken in the oven with an opened can of beer shoved up it's ass and it tastes amazing. It makes the chicken really moist and you can season the outside with whatever you want.
It takes about the same amount of time to cook a spatchcocked turkey as to cook a frozen pie, around 70 minutes. I've been doing that for years now.
Team spatchcock! Our 16lb turkey cooked in about 2- 2 1/2 hours and was super juicy and tasty!
To be sure, it looks a bit like it got run over... but it's the best way, especially if dry brined the day before. I'll  never go back either. You can even cook it in a closed BBQ grill that way.
Agreed! My upside down turkey is getting great reviews from my family and friend as we speak!
I told her to fry one next year. I fry 8-10 turkeys on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years for customers and would just bring one to any holiday gathering I'd be invited to so as to not show up empty handed. The cattiness it caused was the stuff of legend! One gf's aunt called her out the blue and picked a fight, then told her she's not welcome  next year (so we went to my folks). Another's granny left it in the kitchen cause "There wasn't any room". Both cases saw my turkey stripped to the carcass and the baked bird untouched. It took a few more instances like this to realize the truth. I was naively stepping on some well established toes and Big Mama DIDN'T PLAY THAT! But revenge is a dish best served FRIED!
Probably not worth messing with grandma's traditional way of doing Christmas. So many people make bad food with good memories, and they'll take the memories over the food any day.

It took 7 years for my FIL decided that cranberry sauce with fresh orange and Grand Marnier was better than the canned stuff. 7 years!
It won't look like that one picture of Christmas. Christmas is fucking ruined.
Tbh, I once fucked up a dish on Christmas to the point that it was almost inedible. My parents aren't the type to light things up with a joke, so people just set it aside on their plates and ate the rest of the dishes.
To some people there is exactly one way to do everything. It's too hard to hold any more than that in their garbage brains.
"Sorry, we are closed"

"You *ruined* Christmas!"
Yes! It’s from America’s Test Kitchen. Cook breast down for an hour at 425. Flip the bird and cook the remaining amount of time at 325. Usually 1-2.5 hours longer. The skin is rubbed with butter so is crisp. Ours isn’t always completely golden brown but it’s close. The hardest part is flipping. A 12-14 pound turkey is way easier than a 20 pounder. It’s a two person job for me, one to flip the other to hold the pan.
There are better ways; spatchcocking (splitting it) is one. Flipping a hot turkey is tricky and can end in disaster.
Have another eggnog why don'tchya!! 🤣 Merry Christmas!
I hope the males in your family who ate it with you raved about how it was the best turkey they ever had to your mom and grandmother.
I'm sorry about your toxic family members :(
Jesus Christ OP your family's insane please escape
This is abusive behavior and should not be tolerated.
I don’t know your age or anything, but you come across as a young adult whose family is trying to clip your wings. And it sounds like what I went through. Other than my late grandmother, no one in my family could cook until my sister and I just refused to learn from our mom and figured out how to cook on our own. Now, in our 40s, we eat well, and we just had the best thanksgiving and Christmas meals ever because we took over the food this year and told mom she’s retired. Find yourself someone who likes your cooking, and suddenly it won’t matter in the slightest what your family thinks anymore.
...oh, i get it now. They're *jealous.*

Edit: formatting tag
You can come and cook for me anytime!
I've been around people that think if there's any moisture at all in a piece of chicken or turkey they are going to die of food poisoning. 

I was actually once written up for serving juicy chicken. I still have that somewhere. I refused to sign it until I got a copy of it.  This was the food and beverage director that wrote me up, he should have known better.
>They probably think juicy is undercooked

And this is the reason I was in college before i knew chicken was supposed to be moist when you ate it!  Mom cooked everything to a close to black as she could get it ave let it do be edible to the most minimal degree. 

Sadly, hubs and I have figured out I still prefer my pork chops cooked to death. Lol.
My mother cooks our turkeys until the Breasts are around 190 degrees, and the legs (My favorite part) are over 200 and turned to Jerky. So you're absolutely right about that. Some adults just like their meats nearly cremated.
Yep that’s it. There are only two options that exist. 

1. Cook turkey upside down.
2. Overcook turkey until it’s dry and burnt.
just today i was like wow the turkey is really nice and juicy and my mother was like "WHAT!? IS IT UNDERCOOKED!?"it was not
We do this with the chicken. We turn it over the last 15 minutes or so to still have a crisp skin, but it is sooo much better to keep the meat moist
Spatchcocking (isn’t that an awful word?!) is the very best way to cook a chicken or a turkey. Keeps it moist and the cooking time is cut almost in half. Remove the backbone (harder to do on a turkey), flatten the dark meat around to the front and you’re ready to go. Google instructions and see exactly how to do it!
Aside from being ‘non-traditional’, I think the only downside is that you can’t stuff it. But you get juicer meat, more uniform skin, it’s easier to season, it’s easier to carve and portion, and it cooks in literally *half* the time(!), all of which are **considerable** upsides for the sake of an extra minute of prep. I almost always spatchcock now.
It also makes the white meat have a more pink texture which some people get weird about.
What? 
The dark meat doesn’t leach into the white.
All the Chefs in Food network have changed my mind about dark meat. It cooks better, doesn’t dry out as easily, has more flavor. So I’ve been adding thighs which they all recommend. And less expensive
Do people really do the whole bird, slice it on the table presentation shtick? I always slice in the kitchen with space, the ability to make a bit of a mess, and less pressure than everyone watching.
yes. they just want to complain and feel superior to a younger person.
That's how my family's been. Whether it be ham or turkey, we huddle around the kitchen for the carving while we're busy chatting and then move to the table with a platter of cuts. Makes more room for other stuff on the table too.
You’re gonna carve the turkey with that? Thats not a knife. Thats a knife!
That's not a turkey.  THIS is a turkey
And some of the fat from the dark will render down into it
I imagine flipping at the end and cranking the heat for like 10 min would achieve the nice crispy skin? I’ve never cooked a turkey though.
We start ours breast down, turn to one side after 45 minutes. Turn to the other side after 15 minutes. On its back to brown the breast another 30 or so. Perfect and juicy every time!
But what do you use turn an 18 lb turkey? I'm sure mine would end up on the floor.
On any given turkey most of the skin is a disappointment, but there are parts that are not.
My mom does this as well.   

I was thinking that maybe the OP’s family likes dry turkey…
Or beggars chicken
I cooked a turkey in a hole, once. Piled some coals on the bottom, put the bird in a Dutch oven, piled more coals on top. It came out pretty good.
Absolutely. Flat turkey cooks so much faster and more consistently than round turkey. Sounds like you've got your oven timing dialed in, comparing it to the frozen pies. That's such a tricky part of coordinating those holiday meals!
OP should take their delicious turkey and go elsewhere

No need to put up with that sort of shit 

The other fuckers can wait to eat at 11pm cause they bought a frozen turkey at 2pm.
My ex husband yelled at me and ripped a shovel out of my hands because I “was shoveling dirt the wrong way”. I was removing an old flower bed, dirt was making its way into the cart. I went inside without a word, he came storming in yelling that I was using his treatment as an excuse to be lazy. Sometimes I miss him and then I remember how much smoother and peaceful life is now
> The hardest part is flipping

I'd bet. I read the first part and was like, how do you do the second part. lol.
There you go.

Look at your family and flip the bird.
Future tip: when cooking turkey for a big group, cook 2 smaller turkeys instead of one huge one. They cook faster and you have twice the wings/legs/neck for those who want them.
I spatchcocked a turkey this year and it turned out AMAZING. so much quicker, too. Didn't dry out the turkey, and gave me a fun word to throw around while bragging about it, lol. "You know, I... Spatchcocked a turkey this year.." People's eyes get wide, lol. They're like, "you did WHAT to the turkey??"
The libation here is homemade hard sweet tea… it’s the south and it’s 70 today. I’ll pass on the dairy.
I cooked a turkey for the first time last year and was amazed how moist it was!! My mum always cooked the turkey and yep always dry. 

As it was my first time I followed the cooking instructions. I also have a meat thermometer (I've had salmonella food poisoning and it something I never want to repeat) so checked it making sure it was cooked through and then left it in a bit longer. Best turkey I'd ever had and moist the next day on sandwiches. Can't beat a turkey and bread sauce sandwiches
I'm trying to figure out the scenario and the logic. Food and beverage director, so were you working at like a food stand at an event or something? Did a customer get mad that there was some chicken-related liquid next to their chicken?
Sous vide chicken is amazing, but cooking a chicken precisely to the "done but not dehydrated" temp tends to freak people out because they aren't used to decently cooked chicken.
I got sick for a week from (probably) eating some chicken.  Said chicken was dry as the Sahara.  

Had to have a talk with my wife afterward about food safety.
I wish someone would try and write me up for that. I would keep the paper to laugh about with my next boss.
I waited tables in college and I can't tell you how many times customers whined about raw chicken.  It wasn't raw at all it just wasn't dry.
Sometimes it's less about health and saftey and more about what customers are willing to trust enough to eat.  


Even if it's fully cooked if the customers don't trust it enough to eat it....well, they're not paying .
Myom used to do this to pork chops LOL she'd take one nice, inch thick pork chop and butterfly it, so now it's two 1/2 inch chops, then shive em under the broiler till they can be used to play hockey :P

My wife made me pork chops when we were first dating, and I told her I'd eat em but I wasn't really a fan, and holy cow they were so good and juicy I nearly cried! :)
You probably grew up thinking your steak was supposed to be grey because of her too.
We called my mom the 'Cajun Cook' because she always blackened everything 😂 i still enjoy a lot of stuff burnt as an adult. it's like nostalgic or something.
My FIL was the same way with beef.  If there was any color left, you were going to die of ptomaine.  My husband didn’t realize there was another way to eat steak until our first date at a steakhouse.
There's not a damned cook in OP's house.  They could have tossed it under the broiler for 2 minutes to crisp them tits and it would only be better than anything they meant to do.
You gotta render that back fat
Spatchcock is an *excellent* word. It’s grotesque, like all those consonants are bones poking out of its sides. It lures you in with that first syllable, like the flow or musicality of “spatula.” But there’s no music here, not where we’re going. Spatchcock.
Spatchcocking is as grotesque as the act itself. Cutting out a spine like I just did a Fatality in Mortal Kombat and then cracking the ribs of the bird just seems like overkill, but the end result is sooo friggen worth it 🤤😭
+1 on this, have done this many times on both turkeys and regular chickens. it's so easy too. With kitchen shears cutting out the backbone is super quick. I stopped cutting it out in favor of cutting the spine in half along the middle because I didn't  use the backbone, and I kinda like the backbone still attached to the thighs. You could even reassemble the turkey this way after cooking too. 

This method gives the best meat done-ness and a crispy, golden cracking  skin. Soooo good.
If you really want the turkey juices in the stuffing you can make a turkey stock a few days ahead with necks/wings or chicken stock is very close.
>yes. they just want to complain and feel superior to a younger person.

Son, I was smoking turkeys inverted *long* before you were *born.*
I put it on high broil when I flip it. Depending on the amount of fat in the skin, it can take as little as 5 to 20 minutes.
I’m not doubting anyone saying it’s great to completely or partially cook yer bird breast down. I’ve only ever smoked turkeys and I inject the with two sticks of butter and they’ve always been good. If you’re cooking breast down, roasting, isn’t the breast skin not crispy?
I JUST LEARNED THE SECRET. Thanks!
I once had thick dark brown 7-grain bread from the health food store that wasn't too edible unless it was toasted or made like a grilled ham & egg sandwich in the frying pan. I used that for stuffing one year. Mom freaked out but it was moist, flavorful, delicious, much better than cheap white bread.
Stick a wooden dowel up its ass and spin it.
Oven mitts. Sure, they get all greasy, but it works.
Barbecue gloves! Perfect for this task.
Necromancers hen
Flat Turkey - one time stuff happened and we didn’t get to check the bird for a bit- the breast got to 210 and was still moist but headed towards dry. It was still moister than any bird my mother or grandmother ever made.
11pm on December 27th. Aint no way a frozen turkey is thawing same day
They're also most likely screaming and blaming op for not having turkey today. He needs to steal all their aluminum foil wrapping it, then have awesome sandwiches at home.
If it's anything like me, you drop it in the pan by accident and end up with a delightful spatter of nuclear hot turkey juice.
Yup! My mom had a 25 pound turkey, never again. Haha. That sucker was heavy.

We usually have a 12 pound turkey at my house, one holds the pan, the other grabs the sides with 2 hot pads and voila…  the first time is awkward but we’ve been doing this so long our technique is perfected.
You have me interested I'm off to learn more about spatchcocking
The moistness of the turkey probably is due to you finishing cooking it closer to the time you served than your Mom used to do. My Mom finished the turkey first and then did everything else. The first year I cooked it and served within 30 minutes my brother complimented our Mom on her first moist bird.... Yes, 5 minutes of the entire family screaming with laughter.
Bread sauce! As in the WWII staple? My Nana made that as a side dish every year! I love it!
I've had that ish twice got it from frozen chicken pot pies both times 😭 could trust a fart for like two weeks!
No I was at a hospital and I made the food for the doctors lounge  and did the catering for the upper management. 

They cut into their chicken and freaked out that clear juices came out.
Hi, I'm a health inspector! Most food born illnesses take about 72 hours after infection to make you sick, but people usually think it was their last meal before symptoms started. When people call in to our health department to report an illness, we do a whole survey and investigation to try and pinpoint the source and it's usually never what they think it was. 🤷
> Had to have a talk with my wife afterward about food safety.

But did you write her up? :D
Or take over the cooking yourself
My wife changed "I don't like pork chops" to "I don't like my mom's pork chops."

Don't tell my mom.
I swear all my issues with food when I was a child were because no one took care in cooking it properly. Pork I get because of the times (70/80s) but there wasn't any excuse for the rest of it.
Pork is the worst for this, and it's not *entirely* the cook's fault... The guidelines for Pork have changed over the years.
Lol my mom couldn't make pork chops either 😂 she would cook them in a pan and they would always be soooooooo dryyyyyyyy. My girlfriend was the one who showed me pork chops could be delicious. She does them on the grill and seasons them beforehand 😁
Same with mine. Then my college bf had me try steak medium rare. I fucking love steak now. Eat it rare now too.
Man that makes me sad. Mom always made these thin little dry chuck steaks. "Bootsteaks." Nobody liked bootsteak night.
It's fuckin *good* is what it is, nothing better than a nice crisp.

Ever thrown a handful of shredded cheese into a super hot, dry, nonstick pan? You get this amazing cheese-crisp thing the size of a dinner plate. We fight over them lol

(You can use them instead of tortillas, but that fact is a well-kept family secret)
>It’s grotesque, like all those consonants are bones poking out of its sides

Evoking exactly what it is! An excellent quality in a word.
If you are not a writer, you should be.
Or just use the spine when you cut it out of the bird. It's perfect for making a stock
If you flip at the end, it will get crispy. You can also broil it if it’s basically done to just get the crispy skin. Wait until everyone learns about spatchcocking
Mmmmm you made me hungry. I used yellow corn meal for my corn bread stuffing. They shut once I made them eat it.  Tasted perfect.
Omg, now I wish we had turkey today!
Video at 11:00.
devil's duck
These people strike me as the type to throw it in a microwave on thaw for 2 hours. 

I, for one, like gnawing on rubber
The year I did a 24 pound turkey, it bowed the oven rack enough to make it fall when I went to pull it out of the oven. Luckily, I'd had the second rack in underneath of it, so it only fell like 2 inches and was only tilted a little and didn't spill any juices!
The opposite is true. It needs to sit. If you cut it right away all the juices will run out.
The dryness was due to her cooking it far longer than needed. When it used to be a big turkey she'd get up at 5am to start cooking it. Many times everything else was ready but still waiting on the turkey! 

As the turkey got smaller she'd still think they needed far longer than they did. I even bought her a meat thermometer but she didn't use it and dry turkey continued. I understand why everyone in the family doesn't like turkey as its always dry lol. 

Plus she never let it rest, cut it straightaway, she does that with all meat. I realise now why I always have SO much gravy lol
I also put the pieces straight in the juice after carving it. I've taken over the in-laws cuz I'll literally watch the moisture evaporate in the air. This year a niece&nephew helped the grandma with everything. I walk in the kitchen & see  breast was carved & drying out,getting cold. They didn't even bother with the dark meat..cue me rolling up sleeves & breaking down the bird, carving the dark meat & pouring juice over the white.. in my mind im trying to get brain wrapped around the idea of them not prepping the dark meat for plating. There was very little left after,so I know the breast alone wouldn't feed everyone..
What is bread sauce?  I have never heard of it and it sounds interesting.
Did I miss something? I thought all poultry was supposed to be cooked until internal temp reaches 165°F and the juices run clear? Maybe the doctors should stick to the surgery suite and leave the chefs alone? You wouldn't tell them how to perform surgery. Your Food & Beverage director is an idiot.
WE don't want food that tastes good!
Good info to know! TY!
Drives me crazy when people get food poisoning in the evening and blame the restaurant they ate dinner at.

I'm like, "No dude, it was the breakfast you made for yourself this morning".
Hmm.  I had the suspect chicken on a Wednesday, got the chills Thursday night, and by Friday night had horrible, horrible, diarrhea until the following Wednesday.

Trying to remember what I had to eat on the Tuesday.
AKA recency bias.  People blame the last thing they ate but it usually isn't that.
This is such good knowledge to have when you couple it with the fact that we have an evolutionary aversion to foods that (we think) have made us sick. I threw up shortly after eating a pasta casserole type dish with mushrooms as a kid. It definitely was not the dish that made me sick, because I was puking within hours of eating it. I still couldn't eat mushrooms for like 10 years after that though, because of the flavor association with puking. 

I totally thought it was the dish that made me sick until I got older and learned how bacteria operate. I wish I could have practiced mind over matter on mushrooms earlier in life!

Another interesting and related tidbit, it's recommended to bring cancer patients who are going through chemo odd foods. Rootbeer flavored candies are a common one, because if you bring them their favorite foods, they may no longer like them after chemo because of how sick the chemo makes them. That's how strong the evolutionary aversion is in our brains, even when it makes no sense!
LOL exactly! :) my.mom could make some things that were fantastic, but the rest? My current(and forever) wife has blown my mom outta the water on so many recipes :)
Yeah, between the way things were cooked and the "you can't leave the table till you finish your plate, no excuses", the 80s sucked for me too. I think there really only one food aversion I have that doesn't stem from then :P
Hey, never were the guidelines for pork "butterfly and broil for 20 minutes" LOL

It grew up thinking pork was always supposed to be crunchy, even if it wasn't bacon :)
My husband gets out the acetylene torch and makes a nice, brown, crispy skin.
Chicken nuggies?
Oof... you're probably right
Worse than the juices running out, they'll *steam* out. Steam coming off of your food looks great in advertisements, but in real life that's literally just moisture leaving your food.
Resting the bird is so important. This is what you use to not only lock in the moisture but it’ll also actually hit your final temp just from resting to prevent over cooking.
Sauce made out of bread duh.

Here's a recipe 

https://www.nigella.com/recipes/my-mothers-bread-sauce
That is because you are correct.
Yeah. I hated food. Then I wanted to get laid so when I started dating I learned to cook and turns out my family with just simply terrible at it.
Omgggggg crunchyyyyy NOOO
Thank you.  I am going to give this a try.  I love learning new recipes.
What the fuck is this though? Is it eaten by itself? With something? What does it taste like? Aromatherapy and pepper? 

So many questions.
It’s pretty standard in UK Christmas dinners and delicious- kinda like a very creamy roux, but with much more flavour.

One of those things we have each Christmas, and wonder why we don’t make it the rest of the year, as it’s great!
It's a sauce. You eat it with the roast meat on your plate.
TIFU by not realizing my neighbors have a Ring doorbell...
So, the lady that lives next for just came by to "thank me for giving them a giggle." The **FedEx guy** (I accidentally slandered our mail lady) accidentally delivered a package for them to my house, and ofc I was gonna go drop it off. It's, like, 30 steps round trip.

Well, I overthink everything. I set it on their porch in front of the gate that goes across their steps, and went to walk away. Then, I was like, "oh, but I'm not sure if they're actually home right now, so what if they go to leave the house and knock it down the stairs with the gate? That wouldn't be very fun and I'd feel awful if whatever's in the box is broken..."

So I picked it up and moved it to the other side of the gate. But then I realized it was getting dark, and I didn't want them to open the gate and trip over it, so I picked it back up. I want to avoid bothering them, so coming back later when I see (or hear, because she's a borky girl) the dog let out is absolutely out of the question. At this point, I'm just holding the package and walking up to the porch and stepping back to try and gauge where the streetlight would hit their porch when it kicks on, and I eventually settle on a good spot and half run home bc thank goodness nobody's ever going to see this! 

Well, after asking what the neighbor meant by that, she explained that it was really funny to see me just basically walking in circles, especially if you speed the footage up a bit. She showed me the footage. I do, in fact, look like an idiot, but it is, in fact, kind of hilarious. At one point, it even kind of looks like I'm waltzing with the box.

tl;dr I tried to do something nice by returning a misdelivered package, ended up looking like an idiot, and may or may not end up in a TikTok with the Benny Hill theme song playing while I goofily stumble around trying to figure out where to put a box on a porch.

editing to add a couple things: First of all, I don't have the footage. My neighbor showed it to me on her phone. I didn't tell her not to post it anywhere, but my face also doesn't hide what I'm feeling so I'm pretty sure she could see that i wasn't comfortable with the whole thing. Second (due to pressure from random people in the comments), I've written her a note to see if she does plan on uploading it anywhere. If she does end up posting it, I'll add the link to this post, but as for right now I'm keeping my physical self off of Reddit as I do enjoy the fact that nobody here knows what I look like.

Just another edit bc someone dmed me that this is "definitely going to end up in a Smosh video": Hello, Shayne/Dad! Please feature Damien in my episode.
You're one of the good ones! Thanks for considering that much, don't feel like an idiot lol. I'm the same with behavior like this and I feel lonely.
Perfectly wholesome.
Hahaha.  I had a similar experience with my neighbors tiny dog.  It escaped, I pick it up, they don't appear home, the fence won't close, there is no collar to tie it up.  So for five minutes I am circling with this silly tiny dog in my hand, when the neighbor in question opens the door...
Today I fucked up by being far more considerate than most neighors... *on camera*

Nah you're good man.
Oh this was the laugh I needed today 😂😂😂
Hello fellow overthinker
Cute:)
Don't be ashamed, your neighbor probably loves you for this 😉
I’m a FedEx driver and I once accidentally delivered a package to the neighbor. Instead of just walking it over, these people drove 15 minutes to the post office and left it there. I had to pick it up at the post office and redeliver it….15 feet to the left.
Hey, at least you were thinking of them.  Good job!
OMG are we related? I had the very same thoughts when bringing a misdirected package to my neighbor's house a couple of months ago - the perfect spot to leave it mystified me!
This has got to be the most wholesome tifu ive ever read.
Omg this could have been me 🤣🤣🤣🤣 awkwards unite!
I was already humming Yakety Sax to myself while reading your post. I hope it does end up somewhere as long as you'll be laughing with us.
Post it on YouTube with the music from Benny Hill.
I have a similar story. One time I went to drop off a birthday card to a friends house. I’d come from the gym so I was wearing general workout stuff, and when I approached the porch I kind of skipped along some stepping stones that were on the lawn. I was also moving kind of quick since I was trying to be unseen.

Turns out, they had a ring doorbell, so when the friend reached out to thank me, she commented on my, “ninja moves”. Took me a day or two to stop being embarrassed about that lol.
Well, now *you have to* upload the video.

It sounds like if you add music, and maybe about 8 women in bikinis chasing you around, you could go full-on Benny Hill Show.
Lol put more thought into it then almost every type of professional carrier
You did good
You did not FU in any way. In fact, quite the opposite. Albeit in a *hilariously* embarrassing way.
100% exactly what I would end up doing. Haha
Wholesome TIFU
Share the footage we beg you
Hey, you may be a little embarrassed but you did two good things for them, you brought them their package and you gave them a giggle. No fucking up whatsoever.
Nah, that's not a FU. You were just being neighborly. But, between doorbell cameras and phone cameras and security cameras, just assume you're getting recorded *everywhere*. My neighbor that stole an expensive package off my front steps while I was home should have. Now, after a trip through the court system, he has a record.
[removed]
You didn't FU!  You're a great neighbor!  A funny one too!
[removed]
You did a good thing, and provided them a giggle. That is a double plus for you!
Thank you for this! Laughing at the hilarity.
Last night our DoorDash driver put our food order, including a drink, right in front of our door. There’s a screen door that opens outward! If only they’d put in a 10th the amount of thought as you…
What does borky mean?
Would it be legal to just publish the video without consent?
When anxiety is wholesome. Thanks for the anecdote!
I have a video of my neighbor “stealing” her groceries from my front porch where they were misdelivered. It was kind of funny to see her walking up and looking in the bags to double check then picking them up and hurriedly walking away with them. Her trying to hurry up so no one would see her “stealing” only made it look more like she was. 😂
Nowadays I just assume there's a doorbell camera or other surveillance whenever I walk up to a neighbor's house.
OP shouldn't worry even if they did look goofy. Their consideration is an attribute, not a detriment.
They should be thankful that you brought them their package.
You lived a day in the life of a sim where someone keeps canceling your action midway through.
“Waltzing with the box” gave me a good chuckle. 🤭 thanks for sharing!
This is the way.
So glad I'm not the only one who does this except I get worried if I'm taking too long the neighbors will think I'm trying to think of a clever way to steal the package 🤣
Lol. 

Ps, you might have an anxiety disorder
Aw this is very sweet and exceptionally kind of you, good neighbouring!

We got a Ring doorbell a while back, and were also having a bit of trouble with our neighbour at the time.

When setting it up, I hadn't realised that I'd toggled the microphone on, RIGHT WHILE I WAS TALKING SHIT ABOUT THE NEIGHBOUR and it was broadcasting it to our small, quiet street.

Bad neighbouring on my part.
Somewhere on TikTok is ring footage of me falling backwards over a hill in panic
Not a TIFU at all!  Today you showed the neighbors just how conscientious you are about both their package and their well being.  Everyone should be neighbors like you!
You’re a good person who cares. Embrace it. We need more people like you in this world.
Aww, that’s cute lol. 

Sometimes the mailman shoves my packages into my neighbor’s mailbox, and I spoke to my neighbor about this years ago and she doesn’t care if I peek into her box if I’m missing a package that’s marked delivered.

But all of our mailboxes are out of sight of the apartment building and they’re next to the road. So today I was looking over my shoulder and quickly trying to yank out my package from my neighbor’s mailbox… but it was too big for the box so it was stuck. I was pulling it so hard trying not to look like I was stealing someone else’s package lol. Finally got it. No harm done. I hope no strangers saw me and thought I was stealing lol.
When the edibles hit as you’re returning a package. 😝 

Seriously tho, I’ve definitely done the same sort of thing a ton of times in various situations. A package on a porch, an item on a bosses desk, my wife’s laundry. Don’t get to up in your head about it. There’s probably 100,000,000 people on the planet, wandering around, second guessing where to put something down, as you’re reading this post.
One time I received the neighbors mail but I didn’t know their names so I went to their house to deliver.  When they didn’t answer I didn’t want to leave the package with my address on it there so I went home until they got back to seee if it’s theirs.  

They posted video of me trying to deliver their mail all over the neighborhood apps. My boss saw it.  Everybody.  It didn’t even have their address on it.
Omg love the smosh reference here, now I’m rereading the whole post in his voice haha
Our postal folks are always getting mail mixed in with neighbors.  I take most of it directly to the right th house unless its blocks away and then I leave it in my box with the address circled and it usually works. But now that I've read this, I will look out for video door cameras and try not to give them a laugh... or maybe not!
[removed]
This was just lovely. You made my month, thank you.
[removed]
LOL, this was me with baked goods for my neighbor’s kids a couple weeks ago—I kept second guessing how/where to leave it so they wouldn’t trip on the package/miss it entirely, but also it had to be somewhere the deer/yotes/trash pandas/squirrels wouldn’t get into it before they got it XD

I’m sure we did quite a few of the same Ring cam dance moves my friend!
Do not feel embarrassed. Many times I've done that waltz, and occasionally in that same situation. I kinda wish there was footage. It's a good dance, it means you're thinking. 😁
No, you didn't.

That was really nice to read.
What makes you think you're an overthinker?🤔
[removed]
[removed]
Thank you for being able to laugh at yourself and sharing it with us. Best chuckle I have had all day! 😁
[removed]
I have been complaining for YEARS that the delivery companies one day decided that leaving packages on front steps constituted a completion of their responsibility to deliver it to me, and that this is insane, so I would be a hypocrite to leave a package on front steps. I deliver packages that come into my possession because, unlike the delivery companies apparently, I actually feel some responsibility to actually make sure they get it, so I would never leave it on their steps in a million years. What if it is sentimental or irreplaceable and I am the one that got it stolen by abandoning it outdoors?
Don’t feel too bad, a video of me drunkenly swinging around a lamppost set to Benny Hill got half a million views on barstool once, and we couldn’t even find it a month later.
This sounds like a good neighborhood with funny and groovy people.   Love it!
I want to see this video 😭
You need to get that video and upload it.  Please!
I bought an upholstered bed online.  It was delivered while I was at work.  I called my elderly neighbor and asked her if she would please move it to her house so it wouldn’t get stolen.  I explained that she could easily put it on the flat, 4 wheeled moving dolly that I had loaned her and just wheel it to her house. She agreed. I watched my camera and saw her approaching with the dolly.  She easily picked up one end of the box and put it on the dolly , then picked up the other end and did the same.  Nicely balanced, she started pushing it to her house.  When she hit the top of the driveway, she failed to account for the slight incline toward the street and the dolly got away from her and started rolling toward the street.  She started running after it.  I was laughing so hard that a few coworkers came to check on me.  When I got home I went to pick it up and when I saw her I lost it.  I showed her the video and we still joke about it to this day.
you sound like you're describing something i would do: presented with too many options, each deduction of an outcome bumping you while the objective and intent is kindness and consideration and you just malfunction. 

thanks for being sweet to your neighbor.
As an Amazon delivery driver I feel seen LMAO.

So many instances of me walking around trying to find the optimal place to hide the package.

There have been many times where I’ll place it down then decide elsewhere is better and I’m just walking around like an idiot in front of their camera, talking to myself.
Wait how is this a fuckup?? Seems like you shared a nice moment with your neighbor whilst demonstrating you are a caring and thoughtful person...
Except that is adorable.
Lol I stealth dropped cookies off at my neighbor’s porches and one of my neighbors ate them then texted me. The other one was baffled but became my son’s honorary grandma.
I think you just created a new Mr. Bean sketch.
I want to see the video so bad
May I suggest setting the sped up video to Yakety Sax?
Sharing is Caring, so how about sharing the video?
Do you look at amazon driver just throwing the box and walk away lol
So you need to get this footage and set it to yakety sacs
That's actually really sweet, trying to find the optimal place to put the package without them tripping over it or damaging it.

Funny, sure, but I wouldn't call it a fuckup :D
This is actually adorable.
[deleted]
Exactly what I would’ve done.
SHOW US THE VIDEO!
Hey OP! Please don't be so hard on yourself. The fact that you cared enough to not only bring their package, but took time to also think about having it safe, makes you awesome. If someone does add Benny Hill music, it's cause they found it endearing and want you to join in on feeling better about this wholesome little event. Be proud of your actions!
That's adorable and if I was them I'd be so charmed by the consideration and effort put in by my neighbor, you're awesome
Aww that's very sweet. I mean around here the Amazon delivery people said there's ongoing Porch Pirates.

The addresses are also super weird out here so I help newer drivers with where addresses are.
OMG this is cute
Here for that Benny Hill remix
I bet they love the little video of their wonderfully human and considerate neighbor.
We sometimes get mail or a package for one of our neighbors. Everyone has a ring doorbell so I always try and get rid of the item as quick as possible so they don’t come out from the alert if they’re home. And they’re all nice and we get along but it’s awkward wondering if they’ll open the door while I’m leaving their stuff.
The world needs more “you” in it.
r/toomeirlformeirl
That's charming and thoughtful.
This is really heartwarming and thoughtful.
Hey, they thanked you right? Besides two huge draws in people is that they're kind and have a good sense of humor.  I would not count this as a FU, just a bit of cringe doing the right thing. But as an overthinker myself I GET it.
I’m sure that was super cute.

Give yourself a break!
At least you were fully clothed.
No good deed goes unpunished.
And six months from now, we'll know how the latest TikTok parcel-waltzing trend started. It'll be our little secret.
my god, are you ME? i could imagine myself doing the exact same thing. overthinking the best way to do someone else a favor 😭😭😭 cute tifu, you are a good neighbor.
Do what us other over-thinkers do, evaluate from a distance before self embarrassment.

Know your neighbor's house just from walking past. Carefully weigh your options and calculate your final move before the first one is ever made.

Find the best location and make this a tactical strike. It needs to be a drop and go as if you've done this before, a true master of package delivery.

Always recon the area before your initial strike and you won't run around like a chicken with his head chopped off

Oh wow, that's hilarious! 😂 Trying to be a good neighbor turned into a whole performance! It’s so relatable to overthink little things like that, especially when you want to avoid being awkward. The fact that your neighbor found it funny just adds to the charm! At least you’re giving them some good entertainment, right? If that ends up in a TikTok or video, it’ll be legendary! 🎥✨

this is absolutely something that i would do, i overthink goofy lil things like this all the time 😅 i hope you do make it into a future episode of smosh reddit stories OP!!
First rule in life is be nice

and you have passed.
The funny part is the mailman earlier looking at their house and going “screw that, I’m leaving it at the neighbors” that didn’t get recorded.
Oh man, I wish I could see the footage. 🤣
your neighbor seems uncalibrated and that she doesn't have emotional intelligence. remind her of your boundaries, and make sure she understands that she was done a favor.
Omg not you calling out Smosh! That's so funny that I saw this out in the wild!
That's really funny! Don't worry, we all do silly things sometimes. Hopefully, ur neighbor doesn't put it online without asking u first.
Haha! Your neighbour's a dick
[removed]
you sound exhausting
lol I do my best to be at least civil with my neighbors, I'm just mortified that it was caught on film...or whatever we say now that film has gone away. 😅
Don’t feel lonely!! I’m like this too!
I do this too! I’m extroverted and social, so no one expects me to awkwardly second-guess things like this, but I do. Don’t be lonely; we’re really just trying to help out lol.
I have been affectionately referred to as "the best kind of dumb," so thank you lol
I would have **d i e d .**
u are a sweet neighbor!!
the consideration isn't what I'm worried about, it's the whole 3 minutes of ballroom dancing 😂
glad to be of assistance ( *'-')7
hello! i like your username!
Thaaaaanks ;w;
it definitely brightened her day 😂🤦🏻‍♀️😭
our FedEx drivers always ignore my sign to put my packages inside my screen door and just prop them against the door so i have to knock them over in order to leave my dang house, and support never does anything to help me out. same driver, and he does the same stuff every time. 🙃🙃

this was USPS though, and they're *usually* pretty good about things going correctly in my current neighborhood.
lol thanks, I'm just worried she's gonna make a TikTok and it's gonna get sent to me like "lol u"
probably distantly. I'm related to a lot of people in a lot of places, but you also don't have to be blood to be family so 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
thank you ;w;
we all just stand around looking at the floor like "why did we do this?"
I'll be crying, but I'll also be laughing, so it's gonna be ok
i do not personally have the footage.
this is gonna be what i think of at 8am as i try to sleep for my overnight shifts.
i don't have the footage. unfortunately, 1337 h4xx3r isn't in my repertoire of Random Skills That Have No Use Until They Somehow Do
😅😅 golden rule, and all that
i sure feel like i done goof't!
the footage that's on my neighbor's Ring account, to which i do not have access?
apparently my fuckup was actually posting this to reddit bc people are peer pressuring me...
i mean, fair, but like hear me out: i forget doorbell cams exist sometimes
i need to start wearing shirts like "if i do something dumb or funny, you owe me $5. here's where to pay me:" 😂
i would've just left it off to the side on the inner part of the gate someplace if I'd seen the camera 😅😅 can't trip over it, and they'd see it when they went to leave the house, but i wouldn't be auditioning for Dancing with the Stars with a box as my partner! 😂
i swear, my autobiography is gonna be called "oops! ...anyway, moving on."
thank you, i try to be a tolerable neighbor.
you are welcome! I'm over here trying to figure out how to become an ostrich, but I'm glad other people are enjoying my whoopsy daisy
i had a dasher do that once! turns out she was the sister of one of my bullies from hs and the girl tried to say i was the bully. i was not. i have the messages still in messenger.
Why are you the only person to ask this? I’m puzzled too. A googling shows an anime/cartoon character or slang for “broken”. I don’t really see how either meaning fits.
she's a medium large dog, so she doesn't bark so much as bork!
it happened on their property, so while it would be legal, i wouldn't like it. i didn't tell her she couldn't publish it anywhere, but she also seemed to realize how i felt about it, so I'm counting on her being considerate since she and her husband finally stopped being how they were when we first moved in around the same time.
Yes
omg your poor neighbor lol
happy cake day! my consideration has been called a detriment by a therapist as i tend to neglect myself in favor of others :•)
oh she was! she just also wanted to let me know that she thought it was funny that i took a few minutes to find optimal box placement.
i think they kept adding actions after i thought i had completed the objective. thank goodness there weren't any plates on the floor!
the transition from Benny Hill vibes to Once Upon A Dream is startling 😂
that was something that crossed my mind! thankfully most of my neighbors were gone at work, and I'm pretty sure the others were sleeping. nobody called the police on me, so that's a plus! 😂
>Ps, you might have an anxiety disorder

there is no "might" in this situation, I'm professionally diagnosed!
ok but that's really funny to me bc I'm just imagining "if that damn pinecone of a woman doesn't stop bringing her dog to poop on our lawn, **we will be having words."**
are you okay, though? was it a murder clown chasing you or something? that was a weird time.
do not bring this curse upon the world, i beg of you.
i used to have something like this! i always wondered how the guy got them into the mailbox. i ended up settling in him being a space wizard of some sort with the power to teleport the box into any enclosure he wanted 😂
I've had people try to give me edibles in the past because I'm such a mess of a human being, but i promised someone's fursona that i wouldn't do drugs when i was in 3rd grade. as for the amount of people who can relate, I'm always surprised when I'm average as opposed to entirely inept.
I'm a little confused. it had their names, but your address? was it, like, a typo or something? or just maybe someone who lived there before you (bc i get that a lot)?
one of my friends (that i didn't know was on Reddit, and who only figured out i was here bc he recognized my username from other places) straight up dmed me and was like "Dude, you're so ending up on a Smosh Reddit Stories episode, and it's gonna be about the world's biggest fucking dorks."

so I'm over here like "bring it on, this is the closest I'm ever getting to interacting with Damien Haas. lemme just...edit hi, dad!" 😂
imma just yell at their camera from now on. just "HI, PACKAGE, HERE, GOODBYE!"
if I'm doomed to be on the Internet for crimes of silliness, I'm not sure if i want the Benny Hill theme or "I'm just a girl" as my soundtrack
thanks lmao 😂 

y'all are gonna be really confused if you see what i actually look like tho
is So You Think You Can Dance still a show? gotta audition with a box as my partner 😂
I picked the box back up 3 times, did some ballroom dancing with it, and spent about five minutes in all trying to figure out where to set it down, and that's one of the tamer things that's happened this week.
i hope not! I'll have to fight someone over content rights bc I'll be damned if I'm not reposting in​to my own TikTok or YouTube lol

my friends are all "this is so you" people and i gotta stay ahead of that 😂😭
I'm just glad i was only singing made up songs about the golden rule and where to put the package in my head! 😬
always glad to be of service! ( *'-')7
i hope not! 🙃😭 i don't usually get much attention online so i wasn't even expecting the oomph that this post brought and I'm not sure how to handle it.
in all fairness, i found their package by almost tripping over it bc the one time the FedEx guy didn't leave a package *propped against my screen door,* it was on my second step. apparently people get threatened or have dogs go after them in the delivery industry, but like i don't even have a dog. there's just a gargoyle in my porch because i personally think he's cute :•)
well dang, I'm sorry to hear that you lost your fame!
i will let you continue to believe this.
I'll have to leave a note for the neighbor to see what she plans on doing, ig.
i don't have that good of a relationship with any of my neighbors 😅 we mostly just leave each other alone tbh. I'm glad your neighbor wasn't hurt and that you both had a laugh!
yeah, i try to decide literally anything and i just

![gif](giphy|xThuWlkDowsBhfAMX6)
i thankfully was using my inside voice. that's more to say i was using the voice inside my head.
I'm just afraid to end up on TikTok tbh 😅😭
everyone keeps saying that but i feel embarrassed and like i messed something up. idk why at this point!
i love that! i would bake things for the neighbors, but i overthink and I'm like "but what if allergies? preferences? what if they just don't like sweets oh no-"
.....would you happen to be able to put me in touch with him😂😂
I've prettymuch been peer pressured into writing a note for my neighbor to see what she plans on doing with the footage. I'm not really comfortable with sharing the footage, but yanno...
Or Benny Hill?
yes, I'll share the video i don't possess.
our Amazon driver actually is really considerate and he'll keep plastic bags in his car to put on packages if it looks like it'll rain. like, we seriously got the best one! this package was FedEx. it's always FedEx that puts our packages in bad places.
if my neighbor wants to, i can't stop her, but I'd prefer not to post it myself or bother her for it (and also i can hardly keep up with the comments on this post, so I'm trying to figure out how I'd keep up with comments on a potentially viral video without ending up sobbing)
i just didn't realize there was a camera or i would've just popped it somewhere out of the way and skittered off
thank you 🥹👉🏻👈🏻
thank you, but honestly the awesome people are the ones trying to make me feel better about this whole thing! 💜
i take comfort in so many people relating to my dorky bs 😅💜
I DO NOT HAVE IT! WHY ARE WE YELLING?
I'm all fairness, if my neighbor uploads it and adds the Benny Hill theme song to it, it'll probably be because my reaction was "omgoodness, i look like i need to have the Benny Hill theme behind me in this... 🤦🏻‍♀️"
lol thank you. i try to uphold the golden rule (which is why i mostly leave my neighbors alone 😂), and also to be careful because mail is federally protected and I'm (entirely irrationally) afraid they'll somehow get the IRS involved.
thankfully we don't see much of that in my area. probably bc someone tried to be a porch pirate at the wrong house with the best (worst) timing, and got a very knife surprise bc the homeowner was coming to grab his package as the guy was taking it.
thanks ;w;
**D R O P  T H E  B A S S** [YAKETY SAX, BUT MAKE IT DUBSTEP]
the neighbor lady loves my social awkwardness and dedication to seemingly unimportant tasks, but this is the first time she's gotten video proof. she almost had footage of me in my garden talking to their dog like we were gossiping while she borked at me a bunch, but i was like "oh, dear, a camera, time to hide in my sunflowers and tomatoes" like the absolute cryptid i strive to be.
i imagine you just bartender slide the package to their door to avoid human contact, and honestly same 😂
i think one me is enough, but i appreciate the sentiment 😅
oh, thank you for the award btw!
r/3relatable5me
thank you 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
.....r/usernamechecksout...?

also thank you .w.
as soon as she said she had footage, i had that "[whispers] i fucked uuuuup..." sound in my head 😂😭
the one really bright side is that i didn't fall over on video.
i had to be, i was going outside
unfortunately lmao
oh god please no 😂😂
thanks lol. I'm learning that a lot of people are similar to me in this regard and I'm fond of it 💜
my final move was going to be "put it in front of the gate where they'll see it when they get home" 😂🙃🙃🙃
oh, i hope not. I'm not a very social person, and i don't know what I'd do if people gave me the power to make my own merch.
honestly that thought scares me 😂😭
i left a note to see what she planned to do before i left for work, so if she ends up saying she's posting it somewhere, y'all will have your link. otherwise, i stay secret for ETERNITY (probably)
i would like to not have TikTok as my destination, but i suppose so be it if it happens...
look, if they get me (by which i mean my story bc no way I'm getting that lucky lol) on an episode with the glorious and talented Damien Haas, I'll literally recreate the fucking footage in my backyard and post it myself 😂
huzzah! thank you for bringing these joyous tidings! ( *•u•)/)✨
i thought it was our mail lady, but it was actually our FedEx guy. thanks for reminding me i forgot to edit that
if they give me Damien Haas, I'll recreate the footage.
I'm not sure if you actually read my post. she didn't break any boundaries. what are you, a bot?
ngl i love Smosh, so the thought of this post ending up there has me somewhat excited 😅
it doesn't seem like she will, which is nice. and yeah, we're all a bunch of silly, goofy, spooky, scary skeletons.
they used to be much worse! now they usually leave us alone. sometimes they're nice. :•)
i just feel really dumb, but that's normal for me so idk why my brain is making such a big deal of this specifically.
and you sound sad.
Don’t be mortified you did a good thing and made them laugh which means you did two good things. Then you came here and made us all laugh so three good things. That’s awesome!
You're a good person.

I say "Caught on video."
Caught on candy camera is an older saying but still gets rid of the film aspect of the OG saying lol
I feel this so hard. You did the best thing…and it’s rough being an overthinking worrier
You’re officially their new favorite neighbor, guaranteed.
Post the footage!
if it makes you feel better, in my current apartment there are cameras everywhere- the elevator, laundry area, lobby, etc. because it's nyc. i know for a fact i've been videoed  randomly laughing / talking to myself like an idiot 😭❤️️ it's hard out here
You aren't that French gal from r/wellthatsucks are you?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/s/g7q6S6cvcf
I’m the same way. I had an envelope delivered to my address but it was someone’s from across the street. They only use their automatic garage door to go in the house so I couldn’t just leave the letter on their front door. I stood in the driveway for a while trying to figure it out. Then I finally just waited till I saw him come home and I ran over there.
😂😂
I can relate lol. Have been told in more than one situation I'm there for entertainment purposes only
If not for reading similar ring camera posts on Reddit I’d probably get caught walking around for five minutes singing the dumbest little songs anyone has ever heard to that tiny dog while I was holding them. 

I can just imagine “we really liked your song about his tiny little paws”
They loved it. All they of was thinking 'that's my friend ' and having a warm laugh.
Fellow Zelda fan too?!
That’s actually a FedEx safety rule, we’re not supposed to open doors to residential buildings. I still do occasionally but I could definitely be written up for that. Leaving them against your door like that however is just being stupid. Most of my houses have outward swinging doors and I always make sure to leave them far enough away that the door can open
At first a passerby might take the low murmur as conversation, but we’re all just mumbling to ourselves about yet another addition to an ever lengthening series of large and small embarrassing moments
Now you have to request a copy of the video and upload it with yakety sax!
Bork/borky=bark/barky 


It was basically just a fun and silly way of OP saying the neighbor has a cute dog, who gets excited, and barks a lot whenever they get let out in the yard to go potty, and probably play a little.


OP was saying that they didn't just wait for them to let the dog out, and then get their attention to tell them about the package, because OP didn't want to bother them. So instead, they just opted to do this instead, and the rest is history
she doesn't quite bark, she goes bork! she's very cute and medium to large 💜
At least your good deed went unpunished 🤣
Hahahaa that's so much better than the actuality, which was more like AHH HE THINKS HIS LAWN'S AMAZING BUT IT'S TOTAL SHITE, LOOK AT IT! YOOO SHIT LAWN MUCH! WAIT IS THIS THING ON?

Actually ran out in a panic afterwards to check if he was in his driveway/garage cos he would have deeeefinitely heard us if so. Thankfully seemed to be inside his house.

Don't know what I would have done if he HAD heard it anyway. Tell him his lawn is actually amazing? Try to scoop the words back into the doorbell?
I did not know the name on the package and it was addressed to my address.  Sorry I wrote it weird. It ended up being that neighbors package.
I do this …
I’m quite happy that the only place that video still exists is in my own head, and possibly the deep archives of one of my friends phones.
I've got my fantasies!
I write exact ingredients and allergen warnings. Just in case.
If you don’t feel comfortable then please don’t!
That’s the name of the song they used in Benny Hill, so yes?
BECAUSE I AM DESPERATE AND DIDN’T READ all the other comments sorry.
You sound like a great kind of neighbor, everyone wants a neighbor who is considerate and absent. And if it makes you feel any better, I have an irrational fear of hearing puppet legs moving so they're banished from my presence 🤣
>YAKETY SAX, BUT MAKE IT DUBSTEP

Pls no..
I’ve considered chucking packages like Amazon does but I actually do like my neighbors so I leave them nicely and hurry away. 🙈
Dammit! r/subsIfellfor
I’m not even joking! That is something my husband  and/or I would do. 

Benny Hill music improves all things. That and Japanese game show music!
I let my dog out once at like 3am, and before I could hook him up he took off after something. I stepped into my mud boots and ran out after him in just my boxers. I chased him all over the neighborhood. The next day my neighbor also thanked me for the laugh.
then why did it make you uncomfortable? 🙂
I'm just nervously waiting for a TikTok to get sent to me and my friends to be like "omg this is so you" while not realizing that it literally is, in fact, me.
i swear I'm just polite. i don't believe all the personality tests on BuzzFeed for a second.
Candid camera! Lol
Candid camera would be the one more commonly used irc as that was the name of the TV show.
"Caught in 4k" is the phrase I've typically heard/seen
they have candy cameras now?
i just feel like i fucked up being so focused on the task that i didn't see the camera at all. if I'd seen it i could've just, like, held the box up like "i got your package, it's going here, this is a warning, don't be trippin', hasta la pasta." and walked away with some semblance of dignity lol
well, i can't remember if she's the sister of the man or the woman that lives a couple doors diagonal from me (they're married and live in the same house, to clarify), but i can deal with second favorite.
i do not have it.
New York sounds scary tbh
no, I'm a different breed of oops.
It feels like half the things with that gal are symptoms of untreated neurodivergence
That’s me! But with a partner who had the great idea to monetize it. Husband and I are rolling on the floor. 

Last week, after I dropped an oyster on my lap he said “what’s it like riding the struggle bus?” It did not go over well in the moment, but its so funny now! (I’d already lost my keys, tripped over my own coat, hit a curb and spilled my drink on that date. )
thank you for sharing this, I'm always worried no one's going to want to put up with my ADHD but she is just like me and her partner loves her so much
The phone thing hits hard
i probably would've if i weren't a socially anxious walking disaster 😂
upvoted to send you some confidence bc you're way more than just a silly goose!
i wouldn't personally call her a friend by any means for reasons i don't care to go into on this post, but she definitely did have a good laugh.
yes! no idea where he went, but i do actually have a bokoblin plushie someplace :•)
i just have a screen door. my consent to open it is written. i also have a thing that says "beware of gargoyle" but he just sits there
if she uploads it, I'll share a link, but I'm not comfy doing that
well, for now anyway. if she posts the footage, i will not be unpunished 😅
double down, tell him to run his sprinklers once in awhile 😂
it's okay, i write things differently sometimes too! that's why we're allowed to ask questions.
i suppose that's fair, I'm just concerned
i don't even know if she'll give me the footage, which part of me kind of hopes she says she's deleting it 😅
I misread yours as Yakity Yak - the 50's "rock" song!
it is okay, this is why i have made an edit.
lol thanks! i always thought that what i did was just common decency tbh, but these comments are showing me that I'm apparently an "above and beyond" kind of person
good thing i don't know how to music
you: eeeeeyup, that's fine there, hasta la pasta

me: ok so i gotta show them that I'm not threatening by putting the box in the absolute best spot possible, but first...RANDOM DANCIIIING!!!
oh yeah no, when we had a dog (rip lil buddy 🥺💜), i would get fully dressed (by which i mean i straight up threw on the nearest dress whether it was inside out or not) before even asking if he had to go potty.
aren't most people uncomfortable at the thought of the world seeing them doing something dumb? i never stated it to her or asked her not to post it, so it's not a set boundary. like i said, she seemed to notice i wasn't comfortable with it, and she still hasn't posted it. she also hasn't gotten back to me about my note so I'm guessing she's not doing anything with it
Just be glad you didn't rip arse on camera lol
You're a good dude. My wife's bestie often has us mind something at their house when they go on vacation. One time, for some reason or other I went with my wife and really had nothing to do. So I did what any guy would do, I started miming two parts of a very over the top bank heist for about 10 minutes to their porch camera. About a week later my wife gets a call as her bestie and hubby are dying laugh at my ridiculous miming that hubby found as he was doing a quick review of the week's footage.

So you accidentally did what took me planning and thinking. :-D Good stuff OP, you need to lean into this and make sure to wave extra every time you see them.

edit: like a Peewee Herman wave without the spanking. (Hopefully not too soon.)
Polite is leaving the box at their gate. Kind and good is showing empathy, considering how what you do may affect them. Thank you for your kindness!
Lmao whoops xD I’m gonna leave it tho bc that’s funny
Smile, you're on candid camera!
previously "Caught on Film", and "Caught on Tape"
Haha I’m actually a realtor and it doesn’t compute in my brain to ever look for cameras. We are just a different kind of bird 🤪
She almost definitely has ADHD. It was almost like watching my younger self. Second hand embarrassment is real.
I’ve yet to play EOW, you recommend?
Yeah even screen doors and it doesn’t matter if the customer gives consent. We still can’t open the doors. I think it’s stupid but I do also understand. One of the other contractors in my terminal actually had a driver have a customer pull a gun on him when he opened the porch door to put the package on the porch as that’s what the instructions said to do. The husband didn’t know the wife had put that in the instructions. So that’s when they really started cracking down on that for my whole terminal. Idk maybe different areas are more relaxed about it but I do know it’s supposed to be an entire FedEx rule
As glorious as I am sure that footage would be I am certain that the recipient of your generosity will spare you that.
With all ingredients written, and the cookies packed airtight and left on the porch there is little chance of accidental allergens as far as I am aware.
It helps that I’m a relatively small, non-threatening woman. My dog adds some potential intimidation factor but our neighbors know her so they know she’s just a fluffy beast who wants to be everyone’s friend. 😅
I understand. two things:

1. people and their opinions cannot rule us. one minute they congratulate us, the next they ridicule us. if those have the power to make you sad or happy, then you're going to be danced around all your life.

2. she should have been taught that ridiculing others is not so productive. or at least she should have taught that and come up with a core value herself. so that she at least didn't do that, if not showing gratutude first. maybe she doesn't know how to express herself, who knows?

after we reach a certain point, we rarely set boundaries for our own sake. we do it to protect others from themselves. I myself haven't reached that point yet, but I'm on my way.
well, i suppose that's a positive
This is absolutely the best kind of friendship and I hope it continues for years and years to come thanks for the smile
all i can picture is that one guy on TikTok that "definitely didn't have his friend's dog in his jacket" 😂😂💜 that's really sweet of you though! i enjoy making people laugh for the most part, i guess i just overthought this situation as much as i overthought box placement!
eh, golden rule and all that. i won't pretend I'm trying to have people over for dinner, but i don't want to be rude. or damage federally protected items such as the mail.
lol you're not selling any property in Michigan, are ya? roomie wants to move there to be by his family and after today, i have no reason to stay here 😂
i haven't actually played it, either, sorry! it looks cute, but the last loz game i actually got was botw, and then a friend let me play a little totk. I'm very much an oot water temple girlie 😅😅
Hi! I'm not OP but I also love Zelda and EOW is wonderful! It's different from other Zelda games (obviously) but in a good way and it still felt very much like Zelda to me. I enjoyed it a lot and highly recommend it to Zelda fans :)
it's just that he'll put other people's packages in their porches or wait for them to come to the door, but our doorbell is inside our porch. I've actually watched him out things on our steps and he hardly even bends down, like he almost tosses them down. this has also led to things getting ruined if we're not home bc he'll leave them in the rain, or if it's winter hell leave them under the one spot that's dripping from the snow melting. it's been like this from the first package that i had delivered to this house. needless to say, FedEx is the only delivery driver i don't leave goodie bags for.
keeping my fingers crossed.
meanwhile I'm 5'11 and quite hefty, so most people are automatically thinking that they're going to have an enemy 🥲🥴
she didn't ridicule me. she thought i did something funny, and wanted to show me because it was, in fact, funny. ironic that you're a "self-improvement coach" when you're not able to listen to what people are point blank telling you.
That's my wife's bestie, she's good people and her hubby is a gem, we'll be keeping them forever. :-) I adopted them into "my people" a long time ago and I take care of my people.
Hey friend, just showing kindness is good enough for me. Keep up what you're doing.
I’m not but I wish you the best of luck!
Yea I feel that, OOT was the shit when I was growing up. I’m still finishing up TOTK. It’s sooooo good.
Thank you Zelda homie! Will definitely have to snag a copy of it.
And I will keep my pinky toes crossed for you, Even though that means I would be deprived of such a entertaining show 🖤
So maybe you need to get a very smol, adorable dog to balance you out??
you're right.
I’m just saying if I can’t have friends in my life that I can be goofy with I don’t need friends cause I’ll be honest. I’m not a super old, but I’m not as young as I once was I’m 31 but I definitely have friends that I can goof off with and be immature at times with Those are the best kinds of people. I’m glad you and your wife have fantastic people in your life to raise your spirits when you’re feeling down and I know you guys returning kind so that’s super cool thanks for giving me a little bit of faith in humanity today.
oot still is the shit and I'll die on this hill 😤😤 that being said, from what i played of totk, it's pretty neat. I'm still annoyed at all the waiting for stamina to recharge in botw bc my brain wants to climb everything Skyrim style 😂😂😂
as much as i appreciate it, that sounds painful. please do not.
2 things on that front: i have a beautiful, lovable, wonderful kitty baby girl that i would gladly take outside if she liked outside, but she dislikes outside unfortunately. now you're probably going "but you can still get a dog!" which would be correct if my sweet, loving Mama's girl didn't try to slap the absolute ass out of any dog she sees, regardless of breed or size. my fuzzy, tortoiseshell baby wuvvums that meows in concern and immediately starts to lick and nuzzle my hands if i say "ouch" because she's getting too rough while playing **has gone absolutely psycho** to not only a Chihuahua and a Shih Tzu, **but also a whole ass Rottweiler.** she's fine with other cats, but any dog? oh, my goodness.
Apparently I accidentally lied, I cannot do it🤣  no harm, just tiny toes
I try not be a crazy dog mom. I love her death but I wouldn’t immediately tell anyone and everyone to get a dog if it’s not the right choice for them. I’ve had cats before too and loved them. Unfortunately I’m extremely allergic to them so unfortunately I will never have another cat so please give yours a little rub from an Internet friend. I definitely know not everyone likes dogs or wants dogs or has a pet or work/life situation that will allow dogs. Enjoy your sweet fluffy baby ☺️
how absolute dA R E- no but like ty for the good wishes 💜
the thing is, i do love dogs! i just also love my tiny brat who yells at me for second breakfast and forces her way into my lap😂💜

i gave her scritches on your behalf. she went "hwlbrrrreow?" and then rolled over and started purring, so i think she accepts your offering 🤷🏻‍♀️
