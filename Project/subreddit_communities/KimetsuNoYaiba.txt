Is this canon?
Impressive if it is

I mean, so were Genya and Gyomei. It wasn't meant to be something only Marked Demon Slayers could accomplish.
what do u mean. the marks right there. 💢
Well he is the Lord of the Mountain
Inosuke is just stronger at base/physically.
Inosuke also passes through all that training faster than Zenitsu. I really would like to see how he fares with Muichiro and Sanemi. Bonus for Mitsuri training , do they just out-flexible each ? ( Inosuke dislocates his shoulder for funsies so flexibility is not a problem for him )
Zenitsu moved it so fast that it happened off camera.
only tanjiro managed to push it all the way in one go tho.
I mean he can move his organs around. He’s special in his own non demon slayer ways.
He's lord of the mountain for a reason 🌸
Good for him
It is, thanks to tempura
Expected nothing less from ***Yama no Kami*** !!
I mean dude is from the mountains though 😌
Insosuke's strength comes purely from motivation. No technique no breathing no bs thinking. Just "He defeated me I have to do this" and that is what is best about him.
Oh wow it’s true! From the slayers that are still living by the end, Insouke, Zenitsu and Kanao are the only ones that didn’t awaken their marks and get to live past 25
Am I wrong or does the mark only take affect when it appears that mark on his head has been there a while
Yeah 🌫
Inosuke is stronger than tanjiro, he moved it without the DS mark and no incantation
Yeah this is perfectly fine! Inosuke been a Beast since the very first moment, we’re talking about the same guy that can dislocate his own bones to fit in holes no one else can and switch his internal organs out of place when you least expect it🤷🏻‍♂️
Tanjiro: My family! Nezuko! Everyone I care about!

Inosuke: TEMPURA 🍤
Chad :3
Yup 🦋
I think because of the tempura hahaha kidding
Its all about Tempura.
Inosuke is just the goat
INOSUKE TO THE END
He wasn't moving the rock. Inosuke just scared the rick into moving itself
*Pure skill*
Inosuke is a beast
Inosuke has always been physically stronger than Tanjiro
yes, its canon-
Well i mean hes the brute of the group. If he never could then thatd be sad
Inosuke is just built different, he was definitely a prodigy.
How do we know that he was doing it without the marks?
Still, I don't think that man is fully human; made his own breathing style, had no mark, and got that good at sword skill without training?
He's a different level of "I don't want to see that in a dark alleyway"
Inosuke be like : ego breathing 1st form
Don't they usually get the mark somewhere on their face?

Inosuke is wearing a mask, whether or not he got a mark, it won't be visible…

So I guess we'll never know
Yeah, Inosuke grew up in the mountains so his base skills are usually higher than Tanjiros in pure base.

Dont forget

>!He was able to go toe with Upper Moon Two (Even if said demon wasn’t being serious) for a good bit, all without a mark!<

I had a stroke reading this
I mean,Dude is from the mountains though!
Unfortunately it is
Yep, he never officially manifests a mark and is just one badass boar man.
That mark was always there, I thought?  Like yoriichi(except not from birth)
He could have hade a Mark and we just did Not See it
Inoske (I can't spell don't judge me) moved that mf out of pure spite
He was super motivated by tempura 🍤
"Big boss Inosuke!"
It's proven that Tanjiro has to be near the person when their blood pressure is high and they have a fever.
Well so did Genya ( he budged it a little) and Gyomei (this one is out of question). Tanjiro's mark doesn't seem complete and it seems to be permanent. Not saying Inosuke didn't do anything impressive but its not a direct compression to a full mark.
inosukes father was chris redfield
It’s cause he’s the king of the mountains duhhh
Inosuke gets stronger as his competition gets stronger. That's how it is 😂
Obviously because he grew up in the mountains. I wouldn’t expect any less from my boar headed king (The ultimate explanation for anything Inosuke ever does)
Didn't they say in the harisha meeting that activating the mark will strengthen those around you, or something?
tanjiro's just special
Tempura Tempura
I am always a fan of zenitsu 💥 dude jst does stuffs in his sleep..😂
Pig Power
Yes it’s canon! Inosuke is one bad MoFo
Did tanjiro's demon slayer mark have an update?? y is it shaped different
He was raised in the wild alone what do you expect
There's a mark right there on his shoulder /s
Inosuke is an actual genius he grew up in the mountains single handedly crafted his breathing technique and has kept pace with everybody in the show/manga man Is a g
That you can see
HI(M)nosuke
Tanjiro = Goku weakest at first but power spikes with constant training. Inosuke = Vegeta raw strength but can never surpass Goku no matter how much training. Zenitsu = Gohan wimpy but unaware of hidden strength
It was not about mark though
. Genya tells about what they need to learn.. Nothing to do with mark
I thought Genya did confirm to be able to move it without a mark already? Or am i missing something within this post?
Most exciting moment of the season right there
Not sure why being marked mattered here yes Inosuke got so pissed he was falling behind that he did it!!
https://preview.redd.it/ho3i6f75a4dd1.jpeg?width=1169&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ca39ab89ed80158a254c87412cc91dcc81868ad

He does it better than anyone
Haven’t watched the new season yet but read the manga. Holy shit. Inosuke tops.
Bro, look at him he made his own breathing techniques, still alive and happy at the end of the training arc and excited to fight some upper demons lol.
He could have been getting it under mask idk🤷‍♂️
How do you know he has a mask on?
Inosuke just can't let himself be outdone by Tanjiroū. Or anyone else for that matter. 
Inosuke wants to be the strongest Demon Slayer full stop. Tanjiroū only wants to get stronger to fight Muzan Kibutsuji
He is the good of the mountains💪🏼
He's built different. 
I mean, isn't he the only one without a breathing style? He just names his moves right?
Yes, inosuke is just built different. You'll see in the Imfinite castle
Yes.  He and Zenitsu never manifested the mark
Rolling a boulder is easy lol
It’s Inosuke. 

Of Course It’s Canon.
I guess he was working out with the boars
Literally the vegeta of the demon slayer world
I would expect nothing less from the King of the Mountain.
Are you guys confused. Him and zenitsu had to hype themselves up just to do it and tanjiro finished first. It's not specific to having a mark
Tbf, couldn't see his head
I haven’t watched season 4 yet but Inosuke has his boar mask on here, is it not just under it?
Yey he is the weakest of the group
Tbh Bro Is Wanting To Be Strong From The Start
How did u know? He’s wearing a mask
Tanjito might have been the strongest demons slayer after yorrichi if he hadn't died. Tanjiro light have been the weakest demon slayer among other named characters if it was not for the the plot armour. Inosuke is the strongest among the new gen wanne be hashira while zenitsu is the best candidate for next hashira. Yes tanjiro is strong only because he is the mc.
Light work for a king of the mountains such as himself
Well, we can't really see his face soo
Inosuke is actually kinda ridiculously strong. Don’t forget, his natural senses work basically like Akaza’s blood demon art. Tanjiro recalls a conversation he had with Inosuke about it while he’s fighting Akaza, and it’s the catalyst for Tanjiro figuring out how to win. Mix that with his Poison immunity, full control over his body (rearranging organs, extending arms, etc), and the fact that he made his own breath style, Inosuke is way stronger than people give him credit for
https://preview.redd.it/sn7fefbs09dd1.jpeg?width=949&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2ddd1eacbc5c46c5b4282d25ddf20ae4a1062d3

it is canon, yes. no mark. guys a beast after all.
This is why Inosuke, in my opinion, has more potential than Zen (even tho he's my fav, I know when he isn't the best at something) If there's something he can't do, he'll continue trying. The process will go so much faster if he sees someone else do it.
It is spherical so that should help a lot tbh
Well... How do you know he didn't use his mark? His face is covered (it's a serious question, is it like a fact he didn't use it or are y'all just saying that)
He doesn't need a demon slayer mark for that, if the King of the Mountain wants a rock moved then it will move
He is wearing a mask so he could have one and we didn't even know. In theory he could have one and not have noticed it himself.
“This slayer keeps pushing the boulder by sheer force of anger alone.”
What I hate is the fact that tanjiro put a lot of work in trying to move that boulder then Inosuke just suddenly moves it when tanjiro does
It's a cannon ball.
INOSUKE SAN IS SUPERIOR!! I SUPPORT INOSUKE SUPREMACY!!!
Of course. 

For what is boulder? Part of the mountain.

Who is King of the Mountain? Exactly.
Baseline Inosuke is stronger than baseline Tanjiro.
I mean that’s the only thing insouks has over tanjiro strength but everything like speed durability iq battle iq skills haxs and etc go to tanjiro
I mean, so were several other characters. And really thanks to the boar head we don't really know if he had the mark or not
Has anyone actually done the calculations on how much the bolder weighs and how much force it would take to move it
Tanjiro's mark wasn't active either.
[removed]
LMFAOOOO he should be dead!!!! HE GOT STABBED IN THE CHEST!!!!!! FUCK THE POISON, YALL HEARD OF BLOOD LOSS???😭😭😭💀💀💀💀 I love this show but the plot armor throws me across the room in laughter
The mark isnt active at all times , so even if tanjiro does have the mark doesnt mean its boosting his power at the moment
He wears a mask tho
How do we know he didn't have a mark if his mask was on the whole time?
He has his mask on so maybe we just didnt see it 😛
I mean, we don’t know what happened under his mask 😅
How do we know. He has a boar mask on
Why TF aren't they rolling it, a teenager could probably roll that thing forward if they tried
Looking at it from a game perspective, Inosuke is the strongest among the three boiz with only base stats. Tanjiro has the inferior base stats but have the best scaling, earliest powerspike, best weapon, and best skillset.
Where you get that only mark could accomplish, it simply means having mark = stronger so inosuke being able to push it without it is impressive
Gyomei is stronger than inosuke and is far more skilled than him. Inosuke pushing the boulder is far more impressive
Wasn’t it confirmed genya has his mark on his left butt cheek
But Tanjiro, Genya, and Gyomei did it due to Repetitive Action(or wtv its called) Inosuke did it js be he wanted to beat Tanjiro
But Genya wasn't able to move it completely. The thing is that Inosuke's strength is shown to be able to push and complete without the mark. Shows his potential from the GROUP OF 3 not the entire the Demon Slayer
Ofc who tf states a mark is required. its just mark makes you stronger so it would be easier to move the boulder
[removed]
As a symbol glows, power courses through you... Authority.
The mark of the Breath of Correction 😭😭💢💢
It looks different from his demon slayer mark, and it has the silhouette of his forehead scar...honestly idfk at this point
What emoji is that
Honestly, Inosuke is an extremely talented guy when you think about it. Pity he did start off with any formal training
It's interesting consider how Tanjiro came to the Hashira  training like a Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I would have really enjoyed seeing how Inosuke faired with Mitsuri's training or if she spent 5 minutes on him and just let him go
Inosuke would finish Obanai’s training in a blink of an eye since he grew up in the mountains w all those obstacles
Unironically, Mitsuri would have been the best teacher for him. The flexibility of attack... a level of physical power (before breathing) that pretty much no one else can match... an affinity for love that he doesn't understand even when it smacks him in the face... it would be hilarious.
If you put tempura at the finish line Inosuke would’ve finished in one go
Well mark is a huge boost. if this inosuke really did it at base then its more impressive
in one go???? it literally took him multiple days and multiple tries
And? It was possible only using the mark so whats your point?

Still what Inosuke did is more impressive by a long shot
This is cool, but just not true. He learned TCB on his own, and mastered constant TCB like Tanjiro and Zenitsu did. He was also using the repetition technique Gyomei and Genya use to push the rock. He even makes fun of Genya for not being able to use breathing techniques.
The age limit thing is a myth
It's stated that it's getting darker, and also does get darker and darker over the course of the series, implying that it is now always active. The anime didn't portray that as well as the manga.
Take effect*
I thought him repeating tempura then pushing the boulder was his way of repetitive movement
Was it Rick C137?
Because he doesn't have one
Wel mark is kinda big deal i doubt they would not let us know if someone activated it
🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
Yes!
Manga spoilers:

>!As you've already seen, Mitsuri's is on her neck. But Gyomei's is on his forearms and Iguro's is on his left arm. So they can appear anywhere. And Inosuke never got it.!<
The only base skills he has that is higher than tanjiro is at most physical strength.
Why? It's perfectly understandable.
He doesn't
No it just spread, allowing those people manifest if too
Tought himself language too?? A true genius lmao
Mark boost your strength, so it would be easier to do it with it
He probably ate a demon to boost his strength, its not about the mark itself, its the boost in strength to make it easier to push the boulder
Obviously mark boost one's strength? Stronger = easier to push the boulder
No he has Beast Breathing or whatever, he made it himself
Then do it
Not rolling when they are pushing it
He is very strong
Based on [this statement](https://imgur.com/PGCGZ75), I believe that it is now permanently active like >!Yoriichi's was!<
????? nobody was hating on inosuke?? stating that other characters did it as well is not hate???
Imagine being such a fanboy that you are manifesting haters out of thin air just to argue with them. Like what the fuck?
Did you not pay attention when he said he can rearrange his vital organs at will and also stop his bleeding?
Because he takes it off in the Infinity Castle
He takes it off in the manga
First of all it's part of the training to get stronger, and second of all no teenager could roll that thing
No
Zenitsu unlocked hidden perks after putting all his skill points into the level 1 offensive skill.
Inosuke runs on spite, madness and his lack of understanding. There's nothing he can't do.
And Zenitsu is there to roleplay
I mean even in final selection we were told inosuke did it in like record time or sum I can't remember
Well tanjiro is the main character 😅
Why is Tanjiro's sword stronger? If anything, Inosuke's razor dual swords are stronger and dealier against both demon and humans
Lmao that's one way to look at it.
In Paul’s got raw stats, Tanjiro can self buff, Zenitsu spams a single broken ability.
Is Inosuke stronger than Tanjiro?
the sense of touch is his strong suit so you could say it makes sense
Strongest with base stats would be the gun guy since he can move the boulder without using a breathing style right?
And sun breathing is the best attack type against demons as well
Wow. A souls gamer here people. 🫶
Tanjiro literally kicked his ass in hand to hand combat didn’t he?
Huh? What game?

Immediate edit: oh you’re saying to explain it from a gaming perspective. Not bringing up some actual demon slayer game that’s worth bringing up. I’m stupid.
[deleted]
Almost like looking at it from a game perspective isn't a good way to look at it, because it's not a game and game logic doesn't apply
I'm not trying to say that Inosuke pushing the rock isn't impressive at all, I'm saying it wasn't impressive that he was doing it *without a Mark*. It was an exercise intended to be possible for Demon Slayers who don't have Marks, such as Genya. If it were intended to only be possible for Demon Slayers with Marks, and he could push it anyway, *then* it would be impressive that he's doing it without a Mark. As it stands, it's just impressive, no modifier.
Bro what
uooohhh
Fuck, I really went back and forth on upvoting or downvoting this.
buddy chill
I think they’re being sarcastic lmfaooo

ETA: finally get to use this: r/whoosh
It's 💢
Inosuke is the most impressive of the three considering he literally made up his own style with informal training and was able to keep up.
Knowing him he probably saw it like a challenge and tried to compete flexibility with Mitsuri but she would just see it as harmless fun when he sees it as a real contest
i could see gyomei dangling a tempura from a stick in front of him like a cat 💀
Yes, but he did it with repetitive motions like genya. Tanjiro could probs do it markless using repetitive motions as well.
In one go after he learned the proper way to do it - through repetitive motions. When he started to push the boulder in ep 6, he didnt stop until he reached the end in ep 7. Genya and inosuke both used the same technique but still couldn't complete the exercise. And that's bcos they dont have the mark boost.
my point is that if tanjiro didnt have the mark, he'd still be able to do it with repetitive motions. the mark just helped him get it all the way.
Not really. Having a mark in and of itself is impressive. Inosuke has the more impressive base, sure, but Tanjiro is overall more impressive.
Yeah I  am not talking about his motivation to learn these things. I'm saying his sole motivation is competition.
They never said it was a myth. We’re told straight up that every demon slayer who’s unlocked it dies before the age of 25 due to the heavy toll it takes on the body (with the exception of Gyomei who unlocked it at 28 and died hours later, and Yorrichi who was born with it). 

In the postquel manga that appeared in Fan Book 2, Tanjiro says a few words about accepting his short life and being prepared for it. So although not explicitly being shown the deaths of the living slayers, it’s implied that those who achieved the mark during the final battle die before 25 based on the facts that we know.
I hope it's a myth. Makes the ending even more depressing. 🥲
Maybe you're right
Maybe it spread to him and it's just hidden under the mask on his beautiful face? (Idk, i didn't read the mangas)
No he didn’t. Genya quite literally explained that it’s possible without the mark or any breathing abilities through repetitive motion. Also there’s no demons around the training area or anywhere as they were all waiting in the infinity castle. Genya did it in his human state so i don’t think it’s that impressive if inosuke did too 🤷
Three of which didn’t have a mark to boost them at the time so this only mattered for one.
cry kid
That MAKES ZERO SENSE THOUGH, HE WASNT HASHIRA LVL AT THAT FIGHT😂😂😂 my man was still losing lots of blood as he was slicing Dali
Ah yes now I remember, you're right
Oh ok. I haven’t read the manga
Dude picked the cheesiest ability and honestly kept with it through thick and thin
I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
I want this game 😭 imagine an open world demon slayer game where you chose your breathing style and built your own character. Then fighting through demon after demon until you finally help take down Muzan? I wish I could make a game like that myself. I can only beat games, though. I can't make them 😫
The "Maple" of Speed
Zenitsu is basically a warlock who picked all the Eldritch Invocations that buffed Eldritch Blast.
inosuke’s entrance into the infinity castle was cold asf
The fastest in attack and movement speed i guess
Wasnt the final selection a trial in which they had to survive a week on that demon infested mountain top? How do you do that in record time?
He's using yorichi sword
Hes using a legendary blade of the strongest demon slayer
In reality Inosuke's swords would be really bad because he basically destroyed his Katana blades :D
Baseline? Absolutely. Everything but his head is (ironically) stronger. 

Tanjiro carves through demons using his breathing that has a major focus on precision. Inosuke does it by just swinging with raw power. Also, that generation's graduates all have an affinity for a different sense. Inosuke's is Touch. His physical body is his best attribute, like Tanjiro's nose is for him. Inosuke also carves up demons that gave Tanjiro trouble, in terms of durability. Often not by much, but look at the attack on Mugen Train, where Inosuke had to attack first to reveal the weak point for Tanjiro. Look at Spider Dad that Tanjiro straight up couldn't hurt, but Inosuke at least got his blades to sink in before snapping.

Inosuke is 100% the physically strongest of the three main boys.
Zenitsu is never able to push his boulder, making him physically weaker than Tanjiro, Inosuke, Kanao, and Genya who all did push their boulders (Tanjiro the only one who needed to be Marked to do it)
They never said demon slayer mark.
You downvote I upvote?
No like the name
All while crying and taunting him. “ this poor boar lad, can’t get any tempura, namu amida butsu”
He grew up in the mountains and you don't know what the person who trained him taught him. Also, it's a fucking anime.
Zenitsu has crap everything but OP Ash of War
Zenitsu is basically a warlock spamming enhanced Eldritch Blast.
If it ain’t broke
Like an old Ragnarok Online PVPer with every point in attack speed.
The megunim of subaverse
Bro is a genji main fr
I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 sword techniques once, but I fear the man who has practiced one sword technique 10,000 times.
"I fear not the man who has practiced 10000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10000 times."

-Bruce Lee
So does that mean Gyomei practiced 10,000 kicks 10,000 times? 😂
Bruce Lee 2024
Why does every game these days have to be open world I kinda miss linear games
A sekiro style game where you play through the main story would be amazing as well
You could say that. He's like 4th Hokage fast. I remember his skill didn't have cooldown. He could go again and again and again. It doesn't one shot strong demons like how we seem many Hashira do but you can almost see the enemy's lifebar steadily going down with each strike of that level 1 skill. He'll just keep hitting you until you're HP is zero.
Bro got no idea what’s happening and doesn’t care, he just wants to fight something
He has the best sword skill as hes never cracked his blade or destroyed it.
Tanjiro is faster in attack speed, which we will see later.
Not that bit, it was like U have to rush up the mountain and down the other side or something, I think after the actual final selection they were saying he's basically unscathed and rushed down the mountain to the finish and got his nichirin before the other 4 (?) even got down there

He didn’t need to be marked. Even tho the scene looked that way the whole point of tanjiros training was to maintain his mark. So he used the boulder training to do it. If kanao and normal corp members are expected to push the boulder then ofc tanjiro can without the mark lmao.
https://emojipedia.org/anger-symbol
and then inosuke gets pissed off and tries to outdo gyomei, completely forgetting about the tempura in the process XD
Bro I’m saying the plot armor is crazy. Obviously it’s an anime, just read a bit and think a bit longer. I’ve reread the manga like four times. All I’m saying is it’s ridiculous.
Blasphemous blade AOW spam and win
Zenitsu is just playing with pre Nerf rivers of blood.
Suddenly D&D huh
Don't fiddle with it
Nezuko did.
Less agency for the player. Takes away a whole element of exploring. Generally smaller games, likely played faster with less replay value. 

The happy medium to me is God of War style. While open world(ish) it makes you progress at certain parts and directs you, but also allows you to go off and see how much of the area you can clear.
For real that would be so awesome. In that case, I'd expect to just playthrough as Tanjiro from start to finish. Maybe play as some other characters for certain parts or specific fights.
If that's the case then Zenitsu tops in movement speed
He also stole his original sword from a demon slayer he beat up and proceeded to invent his own breathing style
Ah, okay.
His new sword, the one from the mechanical training doll
It's theorized that people with black swords have an affinity for sun breathing. They mention that people with black swords don't last that long. This may be due to using breathing styles they aren't suited to.
Soulsborne ass katana
Wow just wow. Do one for Gyomei"s Flail and axe.
I think you played too much ARPG my dude.
That's fair IG. I didn't expect the protagonist of doki doki literature club to be a demon slayer buff though
Outdo Gyomei? Lol. Inosuke has a reminder of what happens when you try to "outdo Gyomei".
Read the manga, it gives a lot more information on Inosuke.
Pre-nerf Bloodhound's Step
For suuuuuure!. Daki was pissed about that 😂 "iS tHaT alL yOu CaN dO?! iS  kIcK?!"
Thats fair. However I am worried that if every game feels the pressure to be open world it will exponentially increase development times and development costs
Or even a Rising revengance style game if they're worried about accessibility.
Idiot savant perk for sure
Ohh, I'm sorry I kinda forgot
>! During long time Muzan and Kokushibo hunted and killed the Sun breathing users until the point sun breathing become unknown and disappeared, that is why there is the believe that black sword users doesn't last long.!<
this and Muzan order 66-ed sun breathing users that it got wiped out, only surviving as a kagura getting passed down in the kamado family
Yuri was playing too much so I had to join tanjiro and the crew
never stopped him from trying before lol

lightning enhanced swift step with the backhand blades
Some games def shouldn't be open world. That being said, Kakarot is one of my favorite DBZ games, Legend of Zelda has always been open world, and they kick ass at it! GTA is so much fun. My point is, I can definitely see the potential of an open world Demon Slayer game. Side note, have you seen the experimental Open World Naruto game on You Tube?

https://youtu.be/bqs3q7kXFfo?si=-Y5kxSnHudnrzUr-
different genre, demon slayer is adventurous, it could work as open world
I've never played that. Is it a more linear style?
i love your flair
Blinkbolt with swift step would amazing
Zelda hasn't been really open world until botw tho, the other games are still linear, they just have a world to explore but the game still points you in 1 direction
They could also be similar to monster hunter having quests and areas instead of full open world
Thanks bestiee🥰
Google: "Is the original Legend of Zelda open world?

Answer: Yes, the original The Legend of Zelda, released in 1986 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), is an open-world game. In open-world games, players can freely approach objectives, rather than following a more linear and structured path. The Legend of Zelda also features nonlinear gameplay. 

More recent Legend of Zelda games, such as Breath of the Wild (2017) and Tears of the Kingdom, also feature open-world gameplay and settings. Breath of the Wild is considered to have a revolutionary approach to open-world game design, trusting players to find their own way to the endpoint instead of overwhelming them with quests and map icons.

_


This is a true fact stated by Shigeru Miyamoto in 1986: "I wanted to create a game world that conveyed the same feeling you get when you are exploring a new city for the first time. How fun would it be, I thought, if I could make the player identify with the main character in the game and get completely lost and immersed in that world?"
true true
yw! :)
I would be furious
But how can tanjiro smell emotions??

I'd assume it's better than having him say he wants to smell my armpits, but that's just me

Honestly different emotions do smell different due to biochemistry.

Fear is bitter and so is pain to a lesser degree, anger and rage is acrid, joy is light and somewhat sweet, happiness has a sunshine/amber note to it, sadness has a musty or heavy note and arousal... well that scent is distincty yet complex and the easiest to pickup, but different person to person.

But these scent notes are layered on top of the person's base scent, so it's easier to know when they are someone close to you or who you interact with often so their base scent is something you know.

My sense of smell isn't the norm but I always thought others got this to a lesser degree.

I am empathetic but these scents also let me know how people are feeling sometimes.

It also helps me when picking out perfumes/colognes as a gift as I can pickup on what would work with the base scent.
Nah, she seemed more relieved than mad.
Regarding the question about tanjiro being able to smell emotional status of a person everyone release pheromones just like a dog knows when the owner pregnant or in distressed, tanjiro is capable of smelling those pheromones too and the trio is based around senses
Tanjiro is smell he can use his nose like a dog
Zenitsu is hearing he can detect sounds like an directional microphone 
Inosuke is tact he can sense air vibrations and can feel when people are looking towards him like a sixth sense
That’s hilarious 😂😂😂
Tanjiro diff :3
Could never be me
I fucking died reading this😭🙏
This is how I feel when it comes to Sanemi.
LMAO 😭😭
But u already mad

GIRLY I HAVE THE SAME IMAGE

I WAS GONNA INCLUDE IT BUT I DELETED IT FROM MY CAMERA ROLL SO
Imagine making your uncontrollable rage constantly for the fandom to say yr happy and joyful. I would snap.
Womp womp
I wouldn’t believe my ears 😆
Well, he's not wrong...
Tanjiro is part Labrador.   Dogs can smell human emotions by detecting chemical changes in the body that happen due to moods.
This makes the situation much more funny to me
He didn’t skip nose day
Its funny to wonder if he just guessed and didn't actually use his supernatural smelling.
Why is that so relatable
I'm still sad how she went. Just such a brutal end to her character. It's fitting though and isn't a bad end to her character at all. I feel like out of all the hashira who were 'grounded' she was probably one of the more developed ones of the bunch.
Tanjiro:

The Kamoboko squad is just the personified versions of the five senses.
WHAT IS THAT ABOVE YOUR MESSAGE!?!?!??!?!!
At least that can be explained, like when people talk, and he's very acute to the tone (and therefore the emotions) of the people talking.
Bro that makes sense because anyone can hear emotions lol and with zenitsu’s hearing it’s even worse
Do tell

Yeah youre right mate, I think that boar has really good vision, it was either that or being able to feel vibrations from far away 🏴‍☠️
yep, rage, calm, and fear
Very true
It’s a flair
Theoretically, certain emotional responses elicit different hormone expression which could affect the smell of a person… but it would be so subtle that Tanjiro legit has to be superhuman to catch it. Also it’s funny that we never see him suffer from enhanced sense of smell because that sounds like a NIGHTMARE. My mom is just sensitive about average but bad smells throw her off very quickly

Sorry about those downvotes, but you're right. Rengoku is awesome
good bot
Inosuke got enhanced sense of touch, that's why he needs to be shirtless all the time. Beast breathing let him sense thing from really far away. He also got enhanced 6th sense. 

Kanao is the one with enhanced vision.
Second one, Tanjiro-Smell, Zenitsu- Hearing, Inosuke- Touch, Kanao- Sight, Genya- Taste
https://preview.redd.it/8qzwi6i9tzpd1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d58936d348f7dd4fcddafd1d02c93a744b3b042
There’s a fun theory about how different breath users have enhanced senses.

Water breathers have enhanced smell: (Urokodaki, Tanjiro)

Thunder breathers (and derivatives) have enhanced hearing (Tengen, Zenitsu

Wind breathers (and derivatives) have enhanced Touch (Sanemi, Inosuke)

Flame breathers (and derivatives) have enhanced Taste (Renkogu, Mitsuri)

Flower breathers have enhanced sight (Kanae, kanao)

It also led to the theory that Genya could have been a flame breath user
Yeah, I knew I was probably wrong about that, thanks for the information mate 🏴‍☠️
I really wish we got to see Kanao’s *special eyes* before the penultimate arc…
Pretty sure him being shirtless is cus he was raised in the wild

Ironic (>!She becomes blind in an eye after the final battle!<)
Enhanced vision until the vision wasn’t very enhanced anymore… she could probably count as legally blind by the end of the manga
Genya makes a lot more sense.  I was thinking nezuko specifically couldn't taste, because demon eat human.
https://preview.redd.it/k01e122ytzpd1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=539afa0fd80103611c1f78d9612ae46d7e8c54a5
Genya didn't *taste* anything, he just *ate* the demons' flesh. I don't think he has a very enhanced taste, or else he wouldn't be able to eat demons (I suppose demon flesh is yuck).
Nice theory 
I like it and there is material to argue your points.

Not seeing the Genya part too much but the others are very interesting.
Stone breathers are just built different
It’s probably both
Have you ever put something on a cat for the first time? They get so confused lol I imagine inosuke would've the same problem
The manga ended but some people are anime only, y'know  
don't spoil
Well, Nezuko is more of the heightened sense of all 5 since she's a demon, while Genya not only has the most strongest jaw but can also get the powers of a demon after eating it
🤨📸
The Genya theory sort of has it that: Genya tried to learn Wind breathing to be like his brother, but not being attuned to it, he couldn’t learn it, twin that with his abilities to eat/ie taste demons, it lead to a theory that he was attuned to flame breath, just that nobody realised, and by that point, Rengoku was dead.

It’s better than the “Genya is Asthmatic” theory IMO
Stone breathers actively Nerf themselves to make it a fair fight against the demons
Probably because cats have no concept of clothes and think it's a trap
Yeah I just forgot genya existed
Genya couldn’t use basic breathing techniques regardless of which type of breathing. The issue wasn’t that he was trying to learn wind, he would’ve been able to make a modicum of progress even if he wasn’t attuned to it.
The mental fortitude of this is moment is astounding 
To dive more into detail, he completed it while lying on the floor, dying of poison, and forcefully stopping his heart from pumping blood to halt circulation.

From a biological perspective, the brain requires a continuous supply of oxygen to function properly. When the heart stops, it also halts the circulation of oxygen to the brain. Within seconds, brain cells begin to die. Within minutes, brain damage occurs, leading to impaired functions, loss of consciousness, and potentially death.

So, while dying of poison, dying of blood loss, his brain becoming impaired as brain cells rapidly die, he was still able to maintain his focus. Even more so, he analyzed Gyutaro's fighting habits and attacks, converted them into sound, and read it like sheet music that essentially became cheat sheet to Gyutaro's entire fighting style and moves.

It even works with the line he screams at Tanjiro when he gets slashed in the eye: “Don’t STOP!!!”

Like he knows times up for him, but if he can just create an opening for Tanjiro, it’ll be worth it. Dude put absolutely everything on the line, and was 100% willing to die just for the slightest chance of victory. 

What an absolute Chad.
And they say... They say he is the weakest base hashira... 💜
Uzi vert said “your moves are a trash ass beat”
You guys, read this before you put him at the weakest out of all the hashiras especially in base


Only reason Tengen didn't die near immediately like any other slayer who gets cut by Gyutaro would (beside inosuke who's also resistant to poison) is due to his resistance to poison, now let me break it to you like this

Tengen is the 2nd most experienced, fastest in running, 2nd physically strongest, with the best senses alongside Gyomei out of all the hashira.
     My guy literally has echolocation as one of his breathing forms. All in base. Rengoku has complimented his swordsmanship in the databooks 

And he was still cut by Gyutaro, although keep in mind Gyutaro did not pull out his sickles until the last moment when Tengen leapt at him, so it was a surprise. 
              Gyutaro went for the head, but Tengen deflected it a bit so it scratched him, and that was enough to weaken him the entire fight and bring him near death if he didn't stop his own heartbeat 
 
(which I don't see any other hashira doing either to be honest beside gyomei possibly, sanemi might be pushing it as holding in your guts for a bit, and completely stopping your heart for a decent amount of time with your muscles, then resuscitating yourself are 2 different  levels of muscle strength)

 Anyone else who's even scratched by Upper 6 like that by any of his attacks, especially the surprise attack that caught even the 2nd most experienced hashira Tengen ( which will be pretty much everyone beside Gyomei ) 
they will die 100% in due time, within minutes or less, and quickly their fighting ability will be rendered useless and they won't even be able to breathe. Remember how quick it worked on Tanjiro someone who is not resistant to poisons as Tengen or Inosuke.

 (Also, Tengen at moments fights off Daki and Gyutaro by himself keep in mind, alongside keeping the boys and civilians safe. The fight was won with 0 CASUALTIES. ZERO. Not even any of the 3 wives kicked the bucket). 

Put some respect on his name.

Also literally every hashira level slayer who fought an uppermoon had help beside zenitsu and rengoku. And Rengoku died protecting the gang, so having help against an uppermoon is very common

( and no Kaigaku is not stronger than Gyutaro either, he was not even experienced with his BDA and was a brand new uppermoon. Though it's still impressive Zenitsu beat him without too much trouble.)
Absolutely. I won’t stand for the Tengen disrespect.
Tengen with two arms, the demon slayer mark and musical score would’ve been insane.
This man was a hype machine
[removed]
How funny/cool would it have been if during battles he kept lamenting that he can’t get the right “score” of the battle to go all out, and then this scene happened where he’s just overjoyed “it’s ready.”
Tengens will power is unbelievable. Comparing him to Muichiro, who was ready to die in upper moon 5’s water bubble thing and ultimately saved by plot armor, I believe tengen is top three if he had a better sword style/ sword skills. I could be wrong and it’s my opinion, but Tengen is severely underrated. Not to mention Entertainment Disctrict arc is the turning point in the story and Tengen did it without a slayer mark. Thoughts?
Just let's go!!! :3
“WERE GOING FOR THE WIN”
He can’t be weaker than Shinobu who can’t even behead a demon.
MY MUSICAL SCORE TECHNIQUE, WILL TAKE US TO VICTORYYYY!!!!!!!!!
i saw this video on yt short and it explained that gyutaro fixes his mistakes. when gyutaro first attack tanjiro for the chin, tengen saved him from the left so gyutaro cut his arm so he can't save tanjiro again. then again gyutaro attacked tanjiro but then he came from the left again so gyutaro cut his left eye so he couldn't see from the left. then when he attacked tanjiros chin again, he successfully hit him.
![gif](giphy|V69LhUggYIg6qmKUoD|downsized)
I would also point out that my guy was wielding 2 two swords, each one probably weighing 5lbs each plus the chain connecting them like they were nothing… while missing a hand. The mental and physical fortitude of the flashiest slayer is amazing. By far my favorite arc
It’s crazy to think no hashira was able to defeat an upper moon yet every upper moon up until now was defeated by a hashira with tanjiro lol
Very off topic, but it’s hilarious that the people who dislike powerscaling started the powerscaling comments lmao
https://i.redd.it/hwiu6sn5dkdd1.gif

It’s crazy how peak this arc was, I hope the final showdown lives up to it when it drops in like four years 😭
That entire fight sequence is masterful from start to finish. 

AND THE MUSIC DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED
The amount of adrenaline I could feel through the screen was kinda scary. I have a vivid imagination and sometimes it will start making the situation on screen feel more real then it ever should.
The resilience and determination of the Hashira and Tanjiro really kick the emotion of the fights to ridiculous levels, and despite the simplicity of the story it makes it feel extremely gripping. There's still several big moments just like this yet to come in the anime, very excited to see them
Mhm
He's an absolute chad
Tengen is easily one of the most badass characters I've ever seen. 😎
its anime real life logic doesnt apply here and probably author didnt put much thought on that thing so i think its pretty pointless

Peak!
Best fight scene. The music puts it over the top for me.
One of my favorite moments in the entire anime
That’s strange
Quite literally rewatching this season rn💀
Wait is the newest season out???
>From a biological perspective

I don't think this anime follows a lot of biological logic lol.
look all I’m saying is that if he was good to go for the infinity castle arc, shit would’ve been a lot different
bros out here playing beatsaber
Strongest unmarked hashira easily
By far the best arc in series
Favorite Hashira and everyone ranks him too low
Sekiro players
He was playing beat saber on INSANE difficulty with ONE hand
I would chalk it up to adrenaline
Was poisoned
Had his arm chopped off 
And still was holding his own against an upper moon demon 

Hes not the weakest
He is the standard for all hashira to follow
where os everyone wathing this?
WE'RE GOING FOR THE WIN!
Not to downplay his fortitude but adrenaline is one hell of a drug
I'll be honest - I don't think the Hashira recently have topped Tengen and Rengoku. Those dudes just had so much heart and drive.
Tanjiro really said: I think he’s losing it
Lmao another bs KNY author pulls out of his half knowledge of biology
ngl bar shinobu i dont really know which hashira is weaker than tengen. every other hashira literally fought against other upper moons and actually held their own
>! muichiro solod upper 5 and was important in the fight against upper 1
mitsuri held her own against upper 4 and pulled off muzan arms with her own brute strength
gyomei is obv the strongest
obanai cld be the weakest maybe? but he can spar against both muichiro and sanemi, and was impactful in the fight against muzan
giyu was impactful in upper 3 fight and survived against muzan with his limbs
sanemi was impt in upper 1 fight, and survived muzan 
maybe rengoku cld be weaker? since he lost to upper 3 and we cldnt really see any of his feats
and shinobu, p much didnt do much and had to rely on poisoning herself to stand a chance against upper 2. 

overall tengen is probably bottom 3 or worse, perhaps only shinobu and rengoku being weaker, and perhaps sanemi being weaker !<
I mean… it’s kinda just extreme shonen nonsense, though. Like don’t get me wrong, it’s awesome, but the fantasy of it kinda limits how inspiring it can be. Like forcefully stopping your own heart would just kill you. Or leave your muscles so weak you wouldn’t be able to get back up. So he can have all the mental fortitude he wants if the author is just going to pretend even the most basic biological realities don’t matter.
So you honestly think the writer took all that into account when he was writing this part? Some of you fans, anime fans in general, will grasp at anything for whatever agenda you have with these characters. You’re taking realistic standards for humans and applying them to fictional characters when all the writer was trying to do was make a cool moment or push the story a certain way.
Wow man who would’ve guessed a fictional character could do something so crazy
JUMP!!!
I have discovered I absolutely slept on Demon Slayer. I watched the first season and liked it, but didn’t jump back in till recently. Very solid Shonen(?) anime.
Truly an egoist mindset
who said that???
People get so caught up they ignore what he had against him. 

First of all him being top 3 in the arm wrestling and 1st in racing gives us an idea where he's at physically. 

He also had to fight Gyutaro with a lot of factors against him.

Tanjiro was very injured, Tengen takes notices and uses techniques he wouldn't normally use to keep Gyutaros attention on him. 

Gyutaro can also see what Daki sees and control her which allows him to attack Tengen from any spot. We see Tengen get his blindspots attacked (Luckily, Tanjiro was there) 

Also the poison was sapping his strength and with only one hand, when he perfected his musical score technique, the narrator stated that Tengen was capable of finishing Gyutaro off but the poison was taking its toll. 

Tengen is in my opinion top 3 base Hashira. But they're all capable of beating the other. 

We see both Mitsuri and Muichiro need their marks to beat/contend with their upper moon demons. 

I for sure think Tengens gets downplayed
Lmao bro they knew they couldn’t give this man a DSM 😂 blud would really be him
While having 1 arm, being half dead, having enough poison in his system to kill anyone else, he went toe to toe with an Upper Moon going 100%. Compare that to unmarked Muichiro and Mitsuri, who both lost immediately to their respective Moon. Everyone knows Shinobu is the weakest one anyways 
I get so cheesed about that, my boi would’ve gone insane with his mark 💔

At least he gets the trade off of having easily the best life of all the hashira’s 😂
I believe,  I can't remember how to spoiler tag but out of the other slayers only Sanemi could control his muscles enough to stop the poison from spreading like Tengen did. I think gyomei could stale mate them with tanjiro trio or do sacrifice himself to give them the chance
Is this. . . An Overwatch reference?!

And they say, and they say, and they say!
That’s because he is the weakest Hashira..? Why exactly is he strong to you? I don’t seem to understand
Yaboyroshi??
"Why are you sweating?"
I haven't read the manga but I sure as hell would have loved to see Tengen in the Infinity Castle. Would have made some epic flashes alongside Gyomei.
Im pretty sure ppl got hurt or died in the district but it was a major attack it wasn't really a him thing. 
It's pretty much a rock paper scissor situation 
I've literally been saying the same thing. (well not the exact same words but you feel me) People REALLY underestimate Tengen because of this fight. When they should be doing the opposite. Just because it's upper moon 6, who by Muzan's words "was held back by Daki" (This is just a head canon, but I think Gyutaro should probably have been upper 4)
In base maybe not. But if you account for all the buffs and upgrades other hashiras got later he is definitely the weakest and it's not even close. 

Remember the ranking of the moon are strictly based on their strength, there's no room to argue about it.
Finally,someone who understand Tengen. I really hate how he's put last just bcs of the enemies he fought. He's easily one of the strongest hashiras ever,and like you said(EXPERIENCED).
Thank you for showing him the respect he deserves my friend😭😭😁

It seems you dropped this W king 👑
Yeah, however for me he is still the 2 weakest (beating only Shinobu) but that is not his fault. The only reason he can be considered one of the weakest is because he is one of only 3 Hashiras who never unlocked the Demon Slayer Mark (others being Shinobu and Rengoku). The rest got a major power boost while he (and Rengoku and Shinobu) never got that same power boost. Infact, he (and Rengoku) never got a chance to unlock it since Tanjiro only got his during the Upper Moon 6 battle, and he had to get it in order for others to get it. If we were to rank the Harshira without the marks, I'm sure Tengen would at least be top 5 (others being Gyomei, Muichiro, Rengoku, and Sanemi)

Also yes, I am putting Rengoku over Tengen but that is mostly just on word because a good portion of the Hashiras couldn't believe that Rengoku lost to Upper Rank 3, including Tengen (and most likely weren't thinking of the idea that Akaza was holding back) while Tengen didn't even believe that he could even beat Daki and Gyutaro alone.
Tengen is the weakest, he would've been killed in minutes without Tanjiro and others, barely keeping up with Gyutaro
Yeah. People really be saying that "He's the weakest hashira" Just because he was fighting upper 6. Who was literally said to be held back
That's why they got rid of him .. he would be more popular that tanjiro and his sun breathing power
>! Retired hashiras were tasked to guard Nezuko !<
Lost an eye and hand and retired
He’s retired and not part of the Corp anymore. He isn’t going to take part in their war against demons anymore. At least not on the front lines.
10/10, best hashira, extra flashy
How was it plot armor? If anything Kotetsu had the plot armor.

Mui saved Kotetsu bc of what Tanjiro/his father said. That paid off as they said it would.

Kotetsu is the one with the ass pull here.
It just makes sense narrative wise?
Yeah. But if you apply this logic to anime, in general, especially shonen then there aren’t any badass moments in any show. They’re all unrealistic
Where in my post did I say the author took into account the neurological effects topping one’s heart has on the brain? It was just a cool thing I noticed involving oxygen in a show where breathing is key for humans in that world. Some of you guys gotta lighten up, jeez
*sickle slash*

“HE PAVED THE WAY FOR YOU AND YOU STILL MISSED YOUR CHANCE!”
I'm so happy you revisited the show, dude. Glad to have you here.
Have you gotten to hashira training arc yet?
It brings back the classic 90s fight structure.
a LOT of people... Their argument is: "He got clapped by the weakest uppermoon 🤓☝️"
You wouldn't even believe how many people
many do. yet not a single hashira could solo him either lol.
Circumstances don't matter to powerscalers. Some people downplay him to such a degree they claim he lost the fight, even though he literally fought until the very end. I don't get shounen fandoms lol.
There’s also the fact he’s the *only* Hashira to have killed an Upper Moon **without** the Demon Slayer mark. Literally no one other Hashira can make the same claim.
To counter, everyone almost died. His reckless investigation skills got people dead.
YESSIR
People did die, when Daki ripped up the houses when one guy walks out yelling at em.

Was also before Tengen got there.

I don't think anyone died while Tengen was around.
https://preview.redd.it/or1c15vn2udd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9578be38fd09721570925f92f078b7cb0f387ca

Muzan only said Gyutaro would have won against Tengen's group had he fought alone, he never said Gyutaro is stronger than Gyokko let alone Hantengu
Shinobu would be the weakest as she never got a mark either, Rengoku also would be above Shinobu but below Tengen he never got his mark either.

I don't know how you can watch season 2, read all that and still claim he's the weakest .
Why do you have Rengoku above Tengen for?

Tengen has him beat in strength, experience, senses, swordsmanship, destructive capability, abilities due to the musical score, stealth, and running speed?
People are trash. The weakest upper moon is still a fucking upper moon.
marked incorrectly sir
Not to mention what can he even do in the Castle. Any Upper would dog walk him since he doesn’t have a mark
You didn’t have to say it you’re still operating on the assumption that whatever you’re headcannon is exist with some level of consideration within the story. If you thought otherwise then this wouldn’t be a post
“WWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH”

That VA must’ve took that numbing stuff for your throat when you’re sick, you can hear his vocal chords burning
I just started it actually! I have a hard time reading subtitles in my 30s, as my mind is all over the place after work. I keep missing bits of info lol. Crunchyroll had a few dubbed episodes though. I’d like to pick up the manga when things slow down though. Reading is easier in book form for some reason
How would you describe that fight structure? Not disagreeing just genuinely curious what the difference is
yeah but the weakest upper moon (personally) doesn't seem like the weakes to me. They did more damage than four and five...
And they forget he defeated UM6 without the mark
The weakest upper moon, who uses poison which was slowing him down, and if anyone but Tengen fought Gyutaro the poison would have killed them.
Gyutaro is the weakest upppermoon since the other moons are stronger, but that’s because his poison would essentially be useless in a fight to move up. Against humans he’s easily way more of a hard fight than 4 and 5. Any pillar but Gyomei would’ve died against gyutaro in like 3 minutes
Can you send me any examples of people saying this?  Modt people who call him the weakest Hashira are including Marked Hashira, not just everyone in Base
Morons.
he is also not the second strongest in base probably 5-6
He was my second favorite hashira.
The powerscalers on this sub only look at ranks, so they keep shitting on Tengen because Gyutaro was UM6.

If you so much as make a post that Gyutaro is weaker than Gyomei as a demon, but stronger against humans due to his poison, people go apeshit and refuse to acknowledge it. 

They don’t understand how abilities work nor do they understand counters. Other Hashira would’ve died against Gyutaro.
Powerscaling can be fun in just that it's for fun discussions.

But it's like people aren't going back to reread or rewatch in case it was overlooked.
I may be misremembering, but I don't THINK that's true. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure >!Zenitsu, Kanao and Inosuke never get their Marks? I know Douma was severely weakened by Shinobu and Kanao and Inosuke are at least unmarked Hashira level, but still!<
I wouldn't say reckless. 

Having his 3 skilled wives go under cover in 3 of the biggest houses on the district to get information made sense. Unfortunately they were captured and Hina had to get sick to get out. He still managed to gather massive Intel that confirms that a demon was about and the plan worked with Tanjiro and the gang. Hashiras don't have any real authority to do much. 

And there was no way they'd expect a demon like gyutaro and daki would be there as nothing like them has ever existed. 

Tengen was overconfident for sure.
U sure there are no casualties when gyutaro carpet bombed the whole place?
Good point. maybe Gyrutao wasn't strong then Gyoko. There's no denying that he was close to his power. That means Tengen was poised, missing a hand, had no demon slayer mark, was saving other people lives, and still beat Gyrutao who was ether basically as strong if not stronger then Gyoko.
Yep. You can almost do the same shit with a syringe gun infused with demon poison
I literally explained why. While in feats and stats, Tengen should be higher, but on word alone (especially Tengen's), Rengoku seem to be more respected for his strength as a Hashira
The thing is he isn't the weakest Moon. He's just labeled 6 because of Daki
And he was also missing an arm.
Nothing stopping him from getting a mark honestly. If Tanjiro had his earlier, Rengoku and Tengen woulda had theirs too.
If he fought with the others he would have awakened his mark during the fight like all the other hashiras

But that would mean tengen would die soon even if he survives the final battle >!(mark people die at a certain age)!<

Tengen already fulfilled the goal of his character, retire and be with his wives. Tengen has reached peace. He is quite honestly the person with the happiest ending in the manga because he gets to live his life (one arm and eye down is not an issue to the God of Festivals)
I’m not operating under that assumption. You are simply misinterpreting my post (as well as a few others) as some agenda when in reality it’s just to make a cool moment look cooler out of enjoyment of the show. Idk what to tell you if you still think otherwise, man, but to each their own as they say
the more you scream the stronger you get
Multi episode. Telling a story through the fight instead of stopping the fight to tell a backstory. They waited until it was over basically to give us their back story so we are never really taken out of the fight as opposed to Naruto where they will stop mid fight to show the backstory and it breaks the immersion. Characters don’t just over one love or technique they acutely have to fight and work toward a moment where they can use those moves. Fights in something like Dragon Ball would often watch like a professional wrestling match with ebbs and flows. Each person gaining an advantage and positioning themselves to use their speciality over their opponent. Fights after the popularity of Naruto were more focused on characters just using those moves with nothing in between. Or you have something like a Shikamaru fight where he just stares and thinks for a whole episode. Many series were more inspired by the Naruto formula but KnY and JJK have gone back to the multi episode pro wrestling style of fighting which is what I prefer.
Well keep in mind that they were largely capped because of Daki. Evil Micheal Jackson even said that Gyutaro could have been much higher if he cut ties with her.
He is the weakest. Gyutaro would still probably kill most of the other hashira aside from possibly Gyomei. 4 and 5 just seem a lot less strong simply because the slayer mark is a huge power boost.
 
Mitsuri and Muichiro would not have survived nearly as long as they did without their marks.
Facts!
well, when two weak people fights, or two weak team of same caliber fights its always going to be look more entertaining than when a strong fights to a weak
Did he? Alone?
I would say he's 4/5 but that's just my opinion 💜
In an arm wrestling competition, he is. Gyomei is the strongest with tengen coming second.
I mean. The same powerscalers play Mitsuri down cuz she couldn’t kill an immortal Zohakuten and were crying shes gonna die while fighting the whole night til sunrise. Those powerscalers need a new hobby
Yes, but they aren’t Hashira. Hashira-level, absolutely. Honestly the only downside in my eyes of Muzan being defeated is that since the Corps fulfilled their purpose and disbanded, they never got to officially become Hashira.

Also since you mentioned Zenitsu, I’m gonna stan him for a moment; he was the only Demon Slayer to have successfully solo’d an Upper Moon from start to finish, without having awakened the Mark, AND he wasn’t even a Hashira.
Fairly reckless. He was grabbing random girls he saw to help his investigation.
That’s why his wives were there evaccing the whole district
We don't see any civilians after Gyutaro shows up we don't see any more.

Once he showed up the explosions and fighting got louder more intense. I would assume they all left.
I don't think Gyutaro is as strong as Gyokko but I definitely agree that even without that what Tengen achieved was nothing short of a miracle when he became the first Hashira to defeat an Upper Moon after more than a century
I said the categories Tengen has him beat, but you say Rengoku is above because he is respected? I don't think I understand 

Respect does not = Strength, or people like Tanjiro, gyomei, would be like the strongest one ever lol even above muzan.

What reasons do you actually believe he's stronger, like fighting capability not respect
mark ppl dying at age is a myth isnt it, not real
The sadder the flashback the stronger the attack.
The fact that you took time to write Evil Michael Jackson instead of Muzan got me 🤣🤣🤣
Muzan doesn't have an eye for adorable little sisters.

Gyutarou knows better than to not protect Ume.

"It's not fair!  They are bullying me!!~"

Yes, yes they are, how dare they...
He also let his pride get in the way here. He had yo avenge his sister being disgraced like that, so he was more hands on than usual with this fight. He should've just poisoned everyone and dipped out. But his pride kept him there to brutalize everyone he could
He never said that outright, he only said that had gyutaro started the fight against tengen and the kamaboko squad he would have won, but I do agree that if gyutaro was independent of his sister they could both make it to upper 5 or even upper 4 since they need to both be beheaded, and what are the odds they have skilled enough demon slayers after them at the same time and they get beheaded at the same time
Also, Gyutaro weakened him with poison.
Muzan never said that
true true
what he said was gyutaro would’ve won without daki and that he should’ve just left after poisoning them all. muzan never said this dawg
No he didn't, he said Daki held him back and was always a weakness of his. He never says anything about him being a higher rank without Daki. Even without her he is still firmly UM6, UM5 and above all beat Tengen prerty easily. I love him but he just is one of the Weakest, as you said daki holds Gyutaro back and Tengen still would've lost that fight it if was just him.
also true
Really? Most of the hashira? Lol. You're underestimating uppermoon 1, 2 and 3 if that's the case.
Why you're being downvoted? I don't think people here realize that the fight(pairing) between the upper moon and hashiras are based on their skillsets. Because if not then one of them will be easily defeated or the fight will be boring.
Technically, because he was protecting Tanjiro even after he was dying from poison and missing an arm.
TBH, I might put him higher.

He's the second physically strongest, he's the fastest runner, he was raised since a child to fight and he's the second oldest Hashira, his weapons can really change up a fight, his adaptability is IMO the highest of any Hashira, and he beat an Upper Moon (who could debatably be higher in the rankings) with no Mark, one-armed, one-eye, poisoned, minutes to live, needed another demon dead at the same time, and protecting several other people. Uzui is IMO the second or third strongest Hashira in base.
then its also people opinion if they think he is weakest 

and gyomei iguro sanemi giyuu to an extent are more powerful than him its upto rengoku vs tengen for 5 for me
so? overall strength cant be judged on the basis of arm-wrestling mate
I can't disagree with that
Or died
Like I said it is more on just word alone since Tengen straight up said that he couldn't believe that Rengoku couldn't beat Upper 3, while Tengen didn't think he could beat Daki and Gyutaro on his own

Plus (and this is kinda more on my opinion), but I feel like the Akaza that fought against Rengoku could still beat Daki and Gyutaro. Like it was stated earlier, it was just mostly on match ups since Tengen was probably the best Hashira to fight Daki and Gyutaro while Rengoku was quite possible the worst Hashira to throw at Akaza due to his high fighting Spirit.
No? It's kind of an important point in one character's backstory.
The Demon King of Pop cannot be stopped 🕺
He did say Daki was holding him back, how much is kinda up to speculation. I could see Gyutaro and Gyokko swapping places tbh, I don't really see him passing Hantengu though.
Ju:lie
Not crazy to assume

Only reason Tengen didn't die immediately is due to his resistance to poison, now let me break it to you like this

Tengen is the 2nd most experienced, fastest in running, 2nd physically strongest, with the best senses alongside Gyomei out of all the hashira.
     My guy literally has echolocation as one of his breathing forms. All in base. Rengoku has complimented his swordsmanship in the databooks 

And he was still cut by Gyutaro, although keep in mind Gyutaro did not pull out his sickles until the last moment when Tengen leapt at him, so it was a surprise. 
              Gyutaro went for the head, but Tengen deflected it a bit so it scratched him, and that was enough to weaken him the entire fight and bring him near death if he didn't stop his own heartbeat 
 
(which I don't see any other hashira doing either to be honest beside gyomei possibly, sanemi might be pushing it as holding in your guts for a bit, and completely stopping your heart for a decent amount of time with your muscles, then resuscitating yourself are 2 different  levels of muscle strength)

 Anyone else who's even scratched by Upper 6 like that by any of his attacks, especially the surprise attack that caught even the 2nd most experienced hashira Tengen ( which will be pretty much everyone beside Gyomei ) 
they will die 100% in due time, within minutes or less, and quickly their fighting ability will be rendered useless and they won't even be able to breathe. Remember how quick it worked on Tanjiro someone who is not resistant to poisons as Tengen or Inosuke.

 (Also, Tengen at moments fights off Daki and Gyutaro by himself keep in mind, alongside keeping the boys and civilians safe. The fight was won with 0 CASUALTIES. ZERO. Not even any of the 3 wives kicked the bucket). 

Put some respect on his name.

Also literally every hashira level slayer who fought an uppermoon had help beside zenitsu and rengoku. And Rengoku died.

( and no Kaigaku is not stronger than Gyutaro either, he was not even experienced with his BDA and was a brand new uppermoon. Though it's still impressive Zenitsu beat him without too much trouble.)
i mean people generally doesnt like others opinion if it doesnt fit on their narrative so maybe thats why specially fan fav characters like giyuu rengoku and tengen
Tanjiro is also injured and dying from poison. Besides, the statement above implies that he killed gyutaro alone. Let's not forget that inosuke and zenitsu beheaded daki, which is needed to defeat them completely.
I'm not referring to overall strength mate, I'm literally talking about physical strength but since you want to go overall, how about you explain why tengen who is second in physicals and experience as well as first in sense and running speed is overall the 5-6th strongest hashira in base... make it make sense.
Didn't think doesn't really prove shi though, go off what we've seen 

Also remind me when Tengen said that about rengoku and said he doesn't believe he can defeat gyutaro and daki..

Also your point about Akaza, Akaza will have to try harder to defeat Gyutaro and Daki then against Rengoku, if you think otherwise then I have nothing else to say to you really.

Also Rengoku would vs Upper 6 would be a match up in Upper 6 favour as well
why does yorichi live to like 80
I'd say Gyokko is stronger but the gap between them isn't as big as the gap between gyokko and hantengu.

Also about what muzan said about daki. Muzan, after discussing why gyutaro lost, made a point about how the upper ranks are dying in order of how much humanity they had left. So him saying "daki was holding gyutaro back" was less about daki weakening gyutaro  and more about daki holding gyutaro back from being more cruel.
That's crazy to assume, since we never really saw him or the other hashiras fight the other upper moon. Why do you assume that other hashira will die immediately due to poison when the most common side effect of blood demon art is poison?. Aren't they mostly aware of how to delay the circulation of poison through breathing?
Except Muichiro vs Gyokko, all fights were team up. What’s your point?
others have feat in base which is more impressive then tengen 

running speed? giyuu sanemi iguro all three have more combat speed then him

obanai is literally most skilled hashira in swordsmanship

sanemi =obanai=giyuu - we literally saw in anime

sanemi feats in base against um1 obanai feats against muzan
That is quite literally the exact thing I was mentioning, lol. 

Yoriichi lived to be 80 because he was born with the Mark and was just intrinsically far superior. Yoriichi was just special. That's his entire thing.
He said if Gyutaro fought alone from the start he would've won, meaning the fight in the Entertainment District.
Thats a stretch and a half.
I think you're vastly underestimating how insanely OP demon powers make you, dude. That's like the entire point of the show. The upper six moons are on an entirely different level than any of the hashira aside from maybe Gyomie; and even that's a big maybe. Tengen would've died twice as quickly without the Tanjiro crew being with him. Muichiro got no-diffed by upper moon 5 before he awakened his mark. Mitsuri did not land a single solitary hit on upper moon 4. Sure, her purpose was to stall for time, but personally, I don't feel like she would've even been able to land a meaningful strike even if that was the main body.

The only upper moon that could realistically be killed by a few of the hashira is Gyutaro. And even then, the dude nearly killed a hashira, 3 of his Shinobu wives, and 3 extremely skilled demon slayers. Anyone who thinks any of the base form hashira can take an upper moon solo is absolutely delusional.
That can be answered by simply watching the show or reading the manga my dude.

Gyutaros poison specifically is very potent, and idk where you got that "all blood demon arts have poison" thing from. Hantengu's bda does not have "poison" neither does kaigaku, kokushibo, douma, akaza, drum demon, arrow demon, that black-water demon from s1, so on so forth.

Go watch the show and see how quickly it took effect in Tanjiro and what it did to him, or reread my comment to understand more

And Tanjiro tried to do exactly what you said, delay the circulation with "breathing" but after a short time period he wasn't  even able to breathe at all. So it's moot, they will die eventually
Muichiro got caught in a pot.. and was saved by the little boy making air bubbles for him to escape. Otherwise Gyokko literally would’ve one tapped him, and bro just walked away. Muichiro even KNOWS he’s dead, and he prays that the master sends more Hashira
>others have feat in base which is more impressive then tengen 

I'd love for you to actually provide a modicum of evidence mate. Saying something is so doesn't make it so sir. 

>running speed? giyuu sanemi iguro all three have more combat speed then him

Well, you're wrong in that regard. The databooks literally have tengen topping everyone in running speed. Hate to break it to you mate. But running speed is a factor of combat speed. 

>obanai is literally most skilled hashira in swordsmanship

Second actually, but that's irrelevant. Not to mention a moot point since if we bring swordsmanship into ranking factor, tengen ranks 3rd with gyomei being first. 

>sanemi =obanai=giyuu - we literally saw in anime

Ufotable has a habit of overexaggerating scenes for flashy effects, that's their entire thong. They're not sometimes named unlimited budget works for nothing. Put aside the anime, and read the manga. And in the manga, we don't see anything from those three that put them above tengen in base. We have these 5 simple facts. 1. Tengen is the second physically strongest hashira. 2. Tengen is the second most experienced hashira. 3. Tengen ranks 1st in sense. 4. Tengen ranks 1st in running speed and 5. Tengen ranks 3rd in swordsmanship. 

>sanemi feats in base against um1 obanai feats against muzan

Those feats were with the slayer mark and transparent world. Factors that tengen wouldn't have access to since he never awakened either of them. Ffs sanemei was almost knocked out by a headbutt from tanjiro...
i thought that the whole thing w the mark was that after yoriichi muzan hunted marked slayers so they always died young
Which is definitely not true so he’s bsing. Weakness in Muzan’s eyes is humanity and human emotions, which Gyutaro had for Daki. Without Daki, half the reason they’re so hard to kill for a Hashira, even marked, goes away (have to behead 2 demons at the same time).
I never underestimated them, you guys are the ones who make assumptions here .
And didn't say "all" and said "most". You should probably read first before you make an argument.
Hashiras fought muzan while being poison and I'm pretty sure muzan's poison is stronger than gyutaro. But they didn't die upon its immediate contact.
man put his own headcanon tengen doesnt rank in swordsmanship anywhere near top first of all after that running speed is totally different in manga it is literally said misturi had faster combat speed than tengen even though she ranked very low in running speed and see their feats before awakening mark 

tengen literally needed help from 4-5 different people to eliminate weakest um in contrast to sanemi giyuu iguro who fought much stronger um in base and has more amazing feats

theres literally explained that headbutt situation by obanai in anime too
While it is true that Muzan and Kokushibo hunted down Slayers, they specifically hunted down the students of Yoriichi to make sure that another Sun Breathing user didn't pop up. However, since Kokushibo helped Muzan, that means that DSM users died young since >!Kokushibo's reason to become a demon in the first place was to avoid dying at 25 from the Mark.!<
THE WAY MY MOUTH DROPPED WHEN I READ SHINOBU’S 👁️👄👁️
Bruh somebody posted the data book the other day so I went and bought it, now am reading through all of these and my god 😭😭

Shinobu when she sees this:
BRUH MITSURI TOO-

I literally read it, took a picture, and posted before reading any more lmao
It sounds weird af by modern standards but in the Taisho Era that’s just a pretty standard compliment for a woman, especially for someone raised hyper-traditionally like Tengen.

This would be giyus reaction
He said **"GYAT!"**

Also, Tokito's thoughts on Tomioka!!! 😂 "He's just sort of there." 💀
I read this before and I like how almost every hashira has this honest thoughts about each other while Gyomei was like: "I'm gonna confirm every fan's ship and spill the tea on who likes who"
tengen really wants to have 5 wives then
Tengen trying to catch wives like pokemon.
Regoku's face 😂
Man said, and I quote: “Would” to both of the female hashira wtf
It's a phrase that old people used to describe fertility. [safe birth delivery body type](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/zh-hans/%E5%AE%89%E4%BA%A7%E5%9E%8B)
Apparently, it's a compliment back then, which makes sense because birth back then usually led to death
Wait is the data book in ther world cuz if all the hashira read it…. I would love to watch there reactions😅😂🤣

What the fuck did I just read?

Edit: I just noticed he said the exact same thing for Mitsuri.
HE DID IT TO MITSURI TOO OMG
WHAT hips Uzui, she's 37kg 😭
Not surprising coming from a guy with three wives…..
It’s poor phrasing for “child bearing hips.” (Not as bad as the direct translation of “deliverable butt” though.) The point he’s getting at is that she’d be capable of birthing healthy babies without dying. Childbirth is as the number one killer of post puberty age women in that era (and basically any era before that). Tengen’s back story focuses on the deaths from childbirth women in his life experienced, so he’s not being a lech to say it.
‘Good hips for giving birth’ is fucking insane
>He's just sort of there


Muichiro is such a mood fr

Flashy opinion :3
Bratty 🤣
Everyone complains about Zenitsu (a teenage boy) being perverted, but Tengen says stuff like this and no one bats an eye.... I'm going to get downvoted, aren't I? (⁠;⁠ŏ⁠﹏⁠ŏ⁠) He's still a good character though, just a bit... Ummm, well... It's pretty obvious...
HE A FAN HE A FAN HE A FAN
Nah but why is he commenting on all the women's hips like that 😭

Bro has no enemies (except demons)
This whole time he’s been a hip man.
Yall need to chill, it was a compliment back then because childbirth could lead to death and wide hips reduced that risk 😭
this is hilarious
TENGEN ?!?!
I DROPPED MH PHONE AND SCREAMED SO LOUD I SWEAR WHYY
HE EVEN SAID THE SAME THING TO MITSURU

WHAT
He literally said that the only two female Hashiras “have good birthing hips”
Man has only one thing on the mind besides flashiness 😭

Wtf with "good hips for giving birth " ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise) BTW giyu's description is best.
Muichiro saying Giyuu "like sorts of there" boy you're him but just younger!?
Are we also not mentioning Mitsuri as well😭🙏
These always made me laugh. None of the other Hashiras gave positives for Giyu lol
Wait... what?⚡
XD someone post the entire book, i gotta read this LOL
"he's just sort of there" 😭 felt
I don’t see anything wrong with it lol.
Poor giyuu the most abused hashira :(
GURL- HE HAS FOUR WIVES- WHY DOES HE NEED MORE??
He said it on Mitsuri too
He's just sort of there 

Ooof
What book is this?
I guess he may have considered both of the lady Hashiras as potential wives with those comments and I don't blame him.
Help I read this wrong and thought they were calling tengen's hips good for birth 😭
No way did Tengen said that to Mitsuri and Shinobu
Not him calling Sanmei a bratty boy 😭
Well "child bearing hips" was a common saying back then so, pretty normal for during the era standards. Also back then wasn't it considered blessed to have a big family?
He says that about mitsuri too like yeah no shit Sherlock they're women 
What the hell Tengen
I hope he is talking about Gyomei's body size
https://preview.redd.it/kq6adl2ihh9d1.jpeg?width=582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3c7b71d4f9d8ef875b5bd551ccd88056273a5a0
I really want to like Tengen, but he's such a pig. Of the two female hashira, his final thoughts are 'they are good for making children.' Honestly, it'd be less offensive if he just said 'has nice tits/ass.'

He's shown to have depth and to actually care about his wives, and I can only hope his shit behavior towards other women is just a front but ug. I want someone to punch him in the face so bad (Akaza maybe).
Tengen's right asf 🥵🥵
It was a complement back then
Tengen ain’t wrong though
Please tell me which book this is
Where'd you find this lmao
Looks like tengen wants kids👁👄👁
It is hard in the medium to deduce if the grammar issues are intentionally part of Tengen's character or just the difficulties of translating from one languages grammar to another. 

Japanese grammatically and from a word choice perspective is a lot more simple and straight forward than English. A lot of English translations will add synonyms of words and extra descriptors to try to make it sound more like the tone. However sometimes translators infer a different tone than what the panel indicates which can create unintentional changes.

Even though everyone in Japan has to take mandatory English classes, it is still not a strength for them. The poor grammar could just be the translator for that dialogue being too literal or not seeing an issue with the English grammar. Or it. Could be intentional... just hard to tell.
What book is this from? and is it worth buying?
That why he the goat fr.
Lmao that's crazy 😭
But not Mitsuri’s ?

Is this a special volume? Or what
Honestly, birthing hips are a must. Don’t blame him
Well, he was brought up to think of female ninjas as expendable so at least our boy’s taking baby steps in the right direction.
I about spit out my food
where can i get this book?
Bruh, he had one mutual detail for each of the lady Hashira, and it's their hips.

https://i.redd.it/tsmus8dj3m8d1.gif

But he ain’t wrong.
My dude is on the hunt for the best birthing hips possible
Haha tengen

  
Anybody know his location?
The good hips for giving birth is killing me 😭
Bet, shinobu😍😍😍😍
Tengen always on the lookout for wife #4
its all about the hips
When people remember that wide hips=less chance of death for mother and child when giving birth 😯
For a sec I thought it was her opinion on Tengen.
You gotta upload for all
Um......wtf Shinobu
Well no shit females have good hips for giving birth ( Mitsuri has it too )
good hips for giving birth...
Bros planned the 4th and 5th wives fr
Bro, if you read Shinobus comment on Tengen, it just disproves that shinobu can blitz tengen and stab him in the eye. Also, he was seriously weakened
Good hips for giving birth though.
where can I get this data book?
I can’t keep defending my boy like this 😭

Read Mitsuri’s never mind that’s just Tengen being his weird traumatized self 💀
And Mitsuri’s lmao
Giyu: "He looks sad all the time."

Rengoku: "He's kind and flashy."

Mitsuri: "NICE ASS-"
Where can I find this ? 😫
Tengen's just horny
lol so what are bad hips then?😂
Apparently it's like some sort of compliment in Japanese culture?
tengen really just said "shinobu and mitsuri have a fat ass"
Wait till he sees that Mitsuri’s is the exact same

Shinobu gave Mucchino a "she" ermh no.
In that era, it is considered to be a compliment back then because women at that time it was difficult for them to give birth. And it is there tradition to have a big family.
MITSURI TOO? Does he just think “good hips for giving birth” everytime he meets a woman. ALSO WHAT DOES GOOD HIPS FOR GIVING BIRTH EVEN MEAN

Can we please get all the others? I wouldn't be able to get this book because of where I live.
where did you read this from???
Same for Mitsuri

I wonder if he thinks the same for his wives as well
Tengen when he sees a woman :
I wonder what those hips can do
A summery for all the female hashira’s is that they all have good hips for giving birth.
Look at Misturi's
Post Giyu’s opinion on em all
What’s the name of this book?

(Tengen also says the same thing as Shinobu for Mitsuri)
Well he's not wrong
He says the something about the love hashira. Combined with having 3 wives and the only Hashria to actually be married it's likely he has a big obsession about birthing.
It isn't that big of a deal
What about Mitsuri's?
Ah, a hips man. A man of culture
Mitsuri's too😭
I mean.. am I wrong?✨✨✨
"Your sons a sick man with sick thoughts"
Shinou and mitsuris is vile lol
TENGEN PLEASE
i hope this is a translation error 😭😭😭
Let’s be honest, the only one who doesn’t change, is rengoku, my man is never hated, the good old donut never disappoints
"Dangerous with a bratty side" I'm HOLLERIN
What book is this???
GOOD HIPS FOR GIVING VIRTH😭
lol Mitsuri’s too
Oh My God…
He's right. Nice legs, hips, and thighs save lives.
Brutally honest
Mitsuri's is weird too 🌸

Haha the fucking love hashria too flashy for hi. But good birthing hips lol
 Can someone post Giyus please
Which volume of the manga is this page from?
FR THIS IS WHY I HATE TENGEN
not many people have read this so they dont know he said it but LIKE?????
Wouldn't that be a compliment?/gen
why is shinobu saying she to men lmao
Nahh tengen is wild
That’s a real compliment I’ve heard in my country

Tengen @ women:
hey what book is this? i want to buy it
He said it about Mitsuri too 😭 bro is fiending
It’s crazy how universally loved Rengoku was by all of his peers.
He's not wrong
Why did I think that was Shinobu's take on tengen
Does the data book come with the boxset or do I have to buy it individually?
Is this volume 15?
him and birthing hips 😭
We got to remember this is not modern times this is after world war 1 right when Japan was being westernized there's going to be some weird shit in there he probably meant it with good intention now is this socially acceptable for the times I have no idea someone's smarter than me probably will explain it better and I'm not defending his actions I'm just explaining it of why he might say it
Lmfao giyu is just sorta there is crazy 🤣
Tengen @ an 18 year old and his friend’s apprentice: let me impregnate you
He says the same thing about kanroji
wait can you post the cover of the book? i don’t know which one this is!
dont forget mitsuri 😭
he said the same thing about mitsuri but im dying at mui saying "he's just kinda there" for giyuu
I mean..  Can you blame him with the hips thing.  Though I agree more with the overly flashiness of the other girl though. Even for a boob guy like myself,  it's such an aggregating design choice with these sorts of characters in anime. 
UM-
Can anyone give me a link to this?
I must see the rest!
Ew. That’s gross.
nah, Shinobu knows something no one else does 😭
What book is this?!
“Child bearing hips” was a Standard compliment in traditional societies, just a change of times in this sensitive ahh generation.
He basically just said that Shinobu has the best ass out of all the Hashira 🤣
Me low-key
He said the same thing about Mitsuri. Tengen, watch out for Obanai 💀
Mitsuri too???
What’s with his grammar, he was using somewhat correct terminology to describe what the others are like? You sure you don’t need to hit the books g?
is my reddit tripping why is every single comment in one thread
Why does Tengen like Rengoku's flashiness but finds it weird in Mitsuri? Make it make sense 😭😭
He's quite the ladies' man.
Uzui Tengen and his love of child bearing hips
She got the girth for the birth, know what I'm sayin?
It looks bad, but it's a compliment for the time, lmao

SHINOBU YOU ROCK!

WTF?!?! TENGEN HAD BETTER HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS SHIZZ!!
….gives me a few flashbacks when I was growing up as a young preteen girl and was commented on having “birthing hips”

Lots of dismissive comments in this thread too 😭
As a female, it wasn’t “fun” or “appreciative” to get such comments, ya know? 💀

She do got birth giving hips (put a bullet in me already)
Tengens got good taste
Tengen got his priorities straight ig
What about muichiro’s comment about her at the bottom?  Thought it said she likes to swallow!
I don’t blame Tengan, I would love Shinobu to Conceive My Child💜

No she wouldn’t saying women have wide hips was a compliment back in the taisho era
didn't yall read mitsuri?
With that exact smile too💀
Ahahah
Where to read the rest of these?
Need to see gyomei
"BRUH"

god how I wish this sub didn't have so many children. I guess that's what standard for mainstream anime
When a Chad is written by an incel.
Somehow when u think of Tenten hyper traditional isn't the word that comes to mind. Considering the era it would look like traditional to us though
For a long time it was actually seen as a plus to be broadly built and a bit heavier. It signified food wasn't an issue for the person. (Usually then a sign of wealth). For women it also meant birth was less likely to have complications. (Underweight with narrow hips could lead to more stillbirth or even death for the mother in child birth prior to modern medicine.) Another reason why everyone used that ridiculous white powder and makeup. It was to prove you don't work the fields to show a sign of status.

It is only a relatively recently in terms of human history trend of women needing to be super skinny, men desired to muscular/tone and everyone tan. If you look back at even the early movie stars of Hollywood you van see how some of the male actors were considered incredibly hot but all of them have basically an "active" build. Not overweight but no ridiculous hypertrophy. It was the late 70s to 80s fitness craze in America that promoted excessive hypertrophy of male stars and  emphasized the skinniness of female stars as the beauty standard.

Now being in shape is the sign of status because it often means you have the ability to take the time out of your schedule to train. Can afford the proper nutrition and equipment/memberships. Your single parent working two jobs doesn't have that kind of time.
Actually, it's based on his brother. Tengen brother would sleep with women not caring for their own safety as during this time, death during or after pregnancy were high. So, to not be like his brother, Tengen rates wide hips, which increase the like of survival after birth very highly.
I think so too! Also considering how he was raised where women are kind of less than and are given to the men to be baby machines.

VERY nice birthing hips
Very
It was a common compliment for women back in the Taisho Era.
I was thinking the exact same thing
He isn’t wrong though
tbf, i deem Shinobu's weight one of the most unrealistic thing besides some BDAs. She literally has god core strength with muscular gyatt and thighs on top of body weights of poison. no way she is 37kg.
She isnt 37 kg, the author just has no idea how weight looks, other characters also have whack weights, pair this with very strict focus on weight in japan over just how someone looks
Ehhhhh, he’s kinda being a lech about it. But it’s just not a joke that translates well. He’s saying “Nice ass,” in a relatively polite and circumspect way (for his time).
I think what Tengen said was actually a compliment back then. Personally I don’t think he’s perverted, but I respect your opinion!

Also, I will die on the hill that Zenitsu is a good character who suffers because the author decided to impose the ‘perverted character’ trope on him, which is apparently popular in Japan.

(I mean, he might have had *some* pervy moments anyway due to being a teenager, but I don’t think it would be nearly as bad.)

Edit: Honestly though, he’s not that bad to begin with.
Tengen is hot! And flashy. So all is forgiven😇
Classic Flirting vs Harassment 
It was a compliment not a perverted thing.
everyone seems to forget he slapped Aoi's behind
FREAKY AHH NİNJA HE A 6* GOD
Actually most of the hashira said neutral/positive things for Giyuu, except for Sanemi and Obanai. Tengen wasn't insulting Giyuu here, he just wanted him to be less somber
Rengoku basically just says he's quiet but works hard. Sounds positive to me
Mitsuri actually called him adorable. That speaks for something. And Gyomei’s observation of him is neutral…. But he’s a blind man 😛

I did see some people saying that the meaning of what he said was lost in translatino so maybe the grammar was also lost in translation and while it was cool and funky in japanese it's just incorrect in english

As for whether or not it's worth buying I'd say really only if you've read the entire manga. For me, I speedran the manga in a day so that I'd forget most of it and thus be able to enjoy the anime as if I was watching for the first time, so this is probably gonna sit on my shelf for a few years now until it finishes airing LOL

That said if you have finished the entire manga it is 100% worth getting since it's not too expensive and has a ton of cool stuff including bonus epilogue content (which I'm dying to read and barely holding off lol)

Bruh his sentence structure is wack for like half of them lol, not to mention starting sentences with and which technically isn’t wrong but it just reads really bad. Also “With good hips for giving birth” is completely incorrect lol
But you do call yourself Vergil's submissive fleshlight so it evens out.
I feel like Gojo and Tengan would be Great Friends
Shinobu has the same voice actress as Yamato from One Piece, Maria Campbell from an Otome anime that's too long to write and I'm lazy, it's about a villaness. Yor from Spy x Family. Kaguya from Fairy Tail. Himawari from Boruto. Rachel from Tower of God. Ikaros from Sora no Otoshimo, etc.

Kyojuro is so wholesome with his description of everyone. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
Rengoku being the most humble always gets me 😭😭 I love him
Sanemi checking in on her whenever they meet, that's fucking wholesome.
Where can i find this? Id love to read more of these
Flame Hashira always the best guy 😭😭
Sidenote but the way Rengoku has only positive things to say about everyone 🥲❤️
I love how she says that she loves Mitsuri. It‘s too cute 😭😭😭
Where can I read this? I couldn’t find it online
lol Kyojuro is like I LOVE EVERYONE -
The Sanemi one😭😭man I love him sm
How can i get it online 😭😭
She really had to mention "in swordsmanship" lol
(Jetstream) SAM???
why are there amogus in her eyes ??????
I bought it for $20 CAD [here](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1974736024?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) since I couldn't find it online. Be warned like most of the book is talking about the final battle so if you're anime only or like speedran the manga so you'd forget the details then probably not worth the purchase? If you'd like I can send you pics of the other Hashira's and their opinions about the others. If you have read the entire manga though absolutely worth the buy esp since the end of the book is filled with bonus epilogue chapters which I am SO tempted to read but am holding off on them lol (I'm one of the people who did the speedrun thing)

RAISED traditional
He’s traditional enough to have a harem, just like his family has done before, lol
I think he meant something different about his only surviving little brother.

It‘s true! There is the obvious ones like Obamitsu and Giyuu and Shinobu, but I lost it at Sanemi‘s "He likes Kanae“ 😭
No wonder bro is mad 24/7 if his girl got murdered
make him the 1st, now he have 6 wives, hell yeah
already included
Well, to be fair you are judging a guy from the early 1900s lol. Tough to apply modern standards
It’s obvious Tengen would be sexist by today’s standards. He objectifies his wives and treats them like shiny objects instead of human beings.
No.

But he needs to keep his eyes away from my wife. Especially when he already has three wives of his own. 🦋

What do the percentages at the bottom mean?
What is your favorite image of Tengen?
Muscular gyatt 😭
I mean even if the author isn't really educated on weight it's still the stated fact in the manga which makes it canon :p I do agree the author didn't think the weights through, Mitsuri for example is also relatively light/average for a girl when due to her muscle density she should be a lot heavier
Yeaaa I don't think zenitsu is nearly as bad as some animes I've seen lol. I think of him as more as the comedic relief, he was hilarious in the entertainment district arc, I loved his snide comments lol.

It was spanking, normal for the time, also normal in many countries today.
Lmao I can’t believe it took this long for someone to put the 2 together.
ha. nah, i don't use discord.
I’m sorry u got confused he has three right?
Thank you!
Which one???
*complimentary Official Databook/Fanbook.
Okay! Thanks for letting me know :) I think i’ll go ahead and buy it, then :)
Okay yeah I have that one, sick. Thanks!
ok thank you
That is consensual, fam. Big difference lmao

Comments towards me when I was a preteen during puberty while I was too naive to truly understand what men meant wasn’t consensual at all☺️🥰
Funny how Tengen has the same EN voice actor as Sukuna
no because gojo covers his flashy eyes up and holds back his powers. which isn't flashy.
For real, pick one wife Tengen 😂
He's everyone's big bro 🥰
bro is too pure and innocent
I suspect it is because he senses they both have anger issues lol
These are in the second fan book :>
I’m guessing it’s in the manga somewhere but I’ve only seen the show so far
Is it available in India?
Could you post or comment  Iguro and muichiro please
I am surprised no one asked giyu's pov , can you please share? Also shinobu
lmao love how my boy is so into pointing out who likes who
Gyomei has tea on EVERYONE!!!
How is he the one to know who likes whom? Well I guess that’s how Gyomei sees.
He's just telling everyone's business, sir that's not what we asked 😂😂
I need to read this 😂😂😂
My b I Kay be stupid lol

Then 6 cause Rengoku is an honorary wife
...brother, what? Didn't he go out of his clan's traditions to tell his wives they are NOT objects?
That’s like the opposite of what he does???⚡️
He literally told them they weren't objects. If he saw his wives as baby factories, he'd dispose of them ASAP. Did you watch the fucking show?
Did we watch the same show or..?
I think you skipped most of Tengen flashbacks, that's exactly the opposite of what he does telling them to think on their own and they're not objects
Bro what? That's literally the opposite of how he treats his wives
Dude's been watching Demon Layer 💀
Someone does not understand Tengen’s character at all, lol. Or saw the flashbacks where he made a point of treating Makio, Suma and Hinatsuru as persons instead of just brood mares (like his brother did) with their ass.
Bro's watching Devil Killer lmao

"He's like a decorative object"

He did not have to be this savage😭
Open mindedness I think
    
EDIT: No wait it actually says level of openness meaning how open they are to others.

It's this one
[deleted]
Isnt this death to the author? If the author is just kinda wrong you can dismiss whatever they say.
I think something that helps is that pretty much all his "pervert" moments are more "stupidly infatuated." Still bad, but he's not actively groping people like Mineta. Plus, we see him early on protecting Nezuko's box from Inosuke without even knowing who she was, solely because Tanjiro, the guy he met a few hours ago, said it was important. He's a good guy, just cringy at times.
![gif](giphy|GRk3GLfzduq1NtfGt5|downsized)
You don’t spank someone else’s kid. Also within the context of him kidnapping her I think it was a pretty bizarre thing to do. I still like him as a character, but let’s not pretend that wasn’t weird
Oh I meant here on Reddit lol
Yeah I think so unless he got another one in the manga or something
It's the databook, I got it [here](https://www.amazon.ca/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-Yaiba_Corps-Records/dp/1974736024/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CO33TCLSRQWU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kPc82aJOrk8NsVnLSMVKBA0byu7iRWns-h8moC0vSkDU1gOHFBwghAJY4e-x-1ePzKvkvnBiPb7RHo1fcq_KKD--tjW1-yeWQn8MqgbB34hkSWbXY39rJuzVH7pU0IpRKEcgtkg-EInV8XMbfShIvloLFvSCwTP6f8BNyfTu77eQQjbX5-YWMCOLmQeuGx20IwWkjeAlFALr2SAWKGyJrI0bixjMyLqzG7zSE35TMk0.5klAJfNJpnlx3JVeg9667yC92_g4YdnZlYjTEkhMOUQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=demon+slayer+data+book&qid=1719344979&s=books&sprefix=demon+slayer+data+boo%2Cstripbooks%2C80&sr=1-1)
Where can I find it?
Np!
Oh yeah no fuck that, that's obvi, I've had men tell me that when I was 13 before 

But Vergil fleshlight is wild tho
Wow Really? Interesting
Really? I didn't notice that, and Tengen's EN voice actor stands out to me. I've noticed him in a lot of things. Maybe it's the way Sukuna talks that throws me off. The majority of the DS EN cast also voiced the majority of the 7DS EN voices. 

I did notice, though, (all of these are the EN versions btw) that Sanemi's VA is Gojo's. 

Yahaba (the arrow demon who had the arrows in s1) is Toge's voice.

The Spider Mother Demon's voice is Maki's as well.

There's a few others I recognise but they're from 7DS and not Demon Slayer. It's cool how often shows overlap when it comes to voice acting.
I'm still mindblown that The voice Actor of Zenitsu is the Same Voice actor that does Dabi in Japanese
Fuegoleon too
Edit: Has the same voice actor in Japanese
Huhhhhhhhh huuuhhhhhhh huuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😧😧😧😧😧🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨😧😧🫨
I swear to god, Ray Chase has one of the coolest voices. Huge fan of his work, from the Owl in AOT to Tengen in Demon Slayer
Well, he’s too powerful and holds it back for other peoples safety, also In the 2nd season, didn’t he start wearing Sunglasses?
I like he didn't bother to twisted what he said about the wives into a positive, unlike what he said about Shinobu & Giyu, lol,
Yes that could be

But Sanemi was close to Kanae (Shinobu's sister) before she died. And I feel that's why he checks up on Shinobu often.

Yep check dm
Yeah that also confirm to us that giyu x Shinobu isn't a thing
He senses everything
In one of the light novel he was able to know kanae and Shinobu are sisters by sensing their aura so maybe he did the same here
Idk if you already looked it up, but if not someone posted it in the comments here:

Just like every teenager lol
She is not someone else kid, she is a demon slayer who ranks below him.

Just like a General punishing a cadet.
Profile exists for this reason :P
Thanks!
It’s not a one sided relationship promise 🥰 LMAO
Lots of talented VA's, that's for sure. Always cool to see what other characters they voiced
He’s also Kamina from Gurren Lagann
And Alex’s Le does the English VA for Zenitsu and Sung Jin Woo, talk about range of characters lmao
He also voices Choso in JJK and Neuvillette in Genshin. Goated VA
non bedazzled sunglasses aren't gonna be flashy enough.
You're right, it *is* canonically because of her sister. 

["I talk to her every now and then (since she's Kanae's little sister)."](https://i.redd.it/every-hashiras-views-on-the-other-hashira-love-the-way-v0-8qw9jlngjew91.jpg?width=755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68d91dba5a5cc332a5df24250e6d627a1113854f)
"He's just sort of there" to Giyu.
Muichiro, with all due respect, don't do my man like that😭😭
the way he compares every other hashira to an animal but for giyu it's "he's just sort of there" 💀
"he's a monkey" Frieza?
Of course muichiro would compare them all to animals
Aw I love how he calls Mitsuri very cute. She is so adorable and my unintentional favorite.
He was the one who saved them from the demon attack years ago.
No wait it actually says level of openness meaning how open they are to others.

His physiology fucks up like his memory does and he starts burning when he's in the dark
He’ll forget he’s a demon and be surprised when he eats someone
Nah, bro knows his heart rate & body temperature down to the degree. He’d def notice himself getting tingly or nauseous as the sun rises

Nah he'll go and try and talk to the hashira than don't get why they are trying to attack him
Okay okay that had me. yep hell forget. He won't be just an op sob he'd be a dumbass as well.
Omg why?!! I can't unsee it he would 😭 because he's a space head
lmao
I can
He is not that dumb.

Poor Muichiro, can you blame him? Btw that's fun as hell
Do.. you mean Ca-N?
As in, can'tn't?
He will prob have a good sleep in the sun
Maybe if it was Zenitsu...
This should have been posted by Gyomei
no lets be honest here. if muichiro became a demon, he would forget and walk out into the sun lol.

"Huh, why is human flesh so tasty all of a sudden?"
"Huh, maybe I just hungry?"
That is after the Tanjiro effect 

Pre-Tanjiro he probably would lose count of his own fingers while doing finger math.
it's not, he WAS forgetful not stupid

the only comment i'll accept 🥹
He's a descendant of >!Michikatsu/Kokushibo, not Yoriichi, and he hasn't consumed the spider lily like Nezuko.!< He would burn.

da silly and da edgy bot.
Suddenly, murder drones
He literally forgot about nezuko at the start of the swordsmith arc, and that was like a huge thing to the hashira , i wouldnt put this past him
read my comment again. he was🙋🏻‍♀️ 'FORGETFUL' 💁🏻‍♀️due to his amnesia not STUPID 🙅🏻‍♀️  later on, at the end of swordsmith village arc he remembered.
Personal opinion
I would have preferred if Tanjiro was the first one to react and scream out "Muzan!" shortly after seeing him again instead of Gyomei, considering out of all the slayers here, Tanjiro was the first to actually encounter Muzan face to face

Understandable, but hearing Gyomei scream like that when he's usually so quiet and calm was exciting. 🦋
Meh, Gyomei is kinda the leader of the Hashira, especially now that the master is gone. it’s more fitting that he would say it, for multiple purposes. Tanjiro isn’t even a Hashira tbh, his presence there is only really coincidence in the first place. Additionally, the mangaka uses Gyomei yelling whereas he was always incredibly calm and collected, to express the urgency of the situation.
Gyomei was the first to encounter Muzan mace to face
Muzan had his eyes on Tanjiro. Bro saw his demon slayer mark and got war flashbacks lmao. And he personally called out Tanjiro when they were all teleported into the infinity castle. Tanjiro and muzan have personal beef at this point
I beg to differ. I think this scene emphasized tanjiro's expressions and feelings well. Realisation, then grief and rage. Gyomei being the strongest and leader figure brought muzan to everyone's attention whereas tanjiro was the first one ready for smoke.
Doesn’t take away from Tanjiro’s scream at all so I disagree
Gyomei was the insider, it was his job to relay the information. His epic serious scream of "It's Muzan!" to his fellow Hashira, as the lead Hashira himself.... is just so real and chilling. Also, Tanjiro locked eyes with Muzan beforehand. Perfect writing imo.
I think the hashiras trust Gyomei more than Tanjiro...If Tanjiro said Muzan first..sure the hashiras will believe him but there will be a moment of hesitance like "What? No way! That's him!?"..Gyomei saying that..they immediately went "Oh alright. That's Muzan! Time to attack"
I think it's good the way it is in the anime because when [Tanjiro shouts "Muzan!"](https://youtu.be/4XY14lXE_0k?si=aUj8dlaLo0wDlQEQ) it was the highlight of the season for me. It was a moment that gave me goosebumps.
As far as I see it Tanjiro confirmed it when he yelled
I think it actually works better this way. Sure, Gyomei is the one to inform the Hashira, but this still came as a shock to them. Obviously Muzan doesn't match up with the image they must have had of him in their heads, so there's the tiniest bit of hesitation in their minds as they ask "*This* is Muzan?" Meanwhile, Tanjiro already understands completely that this is Muzan and is immediately going in for the kill.

It really showed the sheer difference between someone who's only heard of Muzan and someone who's seen him before, even if the former are Hashira.
I was hoping tanjiro said something first but I’m just glad they had him say it in general a lot of anime’s would overlook that
My assumption is that the reason Gyomei screams Muzan's name is to burn the hashiras' spirits, signalling as if Muzan is the one who caused the explosion and killed the Ubuyashiki's family.

Based on my observation, before he screamed, Gyomei ensured that all the hashiras has assembled (they were all summoned at the same time as part of the plan), and he said 'Oyakata-sama's plan is brilliant'. 

But that's just my theory.
Gyomei shouldn't even know what Muzan looks like. He just assumed that this was Muzan because the leader told him that he planned on luring muzan into a trap. 

For all Gyomei knows, the demon that showed up could have been one of the uppermoons. 

I think this shows that the Gyomei could just FEEL the difference in power and know this was Muzan. I mean... he is blind and his other senses are way stronger. 

Even the other hashira didn't know they were looking at Muzan.
No way! This was such a good moment for Gyomei. He’s the leader at this point. Every Hashira looks up to him as he is clearly the strongest but also the oldest/most experience. Even though he doesn’t have any special rank over any of the other Hashira, he is revered by every single one of them as a silent leader by the amount of respect they have for him. This was essentially the war cry to start the final battle.
I liked how everyone was shocked to finally see muzan and took a brief pause while Tanjiro immediately took out the sword and was ready to fight
I really liked Gyomei's role here. Him being the strongest in the hashira and Ubuyashikis trust in him with the plan. It seemed like he was a war general launching the assault. 

Can't wait to see more 😁
Gyomei is hot
It was fine that Gyomei do it first :3
I too thought that would be more perfect
Its literally because everyone has just arrived on scene and had no idea what was going on. Place is rubble, fire everywhere, Gyomei is swinging at some dude. It makes zero sense for Gyomei to sit down and shut up and let everyone work out what’s going on, especially when he knows the fight that’s about to go down. Leaders lead.
Nah they did this perfectly IMO. Tanjiro knew it was him immediately and was the first to draw his sword. It was on sight for him no questions. Gyomei following that up to tell the hashira that didn't know what he looked like was perfect. It was better coming from him given what had happened and his proximity.
These arms 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Tanjiro is like : Fk hashira I'm not explaining who he is I'm gonna kill him myself.
I agree, but I think it's fine the way it is.
I understand what you mean
True, but given the situation Gyomei is much more suitable for this. If Gyomei screams "Muzan!" everyone will not have the hesitation to attack Muzan as no one even knew his face except Tanjiro.
Tanjiro screaming wouldn’t be abnormal he does that a lot ☠️

Gyomei screaming meant shit s about to go down
Idk what you all up to lol. He was the first one there and shouted who their enemy is as soon as the other arrived, just so that they immediately know who they up against, and dont waste time figuring that out first. 

They didnt rush to the castle because Muzan was there. They didnt even know that at this point because their messenger crows only told them the castle was attacked, but no by whom.
I just thought it expressed a serious situation. Calm Jesus losing his shit for .2 seconds.
Bro, it was better the way it is… it’s cinematic sequencing following on Shinobu’s “Kibutsuji….MUZAN!”

It’s art
im sry but can i js say gyomei looks so fine here 💔

But Gyomei is the best character. He is the new protagonist. That's just the reality.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
I didn't read through all the comments to see if this was said already, but I thought that the events in the anime subtracted nothing from anime canon, and only added a little more depth to Gyomei by showing how devoted he was to Ubuyashiki. 

Maybe I am alone here, but it seemed to me that Gyomei was underdeveloped in both the anime *and* the manga. If his personality was supposed to be a mystery I think he still would have been developed differently. Maybe by other slayers gossiping about him or something like that.  

Overall, I think the anime devs made a good move with that choice. I felt a little resolved watching the anime, it told me that the stone hashira is just a quiet dude that carefully observes other people's character from afar, and he demonstrated his highest degree of devotion to kagaya by accepting the orders he was given, and being first on the scene he was told would come to pass.
I prefer it this way, Gyomei shouting like that really show how serious the situation is.
I can understand but what we got was still more than enough.
When tanjiro drew with zero hesitation or fear i was so goddamn proud of him 
And the last season starts. If you have read the magna you know what happens to Tanji and I’m sorry I’m advanced. Pray for my boy
I also feel like it would make so much more sense for Tanjiro to be the first one screaming his name as Muzan hasn’t changed his looks and Muzan also personally murdered Tanjiro’s family. So if anything, out of everyone there, Tanjiro should have the deepest hatred for Muzan, and should recognize him instantly.
Well Gyomei was the first there and was alerting everyone as to who it was, considering him being there was a massive part of their plan
On the contrary the all should have shouted muzan
holy shit, the last arc is released?
I do kinda wish that Tanjiro put more into this scream

https://preview.redd.it/zdnc756qr9bd1.jpeg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c691de332aa9bac781f7a37b09c27aa8018844e8
Facts!
It's the start of War!!
"It's Muson, Michael Muson"
It didn't make sense to me either.

I expected Tanjiro to be the one to "confirm" Muzan's identity since it was him who actually knows what Muzan looks like.

Even Kagaya didn't know what he looked like so they wouldn't really know if it really was Muzan in an upper moon *pretending* to be Muzan.

Tanjiro should have been the one to "confirm" it.
YES, THANK YOU 🙏🙏🙏
It's does not matter anymore..
Yea but it makes more sense for Gyomei to notice him first cuz oh how much power experience and training he has over tanjiro
I feel the same way! But what we got wasn't that bad
The entire season felt a bit fillery. Could've been a 2 hour ova, or 5 episodes, and it'd been much better
That’s fair but Gyomei carries his own weight with those words🐍
I thought them all repeating *Master* and *Muzan* was tacky as fuck. Gyomei is the only one who should have said/shouted anything - they're Hashira, they can very quickly discern the situation and what has Tanjiro been training for if he can't do the same?
gyomei was the one who knew the plan and knew muzan would show up
Yeah that’s what I thought aswell when I saw this scene
Muzan!!!!
This was the first time Tanjiro had laid eyes on Muzan since Asakusa, so finally encountering him again (with Tamayo's hand stuck in him) while recovering from the shock of the explosion that took Ubuyashiki's life stunned him into silence. 

Meanwhile, Gyomei knew about the explosion plan, so it wasn't as shocking to him as to the other Hashira (no less devastating), and he assumed a proxy leadership role. So I think him being the one to scream out Muzan's identity and the fact that beheading doesn't work on him was quite realistic and fitting. 

Also, him screaming in a slightly panicky way, when he is usually so calm and collected, was important to display the urgency of the situation, especially when the other Hashira were stunned and overwhelmed with grief. He needed them to focus on who their enemy was in that moment. Example: Sanemi was so wrathful he was about to pounce without knowing who he was facing.
Gyomei screaming Muzan’s name was based tho.
What I wanted was one of the Hashira (Sanemi) to not stop at all when the explosion happened when all of em stood and looked at the explosion. 

Sanemi should've just ran into the smoke without stopping.
Facts bc tanjiro is the only one who has seen him before besides Tomayo. I actually was surprised it was rocky, had to go back to manga to double check.
Yep
Well that’s because they screamed for different reasons. Gyomei was screaming it’s muzan to let the other people know who they are dealing with. Tanjiro screamed because he already knew him and was going in on sight. So he’s still the first who “signaled” the charge so to say. It works well actually, everyone is shocked and processing what they heard and is seeing while tanjiro was immediately on go and gets the others to lock in and attack.
How did he know Muzan was there? Is he hashira daredevil?
MUZAN?!
Gyomei seems to me like the one who’d say it first since he’s the biggest, strongest and oldest so it seems like he’s leading the pack or something
I agree. He should have screamed and then Gyomei does the same. Would have hit so hard
Disagree I think I showed alot in terms of his devotion to the cause breaking so out of character with pure rage big difference from praying and crying.
i thought that scene was fucking great to be honest wouldn't have changed anything
I see where your coming from but I do like the execution and hearing the severity of the situation reflected in Gyomei’s scream. For me the fact that he repeated himself ruined the flow though.

I feel like it Gyomei should have announced “it’s kibutsuji” and Tanjiro basically cuts him off/ finishes his sentence by drawing his sword and shouting “-Muzan”
Wasn't gyomei in on the plan?  
He knew this was about to happen and the guy trapped would be muzan
I like to think of it as tanjiro being so angry that it left him appalled and speechless so much to the point he couldn’t even fester up the word “Muzan” until the other DS already did. Basically he needed a second to process the situation. Absolutely shocked that he was able to see this man face to face again. And it was once again after Muzan had killed somebody he/everyone cared about. His rage had to build up cuz he couldn’t believe what he was seeing essentially. 

Think of it like walking in on your spouse cheating on you. Your so angry that you start shaking and want to scream but at the same time you can’t because your still in disbelief trying to process these emotions/what your seeing. And the more you think about the situation in front of you the angrier you get all the way til you snap. All this is happening within a few seconds.
I agree, because didn't Ubuyashiki tell all the hashira Tanjiro actually saw Muzan. Then also isn't Gyomei blind and since he hasn't been around Muzan he wouldn't even know what the sense for Muzan is.
bro when was this omg
I think Gyomei had to tell everyone it was Muzan since they’d never seen him before. It was part of the plan
I love how it took a couple of seconds for the hashiras to process it but Tanjiro was like “Muzan I’ll fucking kill you” right away
Wouldn’t make sense though. Gyomei is informing all the Hashira that Muzan is right there. Tanjiro just arrived and was still assessing the situation as Gyomei was yelling it out.
GYOMEI‼️‼️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🙏🏻🙏🏻💯💯
I love how while everyone was stunned to see Muzan in the flesh, Tanjiro, sweet, understanding, loving and generally non-violent Tanjiro was on sight with him. He went straight to 'I'm gonna kill your ass' with no hesitation
To me it was perfect. Gyomei screams (one of the best parts of the chapter, you don’t expect that from him) like that because he corroborates what oyakatasama told him, and Tanjiro corroborates to the other hashiras since he is the only one who has seen Muzan in person… well for me it was incredible..
tanjiro let him get away once, he is not letting that happen again
Me: FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was thinking the same thing when I first watched the episode
I like Tanjiro's yell more, but I like the way it went. Gyomei announces that not only is it Muzan, but that he's immune to death by decapitation. That info sinks in for the Hashira as they finally get a look at the ultimate evil they've been hunting for so long. Once they digest that quick info, Tanjiro pulls up and gives his war cry, spurring everyone to action. The voice acting was SO good and I had goosebumps the whole second half of the episode. Stone breathing, Tamayo confronting Muzan, everyone unleasing a breathing attack and Muzan's sinister smile was ALL absolute fucking art.
Is this where the anime is at currently? Because I don't want to watch the rest untill they finish I know they are going to cut it off probably at the infinity castle arc, and I don't want them to because this whole arc was just training but I could be wrong because from here to the finish is relatively short in comparison to the other 4 arcs they developed into anime....
Tanjiro does more than enough. Give my boy Gyomei some spotlight.
It makes sense to have the top Hashira be the one to notify the others
The scream made up for it
Dude I just watched it and I watched the manga on YouTube you go back and check your shit lol and I'll do the same are you afraid to admit when your wrong because I'm not like I said we're both most likely right and I mentioned that I made up all of the facts besides two promotions the love hashiras and the wind hashiras and I just based those facts off of what was shown, told, and presented so why are you acting like I just didn't explain that to you, you must have adhd like my self or something because that's the only thing I can think of....
Muzan!
As someone who binged all the seasons, including the newest one in a week. GOD, I can't wait for the movies to release. It's about to be  fuckin nutty!
Actually, I loved it was Gyomei, because if you see it from one point. This is not about Tanjiro. It was about all the Hashiras, who just lost their boss and wanted to take revenge. Not only that but it is the first time they are face to face in front of Muzan, the enemy they have trained most of their life to kill.
It would make sense for gyomei to be the closest because he knows about the bait
Master; ‘this week Muzan will be here to kill me and I’m gonna fuck his shit up’

*muzan comes to kill him and shit gets fucked*

Anime watchers: but how did he know who it was??
I agree. Considering the only person Muzan made direct eye contact with was Tanjiro. Would have been sick if Tanjiro announced who it was.
Personal opinion. It is Muzan
Gyomei is telling everyone that Muzan is here, because they didn’t know
Exactly my thought! They could have Tanjiro screaming "Muzan" before Gyomei even finish his sentence.

But meeeh, we were still hyped, aren't we? LOL
bro both of em yelling will never stop giving me goosebumps… the va’s rlly went fckin crazy
Gyomei didn’t see Muzan.
Fire
i too have this feeling that tanjiro should be the one to say the name first or maybe they could have done it together.
If Tanjiro said it first, the episode ending scene of both of them cursing each other make more goosebumps
exciting
![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6755)
I beg to disagree. As much as I like Tanjiro, I think that it’s only fair that Gyomei took the first call as he is the leader of the group. And the episode is called hashira unite. The leader uniting the group.
The moment where Gyomei goes from calm, secluded and gentle monk to the mfing Incredible Hulk. Absolutely raw.
gyomei was there the whole time and obviously had figured it out
I thought this was gonna be a meme post where the post after the photo just says.
“I think they might be facing Muzan”
Gyomei the hype god
I think it worked well. There might be room for disbelief by the other Hashira if Tanjiro exclaims that it's Muzan, but the Hashira would all trust Gyomei implicitly.

Plus, I like how all the Hashira are just standing there and Tanjiro immediately draws his sword and is ready to charge Muzan. He ain't playin'
I was expecting the same thing I was waiting for tanjiro to scream it out but then gyomei did which was still cool but just not what I was expecting
While yes I woudk know it if Tanjiro yelled it out I see why they had Gyomie do it however I also think Tanjiro shorten attacks slightly sooner than the rest fi the hashira (minus Gyomie)because the didn’t wait for Gyomie to say that it’s Muzan they are fighting but simply knew at the moment therefore didn’t hesitate
I mean if you imagine Tanjiro and the other hashira point of view Gyomei was in a massive ring of fire and surrounded by blood pillars, it was probably pretty obvious it was a strong demon, but Gyomei also yells out first bc he doesnt want the other hashira to be caught off gaurd by the actual king of the demons
That would be fair if Tanjiro was the first to get there, but even Gigi was ahead of him.
Isn't the big guy blind?
i actually agree with this tanjiro is the main character with personal beef with muzan it wouldve felt more appropriate if he said it instead of gyomei
I do kinda agree with this.
Gyomei shouting that helps to show the urgency and seriousness of the situation because he's always so quiet.
This will 100 percent become a meme. “It’s tickle me elmo !” “TICKLE ME ELMMMMOOOOOO!!!😡😡😡” not to be political I hate democrats and conservatives
Gyomei was there before the rest, he was already fighting, it's only logical he is the one to warn the others, IMHO.

If no one knew it was Muzan, Tanjiro warning everyone would have been logical
Would it kill to be specific on what you’re asking
Exactly!!! That part gave me chills and when Tamayo screamed about wanting to see her kids grow up!
It does break the "quiet kid" shell or something when he screamed like that
Plus, he didn't "see" Muzan. He sensed his presence like Daredevil. Also, he was the only other human that was in on the "trap Muzan" plan. Him yelling out his name was to alert the other hashira to the importance of the situation.
He literally screamed earlier in the same episode
Yeah, but the pitch of his voice went so high it ruined the atmosphere, I imagined a deeper voice.

Now that I think of if it has to be one of the nerdiest things I've ever wrote.
Exactly. You knew it was serious af when Gyomei raises his voice
Right? I was like oh shit. Its fo real now.
He said it because he was the only hashira who knew he would be there and that it was in fact muzan 💀
Which now that you mentioned it Tanjiro should had being a Hashira at this point in the story. The boy faces more Upper Moons than most than the other Pillars.
In your opinion who should be second in command?
Leader of the hashira don't mean nothing when Tanjiro was the reason for the first defeat of the upper moons
I think it’s pretty clear he’s the faux flame hashira
I was about to type "Erm, it's tanjiro actually🤓", and then i saw you said MACE to face. Accidently clever comment, if it was a typo lmao.
I was about to type whole ass paragraph until I read your comment again
Then he escaped and now we have a maze to face
Take this Upvote and eat some Manju and gtfo here.
Brilliant 😁👍
I can't wait for the part when Tanjiro >!wakes up after being poisoned by Muzan and engaging in a 1v1 while the rest of the Hashiras are unconscious!<
Absolutely in my eyes better the way it was. Tamayo very hurriedly pleading to Gyomei shows exactly how they had planned this to happen. Gyomei was the only one in on it all so it had to be him. And I prefer Tanjiro being in the "what the hells going on group" because when he sees Muzan there isn't any hesitation, just drawing the sword and screaming. Showing that Tanjiro is ready for what's ahead i.e. he's reached the hashiras level which is a big plot point. There was after all a whole arc devoted to training.
Exactly 🤝
That was my favourite part, all the Hashira are trying to assess the situation and Tanjiro is already in battle mode. 

No hesitation, no fear, just ready to throw hands
exactly i think both of the screams conveyed their anger and urgency
I think while both are great in isolation the repetition took me out of the moment something fierce.
It definitely does
I see it exactly opposite. When Gyomei screamed everyone went to shock, or rather froze in a moment. But then there is Tanjiro, ready to smoke rushing towards Muzan screaming.
They was shocked and confused when gyomei told them lmao. But when they see tanjiro immediately draw his sword and charge in screaming muzan that’s when it clicks for them and they immediately charge in aswell.
Yeah if Tanjiro just yells out “Muzan!” they’d have a moment of “huh? Did he just say Muzan? Oh shit we gotta jump him now!”. While Gyomei clearly saying “this is Muzan” makes them immediately go to “we gotta jump him now”, both because of the clarity of his words and the fact that they completely trust him.
When he unsheathed his katana then the zoom in to his face screaming 🔥
You're overthinking it. Gyomei announces that Muzan is there because the other Hashira wouldn't necessarily know it is Muzan.
>Gyomei shouldn't even know what Muzan looks like.

I should hope not, seeing as he's blind 😭🙏
The demon girl knows
>Shouldn't even know what muzan looks like

>He is blind

Yes ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)

Plus he probably knew when muzan regenerated from a whole steel ball smashing his head off in 2 seconds
This is my level of no thoughts only Gyomei comment and honestly I’m just glad I’m not the only one
It’s also super important that he calls out Muzan won’t die from his head being severed. We saw with Zohakuten how that was used against Mitsubishi (god damn autocorrect) Mitsuri.
I SEE YOUUUUU
The scream lowkey gave me slight chills
I absolutely can't wait for every non-manga readers and un-spoiled watchers to cry at >!Tanjiro's "death"!<
?
Rumour has it the first one would be 2025, second would be in 2027, and the finale of finales in 2029/2030
cutting him off pulling someone of those vocals we heard during the fight with gyutaro
Do you seriously think he’d be a slayer let alone a hashira if his other senses essentially didn’t replace his eyes
He can still use his other senses, plus he knew Muzan was coming because Kagaya anticipated his arrival and warned Gyomei
He ends up being able to us see through world anyway
![gif](giphy|lo9HTe7gmjLrO)

I think you might have a bad case of insanity
SHE HAS KIDS?
He cries and now he CRIES!
Nah that’s just the gravity of the situation. Under stress our voices get higher. Communicated how serious the situation was to me
Maybe not the most in depth, but, Best answer.
Not mutually exclusive
And lower moons too. 3 at least iirc.
Ya but he can’t beat a single Hashira. The difference in their abilities is highlighted in this arc, it’s just that Tanjiro has the mark
Nah he still isn't upper moon level. Mitsuri held back 95% of hatengu.


After the training arc he is almost there but still pretty weak to take on an upper moon alone
If it makes you feel any better, Tanjiro is currently a Hashira in all but official title right now. 

In actual ability and skill he's on par with all of the Hashira, with the only one that's still significantly stronger being Gyomei.
it isnt an opinion and it isnt debateable gyomei and sanemi are the two strongest hashira and they are captain and the right hand man. the thing that sets them apart from the others isnt a skill level but their actual bodies. They’ve honed their physique to the maximum limit. Thats why kokushibou states “once i kill you two the other hashira should be no problem”. i paraphrased that a lil bit but thats basically what he says.
I mean. That’s only because Tanjiro is the MC and was conveniently in the right place at the right time. Any Hashira would’ve surely done better in his place
Lol 😂
Ngl, me too lol
Erm, it’s a flail, actually 🤓
😂💀👌
[removed]
Yeah there's some people saying he isn't on the level of a Hashira even now. He's been going toe to toe with them in training and has held his own against upper rank demons. He's there, maybe near the bottom, but still there.
I think it shows just how much Tanjiro has grown when you compare it to how he reacted to Zohakuten. Just Zo’s presence was enough to paralyze Tanjiro for a moment. But he sees Muzan and now he doesn’t even need Yoriichi to take the controller. Just fucking on sight.
I’m glad redditors don’t write these stories lol
How so? Their screams are for completely different reasons. Gyomei is alerting all the Hashira that the demon in front of them is indeed Kibutsuji and that he can’t die if he loses his head. Whereas Tanjiro’s scream is a moment of rage
Yeah but if Tanjiro was the one announcing it then there’d be even more shock or disbelief due to some of the hashira not trusting him.
there is both i guess
I think they would've been a bit shocked regardless of who said it..the reason they are shocked is because they believe it is Muzan..if Tanjiro said it first..it might have taken them a little longer to take it in.
Tbf, I’d trust Tanjiro more considering he’s actually MET Muzan before this moment.. and the Hashira all know that
Yes. This.
Fucking awesome that his sword was out faster than all the Hashira. Tanjiro saw a glimpse of Muzan coming over the hill and immediately went into attack mode.
Idk why you’re downvoted. That absolutely true. Tanjiro is the only demon slayer in modern history who has met Muzan and lived.
Her name is tamayo, and of course she would recognize him since she was turned into a demon by him
Yes, and Gyomei does not.
There are dozens of us!
She had kids
Yeah that was my feeling too. He wanted to alert every single hashirama that this is the big villain they were waiting to face.

But i would still prefer if everyone was alerted when tanjiro suddenly yelled "muzan!".
Also, username checks out lol
Isn't it just Rui and Enmu
Upper moon level isn't what it takes to be a Hashira. No slayer has killed an upper moon for a hundred years before Gyutaro and Daki. To be a Hashira without being a Tsuguko, you can either kill a lot of demons or kill either a member of the 12 moons. That means that you can be a hashira and only be at lower moon level.
He is. Giyu attests to it in the upcoming fight with Akaza. The Hashira training arc in the anime actually does a ridiculously better job at showing it too. In the manga he is just suddenly at Hashira level with barely any training shown in the arc. But thankfully the anime expanded it a bit so it doesn’t seem like it happened in like 2 days.
True but his other feats up until that point definitely put him as relative to traditional hashira standards. This generation of hashira is just Cracked. But normally Hashira level is just kill 50 demons or kill a kizuki (lower counts). Time in service also counts I guess since you have to be the second highest rank first but that seems like it’s fudgeable since Gyomei and Mui became hashira in 2 months. 

It is later confirmed by another character’s inner monologue that this Tanjiro in this scene is indeed Hashira level.
He's currently Upper Moon level.

He could 100% take on an Upper Moon by himself at this point.
Yeah he isn't recognized as hashira level untill mid-late akasa fight. Then after he could be even considered as surpassing some of the other hashira. But to put it in terms of strength multiple hasira mention that an upper rank is on par with 2-3 hashira and muzan being on the scale of all hasira plus combined. Which by the end of the series only two hashira meet that requirement Tanjiro and the snake guy being the two strongest and most agile. The ball and chain guy was already beat to shit by the end I won't count him out though so three hasira... Gyuomei was strong but was kind of a let down by the end... I believe gyuomei is the wind hashira I have trouble with the names so apologies if I mixed it up.... but the wind hashira was a let down by the end ball and chain was beat to crap but they were both really strong just not as strong as tanjiro and the snake guy. I also believe since the writer kind of rushed the end us the reason it played out this way....
He’s literally there lmao as the other guy said and he’s well in the uppermoon level. He’s stronger than base akaza and base giyu. And later surpasses both of them. Base tanjiro would slam gyutaro and gyokko. He would still struggle with hantengu due to the nature of his abilities but with stw it’s also a slam.
it’s absolutely debatable that Sanemi is the second strongest hashira. Giyu is essentially his equal, they’re very much 2A and 2B.
Well I asked cause second in command doesn’t necessarily mean the best to lead, like Gyomei in my opinion is the leader because of his maturity, not because of how strong he is
Being MC doesn't mean anything. Cause if that's the excuse we going with, then Akaza should've died and Rengoku should not have died. Or at the very least, Akaza would've gotten his head cut off by Tanjiro.
https://preview.redd.it/aizj8vvhcbbd1.jpeg?width=251&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd72a5d345339fe8a10444e04a9c709a4a359f29
Idk why you’re being downvoted you’re right lol
He's not near the bottom.

Giyu acknowledges his strength later.

He is, in fact, entirely Hashira level.

On par with the rest.
Yeah but you’ve seen how some of the Hashira treat him. I think people like Giyu, Shinobu, and Muichiro would trust him right away, but Sanemi and Iguro would probably take a second. Either way story-wise it makes more sense for Gyomei to announce it first.
Tanjiro has been on sight with Muzan from the very beginning. Even back in season 1 when he could barely handle demons weaker than Kyogai, he was straight up calling Muzan a bitch ass motherfucker to his face.
yeah, and while I get that tanjiro could have been the one to tell everyone, it also works for the show for gyomei to put 2 and 2 together and know it's Muzan as well. But I don't think there's any reason to believe he's trying to disinform the other Hashira
So you agree with me ? lol wtf
And she called Gyomei telling him to strike Muzan which was the plan lol 💀.
My friends bully me (ish) for liking him and honestly it’s refreshing to know theres a community (im also relatively knew to the sub so there’s that)
Oh... So we talking Sanemi and Genya's mom.
Hashirama? 

You like Naruto don't you, u/Fragrant-House-2233?
You could argue the drum demon could count. Sure he was a former upper moon. But still
They fought against two lower moons with Tamayo I believe. The ones with the ball, where nezuko suddenly starting playing soccer with them.
And on top of that, you have to be the highest rank after hashira while killing a moon or your 50th demon.
No they mention hashira level is a person that can take a moon by themselves. They also have to have leadership qualities and be in for a little while... Tanjiro never takes on a moon by himself he has help with every fight that's why he's no hashira. But if your manga we know by the end he his stronger then 6 hashira combined lol
Is this not a spoiler
Current Tanjiro? Nah, absolutely 100% not upper 1-3, but I can see him taking on 4-6, especially Gyokko.
I wouldn't say Obani is one of the strongest. He was just the least fucked up by the time the Muzan fight came around. lol
Bro Tengen was getting pushed back by Gyutaro. Sure he fought him close at the end but he was going to lose/die. If you think tanjiro is appreciably stronger than any of the hashira you haven’t been paying attention. He just barely reached the level but was still getting carried by Giyu, which Tanjiro admits
Didn't Akaza basically just kill himself? Tanjiro and Giyu didn't really defeat him.
What did he say?
I said at the bottom cause when he saw the other Hashira sparring he said they were fast but that he could keep up with their movements. I took that to mean he's on their level and only a half step behind now.
I don’t disagree with Gyomei announcing it, but the master already revealed that Tanjiro met Muzan, and Sanemi was one of the FIRST people there to begin asking about it. He doesn’t like Tanjiro, doesn’t mean he doesn’t know his info about Muzan has to be reliable.
He embodies that righteous hatred from someone who's otherwise wholesome asf that's very hard to pull off believably.
I also just chalk it up to anime time dilation. Tanjiro is making eye contact with Muzan right when Gyomei starts yelling. He didn’t have a chance to react yet.
No Tamayo the demon lady lol
He was lower 6 but your point still stands. The second mission Tanjiro ever got had him fighting a lowest moon tier demon, with a broken leg and ribs IIRC.
No, they were deceived into thinking of themselves as part of the 12 moons. Tamayo actually clarified after they died.
Tanjiro killing upper 6 and 4 at kanoe ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)
This seems fudgeable too since Mui and Gyomei were hashira 2 months in. So it seems like they’re willing to just give it to someone if they’re very clearly just built different
You talking about 1 vs 1ing an upper or lower moon? Every upper moon battle was like 2-4 slayers vs 1 upper moon besides the Rengoku and Muichiro fights.
Current Tanjiro *is* on the level of Upper 3, and you'll see that next arc. There is literally no difference between current Tanjiro and Akaza fight Tanjiro. He's able to hold his own against an Akaza that's actively trying to kill him.
I agree with that as well. Obani got to reserve his strength for muzan as well as the love hashira. It's a shame she didn't have a bigger roll in the fight if you ask me Tanjiro and OBani did the most in that fight, but when it got to the nitty gritty Gyomei the stone hashira and naki the wind hashira came through when they were absolutely need though i will say that because they prevented Muzans escape as well as hitting him to prevent the death of the remaining fighters...
This Tanjiro with mark active is almost def stronger than Shinobu. Considering how he performs in the next fight I’d argue he might even be very relative to Rengoku and Tengen… and by the end of the next fight he’s definitely stronger than some of the active Hashira
No you clearly have not been watching 💀 Tengen getting pushed back is irrelevant? Lmao Tanjiro is stronger than him. He was literally able to outpace and beat base akaza. And again with selfless and stw he surpassed and blitzes him. If you think that tanjiro would lose to a demon who lost to unmarked slayers, you clearly haven’t been paying attention 💀
That’s irrelevant. Selfless tanjiro still blitzed and decapitated akaza and akaza himself stated tanjiro surpassed his speed and beat him head on. Tanjiro would have only died due to stamina. A fresh tanjiro with selfless and red blade slams.
He implied some people may not make it that far
That was early in the Hashira Training.

This is after all of it, like a whole year.
I mean did she do the same thing as Sanemi and Genya's mom.
Oh i see mb then.
Unfortunately not Kinoe
No they have to be able to take a moon on by themselves they state this numerous times in the series...
Sorry, I wasn't too specific it can be any moon but mostly lower moons because it also stated it had been 100 years since the defeat of an upper moon.... but with this show it seems like they say one thing then we learn another sometimes it's all over the place with the facts lol...
Doesn't he use his mark + unlock the see through world ability in the next arc? That's a pretty massive main character power up.
Trust me I’m not tanjiro hater. Love the kid, favorite MC. After the fight with Akaza and once he really starts spamming sun breathing I think you could absolutely argue he was stronger than a lot of hashira. 

I guess what I meant to say was that all the hashira have pretty gigantic feats this arc. Things you know tanjiro couldn’t possibly do when he fell into the castle. This isn’t a typical MC gets stronger than everyone manga, it’s a knock down drag out fight where tanjiro just happens to get two of the most powerful tools to kill muzan, STW and sun breathing. 

All I’m saying is this, the current hashira fighting, Gyomei, Iguro, Sanemi, Muichiro, Mitsuri, Giyu, and shinobu. By the time he fights akaza we know he’s not as talented as any of them. While he’s training sure he moved to the next level but he never turned the tables and started beating any of the hashira… the only argument I’ll entertain is Shinobu because she doesn’t have a feat outside of crafting.

All (most?) of the hashira consider tanjiro to be a very powerful swordsman who would have the skills of a hashira. But he’s not already hashira++++++ 😂
While I think Tanjiro is strong as hell here and def hashira level. Maybe even relative (but weaker) than Rengoku and Tengen he also gets a lot stronger throughout the next fight and I don’t think him keeping up with an Akaza who was literally not trying and wasn’t even using his BDA puts him above the other two. For all we know casual Akaza might be Gyutaros level. Giyu was very clearly carrying at the beginning of the fight. Tanjiro only outpaced him after see through world. The first half of the fight it was all he could to to just not get himself killed while supporting Giyu. 

This Tanjiro puts up a decent fight against Gyutaro but doesn’t pull a dub. Especially considering Tanjiro has no poison resistance and there’s no way in hell he finishes Gyutaro without taking damage.
Tanjiro is not stronger than Tengen LOL. The more I see your comments the more they make me laugh. Tanjiro is hashira level but not above Giyu.
So is Tanjiro only 2nd to Gyomei after the Akaza fight or is he basically stronger than every hashira at that point?
As in people dropping through the movies or dying before it launches?
The clip I'm thinking of was from the end after he pushed the bolder.
She killed and ate them
Ah ok kinda spoilers idk if she talked abt what happened yet but it’s def not the exact same situation
Lol A. >!Sanemi was promoted after killing lower 2 with help from his buddy Masachika!<, B. No it's not. Whats stated is that you have to be Kinoe and kill 50 demons or kill a moon. Alternatively you can be a talented enough tsuguku and have your hashira retire.
No worries dude. I get whatchu mean lol
His Mark becomes permanently active after he pushes the boulder, so no.

He also does *not* use the Transparent World to fight on par with Akaza. Tanjiro's able to match Akaza in base (which is technically his Marked form), and he later decapitates Akaza after using the Transparent World.
Yeah for sure i see what you mean; he’s still not at most of their level but this gen of hashira is also just broken and way above most other Eras except MAYBE the “golden age” Yorrichi started, whatever that means lol

Considering Daki killed 7 hashira I think this Tanjiro is probably mid level or even high level hashira throughout most of the corps’ history
Stw tanjiro is easily above giyu tf?
Stw tanjiro would be just behind sanemi or equal. It’s not until tanjiro gets 13th form that he surpasses gyomei.
He's pretty much 2nd only to Gyomei at that point, yeah.

He has the biggest and best set of abilities at that point, but he just isn't on Gyomei's level physically until he unlocks the 13th Form.

Think of it like this-

Sanemi \~ Giyu < Mark, STW, Red Blade Muichiro =< Mark, STW, Red Blade Obanai =< STW + SS Tanjiro << Mark, STW, Red Blade Gyomei << 13th Form Tanjiro
Yeah, but that was during the Hashira Training.

Current Tanjiro is post Hashira Training.
So yes? Bro, keep up.
It's.. literally talked about in the scene before this one
How you going to tell me I've been on a benj the last 3 days with the manga and the anime lol. But I also know it's case by case as well so we're both most likely correct honestly there also other factors as well I'm just telling you what I have seen while watching. But the scene your talking about I just watched as well and he said he felt like he didn't deserve it and he gave the master shit thinking he was treating every one like pawns before knowing that he visits the graves and knows all of there names. I just watched that episode and he already had been a demon slayer for a little while.... the love hashira got her promotion after defeating a moon by herself and because the lower ranks respected her. Kocho got hers for her knowledge in medicine as well as taking the roll after her sister muchiro tained untill vomiting blood and was promoted for his dedication as well as his strength and lineage. The flame hashira rengoku took the spot when his father retired. I don't recall hearing about the others promotions and I took a guess on kochos and muchiros but the only two promotions that have series details is the love hashira and wind hashira the rest they never really explain... I also believe you have to have the strength and reliability on that level... so like I said we're both right most likely but I have just watched the entire anime and manga up untill the last two episodes out now....
Lol I totally suck with remembering names especially Japanese names...
Wait so you're telling me that current Tanjiro is on the level of Akaza, yet you've written in past comments that Akaza handled marked Tanjiro + Giyu with ease? Something's not adding up lmao
Absolutely fair. Hashira in the sense of the word? Hell yea. You can’t tell me he’s not stronger than baby Sanemi who killed the lower moon
https://preview.redd.it/pde7vedlojbd1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdb1f3cf0e9b8c88f21ae7384ce9c7e149fd840e
Based on what you've described, I'd place Tanjiro above Sanemi. I doubt that latter is speed blitzing and beheading Akaza.
Binge it again then because your reading comprehension ain’t there and you’re making sh** up for most of these characters. And we do get details for Rengoku, he didn’t just become a hashira when his dad quit. He took on a mission his dad refused that ended up putting him against a lower moon and he solod it. It’s in Rengoku gaiden. 

You can even Google it. It’s tsuguko, kill a moon or kill 50 demons. You don’t get promoted for “dedication” that’s cornball head canon.
Dude that's like my biggest gripe with anime in general. There's no way I'm remembering like a dozen+ Japanese names. 😅
He *is* on Akaza's level, as he can fight on par with Akaza, evade his attacks, land his own, and repeatedly clash with Akaza's strikes.

That, however, doesn't mean that Akaza can't handle Tanjiro and Giyu with relative ease, though.

Akaza's Compass Needle is extremely useful for handling multiple opponents at the same time, and despite Akaza not being immensely above either Tanjiro or Giyu physically, he's able to hold his own (or "handle") a tag-team from Tanjiro and Giyu.

Akaza isn't easily able to *kill* Tanjiro and Giyu in a 1v2, but he's able to easily stand his ground in a 1v2, if that makes sense.
Lol oh for sure, just by virtue of him being able to consistently fight back against an enraged Sanemi he’s probably walking through the lower moons lol
You speak defunct reading comprehension lmao.
Well I mean marked sanemi, his speed feats on koku are impressive depending on where you scale that form of Koku and take into account how much work marked gyomei is doing. But either way he’s in that range before 13th form
SO TRUE!!!!
I'mma be honest!!!!

Hell yeah😈
Each of Tengen's wives do share a face with one of the boys.
She's inosuke's older sister.
Nah bro Inosuke thicc enough💜
Maybe so, but Inosuke’s got nicer boobs so there!
In all honesty, they are disturbingly similar.
Accurate
One of the best girls of show. ⚔️
Would.
Inosuke as a girl would probably have a handsome and masculine face though
Yep, they spent too much on CGIs that they are just reusing models now because they are getting lazy and to save money and they hide it by being funny 🙆‍♂️
What is her diet and daily routine to get that THICC ?
you can’t tell me that Suma doesn’t look like Inosuke tbh.💯
Ok true
I thought it said “nicer” at first 😭😭

Before I saw the season I actually thought Inosuke had a long lost sister or something
Missed opportunity to say “butt” thiccer
She has hair colour like his eyes and he has eyes colour like her hair
mmmmmmmmm
Man, I hope Uzui did not confuse Inosuke with his wife during one of those long lonely nights
I thought Inosuke was trans for like 60 episodes
This was literally my first thought when I saw her. 😂
I legit thought she was his long lost mom or something.
Inosuke is funny
hes not lieng
Real
A head cannon I have is that she’s Inosuke’s birth mother and was forced to give him up because of her line of work
Facts
kind of, yeah 🌫

Infinity Castle has got to be the coolest concept in new gen anime
The way Ufotable showcasing Infinity Castle throughout the anime was undoubtedly astonishing and they did such a great job adapting from the manga. While other anime series may share some similarities i think Infinity Castle is unique in its own way.

The concept on itself is interesting but Ufotable is truly bringing it to life, now we can really see that there are a couple of sights that’s just repeats on themselves, as such it is a pseudo infinite.

I kinda wished we saw what was in that palace surrounded by the lily pads
I thought it looked kinda similar to Yubaba's bath house from Spirited away.
That whole Hashira and Demon slayers entering into Infinity castle are was an extremely good sequence.

Also, the music was just🤌

You just can't praise the visuals and not mention music. It really brought out the gravity of the situation and beginning of something grand which hasn't happened yet in the series. I am really looking forward to hear only OSTs as well.
You do know the idea came from the manga and not an anime idea right???
Hhmmm, the concept may have come from the God's hand dimension in the prequel arc of Berserk which came in the early 90s

Replace the Japanese theme into medieval/baroque, and you got the God's hand dimension
Pocket dimensions aren't really unique in anime but ufotables depiction of the infinity castle is excellent.
All of this came out of a damn flower
Hell nah it's cool and all but calling it the coolest concept?
Infinity?

Would you live in there ?
I thought it looked kinda similar to Yubaba's bath house from Spirited away.
I'm like 99% sure the castle is CGI, but it's done so well and gives off the effects amazingly. I really want to see how it looks in the manga.
What scene does the akaza picture come from?
The concept of an infinite room, dimension, whatever, itself ist really anything special but the execution of it was superb
It is epic :3
i will NEVER understand why people add “in a new gen” or something like it. just creates a pissing contest of fans going “nu uh” and makes the community more toxic. just say “this is cool” and move tf on why does everything have to be a contest
Ufotable makes it interesting*
Is there any word on when the infinity castle arc will be coming out? I'm assuming 2025
Interstellar's Tesseract
This my crib fr
A labyrinth of japanese castle
Do I have an anime for you
honestly amazing. i hope they go crazy with it in the movies and make it a spectacle
I feel like it's less about concept and more about execution. Ufotable have both the talent and the motivation (from Mugen Trains success) to really make something outstanding. They stand alone on the top of the anime studio quality totem pole and they're going to outdo themselves again with these movies.

It’s the backrooms of anime and I love it
Ryōiki Tenkai
Reminds me of the millenium puzzle from yugioh
closest i can think of (and its not even an anime) was Maze Runner
Middle left looks like a shot of a big Japanese city, like for example Tokyo, during the Taisho era
I feel like the Demons who are going to a meeting have to go there two weeks in advance because they would get so lost would take them two weeks to find the spot
I prefer Infinite Fortress...
And to think we’ve already seen the Cult Garden where Doma and Shinobu battle.
Was it really well done for animation? Absolutely. Was it the coolest thing in new gens? Hell no, not even close tbh
This is once-in-10-year animator blow manga concept sky high. Cherish in it Imax, friends
The animation is really wonderful. I saw the manga references and the difference is astounding. It truly comes alive and the theme and coloring is also exceptional.
I want to know why all the non-hashira demon slayers didn’t die to fall damage.

I love the infinity castle, but I was confused, because wouldn’t you just let them fall instead of giving them platforms to stand on? I know the gravity is all wonky but still lol
Tbh although I disliked some of ufotable pacing and story-boardwriting decisions, though I appreciate how they honored the concept of the infinity castle, no other studio could have done it better.
And top left is douma
I wonder why there are a lot of pillars. Koku likes pillars ig?
She's an upper moon, right? Is her blood demon art the entire pocket dimension?
Wtf was in Muzan’s doctor’s medicine that could give someone power to create another dimension?
Ask Nakime how it works😂
You are really thinking about feasibility in a shounen show like Demon Slayer?
You know there's a quote ,"Good artists copy. Great artists steal"., so go on.  Looking forward to your manga
Same comrade I already have a sort of simular concept
It reminds me of the western air temple from ATLA
I see it as a Domain Expansion from jjk
it only took you a year to realise that?😅
I need the season and episode number plz
Doesnt need one.
Just you wait
Patience, my dude.
Name a cooler one?
r/beatmetoit
yeah
Why wouldn't you, I'd absolitely love to
Both have the traditional japanese look.
That is definitely not hand drawn but it’s still cool so who cares
You mean the mangaka.
Thr infinity castle works differently than real world; you can stand up side down like the upper moons in the first opening of s1.
The Demon Slayers are still stronger than an average person. They were all trained and selected before becoming a Demon Slayer. I think that they all can handle the fall.
Gravity, there most likely isn’t any fall damage, a kind of limitation that makes the place possible.
Gravity pulling from different sides negates the force a bit. If you're getting pulled from all directions (because there are no up or down in this realm) it's significantly less acceleration than a monodirectional gravitational force.
I think they did the manga more than justice. The anime is actually better than the manga. Just the way they have expanded battles, the music, the animation - it’s a masterpiece.
Ah  yes, the perks of being an upper moon. A city sized room. In another dimension only problem is you don't know where the kitchen .
Douma's crib is so pretty ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6744)

Hm…
Yup
**MAGIC**
Another dimension? Another dimension
Yeah tbh. What was man brewing that allows people to create infinite sized pocket dimensions?
Its gonna be a while
Except that you dont get fall damage (evident that even the weakest of slayers survive falling)
https://preview.redd.it/82104rfu6jed1.jpeg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f95d4be49dddadb9046ae30dfe868eefe4dc08e1
Of the image? It’s the first episode of Swordsmith Village
He means ufotable makes it interesting
I know, but it all depends on where they are. If someone falls for 50’, it doesn’t matter if there is a guy standing on the ceiling 100’ away. Their perspective has them falling 50’ to what they would see as the floor. The one standing 100’ away would see them falling towards the ceiling. 

Gravity wouldn’t feel different to you in the infinity castle since you would be experiencing it from your perspective. It’s all relative! 

I think the Hashira + Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke could survive a fall but I think the other Demon Slayers would be struggling if they happened to get a big fall lol

It’s just fun to think about. I’m not hating on the infinity castle whatsoever lol
I’d hope so. There are plenty of demon slayers who couldn’t cut it and had to quit too. It seems like most Demon Slayers can’t use breathing techniques very well aside from the Hashira and MCs.
I am not arguing those parts; we all know their art and music are good; I just had some issue with their pacing especially in the swordsmith village arc; if you compare it to something like Mahoraga Vs. Sukuna which was extended substantially while keeping the pacing consistent, in SV Arc ep.7 and ep.9 felt inconsistent even the manga was more extended both narratively and pacing-wise. There was also missed opportunity to expand Mitsuri fight in ep.11; also we haven't seen Zohakuten utilized like how Mahoraga did. 

 My 2nd criticism is the these anime-original dialouges are not the way I like them; in the HT arc we got alot of repeated dialouges; Let's defeat Muzan; he's looking for Nezuko; etc. A single scene of Kanao talking to Tanjiro is more important than all these interactions that don't add anything to the series.

Remeber unlike many who cares only about flashy fights, I care about execution more; when I read the manga Gyokko death felt fine, but in the anime due to the pacing issues it was underwhelming to a high degree.

I saw also many animators pointing such issues with the storyboard.
I mean SSV had a lot of pacing issues, but the fights themselves were stunning
You don’t really need a kitchen as a demon,  food poisoning is not exactly an option to need to cook
Nooo.. I didn't mean it like that 😭
It is the blue spider lily; based off of Japanese mythology and culture, so its powers, such as the infinity castle, come from divine forces if I remember correctly.
No worries take your time. Rooting for you!
I don't think that's where she fights doma though...  

If u remember , kanao opened a door and saw her getting absorbed
Must be some enclosed space , definitely not that big like that mansion in the picture
??
I think they struggled a bit, but they ARE demon slayers, so they are stronger than normal humans. You can see the demon slayers with Murata fall face first and struggling to land correctly, while the hashiras landed perfectly
That really surprised me. I assumed most could at least a little
They are probably average at breathing techniques. Tanjiro and Hashiras are just outliers lol. 

They could also do the same move that Tanjiro did at the Arrow Demon fight to negate the fall damage,
I can agree with Zohakuten and some of the dialogue stuff - though overall I still feel the expansions from the manga have been overwhelmingly positive.
[removed]
Aw man
Yeah, but I’m sure the fella forgot to add it in due to Muzan searching for it, so whatever he had earlier just did that fr.
Waterfall basin!
As I said the manga chapters are restricted to 18 panels, it's the job of the studio to show us how creative they're; ufotable did an amazing job with music, cgi, artstyle and animation; but I think Mappa storyboard writers are more creative with there extensions.

That bluray Mahoraga vs Sukuna speaks tales.
LMAO, this had me giggling, spoiler tag this just in case tho, this is too funny
spoiled again damnit
True but they also have to get the OK from the Manga Writer as well they can’t just Toss in extra stuff just because it would make sense to (even if they should have I agree with that) We all know Demon slayer prefers to stay to the Source material so no filler episodes or moments really. But some things do get the ok, for example Muichiro 1v2 against Sanemi and Obanai that was clearly put in for the specific purpose of showing how massive Muichiro’s accomplishment was and To show how much stronger he had gotten compared to the others. Wasn’t in the manga but was put in for expansion of the story.
I don't think the author is involved in any of the episodes her name wasn't in the credits of revisors; 

I personally didn't like the added stuff because there was an opportunity to flesh out Kanao relationships with Tanjiro hell even Shinobu but they didn't do it; instead we got scenes that don't add anything to the story.

Anime-original episodes never add anything of value; Naruto for example.
Huh I didn’t know they could just make the anime entirely separate without any input from the author
However I do agree they could have used the anime originals to flesh out the characters who need it from the short amount the got even in the manga
My guess is they have get the green light from the author to adapt the source material; I don't think Gotouge cares alot about anime-original contents; because it's the consensus in Japan that authors don't get involved in filler episodes.
Thinking back, Muzan would've ripped Gyutaro a new one if he actually made Tanjiro a demon.
Like at this point he new nothing about the Kamado bloodline being immune to sunlight, so he would've just thought Gyutaro was disobeying direct orders to kill them.

He would’ve loved it, having the sun breathing demon art would be crazy
Assuming Tanjiro’s capable of withstanding Muzan’s blood to become a demon. Muzan gets final say in what demon gets to live or die. So, we’d see Tanjiro either live his “best” life as a sun breathing UM (take THAT um1!!!!) or he’d just get popped like a tick by Muzan.
It is still Muzan cells decision at the end of day :3
You joking? Nah he would have been like HELL YEAH another demon slayer especially a strong one a demon. He wanted him dead but have him join him worst case he'd just kill tanjiro with his blood and best case, he'd have a super strong demon equal to at min lower 1.
I thought only Muzan could make people demons. Could other demons do this too?
Muzan needs to accept an upper moons proposal. (Chapter extra, written by Gotouge and completely canon. This is how >!Kaigaku became a demon. Koko gave him his blood and Muzan accepted the proposal!<.)

https://preview.redd.it/9xy34kfp7rcd1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a250159877dac755681fb28ec2332dfdd5b196a
I think he’d be glad to have another possible Sun Breathing threat under his control instead of against him 🦋
No not really. It would have taken out the single grain of salt into the machinery
Gyutaro could have killed Tanjiro right here and the demon slayers would be fked 💀
Tanjiro would had only became a demon if Muzan allowed it. Plus >!He's turned Demon Slayers before, including Kokushibo!<
It amazes me how polite and honorable the vilians are, always asking for permission to transform them.
That’s a given, but he’d have scolded him and moved on, because at the end of the day, now Tanjiro is potentially under his control and could be terminated at will. It’s only a problem if he and his sister escape and he also break the Curse of Kibutsuji. 

If not, Muzan has the last sun breather under his control, and so therefore the breathing style is now his weapon. If he realizes this, he could keep the siblings, and when one conquers the sun, it’ll be so easy to absorb them. If not, they die, and both sides take a major hit as Muzan prematurely terminates his victory, and the demon slayers lose their activation card for the mark.

They might not even become demons, Muzan, upon getting the notification, could easily veto and prevent the transformation.
Either way, Muzan might just be happy with that decision, considering tanjirou would be under his control and would probably not be able to pose a threat to him with his influence and other stuff, or Gyutarou simply just kills him and Muzan would be ECSTATIC
Tanjiro is the same blood as Nezuko.  Muzan would have been over the moon with joy once he saw what ability that conferred to Tanjiro, and subsequently to himself.
Yo creo que Muzan hubiera hecho que Tanjiro lo retara por su puesto como la 6ª luna superior y seguramente Gyutaro y Daki hubiesen muerto
I will spoil this whole thing for everybody if y’all don’t stop making these dumbass posts
Having a sun and moon breathing demon would make his day.
I don’t think so
Yeah he would have been hyped. Not only does it get rid of the threat of tanjuro, he would have another demon with a breathing style
Would he? He had standing orders to have Tanjiro killed, but turned into a demon he’d be a powerful ally.
Actually, this is a fair point
I think Muzan would’ve actually been happy. Since Tanjiro knows sun breathing there is reason to believe he’d be immune to the sun. Nezuko ends up being immune
Have you read the manga?
Tanjiro would >!resist the sun immediately as he later does!<, which means Muzan would >!consume him, become immune to the sun, and just destroy all the demons because that was their only use to him.!<

So technically, you are correct.
I mean, I think Muzan wouldn’t care too much, like, he doesn’t really have much respect or care for the upper moons, but he knows they’re not morons, so if one of them wanted to convert someone, I’m not sure Muzan would stop it
Here's a matchup I thought about a while ago. 

Flect Turn from My Hero Movie 3 vs Muzan
Ohhh, I never realised it was the Kamado bloodline that was immune to sunlight ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flushed). I thought it could have to do with Nezuko not being a typical demon. What episode reveals this?
Dumb take...

He would obviously love it because tanjiro would have conquered the sun and the MuZAn would have absorbed him and GG.

All of a sudden gyytaro delivered him his one true wish!
Noooooo not my Gyu-San! 😭🖤💚
L take from a fake fan who doesnt know the story or characters and what they would like and not like
I mean he probably wanted to tear Guytaro a new one for a while
Why? It would mean Muzan can Absorb sunnimmune Tanjiro and gain immunity to the sun.
Muzan wouldn't care much since Tanjiro wasn't a threat to him at this point, plus he could just kill him.
I think he would’ve given Gyutaro a promotion if he managed to convert A sun breathing user to a demon or at least Demon of the month
Muzan had no issue making Kokoshibo, Yoroichi's literal twin, a demon
If muzan didn’t like tanjiro as a demon he could just kill him like he did with the lower moons 🤷🏾‍♂️
Can’t he just explode the demon cells in tanjiros body?
Muzan would probably love it.

It would be like putting his greatest threat on a leash, and Muzan could kill him at any moment.

Why? Tanjiro at this point isn't especially strong.
He didnt want to transform yoriichi who's the creator of sun breathing and tanjiro gives him PTSD so i doubt he'd like it
Nah Muzan hates when his underlyings show initiative because he thinks they are trying to outshine him.
One reason I love Muzan is because he isnt just evil, he is also a terrible abusive boss.
Plus Muzan would also like that he’s making a mockery of Yoriichi by not only having Yori’s brother in his demon army, but the sun breathing successor too
Yeah, he let Douma turns Daki and Gyutaro even if he didn't ordered it
Yeah, no matter what, if Muzan orders a demon to die, that demon dies.
Not necessarily. Nezuko overcame muzans cells near instantly. 

It's entirely possible Tanjiro would also overcome muzans cells and become another free-acting demon like Nezuko and Tamayo. 

Muzan would be in a world of danger if a sun-resistant, sub breathing, rogue demon started hunting him down with the hashira.

And, Spoilers: >! DKT had only existed for a few minutes AND was ALL of muzans UNDILUTED blood. He can't really be used to say Tanjiro wouldn't break free !<
1. He doesn't like Tanjiro.

2. He doesn't like making demons.

3. Gyutaro ain't dead, so he doesn't need another Upper Moon.

4. He already disbanded the lower moons.
>! UM’s like Kokushibo,Douma and Akaza have a lot of Muzan blood inside of them. That’s why they can also make people’s demons. Kokushibo made Kaigaku a Demon. Douma Gyutaro and Daki. Akaza wanted to make Rengoku and Giyu a Demon!<
Upper one and two have been shown to convert humans into demons on screen itself(manga panel not literally screen) and akaza has claimed to have the same ability. Think of it as muzan using them like a phone line, if they think someone would make a good demon they give them blood, if muzan shares their belief then they’ll turn into one, if not it’s lights out I guess. Both gyotaru and kaigaku were demonised in this way.
Only Muzan can make demon, and the upper rank demon can only Initiate a demon making process which then goes to Muzan and if he accept it, only then the demon creation will be complete.

Lower rank demon cannot initiate the demon creation process.
Have you even watched the show dude? This topic came up plenty of times and not just as a side note.
My understanding is Muzan is the one that making the final decision. Even if your body is compatible with his body, as long as he rejects you, you will die. Only a few demons had special permission to distribute his blood.  One of the examples is lower moon 5. Some upper moon had give his blood to some else without getting the permission first ( or at least I believe so), but they made similar remarks that implied they can become demons if Muzan accepts it.
fr, considering muzan did some of the og's dirty, akaza straight got a hand through his face then got the option to die or transform💀
It isn't

The mountain that the kamado family live on is the place where the blue spider lily grows and they use it in their medicine. Hence why nezuko worked outside the normal demon rules
pretty sure the reason is manga spoiler. hasn't been addressed in the show yet
Muzan doesn't know about that at this point.
he would absolutely care wtf are you on
Gyutaro could've outright ended his greatest threat then.
Tanjiro is not Yoriichi's blood
Nothing implied he saw making *anyone* from Yorrichi's bloodline as a get back, so I doubt he'd get any personal satisfaction from it.
Nezuko being immune to sunlight was literally in the last season. Idk what to tell you.
He's removing the threat, that's invaluable to Muzan
I mean, at this point in the story, tanjiro had gone up against like two moons and survived. Plus he mostly fought rui on his own, granted without getting the kill. I can see why Gyutaro was at least interested in tanjiro
Yes he was? He 100% would have been the next Upper moon(although, given what we've seen from Nezuko, it's probable that he'd be immune to the sun and therefore would get eaten by Muzan)
[removed]
Tanjiro is a thousand times stronger than the people Muzan turned into demons…
Sir, you don’t know shit.
Because he’s taking away his biggest threat to him and making him a puppet that can use sun breathing
Tanjiro wasn't that strong here yet but remember he also reminds him of the man Muzan feared.
He is stronger than a lower moon as a human, and with Sun breathing
And yet Muzan runs for the hills whenever he sees him…
Muzan didn't know how powerful or important Yoriichi was when they first met. And after that first meeting, he was too scared to ever go near him again.
I think I’ll have to disagree with you on this. Muzan couldn’t care less about shine or credit. He just wants to be immortal. That’s it. He actually kind of cares about the UMs
Tamayo, the demon boy she made, and Nezuko being the only exceptions, right?
I don't think Muzan would care. He can just kill Tanjiro even easier once he becomes a demon
Gyutaro can't make a demon without Muzan's consent.  Tanjiro would only become a demon if Muzan's cells accepted him.

  
At this point in the story, Muzan didn't know Kamado blood was the key to his primary objective.  If he did know, he'd make Tanjiro a demon in an **instant**.  He'd do it himself.
I think Muzan still has to accept you. I remember Kokushibo saying something along those lines.
[deleted]
I forget things easily. I even rewatched season season 1 and there were so many interesting things I forgot.
Ppl forget things

Do you remember every single plot thread of every single show you watch
It doesn’t actually come up that much.
Also the same house that Yoriichi lived in with Uta.
Oh sixxxkkkk!! So Nezuko is immune to sunlight from the blue spider lily's she ate growing up? So how come Muzan hasn't found those lilies yet?
Its not even manga spoiler, its on a fanbok.
Yes he does, why do you think he killed tanjiros family, he tried to turn them into demons in order to see if they would conquer the sun.

 besides it would become immediately apparent when tanjiro doesn't die from the sun, he would absorb him and tell gyytaro.

"Wow bro you did it!, promoted ! You are now more my favorite "
I mean, not really. Tanjiro was just a low-level slayer. (At this point in time)
Muzan probably thinks he is.
Post says. Thinking back, muzan would have ripped guyitaro a new one if he actually made tanjiro a demon…. How is not a spoiler for people who are currently watching the English dub and on episode 3 of the new season. We also have not learned how she was immune…..
Killing Tanjiro would also remove the threat.
Those aren't exactly reasons for Muzan to be thrilled.
Yeah but that's not really "crazy" to Muzan at this point.
spoilers go wild
Brodie this has an anime tag id mark your spoilers
Bro, you fucked up the spoilers tag, it dont work if there is a line break. That is straight up spoilers of the very ending
Bro these are MAJOR SPOILERS you need to spoiler this
Thanks for the spoilers without using the spoiler block text that was made specifically for instances like this.
Don't leave a space between '>!' and the first 'letter'
Make sure to put a space between your spoiler markers, you've almost got it!
I hate you so much right now :( next time mark your spoilers on anime-only threads ffs man, please
Muzan doesn't know any of that at this point.
...so do you have anything constructive to say or....?
Muzan avoided Tanjiro once while they were in a public area.
He did know yoriichi was powerful since he had already transformed kokushibo and know how much he hated him because of how strong he is, he just didnt know HOW powerful he was
Its more that he thinks of himself VERY high and he dislikes when the other demons have ideas smarter than his own or contradict what he said.
The issue is that if he actually was as cunning as he thought he would already get everything he wanted. But he is petty, irrational and very impulsive which is why he murdered the doctor before even seeing the effects of the drug.
SPOILERS: >!Due to Muzan getting his teeth kicked in so badly by Yoriichi he ended up losing the connection between him and Tamayo. The boy Tamayo turned had a different ritual done to him as he doesnt require blood near as much as a typical demon and didnt die when she or Muzan died. Nezuko also lost connection to Muzan due to insanely strong emotional connection to Tanjiro overriding what happened to them.!<
Muzan would care that Gyutaro went through the effort of wasting his blood and not killing Tanjiro when he specifically wanted Tanjiro dead.

The effort it would take to kill Tanjiro from Muzan at this point was always pretty much zero.

The fact that Muzan has to do it now is the problem.
>!He said that to Muichiro. “Let me make you a demon. With your abilities you can be useful to that man. But if he doesn’t accept you then death is in your fate!<
I thought he was referring to the blood. Like how the first few times we saw Muzan giving blood to humans, there was a chance of rejection and that human will die instead of becoming a demon.
Not directly, what Kokushibo meant was that the Muzan cells in his blood could reject Kaigaku and kill him off if he wasn't worthy.
No - Rui turned other demons into something similar to him.
Don't worry, that's fair.
You also forgot that you typed another "season" word
Of course not, but this is a frequently returning theme bro. It's like forgetting that the Breathing Styles exist.
A mixture of bad luck and really bad management
>!They only bloom during the day two or three times a year. Muzan was too prideful to employ humans to investigate.!<
Why would Muzan try to kill Tanjiro with the sun? He would just explode his cells.
he literally sent people to specifically kill him because he saw he's part of the bloodline. He hates when people don't follow his orders. His level as a slayer literally does not matter.
Even Gyutaro could tell Nezuko and Tanjiro were related
This was a plot point back in season 2 my guy.
Making him a demon makes him an ally as well though
How is that going for him? 

If he turned instead, he could kill him in a snap of his finger.
Yes it is? This is BEFORE the Upper Moons start dropping like flies
Does that negate the fact that he knows he’s a demon slayer who wears hanafuda earrings like the 🐐? Muzan wouldn’t care if he’s a demon, either way the potential threat eliminated
And instead of finding him after the fact and killing him personally he sends two other demons to do the job
Where did you get the idea that Muzan already knew about him before their encounter? That's never stated anywhere that I know of. In chapter 195 Muzan said that when he first saw Yoriichi, he seemed completely weak and unthreatening. And that's the only time Muzan ever really talked about his perspective during that encounter. He never indicated that he had any clue about Yoriichi's strength, aside from knowing he could use Breathing.

I'm not completely discounting the possibility that Kokushibo warned Muzan about Yoriichi, but there's no point where we're explicitly shown or told that he did. In the manga, Muzan seemingly had no idea who or what he was dealing with when he ran into Yoriichi.
the writing is still inconsistent for Nezuko. Still doesnt make sense.
I don’t remember many instances of us being shown him giving blood, but for that one case I remember the most he purposely overdosed the girl with his blood full knowing that her human body couldn’t withstand it, he meant to kill her there.
IDK why you were downvoted. This is what I remembered.
That’s exactly what he meant, I can’t believe you got downvoted so bad
Yeah, that is also plausible
That's Muzan specifically giving him leeway cos he saw similarities in their situation I think
I would argue that remembering the specifics of how the demon transformations work, is something even the most hardcore fans might get mixed up with.

Even for me, I've watched the series at least 3x (except for the most recent season of course), and I've completed the manga, but even I needed to read the manga to remind myself how the rules about making demons work
That’s a given, but he’d have scolded him and moved on, because at the end of the day, now Tanjiro is potentially under his control and could be terminated at will. It’s only a problem if he and his sister escape and he also break the Curse of Kibutsuji. 

If not, Muzan has the last sun breather under his control, and so therefore the breathing style is now his weapon. If he realizes this, he could keep the siblings, and when one conquers the sun, it’ll be so easy to absorb them. If not, they die, and both sides take a major hit as Muzan prematurely terminates his victory, and the demon slayers lose their activation card for the mark.

They might not even become demons, Muzan, upon getting the notification, could easily veto and prevent the transformation.

So they explained in season 2 that the Kamado bloodline was the reason why nezuko can go in the sun? Hmmm. Must have missed that.
Considering he already has the uppermoons, I don't think he'd care so much about a demon slightly stronger than daki. And since tamayo has already proven that demons can escape his curse, he'd likely just kill him (probably absorb him) and move on.
Unless he were to become another Tamayo or Nezuko.
............ 😒 I would kill him if I find him
Muzan doesn't want more demons, he wants the Slayers dead.
Yeah, so if he has a bunch of demons that are stronger than Tanjiro and that he likes significantly more than Tanjiro, why would he be crazy about Tanjiro joining his ranks?
I mean kinda? Muzan wanted Tanjiro dead, not recruited. Muzan doesn't know anything about the Kamado sun-stuff outside of the earrings, why would that factor into his opinion?
Yeah because he thinks it's beneath him.
So far as I'm aware, Muzan didn't transform Koku until after he'd met Yoriichi.  Muzan specifically sought him out because of his relation to Yoriichi.
Im not saying kokushibo warned muzan, im saying that muzan knew kokushibo wanted to become a demon because he wanted to surpass his brother, and muzan also knew kokushibo is strong so naturally muzan knew yoriichi is stronger by a fair margin considering kokushibo needed that much of his blood just to try equaling him
Probably the more extensive version is that Tanjiro and Nezuko mother cooked for them using blue spider Lily for most of their life so they somewhat developed an immunity to demons cells/blood
There’s a theory that because she didn’t eat humans, the demonic transformation didn’t bind her to Muzan. Note that there was no intention to turn him into a demon when the doctor was treating him but once he started consuming humans that’s when his condition became diabolical
I always thought that Muzan's monologue meant that not a human should be able to withstand the mutation to become human. But then again, this was never mentioned or showed again after that episode. A limit from the author, I guess.
>Considering he already has the uppermoons, I don't think he'd care so much about a demon slightly stronger than daki. 

I mean it's not like you stay the same strength forever though. Doma used be Upper 6 yet grew to become Upper 2. And most demons don't even start off Daki level to begin with. I mean just look at Gyutaro and Daki themselves. When they became demons, they weren't even close to Slayer levels, let alone Tanjiro. Yet still they became Upper Moons so Tanjiro becoming a demon at Daki level is pretty huge. 

>And since tamayo has already proven that demons can escape his curse, he'd likely just kill him (probably absorb him) and move on.

By that logic, Muzan would never turn anyone into a demon again after Tamayo. Yet he still did for many many years. So that's a non factor.
I mean a demon who knows breathing styles is highly valuable. You’d have a kokushibo 2.0 in your ranks.
It’s not about how strong he is but his ability to conquer the sun
At that point, Nezuko hadn’t conquered the sun. He only changes from ‘I need to make more demons so I can find the Blue Spider Lily’ to ‘I don’t need to make anymore demons, I just need to absorb that girl’ after Nezuko stands in sunlight
Because he's strong, and therefore useful, after a year or so, Tanjiro would easily surpass Gyutaro and Gyokko, meaning he'd be Upper 5, and also meaning he'd be stronger, and therefore more useful than those 2
It’s Muzan only makes demons with the hopes that one will be able to conquer the sun so he could eat them and gain the ability. One extra demon is one more chance to do that.

I think he says that didn’t even want to make demons at all.

Also explains why he attacked Swordsmith village: more demons equals more chances for one to gain the bda to withstand the sun.
He also knows that Tanjiro is a sun breather remember, Since the breath has defeated several of his demons, and while it failed to defeat Rui, Muzan upon looking through his last memories would see Tanjiro unlock Sun Breathing.
Spoilers: >!it’s revealed that despite being the strongest demon Muzan is actually a massive coward who won’t fight unless he’s sure he can win after Yorichii almost killed him and afterwards hid in the Infinity castle until Yorichii died of old age. It’s somewhat implied that he waited until after Tanjiro’s father passed away before finally attacking the Kamado family as his father was extremely strong despite being sickly. Hence when he sees Tanjiro wearing the same ear rings and with a mark on his forehead we see him straight up have a panic attack in private before summoning assassins. And in the season finale his first move is to get Tanjiro as far from him as possible.!<
Koku was actually transformed before he met Yoriichi, it was only when Muzan escaped that he was told that his brother became a demon by slayers rushing to him.  
Muzan himself says that "I'm no longer interested in swordsmen who use breathing" at the beginning of their fight.  
Implying that by that point he had already turned Kokushibo.  
So yeah, he completely didn't know about Yoriichi. And knowing how spiteful and egotistical Kokushibo is in regards to him. I doubt he'd tell him as he'd feel that he was superior to him by that point
?? Muzan offers Koku to become demon because he would d!e before he turn 25 cuz Koku already have his mark, Muzan says things about dying and if Koku wants to keep his sword techniques then become a demon like him, when muzan first met Yorii he thought that Yorii was weak too and can’t sense any hatred that’s why he not prepared for the attack
i mean we can all make up theories but this is just us making excuses for plot armor at this point....
I perceived it as him just flexing how much better he is than humans and how he’s the “perfect being” since he got triggered by the drunk guy saying he looked like he was dying. He clearly doesn’t need to give much blood to make anyone a demon, just scratching that random dude made him a demon. So by pumping in loads of blood that is something the human body definitely can’t handle.
Yes, he could grow, but I don't think he'd care all that much.

The reason he kept creating demons, is probably because A. The chance for them to escape his grasp is extremely low. And B. If they did break free they wouldn't be able to defeat him. Tanjiro knows sun breathing (to some extent) and considering his last encounter with someone who knows sunbreathing, the  chance being low doesn't matter to him because it's still there. Muzan is extremely careful, so if Tanjiro was turned into a demon he'd likely just absorb him and move on.
And it’s sun breathing, not just moon breathing. Imagine sun breathing with a BDA
Right after gaining Kokushibo, he said that he was no longer interested in breathing styles. If he truly wanted more demons that could use breathing styles, it's likely he'd just make hashira with subpar morals into demons.
He already had an optimal number of demons at this point. He wasn't really back into production mode until the later arcs.
Putting aside the fact that Tanjiro's morality would make him a dogshit demon, Muzan doesn't like change and he likes Tanjiro even less.
Muzan doesn't know that sun breathers are immune to sunlight as demons.
Muzan literally engaged Tanjiro in a 1v1 for a good while instead of running so this logic doesn't work.
Muzan def also knew abt kokushibo wanting to surpass yoriichi since thats all he talks abt bru, and muzan literally said "i dont need another demon that can use breathing styles" meaning he knew yoriichi used them and he looks like kokushibo too
Tanjiro is not a nobody at this point of the story so converting him to a demon would be a blow to the corps morale as well. It's not just a numbers game.

Nope, he's still looking for the flower and still trying to conquer the sun, he's absolutely still making more demons. He's culling the weak ones that know too much, but taking away the hunter with sun breathing would be a huge win
Which is why he'd absorb him so he could become immune to the sun.
Never said he did, but they aren’t. That’s a separate thing, otherwise Nezuko wouldn’t have been immune because she isn’t a Sun Breather.
They arent
Hence why I said thinks he can win, after observing Tanjiro a little more he realizes that he isn’t Yorichii 2.0 and thus thinks that he can take him
I re-read your other comments, fair enough, when you talked about Koku want to be stronger than Yorii while Muzan found Yorii as weak, the meaning of strong for Koku and Muzan at that moment might be different cuz Muzan finds all human weak 🤷‍♀️
Muzan doesn't care about whether the morale of the corps is low or not, he wants them all dead regardless.
I didn't say he wasn't looking for the flower anymore, but Kokushibo has already been killing sun users for years.
So he thought Sasamaru and Yahaba were enough to kill Yorrichi is what you're implying?
Friendly reminder these are the only 2 people in history to create a breathing style from scratch
Yoriichi and Inosuke are the only ones who created their own breathing styles without basing themselves on an other existing one. Beast breathing is officially derives from wind breathing because it's the closest one to it's style, but inosuke didn't inspire from it when creating beast breathing. Kinda fun to think about.

I was recently thinking about how crazy it was Inosuke basically rediscovered total concentration breathing on his own.

Like, in an alternate universe where Yoriichi never existed, the progenitor of all breathing styles might very well have been Lord Inosuke!
Creating a breathing style from scratch is one of the reasons why Inosuke is simply the best kamaboko

UPVOTE THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW !!!! 

THIS IS PURE FACTS

ONLY DEMON SLAYERS IN THE WHOLE DEMON SLAYER UNIVERSE OTHER THAN YORIICHI TO CREATE A BREATHING STYLE! 

  
AHAHAHHAHAHAH NOW SHOW SOME RESPECT !!! THE KING OF MOUNTAINS IS THE MAIN MAN ! INOSUKE INOSUKE INOSUKE

LORD INOSUKE!!!!!

People tend to downgrade Inosuke's IQ a lot but he is actually one of the smartest characters in kny
![gif](giphy|So4Yp61bm4pO1wYo1W)
I could’ve sworn Tengen created sound breathing himself too
Forgot about Murata and Galaxy Breathing. 

But it's ok, Murata-sama casts such a big shadow that people don't realize that they have been standing in that shadow their entire lives.
Fr 🌸
I am an Inosuke stan first, and a person second 
That's why he's the goat the goat. He does all things based on instincts and that too way fast. He saw how tanjiro pushed the boulder and did it just by seeing once. If he knew how to do it he could've done it way before but he sensed how tanjiro did it and did it instinctively. He is king of mountains for a reason. Lord inosuke coming through ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)
And that’s why Inosuke is best boi. 🦋
In the argument where it wasn't inspired by another breath this is pure absolute facts
Michikatsu was trying to use Sun Breathing but couldn't do it exactly, so the derivative that was the result was Moon Breathing. So technically, he accidentally made his own style too.
https://preview.redd.it/iqlw0ao4gred1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80d4f12ceea609cf18381e1d89baebe127852dab

\*Three people
Inosuke is literally one of the best slayers in the whole saga. He might not be that strong but he sure is one of the greatest.
Chads :3
The way Inosuke even found out about the demon slayer corps was because a member was sent the the mountain the Inosuke lived on to hunt a demon, (which was probably Inosuke tbh), and Inosuke beat his ass. He watched the guy do what was likely wind breathing, because that's what beast is derived from, and made his own based on the techniques he saw.

And Yoriichi was BORN doing sun breathing, so does it really count as creating it?
This is why people should not sleep on Inosuke. Yes he is rude, yes he lacks academic knowledge, yes his personal hygiene is poor and yes he is excessively loud but he is a prodigy demon slayer.
what about insect breathing
I fell in love woth Inoske after his hand to hand fight with Tanjiro, deserves a rewatch, he was going the fuck in
Michikatsu would like to have a word with you for leaving him out of this list.
Thats why he is

https://preview.redd.it/nd0sql1ynved1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4d7178e36cbf626b8073b827c752d2aa03e5954
Didn’t kokushibo create moonbreathing
The only one in the kamaboko squad who was not trained by a current or former hashira and can more than keep up with the rest of them. True goat (boar?)
Isn't Beast Breathing derived from Wind Breathing, just like Mist Breathing? Sound Breathing is derived from Thunder Breathing, Love Breathing from Flame Breathing, and Serpent Breathing, Flower Breathing, and Insect Breathing are all derived from Water Breathing. By that logic Muichiro, Tengen, Mitsuri, Obanai, Shinobu, and Kanae all created their own Breathing forms.


Let's also not forget about Kokushibo and his Moon Breathing.
Inosuke stole his first sword from a demon slayer that he bested. It’s possible that person was a user of wind breathing or at least knew some basics of total concentration
Mitsuri????? She LITERALLY invented love breathing????

Muichiro invented mist????
I was under the impression beast breathing is somewhat based on wind breathing?
Closest one to them is like Michikatsu right
Doesn't inosukes breathing style branch off of wind? I remember seeing charts always saying beast branches off of wind
and only one of the two succesfully prevented another demon king from existing
Kokoshibo did as well.  He created Moon Breathing to be a direct competitor to Sun Breathing if I'm not mistaken.  Or something along those lines.  It is the only Breathing technique other than Beast that isn't a derivative of Sun Breathing.
Technically wouldn't Tanjiro count too? Or does he use Sun Breathing? What I mean by that, is that before he used Hinokami Kagura, the only reference that he based the Breathing on, is his father dancing the Hinokami Kagura, which wasn't a Breathing Style but a way of dance, to get the blood flowing. So in a way, he created the style out of a dance. I don't recall exactly how Sun Breathing was created, if it was explained, but that couldn't that have a reference? And Inosukes Breathing can be similar, the breath of Instinct, to live, to defeat, to hunt, his reference was life. I know I'm half talking out of my ass, forgive my doing so, but I don't exactly get what would set Hinokami Kagura aside from Beast Breathing and Sun Breathing.
It's stated in data in the end of the manga that beast breathing was an offshoot of wind breathing. Like... No, he wasn't specifically trained in wind breathing, don't get me wrong. But the point is, it had a basis whether Inoske knew it or not.
EVERYONE FORGOT ABOUT KOCHO- WAIT DONT LEAVE EVERYONE KOCHO CREATED ONE TOOOOOO😭

![gif](giphy|Yq1tXTNe5PDdQEhKXG|downsized)
Thought INoske breathing style is based on wind breathing
He can also move his own organs.

No wonder he forget names. Why would the clear protagonist remember the NPCs?
101% facts ❤️🐷🔥😤🙏

That's because Inoskue was trained by animals. It's like how Toph became the strongest non Avatar earth bender by being trained by badger moles.
…Let him cook.
>Like, in an alternate universe where Yoriichi never existed

I think in this alternate reality, Suzanne may have succeeded in wiping out at least Japan long before Inosuke ever came around 

Edit: *Muzan. It kept autocorrecting to Suzanne
Until it is confirmed otherwise, and given how f\*cking stupid he is on screen, despite the baseless credit his fans try to give to his intelligence, it is INFINITELY far more reasonable to assume he copied parts of the breathing style of the slayer he stole his first sword from than to give any credit to his lonely braincell.
COMING THROUGH
Pig Assault 🗣️🗣️
BEHOLD!!THE KING OF THE MOUNTAIN!!!!!
Are you sure you're not Inosuke himself...?
Inosuke ghost wrote this
Read this in Inosuke’s dub voice 😭
he feigned fatal injuries like twice already I think which resulted in victories instead of sure death
regular iq and battle iq are separate categories tbf
His intelligence > his wisdom
He is street(forest?) smart, not booksmart
my man has 6th sense, can literally move position of his organ, is highly competitive, learns fast, improves faster, great strategist. What more do you need?
He is kinda like Goku since he’s naive and slow on anything outside of fighting. When it comes to fighting though I think they have the highest IQ to survive, adapt and overcome any challenges even in comparison to characters from their own universes
Sound was inspired by Thunder Breathing but was adapted to fit Tengen's own unique skills, same with Love Breathing being made by Mitsuri who based it off of Flame Breathing
sound is a form derived of thunder
It is well known that Galaxy Breathing is a secret that Murata only unleashes offscreen, to weaken the demon enough so the cast can have a shot.

Fun fact, Galaxy Breathing transcends time and space, it was actually Murata cutting Muzan, not Yoriichi.

And the drug was just propaganda to confuse Muzan, it was actually Murata hitting him with the 10th form creating micro black holes that aged Muzan rapidly.

He is **HIM**
I think what they’re saying is that Inosuke never got inspired from another breathing style, just purely made up by him. While Michikatsu tried to use Sun breathing and created moon breathing based off sun breathing (I could be wrong though)
All the other breathing styles (besides Beast) are variations of the original Sun bc no one could do it properly, they are imitations adapted to what best fit the new users.           

 Moon is the closest but still lacking and an (inferior) imitation all the same
Idk but he looks goofy in this one for some reason.
It wasn't ever implied obanai created serpent breathing without inspiring from water breathing.
Beast breathing has absolutely no similarities to Wind breathing, I know the official guide says it's a derivative but I see no evidence to support it.
you mean there are other 'vanilla' slayers who can do breathing techniques? how come we didnt see anything. even murata didnt show anything
Derived from flower breathing, Kanae's breathing style which Shinobu took inspiration from
Derived from sun breathing
Yup it does, but it probably wasn't intentional. Inosuke discovered tcb and created beast breathing on his own in a random mountain, whereas other derivatives always directly base themselves on other breathing styles. More of a coincidence than anything.
Mitsuri based herself on fire breathing, Rengoku's style. Muichiro wasn't ever implied to have created mist.
Yup it does, but it probably wasn't intentional. Inosuke discovered tcb and created beast breathing on his own in a random mountain, whereas other derivatives always directly base themselves on other breathing styles. More of a coincidence than anything.
Yup he didn't know it, but it still means he created it without any inspiration. It came to him instinctively. And he's the second person in history to do that
Shinobu based herself on flower breathing to create insect breathing, her sister's breathing style.
It's a natural derivative of it but he didn't base it off it since he had never heard of wind breathing before he made his own
This comment made me realize that Toph and Inosuke would probably get on like a house on fire
Correct me if Im wrong, but aren't elemental bending in itself actually learned from ordinary animals manipulating the elements in their own way? 
Like for example, water bending is learned from fish swimming and so on. 

I hear that it was retconned that elemental bending is given by Turtle Lions instead.
That isn’t why Toph is incredibly strong. At the very least, it’s not a main reason why. 

There were hundreds or possibly thousands of benders that learned from animals. Most were forgotten to history and not notable beyond having been an elemental bender. 

Toph is genuinely talented and I’d sooner point to her upbringing, force of will and dedication that lead to her becoming so strong.
bro has actual beef with a fictional swordsman
Was this the only reason you even came on this post? ​To absolutely sh\*t on one of the most well developed characters in the series..? Rather childish if I do say so myself.
HAHA 😤😤😤😤😤
... it's written
I just realised so did I! 😆
Who's talking about battle IQ? We're talking about the guy who learned how to speak pretty much perfectly (and understand what he said) while being a baby just from hearing a random old man and his care taker talk
Yeah Mitsuri was literally trained by Rengoku lol
Beast breathing came from win breathing. Plus Tengen was a former shinobi so he wouldn’t go got any training as he already was trained. Practically the same as Inosuke. Tengen practically made Sound breathing all on his own.
and Inosuke's beast breathing is derived from Wind breathing.
tengen literally used the sound of thunder and went.

yea lets turn that into a a BREATHIGN STYLE why not
Fair enough.
All breathing are variations kf sun breathing.

The concept of breathing came from inosuke.

Inosuke learnt this from his breath training in the forest with a master
It has quite a few similarities. The effects they produce look very similar but that's that's weakest link. Both styles are focused on aggressive non-stop attack with minimal defensive techniques the real difference is that wind attacks from up high while beast has more rising strikes from down low
Bro is literally mentioning the source for my point and just going "nuh uh"

Both have similar effects, both are based on aggressiveness, and they're both from the two most badass people in the show.
According to Wiki Murata uses water brearhing, it would be safe to assume that all slayers(except Genya) can at least use TCB
Okay
True enough.
No.

https://preview.redd.it/jmn4ucjrgted1.jpeg?width=959&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=518a6c31a3cbc48a77f691adbe29834074e7cc3e

She invented love breathing during the lower moon 2 fight.

She learnt fire breathing but couldnt perform it all.
Ahh thank you 🫸🫷
No, it just derives from it, it doesnt have a single move even similar to flower breathing, shes also the only one to use it because she isnt strong enough for any other. Youre talking about it being based off it because it is derived from it, this is not true. Inosuke's is derived from wind despite the two almost barely meeting- and him also having it before ever meeting Shinazugawa.
Until it is confirmed that the slayer he stole his first sword from was a wind breather.

Then, from his record of being amazingly stupid, it will be far more reasonable to believe he derived beast breathing from what he observed, consciously or unconsciously.
They even have the same superpower of seeing things true the earth
Turtle Lions gave people the ability to bend, but they learned the various styles of bending by imitating animals.
I think water Bending was mostly developed from watching the moon and its effects on the tide.

Most water Bending stems from the push and pull motion the tide follows, and flows put from there I think.

It's definitely possible for there to be a few sea creatures also learned from, but I doubt it'd be basic fish given that Earth Benders have huge badger moles, Firebenders have dragons, and Air Nomads have the Bison, though for the Air Benders, I think they developed Air Bending mostly before fully integrating their society woth Air Bison, given that the Bison became their single most prominent attachment to the physical world, rendering many nomads without the ability of flight, which comes from having no attachments to the world.
I have beef with the concept of liking his character more than the fictional swordsman himself
Probably best not to engage with this knobbly fucking troll lmao
"Childish" ? Nah at least try to lie believably. Try again. Find a more fitting word. I'm giving you another chance.

Also, how beloved he is should not be relevant. How old are you to bring that into this? He is consistently stupid on screen, just like Tengen and Sanemi are detestable, no matter how many people like them. How is this relevant?!?

Inosuke has to have uncounsciously or consciously copied parts of wind breathing from the first slayer he met off-screen. It just makes too much more sense than being a complete moron 99% of the time and then the story magically making him a genius with that
isn’t that just how babies learn to talk normally though?
Beast breathing is different in a way as both Uzui and Mitsuri were formally trained as Demon Slayers before hand and had learned Thunder and Flame breathing respectively, modifying the styles into Sound and Love to fit their respective unique skills. Inosuke on the other hand had 0 training or knowledge of any breathing forms and developed it on his own after fighting a demon slayer and stealing his swords. Since Inosuke had no training the only connection that can be made to wind breathing is the possibility that the slayer he fought used it, outside of that he made it completely on his own
It wasn’t though, wind breathing is just the style that it’s closest too. Beast Breathing was completely created by Inosuke without any outside inspiration.
Yes but Inosuke did not know Wind breathing. That's what makes it special!
Don't be shocked by "sound breathing" when "love breathing" exists.
Good point. Forgot that the base breathing is TCB at minimum
https://preview.redd.it/eswiu3xlited1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6550b85ff04b1bfd6a4ca893a4d02f004e8030a8

She did create it on her own, but basing herself on flame breathing which she already knew.
He's only stupid outside of battle. In combat he's extremely skilled don't downplay him lol
Through* Also, it's not the same. Toph feels the vibrations in the earth to get around and sense things like badger moles in Avatar, while Inosuke uses his heightened sense of touch to feel changes in the air. That's why he made a form of beast breathing literally using his senses at their peak to find the spider mommy- I mean spider mother.
And? They're both characters, basically the same, we dont know how Yorrichi created the Sun breath, nor do we know how Inosuke create the Beast breath.
Yeah lmao. I just decided to stop talking.
Unconsciously\* ;)

And how the hell is Tengen detestable? I understand with Sanemi but would like a valid reason for Uzui.
Tengen is detestable?

Chat i may have found zenitsu's acc
skinniest halo fan
this response gives me navy seal copy pasta vibes lol, the word childish hit a nerve
Can they talk like an adult tho? Kids don't fully learn how to properly talk until like 10 years old and inosuke did it extremely quickly
Ok where did it say Tengen learned thunder breathing though?
I didn't say that Inosuke did not create his own breathing. 

I just stated that his breathing is also a derivative of wind which is a fact. Doesn't matter if he learned it from a wind breathing user or not.
All breathings are a derivative of another breathing and the root of everything is Sun breathing. 

That's literally how it works in the verse. Whether or not Inosuke made it himself, beast breathing is still a derivative of wind which is a derivative of sun.
Especially when a lot of the forms have to do with cats as well 💀
>They're both characters

No, you might have gotten a little confused when reading
My bad ;)

He shuts down Inosuke's delusions of being "the mountain king" litteral seconds after shoving his own delusions onto us viewers and the Kamaboko squad. I might have a lower-than-average tolerance for hypocrisy, but that's too far and I never forgot.
Have my upvote, then
kids can speak properly way before 10 years old, toddlers are able to hold full conversations with adults
That's a good point, I'm not sure it's directly mentioned but it is stated that he had official demon slayer training prior to making Sound Breathing as opposed to Inosuke who made up Beast Breathing after beating up a slayer and then later got invited to final selection
Beast Breathing was not derived from Wind Breathing, you cant derive from something you dont even know exists, Beast Breathing was created with no knowledge of Demon Slayers or other Breathing Styles

Beast Breathing is considered “derived” from Wind Breathing because thats the closest they could get, but really Beast Breathing is like Sun Breathing and was made from scratch
my bad know that I read it back i see it. However thats your opinion I will respect it even though I wont like it.
But why would you care if he shuts down Inosuke's claim of being the Mountain King, you obviously don't care whatsoever about Inosuke as a character so why would this be at all relevant?
Mf he spent most of his early life being talked to by a boar herd and he can speak Japanese 😂 just don't ask him to read or write
Because it's objectively hypocritical.

Also, I don't hate Inosuke that much, I just can't fathom giving credit to his brain given what we get on screen. Reminds me of Bakugo magically getting good grades in classes in MHA despite being a low-atttention-span screamer all the same like Inosuke and there being no chance even with a plot-armor boost of him having even 1% of that intelligence. Just messes with my suspension of disbelief because it can't be.
Hey so here is a fun concept most of classmates failed to learn "dont judge a book by its cover", most of my classmates thought I was near the bottom of my class in highschool until they actually asked me my class ranking I showed them that I was number 12 in the class despite being the stereotypical example of a burnout stoner, just because someone appears stupid doesnt mean that they are, hell that goes both ways as I regularly interact with people at my job who seem to be quite intelligent and then after interacting with them you realize their heads are fucking empty.
Congrats on being ranked high, but ranking students is counter-productive in education. It shouldn't exist because it only creates inferiority sentiment where there shouldn't be. The skillset required for good grades is just too narrow to judge a person just by their grades. And it will always be like this. There's so much more to intelligence than school.

Coincidentally, one of the skills required for good grades is the ability to listen and gain new knowledge from external sources, which these "screamer" characters just don't have.
I’ve been watching Demon Slayer with my mom, and she never gets the characters’ names right. These are their names according to my mom…
I saw someone do this on the MHA subreddit, so I had to get in on it with Demon Slayer. My mom and I have been watching one or two episodes a day together for the past month or so. She likes it, but she’s always so confused 😂

Dw my mom calls every character Goku.
Of fucking course Muzan is Michael Jackson
Tapioca 😭
Well, she almost got Tanjiro and Nezuko right. 🙌


Pretty unfortunate for Annoying kid and Worm Lady, though. 😭
my mom called Rengoku, Inu Yasha. 😂😂😂
Is your mother’s name ‘Hashibira Inosuke’, by any chance?

Also, some of these are quite accurate (Zenitsu’s especially)
Please tell your mother that “you are right”.
✨Feral pig boy✨
Normalise all parents naming anime characters
This is atrocious. She should at least remember Kamaboko Ganpachiro ....

Jokes aside. I hope she enjoys the Demon Slayer.
lost it at "tapioca" 😂🤣 hard to unhear Shinobu saying "tapioca-san" now
i fucking giggled when she called daddy muzan “Michael Jackson”
is your mother's last name, by any chance, Hashibira?
Feral pig boy 🤣

![gif](giphy|EiCNPURy9WiEAKHRiL)
Lol!!!! The mom had me at Michael Jackson x'D
Annoying kid...

Is your mother single?... Available?
Her description of Haganezuka is very straight to the point 😂
If this is real, at least i'm not the only one who call Gyiu Tapioca, the names sound so close
Tomioka to Tapoica is just too much lmao
She sounds like Inosuke lol
At least she got annoying kid and Micheal Jackson right
At least he got Michael Jackson right 😂😂😂
She isn't that wrong
At least she watches with you😂😂
The only one my mom gets right are Tanjiro, Nezuko, Rengoku and Muzan
I was already cracking up when it got to Inosuke, but I completely lost it at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm your mom. I can barely remember ANY Demon Slayer or My Hero Academia names and I'm super fans of both. I have an easier time with Spy Family because they're all western style names.
Lol that's actually what I called Tengen during his introduction.

"Wow, seems like Everything's Flashy Guy has a whole arc to himself."
Lol can’t say I disagree with her 😂 they’re perfect!
I have gojo ans other anime characters on my wall. And they're all Goku's to my parents.
UMAI!
My mom thinks every anime guy is “boy/girl/man” and anime girls are “hot ones”

LOL 😆 🤣 

She's not wrong though
The Michael Jackson one got me, i’ll never look at Muzan the same again
Annoying kid and worm lady got me😂
Accurate
Last one's accurate
Inoske would agree with your mom
Technically the truth lol
Inosuke should be her favourite character
I understand I know them but still end up botching it
Seems accurate to me lol
All are similar... Most of them
"Tasty Guy"😂.. Lol all of them are pretty much spot on...
poor Tomioka and Muzan xD lmao
I love how even PARENTS say that Kibutsuji Muzan is just Micheal Jackson X'D
As a mom who can't remember any of their names, I LOVE this. I call Zenitsu "French fry guy" or "French fry head." My 11 y/o just looks at me with disgust when I can't remember their names 🤣. Hey I'm trying 🤷
Lol
That's quite accurate!
I can hear the accent from the names.
She at least got one right.
I see nothing wrong here. Carry on mum.
My mom knows Mario does that count
Is your mom the real life reincarnation of Inosuke?
She gave them better names yo
I actually thought Michael Muzan Jackson Kibutsuji was the right name
I convinced my brother to watch it and he calls Tamayo everything but her actual name lol. He called Zenitsu, zenRItsu. Lol
If she says Zenitsu is annoying what will she think of Naruto?😂
Is your mom Inosuke by any chance?
Wdym? Those were all spot on!
I couldn’t even show my mom demon slayer.
Wdym, she got them all right. Inosuke could learn a thing or two from her 😛
I think Feral pig boy told your mom names of the characters 😂
Definitely nailed Zenitsu.
michael jackson 💀😭💀
Be gentile, age will come to you too some day and it will be harder to remember strange names... At the moment, enjoy you can watch anime with your mom and just have fun 😉
Michael Jackson😭😭😭😂😂😂
This is completely accurate
My father calls every character ”Wake sqwueck dragon” (Blue eyes white dragon)💀
Your mum is inosuke
Tasty guy is best guy. Fight me.  
Lol'd at Michael Jackson
wdym? that is Micheal Jackson...
besides Tanjiro and Nezuko she does have a point with these 😂
She’s not that far off 🦋
Is your mom inosuke?
My mom calls everything Kakashi
my dad can’t get names right or remember them either…😔 (all he knows is Genya and Nezuko, and Tanjiro(?))
Micheal jackson is universal
Your mom is based for that third nickname
She got them all right though
lol hahaha tapioca and feral pig boy are my favorites
I mean she ain't wrong though and also is your mother is Inosuke? if so, then you got the best mother in the world
Pretty cool mom you got there willing to watch stuff like this with you. I'm 36 and I still get "when are you going to grow up and quit watching cartoons and playing video games?"

And no I don't live in my parents basement lol, I'm married and we own our house.
She got the last one correct
Imagine her meeting face to face with Inosuke. 😅
The fact that she got the last one right is impressive
No, she's spot on with most of them.
Is she the feral pig boy?
So friggin good.
Fr, everytime I see Rengoku all I hear is: UMAI!
TAPIOCA😭😭😭
I CHOKED ON THE TAPIOCA
Not me, being the one that has to correct my kids constantly on how to pronounce everyone's names.. Am I the odd parent out here??  😮
Tapioca straight up made me lol
LMAO NOT TAPIOCA 🤣

I will say though, Muzan really does dress like Michael Jackson 💀
Based
Number 6 was correct wdym
LMAO NOT TAPIOCA 😭🤣

Daddy Muzan really does dress like Michael Jackson though 💀
Your mom’s inosuke.
LMAO FERAL PIG BOY
I also call Zenitsu "annoying kid" even tho I know his name lmao
OP’s mom ain’t wrong on most of these!🤣🤣🤣
Close enough lol
"Flashy" is repeated more than "Tengen" so it's fair that's what stuck with her
TAPIOCA
I love her names for everyone! 🤣
i mean they’re technically not wrong lol 😂
Good to see everyone agrees Muzan is secretly Michael Jackson
“Tanjino”? Does your mother think Tanjiro is Hispanic or something?
FERAL PIG BOY
Your mom and Inosuke would get along really well
Special :3
Worm Lady is easily my favorite, not what I would expect.
To be fair everyone calls him Michael Jackson... I do too... When we talk about Demon's slayer, me and my husband, he always is "Michael Jackson". She's based to me... Than again I'm a mother too, but I've been watching animes since 1989 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
eh, close enough
Your mom has the Inosuke spirit! I mean that in a good way, of course.
She's not wrong...makes sense ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6756)
Her description of Rengoku to Muzan is pretty accurate tho
Lol your mom is basically a superfan I don't see anything wrong here😂😂
My mom calls Giyu Tapioca too! Rengoku is ‘fire guy’ ‘loud guy’ or ‘loud fire guy’ Nezuko is ‘the creepy one.’ 

When she fist started calling Rengoku ‘the loud guy’ I was like: “Do you know
how little that narrows it down?” 

And when she says ‘loud fire guy’ I still think she’s referring to Natsu from Fairy Tail eight times out of ten. I think that was actually his nickname first.
Atleast Michael Jackson is correct.
your mom actually got it right
Bahaha ! thanks for sharing.
Michael Jackson 😂😂😂
Annoying kid is RIGHT! Go to sleep Zenitsu 😂
Ong to my mom calls Rengoku,  Ranguku or Goku. She calls inosuke hog man, Tanjiro is tangerine, Zenitsu is cry baby, Muzan is Michael Jackson, Giyu is depressed guy, Akaza is blue berry toes, Tengen is the three wives guy, Daki is Taki, Nezuko is Tangerine's sister or demon girl. 

It honestly makes me laugh 🤣
I saw “Tapioca” and I paused because in 2019 I drew this silly doodle of him specifically eating a tapioca pudding cup. It was an inside joke, but it’s so relevant here 😂

https://preview.redd.it/elt6zinn7kfd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=761677379c3407d5833c118428fd31979f3813d6
I cannot unread "Tanjino" lol.  Sounds like an Italian mafia name.
Is your mother inosuke?
Micheal Jackson! Lmao!
The Michael Jackson is so real
Tapioca and tanjino got me dead 😂😂😂
It’s normal. Even Inosuke be like: Kapanchiro, munjiro,…
Not surprised about Muzan Jackson. 

Also some of the other names were funny too
Your mother might be inosuke
You've got 6 right (according to my mom) lol
She did my boy Zenitsu dirty
Honestly, annoying kid should be his name lmao
these are cracking me up
don’t worry mom, i too call tomioka tapioca 💀
My mom calls anime by her favorite arcs. So Demon slayer is Train show and Bleach is Zanpacto. Idk what happened with AOT coz its n*ked babies
inosuke just found his match![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)
In my bedroom hanging Inosuke poster and my grandma just call him "ugly pig"![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6758)
Are you a Spanish speaker by chance? We sometimes call giyuu "tomioka tapioca" in the Spanish speaking community lol
I would love to see you an your mom watch an episode and give your thoughts about it.
Tapioca is fucking hilarious
Nah, My mum thought giyuu was "water sword guy", like what the hell?
Annoying Kid is The correct name

Seriously
My mom calls every video game system “The Nintendo”
My mom is loving the comments guys! Thank you all ❤️😊
Annoying Kid 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
TAPIOCA

(I'm dying)
That's not tasty guy. He is 🍩 donut
The tasty guy💀 donut
Nahhhh but the Micheal Jackson is FR 😭👍
NOT TASTY GUY 🤣
Is your name inosuke?
ANNOYING KID?! NAH, THATS FOUL
my mom would never sit down to watch this with me so W mom
No no, these are accurate
I CALL HIM MICHAEL JACKSON TOO hahahahahahahaha omg
My God it's inosuke if he was a female
Would smash worm girl
tapioca 😭😭
Your mom is awesome.
Feral Pig Boy is amazing lmao. Also a great metal band name.
Tapioca Guyi
I don’t get it. She got anything wrong?😭
my mom, waking in after missing the scene where tanjiro found his torn up family: he cries too much
At least she got Zenitsu’s name right
She is not wrong with any of them
At least she got Michael Jackson’s name right
So your mum is just Inosuke in disguise? 🤭
Getting Micheal Jackson should net her a positive score though
Tasty guy is awesome.
Mine doesn't even remember the name of the show, everything is Steven Universe to her???
I do the same but Michael Jackson was the best. I can’t unsee it lol
I know someone who called her Octopus lady 😂
Tapioca got me howling
Accurate . Tapioca killed me 😭
Pretty accurate
I’m watching all demon slayer episodes for a second time and just finally getting the names down bc I was more interested in the story than the names. Now, I’m getting my act together and paying more attention to the names. Certain details that were once irrelevant to me are now making more sense.
Netscape!
Theyre pretty accurate tho. Go mom
She's following along just fine😂
I mean she only got the first two wrong.
Really... REALLY?! Everybody knows number one is Gonpachiro Kamaboko!!!
Wait those aren't their names?
My friends and I call Kibutsuji Muzan Jackson
She got the last one right
I also called Giyu “Tapioca” for a while before bothering to learn his name. It is the closest I could get to Tomioka at the time. I love it
Oh I should do this with my mom
Lmfao
Hold up did she really just call Daki, Worm Lady?
Accurate I’d say lol
At least she got Michael Jackson right lol
Damn this Michael Jackson finished me off (old meme?)
Topioka😭
I've read the manga multiple times now and your mom isn't that far behind me to be perfectly honest.
Cap.
Bro my mom calls everything's Goku, Naruto, and Pikachu 😭
I was watching demon Slayer and my dad walked in, he asked why "annoying whiny ginger bitch" (Zenitsu) was so annoying. And when Akaza was fighting Rengoku, he asked "why is the flashy flamy guy so fucking obsessed with food? It's not like it's his last meal or anything.."
I mean the last one is correct
You're trying to tell me that isn't michael Jackson?
inosuoke will be proud at your mom
I really laughted here
But the last one is obviously clayface
Mommynosuke?
I love this so much bc my bf does the same shit
Tapioca
I don’t know what you mean? The only one she got wrong was gonpachiro.
The Micheal Jackson at the end killed me🤣🤣🤣
The Michael Jackson one made me go HEHE out loud.
Valid
tbf! the Zenitsu, Inosuke, Sword guy (I forget his name), Muzan, Rengoku and Tengen correlations are spot on 🤣
She’s channeling inosuke 😂😂😂
Feral pig boy got me rolling off my bed (I probably have a bruise now)



My mom would just mix up names. I remember when she called Nezuko Inosuke on many different occasion.
"Annoying Kid" LMAO, your mom is correct.
10/10 for Zenitsu lol
I mean she's not wrong with muzan being micheal Jackson
Lmfaoooo 😭😭😭
So your mom and Inoske are aot alike...
Wonder what she’ll name the annoying kid later lol
zenitsu being “Annoying Kid” made me rofl
Annoying kid, feral pig boy, and Michael Jackson are spot on, though.
Muzak is accirate
The last one is honestly correct we treat the villain like hes Michael fuckin Jackson if he was a demon in japan and I'm pretty sure the people who made the series knew this.
Michael Jackson though🤣😂😂😂
I’m just jealous that your mom watches it with you. I couldn’t even get my parents to watch into the spiderverse because it’s animated. Animated movies are for kids only apparently. I said it’s one of the best movies ever made and the second one is even better and still a no from my dad. My mom watched but fell asleep.

I said Demon Slayer is anime that is targeted at adults. My mom says she can’t watch it because of the way their mouths move. My fiancé thinks the same way. She loves animated Disney movies and movies like Into/Across the Spiderverse, but doesn’t like to watch anime because of the way their mouths move. 

I’ve still at least gotten my fiancé to watch anime with me. She likes my hero but that’s it. I try to get her to watch Demon Slayer but she doesn’t like when they fight, which is the best part of demon slayer IMO! Lol
My mum knows Tanjiro and only Tanjiro because I asked for a Tanjiro plushie once and now she gets me every piece of Tanjiro merch that we see when we’re out. My bed is just covered in Tanjiro now 😭 and she always says that Tanjiro will protect me whilst I sleep, fending off everything from Michael Jackson to the smallest bed bug (yes she said that).

If you see this mum, I love you but Jesus Christ.

I see nothing wrong with this.
The last one doesn’t surprise me 😂
Well, her nicknames are lowkey canon.
I’m right there with your mom. LOVE the show. Can’t remember their names.
I loved Feral pig boy and Tapioca
She's not wrong about Inosuke
Ok. But the last 1 is perfect.
TAPIOCA??? IS THAT A BRASIL REFERENCE????🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well she got one correct in the end
well she got Michael Jackson right, whatchu complaining about?
at least Michael Jackson is right
The last one really got me😂
She literally got them all right wtf
I don't see anything wrong with these names😌
Some of the names are hard

Ubuyashiki took me 4 seasons to learn. and don't ask me his name
Weird flex but my mom saw Aot with me.
My mom knows how to pernounce there name, but she will call Skinobu a different name just because it irks me. The way she calls her sounds like misubi or something Like that
At least your mom got michael jackson
Does your mum own a hog head mask
That last one’s understandable.
At least she’s closer to Tanjiro’s name than Inosuke 
Congratulations for making useful names for the characters
She got the last one right at least.
Sometimes I say Rengoku like ‘he’s literally the sun 🥰’. But fr, your mom is spot on
I mean she’s not wrong hahahah 😂
lol
https://preview.redd.it/zsd8uzkpxjfd1.png?width=351&format=png&auto=webp&s=69124701af7a116003be461cacbdf9b333313388

hihi
Tapioca had me rolling ngl. Also my mum is the same, Tanjiro is Demo Slai (she doesn't know English, so she doesn't get even the title of the show), the Sister, Shit Boar (Inosuke and Zenitsu made her take pills for headache at least twice), and then the Hashira are just Fire Pillar, Sound Pillar, Love Pillar etc.
You can never go wrong with Michael Jackson
I see. K thing wrong here
I mean, she’s not *that* wrong. I know their names and basically call them the same thing. (Except for Giyu. “Tapioca” kills me!)
Michael Jackson was crazy! Lmao
She's damm right with Michael Jackson 👍🏻😂
at least she got the last one right
The last one is according to the whole fandom
I’m glad we all agree on Michael Jackson being right
TAPIOCA WHY 😭
My friend watched it and said they found that characters thinking out loud/narrating their move so often is very annoying
I mean that is Michael Jackson tho
Tasty guy goes crazy dude🤣🤣🤣🤣
Inosuke's gone and reincarnated again :o
Some of these names are valid lol
Your family doesn’t know anime
My dad and I call Muzan Micheal Jackson too.
Your mother has the inosuke curse with names
Your mother is like inosuke
No no, your mom is right. 😂
"Worm lady" I cant😭
CRAZY WORM LADY IS CRAZYY
How cool mom
Annoying kid, tapioca and MJ checks out
thank you for the loud ass laugh 🤣🤣🤣
Cansino Nozupo Zenizo
Tasty or feral pig boy 😂😂😂😂😂
WORM LADY? 😭😭😭
Once my mum asked me if i can tell her the story and she couldn’t memorize anything so we went with nicknames 

Inosuke: masked boy

Zenitsu: blondie

Rengoku: flame-y

Tanjiro: main character/ brother 

Nezuko: your  favorite 

Mitsuri: marshmallow 

Obanai: snake boy

Enmu: victorian child

( all the upper moons go by ranking)

Tengen: three wife style

Giyu: depresso espresso 

I cant remember the rest
Inosuke looks like a female and he's raising u lol
Michael Jackson got me 😆😆 .
Correct
at least she got Muzan right
Rengoku is indeed a "tasty" guy
So accurate lol your mom knows best
You mom did great! My mom calls Pokémon Pokeman 😭
Why tf tapioca 😭
Nezuku sounds so good
My dad's favourite anime is demon Slayer but every time I say a characters name he doesn't know who I'm talking about so I have to describe them like if I say inosuke he'll be like "Who?" And I'll just say "The pig guy" he just goes "OOOOOH THAT GUY" 🤣

(also Michael Jackson one is valid)
Okay, at least she knows Michael Jackson.
She got the last one right
Lmao
MICHAEL JACKSON HELPPP
😂😂
As a Demon Slayer fan, I understand why she would mistake their names like that, I can't even say 'Tanjiro' properly ❤️😂
annoying kid is so real tho
Micheal jackson 😭
he is really like michael jackson
😂 lol
Michael Jackson’s accurate tho 😂
Your mom has a one of a kind beef with Giyuu 😭💀
I have engraved gojo saturo's name in my mother's memory lol she doesn't know who he is and how he looks but she knows there is a gojo saturo that my daughter likes ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
lol Tapioca!
Feral pig boy goes hard
And that's why every KNY lovers are commenting Micheal Jackson "why you killed Tanjirou and his family?"😂😂
My mom calls every character "Fushiguro", though Jujutsu Kaisen isn't the first anime I've watched.
Ah yes,the Daidus sickness
The last one killed ne
She got mj's name right though
Your mom gets it
She got the last one right
Is your mom Inosuke?
There's always a micheal Jackson
Annoying kid. It's an accurate observation
At least she got the last one right
She got them right tho?
Correct
Is your mother Inosuke?
Wym, she got Michael Jackson right
She got Michael Jackson on point
As a mom who watches it,  and can't get names right. I also call him Tapioca!
lmao but they wrong names are so right
Poor zenitsu, he's hella powerful when he's not scared.
At least she got the last one right
Is your mom Inosuke?
(Also she did get the 3rd character correct)
Well at least she got Michael Jackson right
Accurate names imo

Especually Muzan "Swag" Jackson
That's not your mom, that's inosuke
Tasty guy😭
Michel Jackson is pretty much right
micheal jackson is too accurate
Les noms svp il son trop drôle 🤣😂🤣 nezuku 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She got one right tho
I approve of Tapioca.
She had one name right"Muzan jackson"
MiChEaL JaCkSoN Is AlIvE
So she’s a simpleton
I'm impressed your mom knows a single anime character, much less Goku. Mine would know Pikachu at best
same 🙏😭
I have a gojo poster on my wall and my parents tell me you got another Goku poster?
Is this the anime version of how dads call every game system a Nintendo or a PlayBox?
shout out to the moms who used to call pokemon ‘pokemans’
Both of my parents are calling any anime character Goku, it’s funny as hell
Based mom
This is my dad but Naruto lol
Das my mom too lmao I can only imagine how annoying my brother and I were when we were kids so she remembers
My mom calls them Yu Gi Oh people. My dad cartoons.
“We have Goku at home”

Pulls out Bible Black DVDs from the 90s….
Every anime I watch is Naruto
Hahaha! This reminds me of a game I play with my brother-in-law where I ask if every character we come across at our local fan expo is Goku
Goku is crazy
Do we have the same mom? Everyone above the age of 55 in my family calls every character I watch "Goku".  Then there's pikachu. They know pikachu.
I have a feeling she does it on purpose
Muzan Jackson is quite the *Smooth* Criminal
Why did you just write Michael Jackson twice in your sentence
He really do be looking like MJ.
![gif](giphy|oz8jiKqcBTKnu)
This is definitely what Inosuke calls him.
This one got me too 😂
💀
Ah yes, my fav character, Tapioca XD
My mom calls him that too!
I died at "Tasty" Guy, haha.
Almost is right. And tbf, Zenitsu is supremely annoying. Also she borrowed “worm lady” from Inosuke lol
I meeaaaannnn. 🤣 I can kinda see it.
Indeed. Lol I have joked with her that she’s like Inosuke in the sense she struggles with the names
WAIT SINCE WHEN DID HE HAVE A LAST NAME? How am I not remembering this?
We don’t accept zenitsu slander around these parts
It starts with calling everything a Nintendo or Forknife.


Then it evolves into “Is that skipity do da sigma toilet?”


Edit. While my ringtone still Skibidi from Little Big.
>daddy muzan

Oh no the voices are back.

DADDY MUZAN 🥵
I wish there were a Demon Slayer Quad City DJs mashup but I can't find any.
She is 😂
💀
I was going to say, at least she got one completely correct! =P
Daki aint that hard.
lol same.
UMAI!
Same here! The first time I heard this was back when I was listening to an anime podcast that was discussing the movie train arc!
“French fry head” is accurate. Now I’m hungry for some French fries tho 🍟
lol Lady Tamayo’s name was easy for me, because it makes me think of a tomato sammich w/mayo 😂
I took a risk getting her into it tbh. I started her introduction to anime with Pluto, because I knew its themes would resonate with her. Then I got her hooked on Kaiju No. 8, and then came her introduction to Demon Slayer. I’m thinking MHA is next 😁
I am! It’s actually a lot of fun. She pauses the show every five minutes to ask me questions, which can be a bit taxing at times, but at the end of the day, I’m spending quality time with her and sharing something with her we both enjoy. Sometimes she’ll be so let down by a cliffhanger that she simply must watch the next episode 😁
❤️
We’re monoglots, but that’s funny! Good to know 😁
That could be fun. It could be a series called, “Watching Anime with My Boomer Mom” 😂
I do believe my mom would be a riot.
Muzan jackson is the absolute best name
WeLl MoRe LiKe ReBoRn InTo MuZaN
Ur parents know Pikachu?
My parents dk wat anime is let alone Goku or Pikachu 💀
She knows it because we grew up watching DBZ on cassette 💀 But it's the only character she remembers from that time LMFAO
Never got the chance to ask my dad if he was saying "pokemens" ironically or was just trying to take an interest in his 7yo son. RIP
I was 15 in '99 when I first saw Dragonball Z at my cousin's house in Austin, Texas. Anime wasn't broadcast in my city but my cousin had it on Austin's local channels (I don't know how). I was mesmerized. My mom knew it. We learned the name Goku at that time.
My mom made me watch dragon ball back when I was 5 years old
Ultra Dripstinct
My mom does nintendo even for my PC xD
I had completely repressed that 😂  
Everything you could play a game on was a nintendo or just "vidya game". Never heard playbox tho
Nah mine just calls them gameboy
Oh my lord 😂❤️
Holy fucking shit I have never seen anything more relatable 
How did you get the Kaburamaru thing, I want one 😂
Mine usually calls everyone Yukio (Yu-Gi-Oh!) or Narudo (Naruto but replace the T with D)
My 9 year old is obsessed with saying this
Plot twist: Kibutsuji’s real blood demon art is dance fighting like MJ in the 1990 Sega Genesis game, *Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker*
That’s my head cannon now
Tapioca… which is better? Tapioca gummy, or Tapioca ginger?

(Also my fav character)
Based  opinion  to be honest
I can't unsee it now 🤣🤣
https://preview.redd.it/hwkeqlmzjgfd1.jpeg?width=2008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c3747cc0dc92d11efcf8190e5ab9f76f0dfb06c

After he finishes beating up Zenitsu for blocking Nezuko’s box
True, but easy to forget since her character is only in one season. Hell, I don’t remember most of the 12 Kizuki names, and a couple of the hashiras’ names are even a bit fuzzy lol.
https://i.redd.it/2k7hu9z75ifd1.gif
Before 1/11 this year, she had something against what the show name was for religion reasons. I kept telling her that this was not the case that these were different. Then I have to call her out for the stuff she watches.
I figured. If you ever do, please post a link here so that I may watch it.
My mom knows Naruto, Goku and Vegeta since she grew up with them for some time as a child in the 80s and then we watched DB as children as well while eating with her.
Dragon ball and Pokémon were fairly common kids shows back in the day, can guarantee most millennials' parents would know at least one
Dude, my dad asked why we were watching "cartoon" at 11 PM.
P.S. It was Death Note
HEE HEE
Why is your 9 year old watching a show designed for young adults?
*Hee hee* *shamoneh*
That's honestly amazing, I love it. 🤣🤣
I must have forgotten after so long.
I doubt it will come to fruition, but if I do, I will. 😊
Naruto was in late 90s early 2000s
Your mom watched naruto as a child?! How old is your mom?! and how old are you... 😂
I’m surprised he knew his own name 😭
he forgives you
Happy cake day
I meant DB, her brother grew up with Naruto later on.
Definitely not late 90s, the manga wasn't published till 1999, the show started some time in 2002
She didn't but her brother did later on, while my grandparents just watched sumo lmao. She did watch some Dragonball as a teenager tho. She's 47 and I'm 19.
Like u said it was published in 1999, which is the late 90s by definition
Ngl thats pretty awesome, none of my friends or even my brothers would watch anime if i even paid them to
Wow, that really went over your head...  
  
He was talking about watching anime and I'm trying to tell you that her watching it in the 90s is literally impossible since the MANGA didn't even exist until 1999, and unless you think his mom was a huge weeaboo who not only imported brand new unknown japanese mangas, IN JAPANESE BTW, i think we can with great certainty say she didn't read it, and definitely not watching it in the 90s since it didn't even exist yet.
Me and my sister grew up together in the early 2000s watching Great Mazinger (which even my mom watched as a child) in Italian tv. It's truly the best meca anime out there.

Nowdays I've got closer to my sister again in life, so we watched together Attack on Titan, Baki, Overlord, HxH and many more anime, she's only 25 so it's good to have someone to watch things with.

That one panel at the very end when Inosuke showed that he really cares for Tanjirou. Honestly for the whole series I never felt much sympathy for him, but in this moment right here my opinion of him changed a lot.

Ps. Also for some reason text jumps at the end of the screenshot and I don't know how to change that. Sorry
This one right here gives me chills every time

I chose this because someone else beat me to my favorite which was Gyomei hitting Kokushibo first in their fight.

A perfect example of show, don't tell. Kokushibo may have held deep resentment towards his brother, but over the thousands of years he lived, he still held onto some love for him. This panel always gets me man.

This confession scene (as well as Mitsuri and Iguro’s backstories and the way Tanjiro and Iguro fought in the final arc) cemented Iguro as my favorite Hashira.

The intensity of this fight, the resolution of Muichiro, the expression of Genya, I'll never forget this part of the final arc
I had others in mind but I’m going to go with this one

I really wished Kanao had played a bigger role overall. Her fight, alongside Inozuke, against Doma is the one I'm most excited about. Can't wait to see her use flower breathing's final form - equinoctial vermilion eye.

I just always felt bad for Kiriya..he was 8..just lost his parents and two siblings..and then he was thrown into the leadership role of the most important fight ever. :( So seeing him cry..just made me feel relief but also sad

This is by far my favorite moment in the manga. The moment Muzan dies twice is the moment you know that it’s truly over and it is so satisfying.

This one. All of her close relatives and disciples died because of demons. And she must work with a demon to kill a demon. Her life is sad. But it is a good end that the upper moon 2 died because of her joint efforts with Kanao and Inosuke.
I don't want to bother finding it but the one where some random demon slayer tells yushiro that it's okay if yushiro eats him if it would help defeat nakime.

*(I am fucked)*
My favorite panel is the final panel showing the upper rank siblings as they die together with him telling her sister to go to heaven but instead she yells and cries that she’d rather be with her brother
And so he takes her on his back and that panel shows them walking together to the pits of hell.
That chapter showing their backstory makes me tear up EVERYTIME I read it since I also have have 3 younger siblings and I just understand their love for each other. 
I love that he wanted her to go to heaven since even with all their murders, technically he was the one that allowed his sister to kill so much, so she had a chance at salvation 
But I also love how they chose to be together even if it mean suffering forever
I really need to find that label
I love how they make the spirit world and the living world so close where dead family members is actually talking to them and is just not the regular hallucination

It's not super flashy or mechanically interesting, but the small details of this smile mean so much and have always stuck with me. It holds so much pain, so much happiness, so much raw emotion in one simple smile and two words.

I couldn’t choose one but all those three or two ( If you consider farewell a panel) 😞
Shinobu ate
I think it's all about Shinobu wearing her haori but not her butterfly haori because Kanae is survive wearing her bitterfly haori such as Flower Hashira herselves then she showed me that her sister had died then Shinobu had to wear it on her revenge for her sister & then also Giyuu & Shinobu in the snow which i remember where my sister showed me from the Story of Water & Fires about Giyuu & Rengoku & then the cutie emoji of Tanjiro's kinda are my favorite panesl too.

My favorite manga panel of all time
I dislike that this canonically isn't his grandpa. Demon Slayer seems like the king of unnecessary details that detract from its story. Making them unrelated just makes no sense. It's the same deal as the breathing style abilities being "metaphors." Dog, it's a fantasy series. Just make it magic. I frankly find it harder to believe that humans manage to kill demons without magic than humans having magic. The shit they pull through sheer "swordsmanship" makes no sense.

Let me just put this here
… what the heck that’s deep
This made me laugh lol
no plis now i Remember that he Is died too
This one always makes me tear up because everyone was doing everything they could to beat Muzan even if it meant being a meat shield to buy the ones who could actually hurt him even a little bit more time. I love it.
I’m not ready for this to be animated I fear.
Damn it someone's cutting onions in here
Obanai carried
This one was so heart wrenching. They all knew how they could help, and so they did.
The regular demon slayers taking the blows intended for the Hashira is simultaneously gut wrenching and epic. They laid down their lives for their superiors and were not afraid to take on Muzan to save them is one of the corps finest hours.
I forgot, what happened here
Is these parts animated yet? The last I watched was with the Fire headed demon slayer >!when he died!< maybe like Mugan Train Arc or something? 

Not a huge manga person. Animation was amazing. Was wondering about how long until the anime catches up / ends or this a long-standing one like Naruto or something?

Edit: never mind. I see a few comments below stating it.
I need an actual poster of that panel
Ima crying form this it’s so sad
Also so sad she can't hug him and he can't see her anymore here (spoilers?? This whole thread is all spoilers though)
The fact that they are still kids always gets me… oh the tears
Must bring tissues & eye drops when watching infinity castle on cinema 🥲
I loved the fact that, that’s what actually ended up happening
That hits hard every time i read it, i can't imagine how much i'm going to cry when it gets animated
this page hurt me so much, it will live with me forever ❤️‍🩹
Headcanon, that's the moment they both died, he died holding her and she died looking at him
Depression is back🩷💚
I can hear her say it
Hey Shinobu -chan hey Shinobu -chan hey!

Coldest panel 🔥🔥
“You’ve done enough.” 

That one absolutely destroyed me. I’ve never cried at a manga until Akaza’s backstory, because that hit so close to home.

It’s probably not that deep to most people, just a touching emotional moment. But I can actually relate to Akaza a bit. I often wish to be a better person, and constantly try to make it up to everyone for all my bad behaviour while dealing with severe mental illness. It absolutely broke my heart to read that. To see someone willing to destroy themselves as many times as necessary because they know they’ll never be able to apologize for what you’ve done.
Jesus Christ this

I was crying so much reading his back story and climax of it
Hakuji-san ... the purest lover !!
And muzan screaming at Akaza to stop remembering and keep fighting, that whole sequence and his back story made me crying on floor like never before
This is a manga discussion anyways
I NEED this exact line in the anime
Zenitsu needs to call Kaigaku a Lower Moon explicitly lmao
kinda crazy to think that when we're introduced to Yoriichi through visions and stuff we think he's this stoic, stone-coldn emotionless badass killer but then it turns out he was just depressed as hell from how his life turned out, as a kid he was always smiling 😭
W
This one always breaks me
He just wanted to live in a hut with his wife but ofc Muzan gotta fuck that angle up for him too 😭
Was this panel animated or we Will see it later cause it's been too long since i read the manga
His entire life was tragic, its easy to see wat he is thinking, he could have held his own child like this, could have had a happy family and lived peacefully but all that was taken from him.
This one, this one panel, just shatters me every single time i see it
Came here to say this
Also, the fact that she was one of four people who chose to >!go to hell to be with their loved one!< was really sweet.
Their fucking faces tho lol

Omg when Nezuko's smiley face reminded him of his brother Genya. My heart crumpled
THIS IS WHY SANEMI IS BEST HASHIRA THE ANIME-ONLYS WILL UNDERSTAND SOON ENOUGH 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
omfg, I forgot everything in the manga but this 😭 😭 😭 it's so sad
That boy tanjiro face just screaming “IMA MURDER THIS MF”
That's going to fucking destroy me when it gets animated.
This and the look he gives Nezuko when she reminds him of Genya at the very end of the story 😭
Jesus I was crying when I read this the first time too
You gave me shivers. It's just one panel but I already feel devastated
That there broke my heart. They both got to say to and hear from the other how much they both loved each other, but seeing a hardass like Sanemi drop his guard completely like that and cry and beg for God to save his little brother, it was heartwrenching.
This is my favorite as well. I sobbed like a baby reading this, and I'm a big dude. I can't wait for everyone's reactions to this, but I'm terrified at the same time.
Me too
The wombo combo with Muichiro right before I can't not get teary eyed on rereads.
Oh boy, same T-T
Read this last week, gonna fucking lose it when this gets animated (as Burningshadow said, lol)🥲

This is the one🥲
I'm not ready for this to be animated
The fact he wears jigoro's haori ;A;
W-wait a minute
Kenjaku:

Mouth Breathing: First form-brain saliva
People are going to be so shocked when this gets animated 🤣
Is this real?
Really wish we got to see more of her 😭, she could've easily been in the red list district arc bc tengen was looking for women to go undercover in the first place
Absolutely one of the coldest panels I laughed so hard I love her 😂😭😭
I was like man Ueshama gonna be voicing her. So yeah, a sadistic voice is something I am looking forward to.

PS. Whatever happens before this fight absolutely has destroyed me from my inner core.
downloaded :)
The impact from Gyomei is unmatched, he was the key in defeated Kokushibo:

1. Broke his sword and cut his hair so that Genya can devour it and get a broken bda.

2. Protect Sanemi like 90% of the time so that the latter doesn't lose his hands.

3. Constantly irritating Kokushibo, both mentally and physically(good luck adapting to that kind of weapon).

I know that all four of them played their part and if you take any of them out - they would lose, but HIMejima was the core part of their teamwork that held it all together.
I can't unsee the nose as a mouth.
This is probably the only time he spelled his name right
Love his relationship with Tandingo
This is one of my fav too
Also love how it shows the reader how on the mark Gyomei was with Koku just gunning for the kill right after.

You’ll never be him Kokushibo
this panel gives off todo vibes. especially his entrance into shibuya
Had Kokushibo tweaking in one sentence 
He was about to turn his life around! But then ugh...
Muzan's grip seems rough and demanding, trying to push him down, but the hashiras' seem reassuring and warm, trying to get him up. I forgot just how much i loved this story
The dead ones pushing Tanjiro up as the alive ones pull him up..both are trying her hardest to help him out..I love it
I cried so hard during this panel
Loved the one a bit before it with the Pillars pushing on Tanjiro’s back.
I love this one so much
PEAK
This is going to go so unbelievably hard when it's animated I'm going to cry bro
Objectively the correct answer
I refuse to die before I see this animated
I almost forgot this one. Definitely my top 3

Kaigaku received a huge power boost as an upper rank and still got blitzed by his very much mortal human junior without manifesting the mark. Zenitsu need no red blade or ST or TW.
i remember this as clear as day somehow
I'm gonna cry so damn much when this is animated 🍡

Can’t forget Akaza’s reaction lmao
Yeah, totally agree with you and also do you remember when specifically in the hashira training arc, mostly in the opening when Kanao was shown to be training and etc. Bro, not only did Kanao not only get just one scene with Shinobu in that arc but she didn't even get a single anime-original content during the time Hashira Training arc was airing. 
Ufotable did Kanao so dirty and just clowned on us for that. 
The fact that Kanao was just shafted until the final arc, just gets to fight against Douma (Her parallels with him were cool but felt a bit shallow for me) and save Tanjiro and that's all it for her.  I'm so convinced that I feel Kanao was never part of the story and she was a wasted character. 

What I mean was that I wished Kanao had a bit of more satisfying character arc about her healing from her trauma and start on how to feel emotions so that way she could have started to understand herself properly.  

But instead we got the opposite her entire development is dependent on Tanjiro and was based on one sentence of what he said just sucks entirely.  😕

It feels like Kanao was just written to be the love interest and that's all.
the amount of times he "died" in that arc is crazy
Flair checks out
Shinobu is so beautiful 😭
I agree with your flair and your panel pick
I’d fold
Every single Shinobu panel in gaiden is 10/10
And then he proceeds to scream before slashing him iirc hahaha
But going from the anime to the manga, my favorite things was all the arts the author did as chapter starts or just sides for the main story. This one in particular is a favorite cause demon slayer Nezuko, but I enjoyed a lot of them.
That was Gato 💓
shit made me laugh so hard
Dog tax?! We need to see Nezuko!!
he's so sweet, isn't he?

Actual linguist here: Because the online ones are done by translators who don’t work for the publishing company, and a lot of the time language is fluid and doesn’t have an exact word-to-word equivalent when you’re trying to move the meaning of concepts from one language to the next. So the more emotional and poetic concepts become, the less likely it is that you’ll get two different people to translate a sentence in the same way.
Colour scans tend to be unofficial.
What does he say?
the jjk spoilers in a kny sub is crazy
Ah. Gojo 2.5.

(So apparently in Chinese one character in his name was 五(five), so someone came up with the term Gojo 2.5 because 5 in half is 2.5 and Gojo was halved.)
Wrong manga but thanks for making laugh 🤣

The bravery of the regular demon slayers was insane! Even knowing that they stood zero chance of doing anything to Muzan, they all courageously chose to literally stand and die between him and the hashira, all for the few precious seconds of protection that bought them. Those dudes got dawgs in em.
>!I love that The hashira training arc in the anime built up on their sacrifice!<
You have at least 3 years to prepare
no cuz seriously he did so well. him and mitsuri just make me so damn emotional tho
Fax🥲🩷💚
Coloured version coming soon (in a few years)😭
I thought all the Hashira were significantly older except for Muichiro
I can’t wait for this panel to be animated (in the chaos of Infinity Castle).
Yeah it is, definitely also one of my favorite panels in the manga too, Tanjiro was definitely a menace during his fight against Muzan. ☠👍
Don’t, when that gets animated I’m gonna die 😭 reading it in the manga felt so painful
Yeah but you’ll always get those one or two anime only who’ll still stray into a manga discussion so the warning is there just in case
Iknr! This and Kanao insulting Upper moons😂
They better not change the dialogues any further
Can't wait to hear that in anime.
I mean he didn't smile or speak until he was seven, but I get what you mean. The small glimpses we see of him make him out to be this terrifying and serious figure. The memory of him with Sumiyoshi helps put into perspective who he actually was. Then of course his story with Kokushibo and the memory Tanjiro has just displays everything about him 😔. He may not show emotions on his face often, but he feels deeply.
He doesn't let anyone live in peace 😔 At the very least, Uta and him were reincarnated and got a happy family.
It's in volume twenty-one, which hasn't been animated yet. It'll be animated after the three movies (most likely).
Who were the other 3 people? Rui's parents?
Yeah I'll say from watching the anime to finishing up in the manga I genuinely enjoy ufotable's facial renditions better. Some moments in the manga kinda throw me off a bit with the derby faces during serious moments 😅
Sanemi is a softie inside ... he just acts harsh and hides his true emotions, to act Strong. In a way he is almost like Giyu in terms of hiding emotions and act cold. Both lost a part of them in the past.
Frfr. My boy gets so much hate, he's literally my favourite.
It was indeed ... such a wholesome moment. A long time till we see this one getting animated !
Oh i know it will, after that battle my view on sanemi just did a 180
Totally, same as >!Akaza's death and backstory!< I can't wait for it but at the same time i'm sure i'll be destroyed when watching it
I forgot about it! I almost cry when i read it cuz the shinazugawa brothers are my favorite characters
that head pat is going to kill me
They both make me cry
Kimetsu No Kaisen
Yes
I think we were told why she wasn't picked to go because Tengen didn't dare ask Shinobu for her Tsuguko
True, I totally agree with you, I really wished we got to see more of Kanao, she was shown in the beginning of the story and had some small  moments of her development about her breaking out of her shell and only to get shafted so hard until the end.   

This is going to sound very controversial but I think Kanao had some potential as a character but it feels like she was just written to be Tanjiro's love interest, and no I don't hate Kanao either. 😕

I think she is a good character but I just wished she was used more properly in the story and I was upset that most of her character development was offscreen after conversation with Tanjiro.  She's a cool character but I will still be disappointed that I find her to be wasted potential to this day. 

Anyways though can't wait for Douma vs Kanao to be animated soon and I got admit Kanao roasting Douma had to be one of my favorite moments in Infinity Castle Arc! 😆
same
Nicely elaborated.
Hehe Gyomei Impact
>defeated Kokushibo:

kokushibo killed himself
I stared too long at that tbh. I was like how silly for such a moment, then i saw the nose
Who’s that? Do you mean Tendango?
It's Monjiro!
I've been waiting for locked in Zenitsu since the beginning of this series..it's gonna be so good
very smally
That boy was scared 😂
Absolutely. I know most characters besides Tanjiro are underdeveloped, but holy shit... why would you give zero backstory and character development to the person who takes down Upper Moon 2? 

When I read the infinity castle arc I couldn't even remember who Kanao was, given how non-existent she was throughout the story. I was more familiar with Murtara than her!

Requested pup tax!
I noticed that the most when I read the ending. I read two they basically meant the same thing but the way one was worded, I was like "umm...what." then the other translation just seemed more modern and smooth abd i was like"okay i get now"
Ah I see, appreciate the explanation
Even funnier is the Go in his name means 5 so it’s not Gojo 2.5 but rather 2.5jo (ye I don’t really know what I’m saying)
I didn't notice it the demon slayer page till after I posted the comment, lol
Oops my bad I thought it was any manga panel not just demon slayer
Reminds me of Attack On Titan when the scouts rush beast Titan head on.
But it was a boring useless arc!!! /S
read the manga and this is my initial thought. ufotable put that fillers just to hurt the viewers on the sunrise countdown arc. i won't be surprised if they put some flashback from hashira training arc while muzan slices them all.
There's characters that stood out among the same-faced generic slayers. I totally can't wait to watch them either die when muzan wakes, or die defending the hashira ;A;
Obanai was already partially blind but at this point he had zero sight and still was fighting. impressive
There should be one
Most of them are 18-21… arguably just kids. Muichiro and the quartet are 14-16 I think. Goes to show how op they are versus demons who are decades or centuries old. Also makes sense why Muzan is so disappointed in his moons lol
Hm true I guess 



But that's on them tho
I mean Kanao doing anything… such a gentle face and then she destroys people with her words
O really? I must’ve missed that in the extra chapter
Oh nice thank you this is one the most beautiful moments in the manga and i want to see it get animated so bad
Rui’s parents and Sanemi when he was on death’s door, he was willing to carry his mom to hell, but he ended up coming back.
Rui's parents and Akaza's girlfriend.
nemi and obanai got a bad rep for going against the Mcs since lots of fans don't like it. yes they were mean but what do you expect, they slay demons and weren't taking any chances. yes its unfair to tanjiro and nezuko but lives were at risk
They had him dead to rights and certainly would have gotten him with a few more moves. He seemed to be at the end of his rope.
How did he kill himself as he was fading remember he is trying to get himself to use a blood demon art but he can't and starts to cry to his brother of why he was born and how much he hates him
I think he's talking about Konpachiro. Could be wrong tho
Fr, Tanjiro was just built different 😂😂☠ Akaza being scared imao
So true and tbh I really want your honest thoughts abou some character that were wasted potential. 

I think Tanjiro was handled pretty well and I have no problem with him besides the fact that he's one of favorite characters in the series but tbh the fact he has Kanao as his love interest when they've barely interact and to make things worse their relationship is so underdeveloped. 

And I also think that Tanjiro falling in love with Kanao felt so out of character for him and it just didn't sit right with me, to me it feels like Tanjiro really would have been better off without a love interest or ended up with Aoi. 

Funny how Aoi has more anime-original content than Kanao. And also if you don't know who Aoi is, she is the girl who is a nurse in the Butterfly Mansion.
Omg what an adorable Nezuko. Please give her extra kisses and treats for me! Thank you ❤️
I guessed so but no worries, what is your actual favourite panel?
It’s okay I won’t downvote you
Shinzou Wo Sasageyo
Na. That was pure manipulation by the best manipulator in the series in my opinion.

He'll lie to you, and stand in front of you to convince you.

If the person who told me not to fear a threat is telling me to advance and dedicate myself at the point of his arm being munched on by said threat, I'd want to throw my life away too.

These demon slayer corps all just remembered what Tanjiro and everyone said. To me, they were even more encouraging than the Hashira themselves in the last minutes.
yup, everyone who thinks that r such clowns
exactly, man took it like a champ
I hear the “arguably” part! They are insanely OP. I’m only 27 still so only the youngest of the Hashira feel like children to me. Maybe why Gyomei is my personal favorite too
In the list of reincarnations/descendants one of them is just labeled "Happy family." The man's face isn't showing, but his hair is clearly Yoriichi's and the woman looks just like Uta. I guess it's not confirmed if they're reincarnations, but considering the tsugikuni bloodline died out, I think they'd have to be.
Of course! I love this moment so much and have been waiting expectantly. I know it'll hit like a truck all over again whenever it does get animated.
yeah i never really got the instant the. i was def annoyed that sanemi was going straight to stabbing nezuko so quickly but it ended up helping her case anyways lol. i couldn’t be too mad cuz like even then i figured nobody got involved in the demon slayer corps without a sad ass backstory and understandable hatred for demons.
The dude was starting to recover and was about to become immune to decapitation. What ended it is seeing how awful he became and that made him lose the will to live and thus started crumbling.
You just answered yourself. He's trying to use his bda and regenerate but starts crying due to the memories and gives up, stops regenerating on purpose and dies.
To be honest, love interests don't really make sense since we know so little of the female characters except Nezuko, Kanroji, and Shinobu. Of the characters that have some depth, I felt that Inozuke, Tanjiro, Giyuu, Tengen, Shinobu, Nezuko, are pretty good. Zenitsu and Kanroji are so-so. Gyomei, Obanai, Muichiro, Rengoku, Zenitsu, and Kanao are trash.

  
It doesn't even have to do with screen time - some of the trash ones simply don't see action until the end (e.g. Kanao) while others do have some screen time but are just stupid caricatures with cardboard personalities (Gyomei cries, Muichiro is airheaded, Zenitsu is scared and a pervert, etc.). They just don't have personalities and real interactions with the rest of the cast. A sad backstory and that's it.
Thx and heres My favorite demon slayer panel

https://preview.redd.it/17kwjn5kolcd1.jpeg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23cec60b15d8371b826996da50291952b4eeaecf
Erwin literally led the charge....but go off I guess...
It was a boring arc. But not useless.
Haha fair enough! Just turned 30 so I even look at Gyomei like a kid brother haha. But it also makes me feel they all missed out on living their lives like normal teens. Like Mitsuri and Iguro should have been highschool sweethearts and yet …. 😭
There is so much emotion in this panel with 0 words in it just the laugh of a cute and innocent soul, yoriichis face and the tears running down showing us how much emotion and sadness this stoic and serious person hides behind his cold face. People say demon slayer has a mid story but i believe there is a lot of emotion in certain moments
I was never mad at them in the first place. being mc doesn't grant yoy special treatment, esp when you break corps rules. nezuko was a proven danger in til season 2, and tanjiro willingly carried a demon
I gotcha I always interpreted it as he was realizing it was over not like akaza that kills himself but kinda like he was putting it all together that everything he ever did was always going to be for nothing cause he was selfish
Do you know you said this 8 times?
I totally agree with you and about your take Nezuko having "good writing" is just wrong I feel like as of now she used as a plot device for Tanjiro's character. I'm really somewhat starting to be convinced that ds is kinda mysgonistic. How come Shinobu and Tamayo can only be the only well-written female characters but the rest are treated poorly and used for fanservice. 🤨
You can't say bad things about an anime on said anime sub, because at that point your opinion is automatically wrong and it doesn't matter. I swear most people just downvote whenever they see someone already getting some.

The season was boring as fuck, as he said it wasn't useless because you know why slayer corp npcs sacrifice themselves but that doesn't take away the fact that 7 out of 8 episodes were absolute nothingness
Exactly. The characters are where it really shines. It's the first show where I don't dislike any characters. In such a short time, their stories can really leave a lasting impact and resonate with you. Demon Slayer wears its heart on its sleeve and I love it for that.
yeah, i wasn’t trying to say i was mad. more like frustrated that Sanemi specifically wasnt willing to even listen
Oh damn 😭 I was pressing post and it just kept saying empty response from endpoint so I clicked a few times and just gave up. Now it somehow just sent the messages so many times lmao. My bad bro, I'll delete these shi
More like a calm before the storm.
Thats YOUR opinion dawg. You cant expect everyone to feel the same way. And there's no way 7 out of 8 eps were absolute nothingness lmaoo u can find it boring if u want but shit was definitely happening.
For real i liked rengoku so much and he had a screen time of one hour hid death made me cry like a baby and to this day it makes me sad. There are so many stories from many characters and each one has depth and emotion to it for people to connect with, damn i loved akazas backstory and it was so sad and beautiful. And the anime just has so beautiful and strong massages it helped me go through a really hard period of my life and i will never forget this anime
Why should he? His own mother attacked him and ate her kids. there was literally no reason to other than plot if we're being logical. those with your opinion are completely missing the point, way too focused on mcs wants instead of looking at the situation clearly. They know family members turned demon will attack you- hence the strict rules. Theyre trying to prevent more tragedies from happening. idc for shinobu that much but ahe was right to carry her mission out and tomioka I like him, he was wrong to not go through with it
Doesn't take away the fact that it was boring as fuck
Like what?
Couldn't agree more. The music adds a whole other level to the emotions in my opinion. Obviously the animation is gorgeous, but those songs man. Even upon re-watch/read the moments, big and small, still hit me. I'm grateful something as heartfelt as this show can exist and reach so many people.
Not your cup of tea then. Can't expect constant action all the time.
giyu and gyomei backstories, mui character development, shinazugawa brothers and obamitsu relationships establishment, nakime um4 reveal and her eyes infiltrating the corps, nugu slayers getting screentime and motivated, tanjiro learning repetitive motions in order to activate and maintain his mark permanently, zenitsu getting serious, shinobu and tamayo plan setup and then the entirety of ep 8.
Truly the soundtracks just give me chills they are so calm and beautiful they fit every situation perfectly they can tell the story without much talking. It's kinda sad that the end of it is near bur every journey has its end
Why are there hardly any female Demon Slayers?
I know there’s Mitsuri, Shinobu, Kanao and Aoi, but since the Hashira Training started, I haven’t seen one female participant

Douma just eats them all
It takes place in 1920's Japan⚡
Women back then were kind of just cooped up at home so they didn’t have many encounters with demons so there was definitely much less female to male slayers. There are also many more female Kakushi to male Kakushi so maybe the women just play different roles on the battle field compared to the men 🤷‍♂️
Funny thing,Ozaki(the girl on the picture) is the only female slayer demon slayer in the series thats not a Hashira or connected to the Butterfly Mansion

But anyways i do remember in a databook or something(?,not sure) about Obanai it said that he resented most female slayers since they had a "weaker mentality" or something of the sort. And while typing that i realised how incredibly funny it would be to imagine Obanai having beef whit a 14-15 year old girl thats scared for her life which would be really in character for him.
I mean in taisho era Japan women weren’t exactly raised being call strong and brave and being told they could be a warrior one day. So I imagine only the bravest of women would take up warrior work
They're hiding from zenitsu
Because all the skilled females went to Gensokyo 40 years before the show happened 





(This is a joke by the way based on a Touhou/Demon Slayer crossover timeline I made when I was bored one day)
THATS WHAT I’M WONDERING. Since the fight with Rui, I haven’t seen one girl slayer aside from the ones mentioned. And the female kakushi don’t count
The author wants you to be into tall muscular half naked men flexing
Generally, men are the ones to take up fighting jobs as providers, not to say that women can't it's just that fewer women are willing to, especially with the patriarchal society of the early 20th century
everyone is thinking of social and biological reasons but we know in anime there are plenty of strong females (protaganists or otherwise) no matter the time period. I think it's simply because the author wanted to draw more muscles to depict how physically strong and fit demon slayers are
I know we're aiming for an in-story answer, but the real reason is that probable male fodder characters are easier to draw (shorter hair, less features).
Douma eats them 

It takes place between 1910 and 1920
Douma
Nezuko, Shinobu, Mitsuri, Kanao, Aoi, Caterpillar sisters, Tengen’s wives, Daki, and Nakime:

![gif](giphy|kqJt1cSSN0DrwwMmY5|downsized)
Douma 🤣
because they just didn't want to do it
Demon slayer is set in the tashio era of Japan taking place in the early 1900 to mid 1920’s. Considering this was when Japan just started to open their borders much of the way of life was still very traditional. Mitsuri whole character is based on her not fitting the ideals of what a typical Japanese women  in that time period is supposed to be and learning to overcome it. I think they’re are female demon slayers but considering that society still expected women to be the primary caretakers of the home. I don’t think many women stayed or participated in the corps for long. Also there are multiple support roles in the demon slayer corps outside of slayers. We see it with the wisteria houses and the clean up crew which was shown to have a lot of female members. Also I think it was slightly touched upon that to demons women were way more nutritious compared to men due to yk reproductive system etc
Tbh the whole "women are biologically weaker than men" is typically a weak argument when talking about fictional shows, especially when you have exceptions like mitsuri and it takes place in a fantasy world where you can be so flexible you can shuffle out your organs. however the fact that the author has set things in the Tashio era Japan and has kept most the women's jobs in demon slayer accurate to they times, we dive a little into women's roles of they times in season 2 with Tengan's 3 wives and how women live in the Red light district, it's clear the author wanted to make her story more accurate to the times not some shallow as "girls no strong, girls no allowed" so while Demon slayer is a fantasy show the author wanted to try and keep it historically accurate.
If they don't have a personal kemono or a unique hairstyle, they are fodder according to demon slayer
They have smaller lungs which makes it harder to use breathing techniques and less muscle mass
1920s.
Since this takes place in 1920’s Japan (Taisho Era), women are expected to stay at home, cook for the children, actually, cook for everyone. Yknow? Like the “Get back to the kitchen” slander. It was not common to see a woman fighting supernatural beings rather than cooking omeletes for their (arranged (forced)) husbands or children.
Mfers talking about history and biology. It's an anime. It was simply the author's wish not to include many women slayers. It's that simple.
Ive been asking that Exact same question, like in the Hashira Training Arc, I haven’t seen a Single Female Demon Slayer
Honestly it’s probably because they all get snatched by demons. Or get targeted in particular
Maybe they taste better so all of them get targeted to be eaten
i believe it’s because during the time that demon slayer was set in, women usually preferred to stay at home and tend to the family and stuff (?)
Most of them are the doctors iirc, I know they have an actual name but I can't remember it for the life of me. Basically they work at butterfly mansion and clean up what's left after the slayers kill a demon I think.

Plus given that it's set in 1910 / 1920s Japan, most women were probably at home.

Or maybe doma just ate them all.
Because females belong to the kitchen*

*in that era.
I feel as if Mitsuri should've personally trained female prospects in flexibility, agility, perhaps even diet. Don't think they would've endured Tengen's merciless training.
The story takes place in 1920s Japan in the fact there are any female Demon Slayers is a plot miracle given how 99% of soldiers would be male and how prevalent, popular, and reinforced traditional gender roles were
They live in older japan

Even if you think about modern military there are simply more men than women. This is due to just biological wiring and advantages.

Not saying women cant be warrior and soldiers just much harder for them to hit the standard due to biological disadvantages.
Women tend to be physically weaker, so less are fighting. Pretty universal, since forever, there are much less than men in wars and the like.
because most Shonen are like that sadly
because women biologically tend to be weaker ON AN AVERAGE compared to men.

I mean there are women particularly strong and intelligent {mitsuri and shinobu} in hashira roles.

p.s come on we already have male and female sport category for a reason, and its not sexism .

yes taisho era is sexist but this is NOT BASED ON JAPANESE TAISHO ERA. there are no demons in realm japan
Because women tend to be physically weaker and don't make as good a soldier as men. The only female pillars are Shinobu, who is stated to be the weakest of the bunch and she hates herself for how weak and frail her body is, and Mitsuri, who has an "anime disease" mutliplying her muscle density and making her much stronger physically than any other human in the show. Also, this is 1920 japan and women at the time weren't exactly known for enrolling en masse into the army (not like it has changed today lol), a part of Mitsuri's backstory literally adresses how she felt out of place in the corps at first. And supposing a woman decided to become a demon slayer anyway, she would have a lower life expectancy than her male counterpart, since as I stated before they would be less effective fighters and would be more likely to die while fighting demons, unless they were prodigies like Kanao, or cowards like Aoi, who spent her entire career in the corps doing cooking and laundry.
Timeline
Women are naturally weaker bruh
I feel like it’s obvious, women are more targeted and less physically fit to fight demons, mitsuri being the one and only exception
Probably the same reason Shinobu is unable to decapitate a high level demon despite being a Hashira; physiological handicap

There are girls that possess the necessary strength (Mitsuri could probably arm wrestle any male slayer and win, even give Gyomei a challenge) but the average strength difference means boys are more likely to be able to deal a killing blow and survive fighting a demon.
If resources for workarounds were more available, as they are to Shinobu, then there would be far more slayers surviving in general, both male and female. There are also males who cannot master the necessary techniques of breathing to decapitate that rely on workarounds and alternative means, such as ninjutsu, American breathing and other tricks
In season 2 the show basically told you with Tengens wives. The women can't compete with men physically so they need to resort to other methods to fight like poison. Mitsuri is the big outlier here but she is an abnormality. Also Kanao I guess 
I feel like they all have been taught to either stay away from demons because the demons usually prey on women to get stronger and another reason is because at this time since it was the 1910s-1930s women were made to A work in the house and work for the husband or have kids, normal house wife stuff at the time. or B most women at the time were made to feel less then a man so most women stayed in the house.
Because similar to Mitsuri a man never wanted to date her because she was strong and thought for herself 
She wasn’t considered house wife material that’s why there Aren’t a lot of female demon slayer, because they were preyed on or eaten or the woman were made to be "normal" house wives in
https://preview.redd.it/65mwi20tmn5d1.jpeg?width=3818&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4f6a32506e8bfbd7881504c4aa428df0a79582f
Because none of those useless ass demons killed Douma as a human when they had the chance 🙄
thats a really silly question considering the era and country the story takes place in....I'm surprised there are ANY female slayers
And the female slayers who weren't as gifted as Shinobu or Mitsuri were most probably eaten off by demons, by Douma in particular. As we know, females provide more nutrition to demons when consumed than a man or child.
They wanted to do group bath scenes.
Douma eated them all
The percentage of female Slayers is still higher than today's percentage of women in every armforce in the world combined
Demon Slayer is set during Japan's Taishō Period. Which is about 1912 to 1926 some what in ww1 Woman till WW2 were highly prevented to join army or any kind of dangerous job. Demon slayer corps is basically an army. 
Along with the fact that most demon slayer know about that corps because they found it when wondering through a forest or something searching for a job young womans (about 18-21) at that time were much more busy doing households 
Social structure kinda like this:
Got a boy? 
> train him
> tell him go find a job
Got a girl ?
> make her look beautiful 
> make her marry to a rich guy
So their much more young mens were available for certain jobs especially deadly jobs.
Because the writer sucks at writing women
In my opinion is because of how dangerous it was for women in general en 1920, let alone if you aren’t as gifted as Mitsuri or Shinobu, they are figthing demons it isn’t really something many are exited about let alone women who for years have been house wife’s because of the era they where born in.
Just remember, the author is a woman.
It's kinda like asking why aren't there any black people, it's the early 20th century and Japan was rly traditionalist at the time, we can understand this by Mitsuri's backstory too.
Because women are mostly weaker
Its a product of the period. The women you even mention are exceptions to the norm. 

Mitsuri was so unsightly as a marriage prospect due to her immense strength, she became a hashira to find a husband. 

And Shinobu, kanao, and Aoi were raised by a female hashira who would routinely find and save women that society failed. 

The majority of society for much if the series didnt even *know* demons existed and those that did would much rather raise families than put their own lives at risk.
It’s a shounen anime so it’s aimed at teenage boys and any women that do show up are likeable for that demographic.
For me the most obvious explanation is that the time in which things are set were somewhat sexist, and since a demon hunter is somewhat "male" it is not surprising that there are not so many women
Same reason why soldiers are mostly men. The average woman is physically weaker than the average man, and most women can't keep their cool in stressful situations. In addition, the manga/anime is set in the early twentieth century in a country that has recently transitioned from feudalism to capitalism.
I guess it's really just because females are biologically weaker than men, so statistically it has to be like that, that's it.
Cause demon slayer takes place in the taisho era and maybe the author likes drawing attractive guys
Doylist answer: it's a shonen manga aimed at adult or teenage males so they have more male characters for the audience to identify with.

Watsonian answer: it's set in the 1910s/1920s so sexism was unfortunately rampant meaning most women were probably turned away.
Well, the main reason might because it’s the 1920s. Not to sound misogynistic, but women typically were expected to stay at home and raise children. Not that there weren’t clearly exceptions, but I’m sure most of the Demon Slayer Corp were recruited after they experienced some kind of Demon attack in their lives and young girls were typically weaker or were the main target of the Demons, giving them lesser odds of surviving the initial attack to become Slayers. Even Shinobu acknowledges she’s weak compared to the other Hashira due to her inability to behead Demons and had to invent a new way of killing them to even stand a chance.
There are female demon slayers as support roles, but I wouldn't blame any female member of the corps for wanting to avoid the front lines
I know we're aiming for an "in-store" answer, but the reason it's they're probably easier to draw (shorter hair, less features)
Same reason they’re hardly in most military positions probably, idk I don’t think there is a lore reason I’m just making guesses
Because theyre female, it's not a secret that the demon Slayer goes through hellish training.
Some may have been in the Kakushi division, along with Goto.
Alright, strap down and give me a 20... Thousand. Lol

On a real note? Its probably a case of the author doing a bit of a realism set piece on how hard women have in the corps as a whole.

Like, apart from an incredible drive required to surmount the basic difference in strength, would anyone really place much stock into a slayer that is practically disabled for 2-5 days every month?

This is my headcannon at least on why there aren't very many high ranked women slayers or just lower ranked women slayers in general, work that isnt as intensive is better suited for them thus they have clearly formed the majority of the recovery service members even on screen.
Everyone is commenting about biological and historical reasons but really, when we think about it, at the end of the day it is a shounen manga with little to no fanservice (apart from mitsuri’s shenanigans and daki) so naturally most of the characters are going to be male. Also even if it was targeted at a more female demographic it would probably still be more “male centric” since in Japan women tend to prefer male characters (like in bungo stray dogs). That being said I miss a strong willed muscle mommy like Mereoleona in the hashiras…
the time period that it takes place in was one where women weren't seen as fighters and they were physically weaker. While there are female slayers most of them are outclassed by the male slayers because men are genetically designed to be stronger.
real
Cause
Shonen genre
It’s cause they all die at the final selection cause they’re weak

In the tashio era. My best guess is that it is rare because given tradition, Swordsman Ship is something a man should master and woman not

But that doesn't mean a woman can't fight. I mean, there are great examples like Shinobu

In short, they're rare, but that doesn't stop em in the demon slayer corp
I’ve been wondering about Female Slayers Too
I don’t think Aoi is a Demon Slayer. She just helps out at butterfly mansion
Lack of physical strength and family-rearing responsibilities.
Because we are products of our culture
I don't think I wanna say what a demon might do to female demon slayers, so just look up goblin slayer.
Maybe doma ate them
I dunno
Cos doma gets to them and eats them first?
Because this is set on Taisho era but! Even in this time period their are still some female demon slayers as we know but if talk about sengoku era there would be literally 0 female members and Hashira is out of question
Because women are weaker in reality and author as a woman knows that
Women are generally weaker so probably they got killed.......
Because they're normally easier to prey on cause they're weaker.
I think I actually read somewhere that women have more nutritional value to demons.
There’s 2 possible reasons in my opinion, 

1. Women were too weak to be demon slayers, as it was the 1910s

2. Demons ate women more than men, as they are supposedly more nutritious
The women may die easier and be more likely to be targeted first by demons because they are weaker. “Not to be sexist or rude”
Cuz they weak, my main issue is why they all so young🤨
Demon Slayer takes place in a time where women were expected to stay home. It also takes place during world War 1. As we saw by Muzan's fits, Japan was adopting western ideas.

There was also a time we're Samurai could write letters to cowboys... so that also adds to the idea.

Also, The Demon Slayer Corps were a secret organization unknown to the government. They were basically the Men in Black, but on their own.  So it's was either found by accident, the Hashira/ slayers found you first bcs of a demon attack, or you were a part of it from the beginning. 

And since women stayed home: less chances to find/ join the Corps, or being so weak, they're cooked as soon as a demon breathes in a mile radius.

Even Tengen's wives, despite being pretty formidable even if they're not slayers, were scene in the new eps acting like  usual SAH wives.
1. females are biologically weaker 

2. 1920s japanese culture

3. douma
It doesn't have to be equal for everything all the time does it? 

Does every man and every woman have to be represented in every form of art to an equal measure?

*Upper 2 Demon would like to know their location*
Because men are stronger, end of conversation
The Patriarchy
Timeline wise: 1920. A lot of women wouldn't be fighters as much. 

Biological wise: men are stronger than women. Plus, only the best of the best men became hashira. Shinbou and misturi are only exprctation because shinbou is super smart and intelligent.  They didn't make her hashira because of her strength.
Misturi is basically flexible, dude. Her bone density and muscle phyiscal close to a man, and then women .

Censorship wise: people more ok with guys getting cut up then girls. 

Can they add more women? Sure, it's a make-believe show. However, the creator wants to make the hashira a little bit realistic . Even the breath technique is fake.
Feminist has entered the chat
Stupid ass question. Why are there relatively few female soldiers on the frontlines even today?
Blame Douma.
Same reason as why there are not many women in Military. Women in general are not as physically gifted as their male counterparts.
the same reason there are barely any female blackbelts in martial arts.  the amount of dedication strength and  resilience it takes is something not a lot of women can manage
Women are weak
![gif](giphy|I6n8YSKRIJqPwGll4n|downsized)
Because in demon slayer woman have more nutrients for demons and are probably hunted by demons more and that's why
Because anime boobs flop around too much and would hit them in the face during these moves
If you're looking for a realistic answer, it's because women physically can not compete with men. You will obviously always have outliers and exceptional women but they are not the norm.
Because there all kitchen breathers
Because women think of a Pikachu when demons are mentioned. 

“It’s a forest spirit!” 

How many times has this been said in an obvious anime death flag moment.

Jk, I’d imagine it had to do with Japanese culture. I can’t remember the exact name but in Heian-Edo era Japan in most villages there would be a group of rice threshing women who, if they were needed to “defend the portcullis” would be called upon by the local lords because they were strong and knew how to use a scythe/Naginata type weapon. It’s not either of those but I remember the artwork we were shown of it in college and I thought it was pretty cool. 

Mounted Samurai were known to fear these groups of women because of their weapons ease at dismounting a rider.
Simple, most woman aren’t as strong as men. Mitsuri is unusually strong and Shinobu uses a special weapon because she isn’t strong enough to wield a big weapon.
I mean, look at modern day dangerous jobs. 9% of firefighters are female, 14.2% police officers, 16.6% of wrestlers. So, it's the same reasons as why there's not many women in those professions, PLUS the fact it's taisho era Japan, and women are told to be home makers, and fighting probably isn't a "proper womanly activity"

As a girl, I would also not want to be a demon slayer lol. I feel like from my personal experience, woman tend to just have more propensity for survival? Like, I just see men do way more risky things, and it's proven men just engage in more risky behavior than women. There's plently of women out there whod take up the sword, but I've found women are generally less willing to put themselves in situations that can cost them their lives. I know i wouldn't.
Probably societal stuff
I have two theories.

1. Women are biologically weaker than men, as men are naturally built for survival, so it must've been harder for women to become a demon slayer at all.

2. The producers went with the idea of a traditional wife, and that's why there's not many female demon slayers.
Women are weaker than men.


Swords take strength to use for what they need to use them for
Because this is a story directed towards young men/ boys not women. 

Sorry if that hurts your feelings but that’s just how boys manga is most of the time even now there are few main stream action/ Shonen manga that feature many women main cast/ back ground just in general. 

Also the period that demon slayer takes place in realistically wouldn’t really have many women in combat situations just like how women weren’t in combat in modern day until very recently, just a primitive way of thinking I suppose but very time accurate if that’s the head cannon you support.
Douma ate them to extinction
Because most of the female characters are already dead and consumed by demons in the first place. Demons are known to eat a lot of women and children because of their nutritional value, so they would prey on women and children more than men. I hardly remember demons any men except for shoichi’s brother who has a marechi blood.
Because demon like doma exist
Them demons do look kinda rapey.
Its takes place in the 1900s, use common sense
we  obviously know that there is no electronics but there are trains and clocks so it's most likely taken place from 1910's and lower and there are no wars too
I'm going to give a Doylist answer and just say easier to draw male Demon Slayers then female. Or maybe during the training arc there's more female demon slayers in the background.
I'm not sure but very few women have been depicted as wrathful enough to be a solid slayer. People like Shinobu and Sanemi bear a deep seated unshakable resentment to muzan and demons for the deaths of their loved ones. That type of deeply rooted hatred from losing your family is needed to become a slayer in most cases unless you're born into a slayer family, and as we saw with Tanjiro, muichiro, and rengoku's families just seem to have had more boys.

There's also the real chance that like we saw with Kanao, poor families that would be more commonly attacked by demons just because there are more of them, would sell their daughters off to brothels or private buyers like we saw in the entertainment district.
Because all of them are all busy being subjugated.
In 1920’s Japan, women were more traditional, which meant hardly any of them even thought about fighting in the first place.
Well seriously bro the story demon slayer was set in year 1910-30 and in that time there were no such a women have no particular independence and feminism didn't exist and that era and that was a good thing they have to spend less resources in such a liability of women and maybe the manga artist have added them to attracts more audience just as normal script writer or bro don't want to be canceled and according to me he have to include only few female characters like Matsuri,  Shinobu and her adopted sisters in demon slayer unit not in even hashiras Matsuri is a exception because of her strength and Nezuko is a demon so she don't have silly issues like other girls and well well well she is not a demon slayer after all and now I'm going to be canceled.
most likely if you wanted to get any job in japan that paid alot. demon slayer def wasn't one of the first opinions and their is much safer-ish work.
Due to the era of the time
While true, 2 of all the Hashira are female…
Skill issue
[deleted]
I mean, women in general are physically weaker and in a fight against literal superhumans and monsters every last bit of strenght counts. Its likely that they get picked off much easier than their male counterparts unless they have some sort of gimmick (like poisoned blade for example) and there's just less of them in the first place as it tends to be in irl militaries.
isn't it set back in really misogynistic times? so it's probably something to do with that
We all know the messages are going to be deletet in a matter of seconds.
Douma
Just Douma having a big lunch, normal as usual🥰
i think its just that we dont see them. like i get that thats the only view we have into the world of demon slayer but i still dont think there are hardly any female demon slayers in the grand scheme of things. if there can be female hashiras, theres probably many female demon slayers too, just not ones that we see.
THANK YOU I was thinking the exact same thing earlier today and was wondering if I should start a thread.
Bcz it's a good show
Because Anime Community always creates hentai mangas on them always disrespect them and s*xual objectification of them defaming the women's image.
cause… women
Well I mean, it's the Taisho era so women were not seen as warriours, the misogynistic society likely doesn't give women many chances to do something like join the Demons Slayer Corps especially since that's already difficult.
No clue
Because it's not a waifu fanservice anime...
Because it's taishou era Japan, when woman were mainly meant to be housewives
Author choice to be honest :3
It takes place in the 1920s
It's not a female oriented role just like a lot of labor combat sport fighting and military positions are mainly male no matter the time period.
1920’s Japan. Women inequality🐍
I don’t think it’s that deep. It’s a Shonen manga so by default that means you’re not gonna see that many women.
Real question is why are there no Black demon slayers? So strange for such a mainstream show to lack inclusivity.
Who'll be in the kitchen then?
I'm pretty upset about this, even though it's somewhat realistic for the time period. It's just that out of all the realistic elements in this unrealistic show, why did the lack of women fighters have to be one of them.
They only wanted to make one generic hunter body instead of two. Just saves ressources.
Adding more female characters will just makes This show a trash since demon slayer have barley any story and on the other hand its a SHONEN ANIME!

Its 1920s Japan with strict social norms and women are physically weaker than men. In breathing alone, female lungs are 10 times smaller than male ones.

Mitsuri is just the exception and Shinobu uses poison for a reason
1920’s Japan is why
Because they have Zenitsu
I love how one of the reply sections turned into a whole debate on feminism and biology
Dang it, this is how it starts. Just look at what happened to Star Wars.
The writers don’t want us getting too horny
In the story they state you have to be incredibly physically strong to decapitate a demon (the only way to kill them).

Mitsuri is unusually larger and stronger than your average woman, with an unusually large appetite to boot. She is an outlier and a representation of exceptionally strong women who can go toe to toe with the men, but in this case, demons. 

Shinobu is physically unable to decapitate a demon, but she is an hashira because of her intelligence and speed. Her katana is actually a giant syringe and her speed allows her to be quick enough to inject demons with poison. 

Given this is the Taisho Era (1912-1926) the progressive and liberal society we live in today where women are free from the restrictions of *just* domestic duties hasn’t taken hold yet. Therefore men take on wartime, hunting and protective roles while woman take on care-giving roles due to our child-bearing nature. So women in military positions were far fewer and in between. The show shows most female demon slayers taking on administrative leadership/care-giving/hospitality roles, which is more accurate to the actual role a female would play. 

However, the show would suck if there was no female hashira (I am a feminist) and since there is always those few exceptions in a society we have our two beautiful and lovely female hashiras. 

I will say in most anime’s, they do not make any limit or distinction to male and female biological strength, with many females being considered “the strongest humanity has to offer” in MANY different shows. However, I think demon slayer tries to keep some historical and cultural accuracy despite being entirely fictional.
Men are psychologically and phisically built for battles in previous eras. Hell, we even have that fantasy of dying protecting those we care about or sacrificing ourselves for greater good. Women on the other side aren't just usually romanticizing death but life since they want to take care of those under them, while still being alive.
You making this post has brought the armchair biology experts out in force.
Japan in the 1910s and 1920s like most countries. Then and even today was a patriarchy. Women's place was in the house and that's why there are very few women to be demon slayers.
Shitty profession, women tend to be smarter about not dying
I dunno look at history maybe
Men are better suited for the job, stronger, faster, more physically capable
Given how unknown the slayer corps are to the wider public, chances are the most slayers come from families who have history with the corps or demons, as a result the selections of humans that can become slayers is small, pair that with sexism, biology and the dangers of the job there is probably some stigma about women being trained and instead their roles are to stay away from the front lines and focus on helping in other ways such as medics, messengers and other stuff aswell as most importantly having children. 

Slayers are always dying, so it's probably very important that babies are being born all the time for the purpose being trained from a young age to replace the dead slayer. Otherwise the corps with be diminished too fast if they were relying on cases like tanjiro just happening into becoming a slayer.
Their in kitchen acting like yoriichis wife, dead inside and out with a mini submarine life form them
Because they will seduce da demon

They exist but most of the background character designs look like ops picture. Bland
It takes place in 1920s Japan, where women most of the time stuck to traditional roles instead of fighting or going on the battlefield. I’m not saying women can’t fight, they could and they can help out in the battlefield, but most women preferred not to and I don’t want to use the argument “women are biologically weaker than men” since even if they’re weaker, they can contribute somehow in fights and as a warrior. Overall, the author wanted to keep it accurate to that period of time
yeah it’s kinda weird! but there is also a looootttt of charcters with black hair and berely any other color
for the same reason military forces are mostly men
This is a task where strength and speed is required. Men are stronger and faster than women. Plus as other mentioned it’s another time. Things were different. 

We now have women in the police or military force mostly because we have guns.
In lore? Might be biologically since men are generally (pls don’t blow up my notifs) more physically gifted than women. I mean men evolved to be able to do physical stuff (hunting, fighting, lifting, etc). Women on average don’t have the same physical stats as men. Misturi and Shinobu are outliers and shouldn’t be taken as the norm. There’s reason why men have been the ones fighting wars for the entirety of human history. Again there are outliers (Boudica is a good example!). Anyway, Mitsuri has been shown to have been born (or at least developed) her strength. It’s unnatural for anyone else. While Shinobu is one of the fastest Hashira (might be below Tengen bc of ninja stuff). Shinobu also has to use poison since her body limits her strength. So to sum up, Shinobu and Mitsuri (and later Kanao) are all outliers. They’re gifted and shouldn’t be taken as the norm. 

However…men may just be easier to animate. I mean think of the isekai protagonists. They all look the same and are basically carbon copies of each other. Plus it might spark a lot of…art if there were an abundance of female slayers. Anyway, it might be convenience more than anything.
They’re in the kitchen
N-nezuko
Skill issue
Cus the majority of them would die
Women are weak.
Remember it’s the Taisho period. That’s 1912-1926. During this time anything remotely martial in nature was mainly male dominated.
Because women were evolutionarily designed to be caretakers, not warriors.
They should make one story of the First Demon Slayer Huntress... her backstory how she was killed.... Certainly was Douma who killed her...
Start of 20th century Japan. I won't say anything else
Historical reasons purely
1.) Shounen...

2.) The era. This is the early 1910-1920s Japan. There is a certain societal expectation for women and training to become a swordsman is not one of those expectations. Not to mention the Final Selection is essentially a suicide mission which not many would want their daughters training for.  

3.) As Shinobu demonstrates you need immense upper body strength to slice off stronger demons heads. Most women in the Demon Slayer universe don't have that. So they either need to be an exception like Mitsuri or use other methods like Shinobu.
It’s been a common string through the series that women have a stronger or sweeter blood.

Demons crave it more and this female demon slayers are probably targeted way more often.
I think the most basic and unfortunate answer is just… misogyny
I mean the time period was the 1920s, it was more egregious then (although as an American I won’t sit here and assume what Japan’s social culture was back then, ain’t my place-)
I feel like the animators sexualize female characters more so it’s harder to animate them. And men are more likely to become a demon slayers I guess cause most of the women in the verse are just not powerful enough to at least put up a fight against demons.
I ate them.
Probably the time period
![img](avatar_exp|177543072|fire)

True
Most get rsped
Maybe they have a secret area where they have them constantly popping out babies so they have more slayers
Should be logical right? Biology says females are weaker than men. Strong people are needed in the corps. You should be surprised that there even are females in the corps, which is solely to have some diversity. Realistically speaking there would be no single female in the corps.
The same logic as to why are there hardly any female in the military
Because they're smart enough not to deal with this shit
You people are embarrassing
Cuz women in that time were the most vulnerable 🤣 duh
1. Time period 
2. Men are more predisposed to grunt work combat than women
3. Author’s choice
4. More women would make the editors want the author to oversexualize them, and the author doesn’t want to do that (I think)
5. Douma
 It’s the time period.
because the writer is a coward? obviously theres no real societal reason seeing as how theres demons so realism isnt important.
Why is there lesser woman in the military /police / firemen in modern 2024. 

I belived that answer your question
I am SO relieved this comment section isn’t full of sexism. 
this is like asking why theres more male police officers than female police officers. the demon slayer corps is essentially a glorified police force.
Probably :
- the misoginy of the setting
- the amount of demons that tend to prioritize eating women
- the possibility that demon slayer families preventing their female members to join. 

Aside from that, there’s the matter of strength but it doesn’t really matter that much as strength isn’t the only factor that’s going to help you defeat a demon and, man or woman, you’ll always be at a disadvantage against one in that domain so…🤷‍♂️. But it’s not like there isn’t any, there’s just less of them.
Since the anime takes place during the 1910s, a time where gender roles were really enforced, I think that women themselves just believed that they didn’t need to be demon slayers and that they belonged in the kitchen while the men fight demons
It’s not truly stated why there aren’t many. But in this timeframe, there aren’t many because it’s not expected of them to become a swordsman or brawler of any kind. Women were expected to do house work and assist with farming and cooking. Therefore: Any female slayers seen are either out of coincidence or because they grew up in families where they are subjected to a life fitting for a male to be in. Though the Slayer Corps don’t have rules against volunteer females. This is my deduction as for this timeframe it makes a lot of sense. And a lot of women are picked off from Demons either because they’re incredibly nutritious than males and some demons are mentally twisted and specifically target women like Douma and the Swamp Demon did.
I think the leading reason was because at the time most women were stay at home wives
I was wondering It too!
I heard it's mostly because the action takes space somewhere in WW1 and in that time in Japan women were strongly believed to belong at home married with children, not out in the battlefield. You can see it even in mitsuri's backstory, she thought that as a girl she should stay at home and get married before becoming a demon slayer
Biology
It's a fuckin shonen
They be dying on the field first
Periods per off nahi demon slayer corps mein thats why and btw mitsuri flexible hogyi hai and she doesnt get bothered by it
Probably bc it was during a time where women were seen as just wives and nothing more
Most men are stronger then most feman shinobu is an example but she found a better way than just strength
I think it is because they were
A:eaten off because there are more nutrients in women for demons
B:There are lower ranked demon slayers, so they die quicker if they are not in groups (same with men, there are probably a lot of weaker male slayer, so not just wemon)
That's all I can really think of
Why are you expecting world building. This is demon Slayer lil bro
Men are stronger
why are there hardly any female construction workers or fencers?
They rare
I will assume douma takes a interest and eats them
Probably because of the time period
The show takes place during the Meiji restoration period, so your lucky to have ANY female demon slayers.
First of all it takes place in japan in the beginning of the 20th century, culturaly speaking jap women in these times do not fight. Secondly men are in major part physically stronger so they get a better chance at murking demons. Sure there are exceptions, but broadly speaking in any conflict all over time and over the world men are the ones fighting it just makes more sense
The same reason more men are in the military than women.
It's a shonen
E
Lore reason:  it's Japan in the early 1900s. Women weren't really doing anything. Most of the female characters were shown that our demon slayers physically aren't strong enough. 

Meta reason: Tengen has more than enough fingers to count how many anime have strong female characters that remain useful and important throughout the entire show.
The simps
because there weaker most of them are cannon fodder
Probably have the Shinobu problem. Too physically weak to cut off a head
Bc it doesn’t make sense to for women to be at the front lines. If women population collapses then humans would be doomed. How would make new babies
I also find it very odd why there is literally no female participant in the hashira training arc. If I remember correctly there were a few of them who fought and died in the spider mountain arc in s1. There were also some of them deployed at the start of the mugen train arc. I think its either just bad writing or the author forgot they existed. Even Kanao, a tsuguko should have been at the forefront of the hashira training.
what's her name?
In general, any reason that would apply to why there is more men in the military than women would probs apply here.
Prob cuz its in old japan.
okay more like why do they all have black hair
Probably because most girls get eaten by demons or something/ douma
There’s to answers the first being douma eating them and the second is it’s a shonen anime not to be rude but it translates to for boys and most boys would prefer to see more men in cool scenarios 
I cant tell if this is a meme and Douma be getting a feast
How it works





Douma inhaled all the woman in the universe the end
Most likely the same reason for why there hardly are any female soldiers today, if you compare it to males.
I mean the majority of soldiers are men because men are naturally physically stronger because of testosterone, so they’re kinda just being accurate
Women are generally weaker than men. If you have an army, you're going to want the strongest people. Obviously some women will be in your army but not close to the amount of men. I also wouldn't say sexism is the reason, there are female hashira.
Well yk, back then women weren't allowed to do much, and tbh I don't think most women -at that time- would withstand all the blood and death and the demons. I am not a sexist, please spare me
It’s the same reason shinobu couldn’t cut douma head. Not many women are as strong as mitsuri and can be on par strength with a demon.
The same reason. There are more men then women in the Military
Idk, ask biology
Coz Fake Feminism Always Ends during War
I guess that's true but it also depends on the training maybe? Like mitsuri, kanao, and Shinobu. There are other female corps members but they're with shinobu's healing/hospital part? But they are still considered part of the corps
Cause females are weak.  Shinobu is a hashira and can’t even cut a common demons neck 😂

Mitsuri is an exception cause she was born abnormally strong. Even so, she was the weakest link in the infinity arc
This is going to start world war 3 but i will say it again men are generally physically stronger than women
The answer is so simple, the author herself just doesn't want to have many female demon slayers😂
The demons in general mostly targeted women because many did not have combat or self defense training. Like a wolf picking off sheep.
Stay quiet or I’ll eat you also ✨

I love this idea 😭
Shinobu will stop it though
This answer is top notch
My dude is inhaling them
Or that women who aren’t as gifted as Shinobu and Mitsuri can’t compete in strength
it's really just physical strength difference, most males don't even pass final selection, so it must be even harder for girls
I wouldn't say that's why, there are female hashira. I don't think (or remember if;) Demon Slayer shows any sexism.
Fax
Oh yeah that’s good point
But women’s right and status in 1920s Japan was a MASSIVE improvement compared to Edo period.
Yeah that too, it’s clear that the men are generally just better for combat
Also women are naturally weaker than men.
There was one other female corps member

She was in episode 1 of season 2 (the anime-original one). She isn't credited anywhere; unamed and voice actor unknown. Or at least i can't find anything on her
Wonder what he'd think of zenitsu
>Obanai it said that he resented most female slayers since they had a "weaker mentality" or something

Obnai has a long history of some snake women torturing him or something so he started resenting women, if i am not wrong
Yes, they’d also have to be super trained and strong like mitsuri. But that was already a rare case
Nezuko punching the air rn
i honestly wouldn't even be surprised if this is canon
There was a female demon slayer in the Mugen train arc, she is seen with Rangoon at the (I dont know the name of the building so I'm taking a wild guess) train maintenance place

edit: it has been a month and I still didn't notice how I did rengoku dirty by making that typo
Aren’t the majority of slayers we see around 5.6/5.7?
They could've drawn women with muscles
Because it's a Shonen and the author probably didn't think too much about it.

It's like wondering why dbz is filled with dudes.

Anyone talking about biology or whatever are kinda just outing themselves lol 

This is a story about people doing super human feats by **breathing** fighting **demons**
Makes sense. Tbh I still can't get used to seeing Tanjiro so jacked when he has such a baby face 😅
Yeah i think so too, that’s the most logical of all answers here. It was also my initial thought when I watched it and wondered why. If they started drawing female characters they have to make all the males distinguishable aswell, which just costs time and money.
Happy cake day 🎉🎂
op already mentioned most of these, and in comparison to the male cast they /are/ quite few in numbers. + tengens wives arent demon slayers, theyre shinobi, and daki & nakime are demons 😭
Yeah am I a joke to you😤
He is inhaling all woman
We saw douma killing shinobus sister so it's probably safe to say douma ate all the strong girls
What about Mitsuri
Nezuko punching the air rn
Douma that you
No he inhaled them
The issue is that Mitsuri is even more physically abnormal. Im not sure she would have enough of a baseline to train normal women.
Don’t forget that the US military wouldn’t allow women in combat roles until 2015
Yeah, because it takes a penis and big muscle to pull the trigger on a gun /s
Baldjiro
Technically we have less muscle mass compared to men, if you want to be specific.

That being said, women’s muscles don’t tire as fast as men’s do. So what we lack in strength we make up for in endurance.
Idk why ur getting downvoted
Not only that, but demon slayers operate outside of society so whatever politics is going on outside of demon slaying doesn't really apply to them. So even if society is sexist, there's no reason for the demon slayers to follow suit. Plus Ubuyashiki doesn't seem like a particularly sexist person.
Don’t call Aoi a coward
Her disease isnt actually as fake as you’d think. Look up myostatin deficiency

I would definitely agree with you and I really had high hopes for Kanao....but I feel like her whole character development was just dependent on Tanjiro to give her agency to which she lacks. Hell, even in the 178.5 vol 20 extras in the manga,  she gets motivated by the mention of Tanjiro. 

I like her and she is a good character, she at least had a bit of potential and appreciate it that she isn't a plot device like Nezuko but it feels like she was just written to be Tanjiro's love interest and to me she still felt underdeveloped even after the events of the final arc. 😓 

At this point I might as well say that Ochaco from mha feels more fleshed out and better written than Kanao.
Doesn't really make sense since there are two female Hashiras and Ubuyashiki seems like the last person who'd be sexist.
I don’t really think sexism is why at all because there were female demon slayers I think it’s just they didn’t really want to or never considered it plus what girls do you know (other than one that love demon slayer) would even want to do this so I don’t think that’s the reason and it’s factual that men are genetically born stronger and have bigger lungs for breathing techniques so that also probably is some of the reason
Either that or it takes place in 1920s Japan when all women were basically locked inside to cook…
She went through Final Selection, but she mentions she was too scared to go on the front lines, so she went to the butterfly mansion.
Lol ! he manga had already ended and nothing like this happened
If I had to guess, prolly cuz they’re in Japan and the anime was dated in the Taisho Era which  was 1879–1926, so you can probably fill in the blanks from there
It’s prob a sexist thing
Because it's Japan.

Men also benefit from training (for fighting) a lot more than women as it's easier for men to build mass which is necessary to be slicing off demon heads. Just look at how shredded Tanjiro is at his age. Also another point, Shinobu. It just so happens she compensated for her lack of strength in other ways and Mitsuru is a biological anomaly.
Aren't they more nutritious for demons or something?
And the Red Light District pretty much had them as cattle
And it's the tasho era
When was this ever stated? There are only few demons who target women specifically (one of which likely enjoyed them more since they are more nutritional for demons) and then there are those who don't discriminate.
I honestly think many women just don't want to be warriors during that time.
Shinobu isn't gifted in strength, no offence to her but like she's the weakest hashira, no she isn't the weakest slayer, but in terms of physical strength, she's definitely top 10 there
Keep in mind Mitsuri also was aware of it. She asked if it was okay for a woman to be that strong as it was an unusual thing at the time
They’re probably being eaten by demons more than men so they don’t have the chance to become demon slayers anyway
to be fair, Shinobu cant compete in strength, thats why she has the scalpel katana
Basicly
yea, plus shinobu said she is weaker than most regular slayers, and she has to rely on her posions and such, while mitsuri has unnaturally dense muscles, which gives her massive strength vs her size.
Orrrr just like Mitsuri, the ones who acted or were built different were seen as weird and so they hid themselves. Stronger women might've been shunned like she was. Women who wanted to be stronger were probably also not treated well. Remember Daki didn't get treated respectfully because she was strong; it was because she was pretty and followed what the people around her expected of her. Nobody knew anything about her being not-normal as a demon. They just saw a pretty "young" lady.
Those female hashiras come from wealthy families. Not to mention, in Mitsuri's backstory, she was supposed to be married off to another wealthy family.
> I don't think (or remember if;) Demon Slayer shows any sexism.

Not intentionally but there definitely could stand to be more female characters, not just slayers. *side eyes the only female Upper Moon who can't even claim the spot for herself and shares it with her brother*
Reddit when biology, Lol and no one better bring up the female hashira Mitsuri has chimpanzee muscle density and Shinobu uses cyanide to kill demons. 

In genreal when it comes to military matters dudes loving running to death
Physically
İ mean irl this logoc works but in anime with superpowers just no
reddit moment
Why would you be so controversial yet so brave my guy
Oh yeah,there were also a couple in the background in the manga too. I meant as in named ones
Didn't Ozaki die in Season 1?

Edit: Plus when searching Ozaki she looks pretty different from that pic in S2, also the fact that she died in S1.
You just know he beat Zenitsu extra hard when he was training him.
Yeah, i think Obanai's issues with women go beyond just his distaste for ther mentality.
Or super smart like Shinobu
Touhou- Demon Slayer crossover when?
Ok but none during Hashira Training?
Yeah. Tallest ones that come to mind are Gyomei and Tengen.
That was tall for the 1920s
>Aren’t the majority of slayers we see around 5.6/5.7?

You need to understand it ain't Europe, men average around 5'7 to 5'8 worldwide and this story is set around the 1920 period in Japan, it's pretty realistic height for men during that era.
yes but it doesn't fit the author's style, who prefers to draw them curvy (slender with big boobs) and it will be too erotic to draw them half naked during hashira training
Mitsuri has abnormal strength due to the fact that she is a fictional character.


Edit: I believe that she is made this way to be “unlike” most Japanese women. In Japan, women often eat smaller portions than men and do not show their physical strength or are as “out there” as Mitsuri is. This is shown in her backstory when she colors her hair to “fit in.” I think the writer created her to be a role model for girls who are like Mitsuri and that even tho you are different you may still find friends and love :)
Isn't her entire story that she is different than Missy of the woman and she eventually became afraid to be herself and tried to act like she thought she should based on how other woman around her were
She has abnormal muscle(and/or bone, don’t remember perfectly) density.
She is a rare exception with physical strength of a sumo wrestler. Gotogue wrote her as being genetically abnormal (not that it’s a bad thing), which was further enforced by the reaction of her formal suitor (the guy everyone hates here).
I don't know about her lungs but she for sure keep them in huge containers
There's always an exception.
Legit answer: Individual exceptions exist obviously both real world and fictional world alike however don't expect an 'exceptional' woman to beat a man of her own weight class in reality.
😔😔😔😔😔
I was downvoted? Damn, some people really can’t accept biological facts uh
Yeah. Even ubuyashiki helps female demons (tamayo) .


Female humans are fine too
She pretty much admits herself that she is one though lol
I mean Mitsuri being an exception. She's literally built different
That is also something to take into account, but it is the explanation that seems most logical to me, perhaps it is simply that the majority of women do not enlist in the demon hunter corps because they are "doing women's things", but who knows, it's more of a theory than a statement
Oh, my bad
Whoa that's so crazy how the answer to that is so obvious. One could assume a special Samurai division had little females because actual samurai divisions had little to no females, but hey that may be a stretch.
Noooooo
I assumed Douma was just picking on Akaza with that line
Huh… I don’t recall that being disclosed in both the manga or anime.
I remember one of the early demons at least preferring women and getting a bit into nutrients/flavor before Tanjiro kinda had enough of it
I don’t think so, Douma is just a freak with it
I think it is more like personal taste like how some people prefer steak and some pork
Yes.
Women are also typically weaker too.
Same goes for men, not many people would want to soldier up to fight demons.
thats not an offense, thats just a fact about the character. She's a textbook example of work smarter not harder, though, with how she compensates with poisons
I agree since her sword was built in a way that she does require as much strength since shes weaker than than the rest but she is also very smart and agile .
Ik but i meant just every category that’s not built in on physical besides speed. She’s definitely top 3 or 4 in speed and she’s super smart. So she’s super helpful
She says this herself in the Spider arc so I don't think she would have considered it an insult
It’s a lot of reasons, which is why there’s a lot of female kakushi
Ik I meant that she also has other amazing attributes that make her capable enough to fight as a hashira. Especially that insane speed with her small body
Well daki isnt the only female upper moon. We just havent met the other in the anime yet.
yeah Daki was a joke. coming in the same arc as Tengen's 3 subservient wives with gigantic tits as well lol
I personally just think it’s silly to use that as an argument on a show where there are:
-demons
-people that…summon elements to fight
-a girl who is a demon but also changes her size when needed, can heal people with fire, and can go outside now
- a guy that was a train 

It’s like when people are like “erm ☝️🤓 there wouldn’t have been black people in this time period” but they can have wizards, dragons and shit lol. Why is a women’s strength where theyd draw the line on fantasy? I think it’s fine to just say “it’s 1920s Japan” lol
W
That's alright
She only stood out to me 'cause she had a line of dialogue (she also has some pretty eyes ngl 👀)
Ozaki did die
If you're talking about the corps member in image of my comment, they are different
Mitsuri should’ve had muscles imo 😭
What about bandages covering their chest. Or just a shirt like kanao? 
Bro Mitsuri and Tengen's wives have half their breasts out 24/7, they could've got away with ladies in chest wrappings haha
Hee hee😔
Nezuko is angy at you



NO CHOKY MILK FOR YOU
Well, we all know at the end of the day, the author probably forgot about it (or it isn't important enough to remember) since the series itself doesn't really try to make a statement of it.

The only other explanation I can think of is that they split the genders so they don't get distracted while training? And since we are following Tanjiro, we'd only see the males training.
No worries. It's a passing comment so some didn't catch it.
So then why does Douma eat women only
He said it in both the manga and anime. It seems like he might have been joking but who knows. [https://www.quora.com/In-Demon-Slayer-is-it-true-that-women-are-better-for-demons-than-men-If-so-why](https://www.quora.com/In-Demon-Slayer-is-it-true-that-women-are-better-for-demons-than-men-If-so-why)
My dude is the ultimate pervert
bros being downvoted for stating biology lol.

there's a reason wars were fought by almost entirely men in the past and it aint just sexism, men are built for hunting and fighting, that was their evolved role. The Demon Slayer Core is basically an army set in 1920s japan

Can women fight and contribute? Sure, slayers like Shinobu and Mitsuri show that, but of course there's gonna be more men when men are literally more built for combat
I am a feminist, but this is true. Women are biologically weaker than men. If people state Mitsuri and Shinobu, we all know that Mitsuri has an unusual strength since she was a toddler, and Shinobu is known for her lethal toxins and speed. I might get downvoted but it's a fact. My mom is a doctor and she too approves that women are biologically different than men, just as women have less testosterone than men.
Bro get downvoted for stateing fact.
If it's a female then it would be like female and male gymnastics. https://youtu.be/ndTpHrbF4tI?si=giAQde2MFIaL60ZC
People downvoting you are cave dwellers lmao. The keyword is “typically”. Some people needs to learn and go back to school i think.
Shinobu or mitsuri can come and gang bang you if you say that one more time
Women biologically are stronger then men 10x times, mentally and physically. So this comment makes no sense
But in a ratio, there are still a considerable number of men who would like to take up the job than women. The time setting of DS is in the early 1900s, women are not really expected and even educated to take on physical and combat roles that much. During this time, there is a high rate of stereotyping and such.
I don't really buy that Shinobi can't decapitate any demons. Her fight with Doma showed how she was able to destroy a bridge with her speed. It literally collapses. I think its just that she can't decapitate the higher tier demons in one swing and her blade is not meant for decapitating. But for the lower and weaker ones she definitely should be able to considering how much force is behind her speed blitz attacks. 
Kakushi are like the most underated people in demon slayer along with the weaker demon slayers that sacrificed themselves against muzan
No yeah, I'm not trying to short sell her. Just the joke was there, especially with Mitsuri there for the comparison
Wasn’t she though for basically the whole manga? Like before the started killing them off 1,2,3,4 and 5 were all dudes.
"Well actually the elements aren't real"-☝️🤓
Forreal tho, in anime, a skinny guy that happens to have some muscles on his bones can go through seven floors of concrete just fine, no one bats an eye but god forbid a woman ever does anything😭

https://i.redd.it/wwmjv6ponu5d1.gif
But the favt that irl women are strong af too, and theyre just misogynistic and egotistical. 😭
Yea,i honestly dont think theres a single slayer in the verse that doesnt look good😭 Even the background slayers look better then most isekai protags
Is the corps member in the image unnamed?
Fr tho! I hate the 'men get to be bulky but when women are they have mysterious muscle density and are still slim' like no!! She can be LEAN, but let my girl have the six pack she deserves!
definitely she shouldve
WHO WANTS TO SUMMON MICHAL JACKSON 
Yeah, I didn’t realise that she made it through final selection
Cause he's a creep.
Cuz they taste better
Douma eats both man and woman just mainly woman
Oh. That scene. The entire context revealed Douma trying to instigate poor Akaza’s after he had just been verbally/physically reprimanded by Muzan. And since Akaza is under Douma’s rank, it further justifies Douma exerting his power over him because Akaza can’t do anything to him. Notice how NONE of the Demons are friends and are often depicted working against each other.
Also, the sad fact was men were more expendable. Civilization (or just ecology in general) needs women to give birth and feed the children, but men have little use after they mate

I theorize this is also why female insects devour their partners after mating.
As a biology student who has also studied anthropology and archeology, this is a misconception. Men did not “evolve” to be hunters / warriors, and women did not “evolve” to be gatherers / healers / carers. These ideas originate from the highly biased viewpoints of scientists in the Victorian era, who often twisted their findings to match their worldviews in regards to the role of the female sex, not just in humans but in all species. The size dynamic of the egg and the sperm were used to reinforce pre-existing gender roles. In reality, while humans do display sexual dimorphism, where men have higher muscle mass on average than women, these dimorphisms predate organized human society, and thus gender roles have no impact on how they came about.

When did we decide to draw the line that these people can rearrange their own organs to avoid a fatal wound or slice spider monsters in the blink of an eye while asleep and that’s part of our suspension of disbelief, but then having more female demon slayers that break our normal biological conventions suddenly become TOO much of a fantasy?
I'm not entirely satisfied with that explanation. Yes, this is probably the author's explanation and biology is a factor. But this is a world where people regularly surpass human limitations while fighting monsters with a wide array of magical abilities. 

Plus we know that even people without these special powers or who don't have as much physical strength find work arounds; poison blades, guns, eating demons.

I think the original comment about 1920's Japan, specifically its gender norms (and out of universe modern ones) makes the most sense to me.
Exactly.
It's an anime.... biology is whatever the writer wants it to be. They could've created an entire clan of Mitsuri.
True, Demon Slayer is a biologically accurate show 👍 wouldn't want those pesky women ruining the realism!
Idk, bringing real world biology in a series where people perform supernatural feats by breathing really good is kinda silly to me XD
Yup. We must qualify this statement as women being biologically weaker physically but also endowed, biologically, with more resilience than men. Carrying a child to term, delivering it (especially during a time without anaesthesia) and nursing babies requires resilience. It is believed that estrogen plays a role. I’d say childbearing requires a good deal of strength that isn’t physical.
Fr.
💀
Least obvious bait.
This man (or woman most probably) right here is fishing 🎣 for replies and thought we wouldn't notice 😂
Oh I was agreeing, I was just adding on that you'd have to be a crazy person to want to fight these demons. Id be out of there the second the baby face spiders start crawling at me.
I forgot this crucial, hard hitting fact
Yeah like…these characters are leveling cities on a regular basis there is nothing realistic about it in the first place lmfao
Sadly, no. She isn't even credited. At least, i don't think so
Thiss, the only reason why she’s slim despite her muscle density is because of fan service. I love Mitsuri but she deserves better 😔
Nah I don’t think so, I mean yeah he is a creep, but I’m pretty sure it was mostly because of the fact women are more nutritious than men, that’s why Douma told Akaza the reason why he was stronger than him was because he consumed women, whereas Akaza only consumed men making him weaker as a demon than Douma (and to be fair, he’s a creep to men too)
They’re more nutritious
i agree
Pretty sure muzan actually told them not to work together because they always ended up fighting
I may not be an anthropology student, I'm only a human biology student, but I'd like to add to the conversation. I always find it sad when someone with an actual argument gets ignored. 


Sure these dimorphisms predate organized society, but so do a lot of things about humans. Just because a trait evolved before the modern human, it does not disprove the necessity of these traits or that there was a reason for it. We can infer that Homo erectus very likely had gender roles just by looking at the rest of the animal kingdom. There is an actual point to gender roles in the animal kingdom. 


I am sure you can agree humans are very very new on the evolution time line. Life has been evolving for millions of years before we arrived at modern animals. Many things evolved and were decided before we ever built the first sharp stick. Such as the females having the ability to bear young while the males don't. This was decided even before the Cambrian era. Our primate ancestors probably lived a life that selected for the traits we have today. 


Gender roles do exist in nature when looking at creatures more similar to us. Gender roles do exist in animals that take care of their young together. The easiest example are birds. Many of them have roles each parent plays. Also, I'd like to strike down the idea that gender roles are only when the man hunts and the woman cares for the young. Emperor penguins have the role of the man takes care of the egg while the woman hunts for food. The men have a specialized pouch that evolved before modern penguins for this purpose. In every animal where the mom and dad both take care of the young gender roles keep popping up over and over. 


Life is easier when everyone has a defined role. Evolution tends to select certain trait more than others. Such as the meme , everything keeps evolving into crabs. This can be seen all over the animal kingdom because some strategies are more viable than others. And one thing that continues to evolve are roles. I'm no longer talking about gender roles but just a role in general. In large herd animals you have soldiers, watchers, and leaders. In colony animals you have scouts, gathers, and mothers. For the naked mole rat only the dominant female gives birth. You can argue modern gender roles are a construct and I will agree. But roles in general especially when it comes to rearing young is present throughout the animal kingdom.

This is my biggest beef with fans of fantasy. They will be totally fine with all kinds of shenanigans and bullshit and magic but the second it comes to things like “this woman beat this man in combat!” they’re like “BUT BIOLOGY?!” 

Like bro you were fine with a dude surviving a fireball from a giant ass dragon by casting a giga shield drained from his bussy soul power core, but you’re mad bc some booby armor lady beat a dude in a swordfight? 

Sure, women are weaker and slower than men IRL. But if we are bending a million other laws of science in a fantasy show, why can’t we make women be equal/stronger sometimes? 

They need to just admit they’re sexist tbh.
To be fair, I think Inosuke's organ thing was a really stupid asspull lol, I couldn't believe that was actually the canon explanation for Inosuke surviving a stab through the heart.

And I think it just depends on whether these details contribute to your show in a positive way. If it was purely "There are more male slayers than female because men are more built for fighting", while that would make sense it'd be hella boring. But the show takes that and creates awesome characters like Shinobu who is one of the fastest Hashira but the also the only slayer in the show that kills demons in an alternative way that isn't decapitation/sun. She's also one of the smartest characters

It's also a known fact that females have a more flexible body than men, which is why female gymnastics is a lot more popular and there's way more women doing it. Mitsuri's whole thing is flexibility, then Kanae and Kanao's flower breathing feels like a style that takes advantage of their flexibility

Keeping biological conventions allowed for more interesting writing
No magic in demon slayer bro
Just breathing techniques that increase oxygen to muscles and giving heightened strength and endurance
The light works are for show
I agree on all but.demon slayers don't have magical abilities.The animations of breathing techniques was just added for us.They don't really summon water,fire,stone,mist.normal ds side character won't see a thing.and yes when the demon slayer mark awakened and transparent world the body temp goes high and the sword is converted into crimson red blade as mentioned in the story.and if cut with crimson red blade upper rank demon Take time to regenerate.


If any spelling mistake sorry😅😅😅
Yes. Each sex has it’s own strength and that is okay
Mental fortitude especially those who had issues with their pregnancy and have to be in the hospital multiple times a month but followed through. 

Or those who were told that they would die if they gave birth to the baby but still managed. 

It is respectable.
I don't know if that necessarily equates to alot of resilience outside of that purpose cause women's bodies are hard-coded for that very purpose, but could be... I dunno.
Ok man
Oh I see, sorry if I misunderstood your comment.
nah it's he's a creep. akaza was weaker because he's a demonlet
I would assume so because one of the first demons tanjiro fights says that only young women taste the best but demons like the drum dude (can't remember his name) was pretty clearly taking men women kids doesn't matter. 🤷‍♂️
No it's because akaza only eats men so he eats like less than 50% of what douma eats
Granted, he had a cult where he could get humans vs. Akaza, who needs to hunt for it.

I'm pretty sure he also eats dudes, too, just less often.

He just has a larger supply of victims. I think he was just fuckin with Akaza to make him get stronger (he's cutting off his supply of power)
Both.
Or was he too scared that they'd gang on him 😶
You’re confusing gender roles with life history strategy. Gender roles do not, evolutionarily, exist. Evolution does not have foresight.

Furthermore, so-called “gender roles” (aka differing life history strategies across sexes) in nature are nowhere near as rigid as humans like to think they are. That example you gave, about emperor penguins? *Both sexes engage in solitary parental care, and both engage in hunting to feed themselves and their young.* The only reason that the males tend to the egg over the dark winter is because the females have expended too much of their body mass creating the egg to survive. They return to feed first because they and the chick will both die otherwise.

In many species of fish and arthropods, multiple male “gender roles” exist; these are defined by differing reproductive strategies, and are typically recognized as different polyphenic morphs. Some of those morphs serve as adolescent forms of other morphs, the individual’s reproductive strategy / “gender role” changing as they mature. Sexual dimorphisms occur when the genes which control a trait in one sex are different from the genes that control that trait in the other sex. Polyphenism occurs when the genes which control a trait change depending on the organism’s environment. The dimorphism is evolved because different traits are favoured by different life strategies, not because they “fulfill a role.”

Sentinel behaviour, what you called the “watchers” of herding animals, is specifically a task which all members of the group must engage in equally. Any individual who slips out on their turn is liable to punishment by the group. Which animal serves as the “leader”, if there even is a decisive leader, is often the parent or grandparent of the other group members, and leads by some ratio of dominance and recognized life experience. And herding or pack-forming species do not have dedicated combatants, with the exception that juveniles are too small to fight. A behaviour or group dynamic may be evolved, but in these species who performs what “role” is almost entirely environmental, aka not evolved. Honey bees are eusocial insects, and they have different roles the colony needs to fill, but unlike the caste systems of ants, they differentiate roles based on individual age and the proportion of workers which meet those relative age categories. If all of the older workers are removed, the young workers will transition roles early. If the young workers are removed, the youngest of those who remain will revert. 

Yes, you are correct that human sexual dimorphism existed in our hominid ancestors before they reached the level of sapience by which we modern humans define ourselves, and that there was a reason for this dimorphism. Males and females persisted under differing evolutionary pressures. *But we do not know what these pressures were.* We weren’t there when our hominid ancestors first descended from the trees. As a student of human biology, surely you are aware of how fraught the field of human evolutionary history is. There is SO much bias to sort through in any historical data / studies because we humans have spend so long thinking we were the centre of the universe, that we were somehow separate from the rest of the animal kingdom, that we were the ultimate life form to which all other organisms aspired to become. *We are not.* Biology influences culture, but culture does not influence biology. The “gender roles” we humans have given ourselves are only marginally reflective of actual sexual dimorphism, and usually only the visible elements of it. What they are actually reflective of is the worldviews (and interests) of those who hold power over a society.

And honestly, I think you missed my point entirely; the person to whom I responded was quoting heavily biased ideals of biological essentialism to justify bigotry. He invoked the concept of directional evolution, which as I’ve stated above, does not exist. Nothing evolves “to become” anything; natural selection is a sieve, it simply selects out that which is not well adapted for the current environment. The “gender roles” he was citing, and I was disproving, we’re that males are universally dominant, competitive, and mate-seeking, and that females are demure, need coercing, and are choosy. This is not the case. Hyenas have a matriarchal hierarchy, where the most competitive females are on top, but even the lowest-ranking female still stands above even the highest ranking male. Many “monogamous” female songbirds will cheat on their mates. Nothing in the evolutionary sciences is absolute except for the fact that evolution selects for what produces the greatest reproductive fitness *right now,* and damn the future consequences.
That is not how that works. The average man has more muscle than the average woman, but the “average man” and “average woman” don’t exist. Muscle mass occurs on a spectrum, and many men are weaker than women of their own weight class.

Furthermore, how much muscle you have is only half of the question, when it comes to strength. Type of muscle fibres is also important. Are your muscles made up of more aerobic or anaerobic fibres? Aerobic fibres produce more force over less time. Anaerobic fibres produce less force over a longer time.

Finally, women have a higher average pain tolerance than men. I don’t know what could possibly be more important in a fight than not keeling over the moment someone kicks you in the nethers. So you can take your sexism and shove it.
But it's a canonical fact that there aren't much female demon slayers even if u/sexistguy blames it on biology if anyone were to be sexist it would be the author
The effects may only be for show, but saying the breathing "heightens" the strength is an absolute understatement. For example they fucking demolish buildings in the Tengen fight. There is definitely supernatural stuff going on, might as well call it magic
Then how do the light works interact with demons? If seen a few times where the light is what cuts demons instead of the blade
Yup. I don’t believe in either sex being better than the other too
Yes. Some studies show women have a different response to stress that enables us to withstand such activities.
👍
Nah, women actually are more nutritious for demons
Yeah but my point still stands because it was mentioned by him, it’s both
It's mentioned in volume 3 of the manga that muzan instructed the demons not to work together cause they would end up eating each other but that's a lie, and that it's only because he's scared they'd gang up on him and kill him. This is said by tamayo so you're right.
Only Demon who MAYBE has 0.0001% chance of wining is Upper Rank 1
They cant cuz of muzan Jackson's control over them
Om sorry I missed the point of biological essentialism I don't agree with that line of thought. But thank you for your reply, good day.
[deleted]
Look closely bro , its the sword

And please specify when that happened
It's kind of werid seeing full grown adults still fighting about gender like they're still in elementary school
That doesn’t make sense though Muzak could fight every upper and lower moon at the same time and be fine. Not only is he supremely strong and fast but he literally can control their biology since everything they are comes from him
Kokushibo has a much higher chance than that even by himself. It took the two strongest hashira, a demon eater, and Muichiro who is incredibly strong to defeat him and they barely won. Koku paired with Akaza and Douma have a very high chance of overwhelming Muzan.
Biological essentialism is scientifically incorrect and ALWAYS sexist, so no, nothing contradictory at all. You are the one who fails to understand biology beyond fourth grade.
I dunno if there’s an element of indoctrination
Anyone wish that he kept his long hair

Muzan managed to keep his composure when they first met and that’s when he only has his earrings. If Tanjiro kept his hair long too, well, I imagine he would freak out right there and then.
Long hair Tanjiro is the GOAT so yes
I said the same until I realised he won’t look like the goofy adorable boy we’d know, he’d look more adult like. I prefer his shorter hair
And give Muzan a panic attack when they first meet?

No because I'm hoping that some day >!We get to see an OVA for Demon Slayer with a grown up Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke, much like the Epilogue of UBW with Shirou and Rin in the Clock Tower.!<
Me he looked a lot like his dad
Muzan would shit his pants every time he saw Tanjiro
I do, Muzan on the other hand, doesn't.
Muzan is happy :3
I honestly like the long hair more but that might be biased because my hair kinda looks like that
I want him to look his age 😔
I love it when he ties like a little ponytail- it looked super cool.
https://preview.redd.it/wfogvwsk9ebd1.jpeg?width=189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87fa3422e4d72423a8deafd74edb5cedfebca590

He would start to look a lot more like Yoriichi, which I love.
Muzan Will never cure his PTSD
Better looks-wise, however less "goofy main character" energy.
I prefer the short hair ngl 💜
I think most if not all guys look better with long hair, real life/ anime all the same.
He looked so cool with long hair. It made me so sad when he cut it.
Me it looked awesome
As a kid in early 2000’s I didn’t know a man bun was an option and I was afraid of the pony tail so long flowing hair wasn’t an option….
Keep it short up until the hashira training arc just for when he fights Muzan
I definitely wish so. I’m a sucker for long hair 🐍
I wish Tanjirou had kept his hair long.
I like the short hair better but omg if he kept his long hair when he met Muzan, Muzan would have had a heart attack and I'm all for it (bc Tanjiro would look like Yoriichi)

It looks cool, but to be honest I like the shorter hair more.
Yesn’t?
No I really wish he hadn’t
It is rather cool.
Imagine if Muzan and >!Kokushibo!< thought tanjiro was yorichi ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6760)
Is that Monjiro or is it one of his ancestors?
Muzan would have shit himself, and freeze mid step... That would have been awesome to see thoughhh!
I 💕his long hair…
Unless he ties it back, nah
Ngl absolutely not
Muzan would shit bricks and straight up vanish out of existence
Id liked to have seen it get cut off in a fight, probably against Rui
I like long haired Tanjiro🌌
As a long hair, yes.
He would be way cooler but on the beggining of the show i didn't know if Tanjiro is male or female 💀
No
Long hair but in a high ponytail, Muzan will have a heart attack 🤣🤣🤣
Hell yeah I wish he’d kept it <3
I wish
Muzan would have shat himself and just would’ve disappeared for 100 years
author had to nerf that illegal rizz
every damn day. that was his peak design
Yeah I liked it
I like his short hair he looked like cavani at that point
Ima stand by it. I hate when MCs get long hair because usually it doesnt last long and they usually look 10x better with longer hair.
Literally!! I wish I had that hair
Long hair Tanjiro was so cool man
I do, he looked Cool
Yeah. He looks like that one sun breathing user and upper one
Yes! He has gorgeous hair. I’m so jealous of Yoriichi tbh
I miss the water kimono he used to rock
Muzan would be shitting himself
Then not even plot armor can save tanjiro from muzan
It’s def a look
I feel like him keeping the short hair fits him. He's shown to struggle with styling hair as seen when doing Nezuko's braids in SSV, so I'd imagine he sticks with the short hair for simplicity. I know this from experience, having longer hair was a nightmare to handle
He looks like Kokushibo with his long hair.
No
HE'D LOOK SO ADORABLE WITH LONG HAIR IM SO PISSED THEY CUT IT OFF
Definitely but it would’ve done Muzan no good thus they decided to remove it..
I forgot he had long hair.
I wish he often switched to his final selection uniform. It was so sober and good to look at.
![gif](giphy|hU0xtUMnXSrHa)
No
Just looking like yoricchi
He looks so handsome with his hair down , no homo
He should’ve kept it long and tied it up to look like Yoriichi so he could give Muzan a heart attack
He'd definitely look more like his father and Yoriichi.
Chadjiro
idk if i wish he kept it but it certainly should have come back at some point. he had it for all of 2 seconds in the series 😭
No, he'd be bootleg Yoriichi.
All the time
Imo he looked so much better with long hair
Honestly. Me with every male anime character who we see long hair on. 
Tanjiro, Ichigo,etc (there’s probably more tbh)
It does look good on him
Yes
He looked like a rock star before
No
Ngl I kinda hated this look when I was watching it originally
**inserts muzan ptsd meme**
Yessss
Why did I think this was some anime girl
Right here 👋 I wish he had kept the longer hair, I even remember telling my wife exactly that the first time we went through the series.
We all do
Muzan would have shat his pants
I wish he did. Tanjiro looked so good
True!
HE COULD'VE BEEN A MINI YORICHII(IDC IF I DIDN'T SPELL THAT RIGHT) IM SO MAD☹️☹️☹️☹️
Saw a meme that said if he kept it when he met muzan he would have had 5, 7 heart attacks or whatever number of hearts he has and i thought it was funny
Who ever approved his short hair count your days, he could have been such a thirst trap
Yes but only because the idea of Muzan having five simultaneous heart attacks makes me laugh so hard, I cry!
Before watching the show I saw pictures of tanjiro with his long hair and I honestly assumed he was a girl
Yeah I do
Muzan when he sees Tanjiro.

![gif](giphy|kVmzd3RxKqaT5Rm16e|downsized)
You should really ask if anyone didn’t want the long hair
I’ve always wished this
Obviously yes, he looks amazing 
Muzan will be like :

![gif](giphy|12RfP2odT4hEOI)
Absolutly
That's not Tanjiro, that's Yoriichi, and you can't convince me otherwise.
Tanjiro just doesn’t look right with his hair long but muzan would be out of shit at infinity castle
I do, but I also like how his short hair doesn't look TOO short. Really gave me notice when he unlocked his mark and his hair just started to flair out a bit
No because it will give anyone the idea how lazy they are for designing their characters. They all look the same
Muzan would die in PTSD

![gif](giphy|Y3q6PGa2wZzXCQ6ZR5)
Yes! I love Tanjiro but I was always upset that he cut it when the only reason it was short before was because it was cut in the fight with Giyuu. He kept long hair before everything.
I completely forgot that he even had long hair to begin with
I wish he kept his hair from the very beginning. The longer ponytail/bun thing looked great on him and made him look a little less childish without detracting from his kind look
Yes me
Muzan would shit his pants on spot
He looks sick like that honestly idk why the author made him cut it
Cute tanjiro
Yeah no, that look went hard.
Daddy tanjiro 😂👀
Nah
absolutely
Same
After final selection he should have kept it long cause all the demons would have been in shock from l seeing him
mmh hes a cutie but wouldve been the death of the animators probably lol, hes still pretty with short hair so im not too mad
Honestly loved the long hair. I very much wish he’d have kept it.
muzans gonna think its young yoriichi imaoo
As I was rewatching the Demon Slayer, I wished he would have kept this hair style! Damn it suits him and may be in the long run he will look like his father!
If kokushibo or muzan saw him with long hair, the mark AND the earrings the fight would’ve been over hahahaha
I much preferred it.
You can’t have him looking to cool
Despite anime logic, having long hair in combat is a safety issue.

Think about it, you're in the middle of a life-or-death sword fight with a freaking man-eating monster. Then, during a crucial moment, your beautiful long hair, which is wet with sweat, gets plastered across your eyes.

Do you think the demon will wait for you to clear the hair from your eyes? That's 1 of the reasons soldiers(except for special ops) have to keep their hair short.

In anime, hair tends to stay exactly where the artist puts it, which is cool but dumb.(I'm looking at you, Toriyama, RIP)
Yeah he looked more like yorichii this way
https://preview.redd.it/xr7kbq2dikbd1.jpeg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8a0d3312f7db892bdf225e8af64550a52bcd134

Muzan POV if he saw long hair Tanjiro:
Yep I loved it so much it's the only thing that kept my brain cells moving
ohhh boy the fight in entertainment district with this long hair of his woulda shown us the closest thing to a yoriichi fight scene.
If he had: Muzan would’ve lost his s***! No lie: that would’ve been amazing to see, but what can you do?
If he did, he'd put Michael back in the grave.
He’s sooooo cute w long hair!
I miss his ponytail 😞
Nah
i love this thread, people referring to muzan as muzan jackson always makes me chuckle
Muzan and Kokushibo would surely have ptsd cuz he looks like his ancestor named Tatsuya Kamado (Sumiyoshi's cousin who's a demon slayer in the Sengoku era).

https://preview.redd.it/kf2do8ok1mbd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd699630b1866a32e2f1d86c14c96038513d4405
yes its cute!
Yes
YES
He should have it would make Muzan Jackson shit himself also it looks so cool

no

it doesnt fit him plus its shaggy and unwashed he look like a hobo with all that hair
Muzan has enough pstd as is rn let himmm  beeeeeee 😭😭😭😭😭
Michael Jackson might have sharted his pants from seing him 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Goddamn that boy looks fine in long hair. 😍
I have never seen this look of tanjiro's I will cherish it forever
I actually kinda do. I think his haircut now is a Lil awkward but he's a kid so I guess that's why. I'm sure in the end he'll grow it out
Yeah we wont his old hair back😭
Yes
*here
Series ends due to Muzan Jackson having intense PTSD from seeing Tanjiro with long hair the first time. He forgets to take shelter from the sun and dies (he is in shock until sunrise)
That's why I wished he kept it
Well alot of heart attacks, I kinda forgor how many hearts he has
Heart attack(s), he has many hearts.

Makes me wonder, can demons die from heart attacks? Like, what if all his hearts just stopped working and he just like, died
which heart? /s
Status: Muzan retired due to trauma
For real😂
He would be like: Yoreeheechi
More like hearts attack
imagine Tanjiro in a ponytail
Such a missed opportunity on the writers part. Imagine >!UM1 seeing his brother's earrings AND breathing style...he'd have a heartache!<
>!Doesn’t Kokushibo still have long hair?!<
He would probably goes into hiding and never comes out like the scared pussy he is.
RIGHT ANSWER.
Wrong answer
That's why I think it'd be cool if he got it around the start of the upcoming movies.
Agreed
I thought Tanjiro didn’t live very long?
We kinda got that with the special goodbye's chapter along with an update on all the survivors
are you anime only? if so, this question makes more sense.
I thought he fit 16-17 pretty well, saying he looks any older than 19 is stretching
I love how the viewers as a collective decided to call him Muzan Jackson 🤣
Bro wtf I hope you aren’t right, you just like SPOILED the fuck out of this anime if what you said is true
spoiler much???
9 I think. And 5 brains.
What’s regeneration gonna do if their blood just stops? Blood demon art could work, but they’d have to physically move blood around their body.
From the shock? Probs all. Even more
He would also have the same demon mark to lol.
But we had to get closure with akaza tho, also at least we get mui with koku.
Oh he would absolutely go berzerk and end the series right there tbh
Yes, but the point is that if a long-haired, flame-marked, Sun Breathing swordsman were to cross their paths, either of them would lose their shit.
Nuh uh!
this sub glazes so hard its not even funny. 41 downvotes for not liking a haircut is crazy
The upcoming movies and end of the series all take place within the same night as the season finale if I recall correctly.
That would be hilarious if he just grew hair for a single night
Well Tanjiro age at EOS is >!16 years old in Chapter 204, and all Mark users live until 25 (with the exception of Yorichi who lived until 80)!< So I'd say we have plenty of chances to see a Grown up Tanjiro if Ufo/Gotouge ever wanted to make it a reality.
I mean, he is kinda of a smooth criminal
He basically is Muzan Jackson.
No fortunately it's not what happens XD
>!That's not what happens!<
It isn’t good but isn’t this sub more geared towards manga readers?
dang, that's just wow
7
How come he has 5 brains but only has about 2 or more likely 1 brain cell?
Lol yup
>!he'd speedblitz him just like he did gyomei when he mentioned his brother!<
Oh whoops I misread, I thought scout was saying they didn’t want muzan or >!koku!< to keep their long hair
Same earings too
Yuh-huh. Long hair Tanjiro is just Kokushibo with half the steps.
\-55 in 7h ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip)
real
Sounds right. I just mean maybe by the final episode he'd have the long hair again, kind of showing how serious he's going to be.
Smooth
Mfw anime onlys
im reading n watching demon slayer at the same time
Koyoharu Gotouge was high off fent 80% of the time writing this series.. I still love it to death tho dw. Demon Slayer is one my favorite anime/manga, as I do find the plot, characters, and stories to be very fun and inticing.
Roasted him harder than Yoriichi
Nuh uh! He looks so much better than short hair though!
If we're not including the >!timeskip!<, the whole thing will be over once >!the sun rises!<
That's my point.
Oh
This show's humor doesn’t get talked about enough. What is the funniest gag in the series in your opinion?
For me, it’s definitely Gyokko getting mad at Haganezuka for completely ignoring him.

Muichiro roasting Gyokko. Like the sass from this twelve year boy was out of nowhere.
This show is so freaking funny! But I’m going to limit myself to one scene:

Inosuke’s face reveal. Especially this exchange:

Tanjiro: There’s nothing wrong with your face! In fact the feminine size, shape and complexion are quite attractive!” (Or something like that.)

Inosuke: “You’re a dead man!”
Haganezuka revving up like a chainsaw cannot be beat. That shit is too funny.
Love when the *demons* get confused when a human does something weird
Any time the characters go:

That they included the dumbfounded face from Tengens wife 🤣
*
https://i.redd.it/62nteafcujfd1.gif

Haganezuka always poking Tanjiro's cheeks
The main trio's first interaction with Tengen. The "I am god, you three are trash" scene. The exchanges b/w them was still funny to me.
Is there a lore reason that Haganezuka escaped the Aslume?
giyuu thinking SURELY tanjiro won't just barge into his residence
https://preview.redd.it/g8i5nmemdlfd1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80e03a4ff3340050044c7df278f9a36c459fbd9f

This is my favorite bit from the whole thang
For me it's like a inspiring scene as it shows the level of determination and dedication he has towards making the sword.
When Zenitsu climbs away from the hashira training like a lizard
https://preview.redd.it/xn5zwo2qzjfd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e5a4d78b4d004a453cd3269feff64ea0563caab

The wrong subtitles made it funnier
My favorite running gag is when tanjiro breaks his sword and haganezuka tries to kill him lol
The first time something got me was when inosuke was chasing the spider sister and she yells out “dad!” And hes all “who the hell u calling dad??”
When zenitsu gets struck by lightning
When the three of them first see the train 😂
Tanjiro saying he refuses to acknowledge Tengen as a hashira after they got into an argument.
Literally Gyokko:

https://preview.redd.it/7mdyke0usjfd1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=050f8100307195645d81b08e50d950441a6e48c6
Obanai out of all people being petty over Tanjiro being friends with his crush. 

He was the most unexpected person out of all the hashiras to be so petty like that 😂
In the same fight Muichiro reminding us he's a teenager and being just an absolute Brat mocking him during the 2nd half of their fight.
Inosuke being like 1 for 7 on getting someone's name right
For me it will always be how Tanjiro appears before Tomioka with bubble eyes
When tanjiro showed the scar face guy his tooth. That made me crack up
More recently, I love when Tanjiro invited himself into Giyu's abode and Giyu said something like, "I must be mistaken, he must've said he was leaving"
Surprisingly, I find Giyuu to be the funniest person in the whole show….not because he’s a funny guy but his total lack of social awareness caused so many funny lines and jokes

. “I’m not hated by others”

. Calling Inosuke stupid and tying him up

. Trying to ignore Tanjiro

. Asking Sanemi if he likes Ohagi
Inosuke on the ceiling.. those screams man, those screams fit a horror movie.
The first few episodes of the Entertainment District arc are hilarious. When Zenitsu is rage shamisen-ing and when Inosuke is told to keep his trap shut because his voice is way too husky.
when inosuke challenges giyuu to a fight and he just casually strings him up
Every single thing inoskue says
The disgusted look Tanjiro gives boar boy
The comedy routine between gyokko and muichiro along with hagenezuka and that other masked guy don’t remember his name but the whole routine of arguing and gyokko getting mad was so funny

THIS MANGA PANEL THAT DIDNT MAKE IT INTO THE ANIME
anything with Inosuke
Personally I like Tengen giving Zenitsu away
Maybe I am misrembering, but when Genya and Tsnjiro met for the second time Tanjiro was all friendly and Genya reminded Tanjiro that he freaking broke his arm!
https://preview.redd.it/s38h7gy0fofd1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93cb8de973d1f2f050e16d4fdb179beea63fca24

Every time Haganezuka-san tries to straight up murd€r Tanjiro for breaking his precious Nichirin swords😆
I love Zenitsu's non-stop screaming. So hilarious. Just screaming in every scene. What comedy genius...
Love anything inouskes in cause he’s funny
Kamaboko gonpachiro supremacy
Almost everything that has to do with Inoske doing/saying stuff and Tanjiro not reacting to it
Inosuke’s dream

On the contrary, the Inosuke saying tanjiro’s name and donut jokes are mentioned far too much
Man, I'm still bummed out that Gyokko got no backstory fleshed out, but Hantengu did lol 😭
I think it’s really funny when Tamjiro and Zen is going to Gyomeis training. First they see Inos and other below the waterfall praying and then Gyomeis shows up behind them, in fire while crying 😂
When Sanemi karate chopped Zenitsu when he tried to ditch his training lmao
When they sort of break the fourth wall and Tanjiro asks rengoku “when did you become so huge???” 😭
Muichiro sass 🌫
Why is Haganezuka ignoring him? Is he stupid?
Mans more demon than the demon in front of him 😭
Inosuke-worm was definetely peak
Nezuko that call Zenitsu with Lord Inosuke name :3
Haganezuka poking Tanjiro and trying to kill him.
*says the man with mouths for eyes*
Isn't a villian's mouth is eye, eyes are mouths, and shooting fish and tentacles to attack already a joke?
The drowning namu amida butsu
IKR?!?! Even the comedic timing in the shift between manga panels is perfect!

Zenitsu freaking the fuck out.

I normally find anime screaming cringe or needless but him… he makes it work.
It’s always when Zenitsu is being the voice of reality in their trio.

Also the Natagumo scenes with him and the spider demon brother. It was noisy as hell but it made me roll over in laughter.
Why is man not sane,is he stupid?

![gif](giphy|qrIlvM63x7x9IjrHw1|downsized)
whenever Zenitsu fights while asleep
By far:

"Let's eat this thing."
Not exactly in the series but based on it. It’s called Tanjro, the Rizz Hashira 😆😂
Nah he’s hot


Zenitsu getting called Inosuke by Nezuko

Tengen roasting Daki

Inosuke watching Tanjiro from the ceiling

Inosuke's "Who cares about your name" after nearly getting Tanjiro's name right
Tanjiro's and Kyojuro's nasty looks plus the amount of time Muichiro needs to swap his whole personality

The disgust on TKs face from zenitsu’s domain expansion called infinite simping
Haganezuka always pissed at tanjiro for breaking and losing his sword
That scene during Mugen Train when Tanjiro tells Inosuke that the demon is the train and Inosuke is just like: “…..I KNEW IT”
Is there a lore reason why he's ignoring Gyokko?

The hashira geiko hen was the funniest imo. Especially muichiro's scenes and obanais jealousy
Why does it look like he's grabbing  onto a big red "rocket"?🤣
Lol 🦋
Oh hey it’s an r/batmanarkham reference in demon slayer
All of the Kakushi Gotou's monologues.
Same for me, and I also find Muichiro roasting Gyokko hilarious 🌌
the eyes bulging out their heads
It's between Haganezuka trying to kill Tanjiro and Muichiro trash talking Gyokko
Arkham Reddit PTSD intensifies
my favorite gag is definitely whenever people would see inosukes face for the first time
Every inosuke scene
r/batmanarkham would like to have a word
Zenitsu fighting the spider demon and the way the demon says he’s gonna fall on his head and die
each time the kakushi are either sassy, sarcastic or freaking tf out get me
When Tanjiro straight up died but he was so dizzy he fell in the river and found the shiny life rock.
For me it’s Chachamaru every time they disappear with a single “meow” that fades (I have video of me cackling over that clip in the last episode of the swordsmith village arc except it’s on my old phone and I don’t feel like retrieving that clip atm🤦‍♀️), as well as Gyomei hiding behind the tree saying “Namu.” After Genya mentions something about Gyomei saying “Namu”
“Nenbutsu, nenbutsu, nenbutsu, nenbutsuuu.” and when Zenitsu was slowly falling into the waterfall. Idk the Hashira Training was so much funnier than the rest if the series.
r/BatmanArkham reference
We loved this scene, my wife is known for her hyperfocusing.

I often joke the world could be ending around us for an entire 10 minutes while shes engrossed in her work before she even notices and she usually replies that I'm giving her too much credit in the first place, that she probably wouldnt notice at all lol.
Genya's tooth
A lot of people hate zenitsu but I thought he was hilarious in season 1 lmaooo
I literally didn’t expect Zenitsu and Inosuke to be that funny💀
Why didn't he stop sharpening that sword? Is he stupid?
I love Gyokko so much 😂 Look at his widdle hands 🥺
Giyu San
Giyu San 

GIYU SANNNNN
He's correct. He is not sane, seeing how he goes after Tanjiro when the sword breaks or chips.

Almost everything involving the Kamaboko squad, the "GIYUUUUUU SAAAAN!" with Giyu getting soooo done with like, Zenitsu when he first saw Inosuke and was like "BAKEMONO SOOO!!" and his eyes were out and his mouth was hella big! Inosuke choosing violence when waking up, Uzui yelling at inosuke to the point that he got intimidated, Giyu and Inosuke when they interacter, Zenitsu getting angry that the demon Tanjiro was carrying was actually a pretty girl and came to the conclusion that he was in cloud 9 with her when irl she's his sister Nezuko, etc etc etc omy i couldve added more!

And EVERYTHING HAGANEZUKA LIKE THIS MAN IS HILARIOUS! (i guess he's ND)

And the way Kotetsu interacts with Haganezuka lol especially when Muichiro fainted and Kotetsu was like "WAAAAA! HAGANEZUKA-SAN KILLED A HASHIRA!" I also love how Tanjiro is like "Haganezuka-san!" whenever Haganezuka loses his shit and is about to chase him omgomgomg!!!
Daki >>> gyokko
i love this show but the humor lowkey sucks
Someone must have asked for more humor so they made the training Arc a fucking joke
It's not funny.

This scene is one of my favourites of Mui
What did tokito mean here by saying you look familiar
Moments before disaster
Which episode is this from?
This scene was too cute. I leaves me cooing at Nezuko, at the end.
this was peak cinema
This and him bursting through the window are the funniest Inosuke bits
![gif](giphy|R3tHUypTIfmFi|downsized)
I think the funniest thing is when Inosuke said "good for you for noticing Gonpachiro!". Then Tanjiro said, "of course, I was lying on my back" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sometimes I just rewatch this scene and cackle

He's literally me fr
The screams man.. any one hearing that from another room would think you're watching a horror movie
This shit will always get me. Like I will never not find it funny.
Now this was the only funny scene. I can't get over why he's up there.
This scene was so funny
This is the manga panel of all time 🩷💚
Aoi in that lower panel: "I'd tap that."
I laugh every time I see this scene
And then inosuke being confused how he was spotted and tanjiro saying “well I am lying down” I love it 🤣
Goto be like

This lives rent free in my brain
This was hilarious.
GONPACHIRO
Kamaboko
Fr Itadaki Tontaro always sends me😭
And Zenitsu with the "Monitsu"
Alright Kanpanchiro Kamapoko! I'm gonna find your weak spot and bring you DOWN!
Non-ironically I always feel like watching it all again to catch those moments bc that shit is funny af
He could probably say "GAZPACHO" from 70 feet away and Tanjiro would still respond 😭
KENTARO!!!
Always been the funniest to me😂😂in the entertainment district I had to pause n figure out who he was talking about
Those are the best parts of KNY

Fun fact the name "Kamaboko squad" comes from Inosuke calling Tanjiro "GONPACHIRO KAMABOKO"
KENTAROOOOOOO!
I can hear this picture
I bet Shinobu would laugh if she saw Tanjirou pretty much stalking Giyuu.
Too bad for Giyu , restrain orders weren't invented yet
r/screenshotsarehard
giyu was truly fighting for his sanity in this episode 💀
He's so pissed but it's so funny!
Female Zenitus almost spanking Nezuko makes it even funnier
I love the tiny rocks just bouncing off his face when he was "dying"
I may be mistaken but I read somewhere that the direct translation for Zenitsu here was along the lines of "WHERE IS THAT PIG?!" rather than "That Guy" which is hilarious imo
Zenitsu here transformed into the average JoJo character
https://preview.redd.it/9xjbv6jbilfd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec28bb93f4180c1c6bfc7e491fdf1b59b4730a3a

He's my favorite only because of stuff like this
That shit sent me💀
That moment was Gold🤣
Zenitsu looks more demonic than any of the demons shown in KNY 🤣🤣
Bro turned into Thunder Sanemi for a moment
The average jealous BF be like:
He’s 14, he must’ve activated some of that broody teenager energy. Plus having abs like that when you’re 14 is crazy enough, but 12?
Yessssss! This is my favorite part!
I keep seeing that manga panel where he is flicking his tongue or something with his saliva lmao is that for this arc? If yes, too bad that wasnt animated
Overrated scene
Yas lmfao
Honestly that’s one thing I think the manga does better at than the anime, as the facial reactions are just absolutely insane. For examples look at other comments on this post
i love the fact that they do it to everyone, even the serious characters 😭

Immediately goes to a river to break em up.
Ok maybe Inosuke is the only funny one. He's literally the only good demon slayer.
Bad bot
In this scene there’s a little pile of origami next to him implying he was sitting there waiting for them to wake up while playing w origami
Tanjiro has the same eyes as his father. He noticed the resemblance but couldn’t place it.
It’s somewhere in the Swordsmith Village arc.

Maybe episode 2 or 3(?)

Thank you for this reminder I just had to stifle a laugh so I didn’t disturb my sleeping husband 😂
That double replay sent me😂💀
I feel like Inosuke's presence itself can make a scene funny. He is the perfect combination of being funny with his bravado while being a badass because he can actually back it up with his skill.
MANJURO!
The most iconic, gonpachiro.
“Giyuu-san~”

“Giyuu-san!”

“Giyuu-sannn~”
But Sanemi had a restraining order on tanjiro, didn’t they say that
Oh I knew how to screenshot I just don’t have Crunchyroll mega fan so it blacks screenshot so I took the picture on my smart watch- sorry for the quality.

No, Tokito had met them but his memory is horrible.
Tokito is such an underrated character, absolute unit
Thank you!

Holy shit there was just smt like this on another post in this sub and it was like 14 comments long
Not exactly a restraining order more just that they werent allowed near each other neither of them had a restraining order on the other

Don’t even get me started lmfao
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Fun fact:I read the wrong subs even more wrong...i read it as "What the hell happened TO ME?" And that was even more hilarious..just Tanjiro getting beat up by Inosuke but it's like he can't see Inosuke or something lol
Dude… 😭😭

I like how this scene put into perspective that most of slayers are just kids after all
Think about it for a minute, isn't just Tanjiro (15s) and Muichiro (14s) but the large majority of low rank slayers we seen in the show seem to be around 16s at best.

 And yet they have the duty of fight against a menace that most of humanity isn't aware of, fighting in the shadows and most of them die in the process.
 
 I'm appreciate the simplicity and beauty of the original scenes of the anime where Tanjiro and Co can enjoy for a brief moment the happiness of being the kids they're.

  It really was a genious move from Ufotable for make us root even for the unnamed characters.

I like how they worked in canon info from the databook into the anime. Muichiro’s favorite pastime is origami.
Oh yeah, it's kinda fucked but the average slayer starts around 15 and dies before 18. Unsaid details of the world.
I'd like to think that alone is just one factor as to why Gyomei is the strongest hashira. He's more wise, practiced, and experienced than the rest of the slayers, and he generally has had a longer time to hone his physique and skills. I was thinking that most demon slayers don't make it to adulthood, and only a small percentage of them make it to hashira level.

Muichiro is the youngest hashira ever and became one incredibly fast, so he isn't as experienced due to that. His body isn't even fully developed yet. He is a literal child and already has incredible power, and we saw him have immense growth when he solo'd Gyokko. >!Imagine if he lived to see Gyomei's age. If it wasn't for him getting literally eviscerated by UM 1, then his mark would have killed him anyway. Iirc, anyone who has a mark dies young. Sanemi most likely would be Gyomei's level once he has a few more years on him. And if Gyomei didn't die during IF, then he'd be a retired master, which brings me to my last point!!< 

We have an even smaller percentage of hashira that are fortunate enough to stay alive, retire and make it to old age, and become teachers and masters, like Urokodaki. Despite all the numbers and odds being stacked against them over the years, the DS Corps has never been eradicated. Ubuyashiki wasn't lying when he said they are eternal. In a perfect world, a larger percentage of slayers would make it to hashira level and have longer life expectancy if large-scale, organized training regiments were more feasible.
this is part of my reasoning of why i dont like the final selection, in this case if most active slayers are still children/teens imagine the age of all of those who die in the mountain in vain without even being officialy part of the corps
Agreed. That’s the way I felt when watching this scene. 🔥
exactly this. but unfortunately, all ive seen r ppl complaining about this scene without even trying to understand it.
I agree. This is also a bit sad too. They have to go through so much so young 😭
you can really tell that the people who don't like this scene are only watching for the action. i loved this scene, they got to be kids again. they're not fighting for their life, they're just having fun.
I really liked that whole arc because of the stuff like this. They really are just kids after all, orphans at that too.
I feel as though Murata should've been here. Haven't gotten to this scene yet, but it would've been nice to see him happy and relaxed
Tokito is so cool
That’s what happened when you deal with a violent vicious enemy who wants nothing more than your blood. 
Look at Hamas, if you look closely at the resistance videos the majority of them are kids, early 20s and less, Abu Obaida, the spokesman, I don’t think he’s older than 25. we got the superpowers of our world launched a fall out killing campaign on every person on that land, and yet they still losing to kids. 
Different worlds bro, a 12 yo gazan kid is more of a man than 30 yo average American, you can even take it in reverse, 30 yo gazan man is purer in heart and mind than a 12 yo American.
fr i loved this scene so much
kids fighting demons
what adults doing 💭 🤔
Child soldiers.

From what I can find, the minimum age during the Taisho period was 16. It's tragic that these kids are being sent to die.
Isn’t Tokito literally 14?
Ye, sadly it is brutal reality :3
This scene reminds me of The Wind Rises final scene. Planes fly away without returning.
To quote TFS Perfect Cell, “with hair like that I bet you’ve never lost a game of spot the protag”
Even their leader is only 23. Young adult 😭😭😭
One of the saddest and most beautiful scenes of this series. Really reminding us the courage & youthfulness becoming a demon slayer takes, and the youthfulness usually stolen. A perfect scene of duality. Fuckin stunning.
Btw, this scene represents them all going to heaven...
How old is tanjiro in this season ?
I agree, I loved this scene 🌸
I cried watching this scene.
Bravo Vince
Yeah, I forget how young they are, and they all call Gyomei "old man" and he's only like 27

this post helped me remember that Muichiro is only 14 years old
fr, many of them are no older then me Mui literally being my age, I'm glad they can all act their age in their freetimes because this scene made me so happy to see Muichiro just be a kid for even just a second
Most of them only came to the corps because they had nothing else left. It’s a little sad🐍
I honestly feel like Tanjiro is at least 17!!
I always thought they were mid twenties
Even the Hashiras are younguns
Do you wanna build an airplane?
Yeah it’s crap when you have to remember that the main cast is 15 and I think 16(?) I can the wrong.
Then muichiro is 14 and a hashira 😭 most of the hashira are also pretty young and only in there mid or early 20s.
They're just babies, they deserve to live a long happy life 😭
Child soldiers
Honestly, I found this scene really corny lol. The entire episode was pretty much just filler as well.

It also showed the low-rank demon slayers being absolutely terrified of Muichiro for no reason when he was simply trying to train them. They were all shaking in their boots just at the sight of him and it really doesn’t make sense. They were acting like they’d never even held a sword before - or that Muichiro was trying to kill them. It was baffling to watch and did them a disservice by making them look pathetic.
I mean . . . It's messed up but that's how Shonen goes. As an MC you usually reach peak power by the time you turn 17 after saving the world or doing some super significant thing. Most MCs are like 15 to 16 to start with.
Muichiro being 14 is such a slap in the face to Tanjiro's progress and Tanjiro already makes most of the corps look like babies.
no they're not 16. they're around Giyuu's age. as Murata represents the average demon slayer. at least that's what i like to think so.
Or even less in some cases. Sabito, Giyuu and Murata started at 13, Makomo while doesn't have a canon age looks even younger than them probably like 11 if we are generous.
They're like the scouts in attack on titan
>I like to think that is a big factor as to why Gyomei is the strongest hashira. He's more wise, practiced, and experienced than the rest of the slayers, and he generally has had a longer time to hone his physique and skills. I was thinking that most demon slayers don't make it to adulthood, and only a small percentage of them make it to hashira level.

 I think most of the reasoning behind this ultimately lies in natural talent.

 And I'm with Shinjuro here, but a sad reality of the DS universe is that despite you can put all the effort to improve yourserf, the harsh reality is that not everyone have the potential to reach the same level if they didn't born with the talent. The other slayers who trained with Gyomei for example give up because they couldn't succed where Tanjiro could.

 In that regard I think DS is one of the few shonens that have such a crude message of only people who born with talent can go so far, and while hard work is requiered it doesn't mean you can catch up with a prodigy just because you put effort on it.
I think they train them young to make sure someone is able to become a Hashira, and to also make sure someone is there to pass down the breathing style. 

Most of them are children, but given the fact the Hashira have a very high chance of dying in the field fighting, the only option is to train the kids young to a point where they can become Tsuguko or Hashira quickly if one dies.
Dude this is an anime discussion - spoiler tag for people who haven't read the manga like us, you're ruining important moments of the final arcs xD
Sabito's death still hurts, he could have been a hashira for sure.
Yes. I really don't like the part of the final selection to which some were able to get through because of sheer luck. I mean, I am sure there are a lot of youngsters who died in the final selection can reach at least near hashira level if they are still given more time. If some passed the FS because of some luck, some talented DS-in-trainee died during the FS because of bad luck.
Well i wish the final selection was more supervised, like take them out if they arent ready. Sure they wont beat any other demon if they cant beat those ones but why let children die?
The final selection is genuniely a stick in the ass of the series worldbuilding
For real. They need a much better way
I don’t get why they’d even allow people to die in final selection. It seems like such a useless waste of the corps’ likely limited manpower. It takes years to train them, and you’ll let them die because they failed a qualification test? I don’t get it.
Even if they were older, it shows an innocence among young men/adolescent boys that doesn't go away.

Do you think the urge to dig a hole ever disappears because your balls dropped and you're working a 9 to 5 dead end job?
Yeah coz it’s out of place
To be fair, the fact that most slayers are minors is not actually realistic but it's fiction  and fiction doesn't have to be realistic so it's whatever.
I mean, you can not like this scene and also not want only action. Your comment has "if you don't like Rick and Morty" you are not smart enough vibes
Is tragic either way, if they're orphans they probably don't have anyone who will miss them except by their friends in the corps. 

 If they have families they will always live the fear of every night can be the last one the parents see their childrens coming back home.
Dying obviously.

Demons are like Leonardo DiCaprio, when you get to a certain age, they throw you into the bin.
most demon slayers don't really reach that age
Most hashira are barely in their 20s with gyomei being the old at 27 and the only former hashira being 4 counting uzui 
a lot of them are adults well into their 20's, we know Murata is same age as Giyuu (21-22)
At least those Japanese child soldiers aren’t fighting  actual gods unlike the Greek child soldiers of Sanctuary, Athens, Greece:

https://preview.redd.it/oc1vwjl2vtbd1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a33dc35bd5146fa65503f925c372eaa4971ecaec

Luckily, [the adult Greek soldiers are there to guide them.](https://youtu.be/NWLryKsMhoM?si=QKPutSkDJ7XlxWF1)
I think the Western world vastly underestimates how "free" and "privileged" they have become. The collective West unlocked this after the Industrial Revolution, but Japan continued to keep things real until 1945. 

The transition of "kids should be involved with hard work and the harsh reality" to "kids should be mindless and free" is a Western-led concept. Its a much newer concept in Asian parts of the world.
And Makamo literally 12 😔
Less of a reality and more of a parrallel.

Like how in WWII, Japanese children were conscripted into the army to fight for his majesty. So if you were old enough to learn, you were made to run track and hold a gun.
Tanjiro will go to heaven?
15, by the end of the whole show, he turns 16.
It’s because your fully developed at 25 so 27 is pretty old
And Tanjiro is only 15 years old 😔
And tanjiro too
In the beginning he was 13 and then he trained for 2 years so he’s 15 now
Nezuko turned into a demon at 12 😢and Makamo and Sabito died at 12-13
Naruto and Gon were 12 it’s crazy lol
maybe. still really young tho. sad to know most will die before they even reach their mid twenties
Well Tanjiro is 15-16
Yeah, I went higher on the average because we do have people like gyomei and uzui who seemingly started later
Murata is 2 years younger then giyu so he started at 11
while I generally dislike the message despite knowing it's somewhat true 


I like the way it's presented in demon slayer the npcs are not jealous they are not just here to show how mc is the best but the mc is here to inspire them to do one more run before giving up
I both agree and disagree with this. To some extent yes in slayers like Gyomei, Tanjiro, Muichiro etc natural talent plays a massive factor in them being able to withstand training and fights but on the flip side, there are slayers like Shinobu, Genya, Giyu (partially debatable) who had to rely heavily on hard work and dedication to get to where they are. Shinobu in some sense had the luck of her older sister being a Hashira but she studied poisons etc for years to be able to conquer her weaknesses and Genya cannot master a breathing style leaving him short in so many ways when his brother is so naturally talented. It shows both sides of the battle of talent and it’s beautiful in the way it does it.
>and to also make sure someone is there to pass down the breathing style. 

 I don't think is 100% necessary that the breathing user is alive to pass their technique, after all we know breathing styles are well preserved >!(with the only exception of moon breathing)!< and can be learn by just read and study registers. Remember that breathing is kinda like martial arts in nature after all.

 Training kids also suppose a logistical advantage in the sense that by starting the body preparation early, they could take more adventage later on during the years a slayer peak on their abilities. Which is around the 30 as we seen with Gyomei, and also how the dialogue implies hashiras like Rengoku (who was 21) could have perfected their level in a few years.
Lol, are you good? There is a spoiler tag.
In the scene of him this season his uniform had gold buttons
Wait, he died?

I'm still waiting for the full dub to come out so I haven't seen much of anything.

EDIT: Nevermind I forgot who Sabito was.
Yeah it’s like Sabito died due to bad luck while all of the weak slayers in the Hashira training arc survived due to luck.
Sadly
That's how real world works...

There's maybe some kid somehow more talented than Messi in football, but family circumstances, unlucky injury or just straight badluck prevent him to become star
The whole system is so fucked up. It kinda feels gambling in a way, because they have no idea of the actual progress and as we can see kids like Giyuu who aren't skilled enough at time only pass due luck but they can improve and be great slayers in the future, while talented kids like Sabito more likely will die for unfair conditions and all their talent is waste on nothing.

 That's not even touching the fact of how ethical really is having demons (you know former humans) trapped as animals and going crazy like the hand demon.

 The moral of the corps is very questionable in this case.
People will argue and argue but allways fail to explain this point, like if they arent cut it to be demon slayers just let then go on with their lives no need for them to just die
What a fine interpreation
Is in place
The whole season is about exploring personality of characters and preparing for the last episode that starts the last arc. Sorry that origami didnt transform into demons and attack them.
disagree
i mean its pretty realistic. not only is demon slaying a job where most die young, but the story is also set in the 1920's. medicine and technology were not as advanced back then so ppl often passed due to illnesses. and i dont think majority r minors, but older teens to those in their twenties (like all the hashiras) whether the ages r realistic or not has little to do with what im saying anyway
well clearly you're not smart enough because the quotations should've ended before vibes 

"'if you don't like Rick and Morty you are not smart enough' vibes"

also i was kinda giving the general basis of what ive seen from criticism about the episode. if you didnt like the scene, you're there for the action.
No Murata is 19
We got 10 year olds working in meat plants now.
ig but until he's 25
He’s 15 until swordsmith arc and hes 16 in training arc
it just means their system of ranking and the test is horrible.
so what
You gotta consider they all come from different places and usually join after being affected by the demon attacks. The Corps isn't well known, it seems only older people, helpers/suppliers or survivors are in the know
I dislike the message BECAUSE it's true. Life isn't fair. The notion of keep pushing and you'll get there doesn't align with how life actually is. That's why chasing dreams is the hardest thing to do. Because really only a select few can truly reach them.

But you're right. They do give one last effort before conceding. Gotta respect that.
Oh weird - it didn't show up for me until reloading the thread just now. I just saw the un-spoilered message in full.

Reddit bug I guess?
Wasn’t Sabito’s whole thing he killed every demon except the hand monster and saved everyone else? So the guy who did all the work is the only one who didn’t pass
Yeah, that's just sadly how it is. I guess that is why Giyu and Aoi don't feel good much about themselves because they feel like they don't deserve the spot they got within the Demon Slayer corps.
No it doesnt, real militaries dont send their trainies to die before even becoming actual soldiers

Thats after they actualy become soldiers
>Sorry that origami didnt transform into demons and attack them.

 That would be a sick BDA though.

 Imagine a demon who can fold himself like paper and take different forms while creates paper monster with extremely sharp edges.
There are too many teens and too few in their twenties and early thirties.
Hummm what? So I put the quotation marks in the wrong spot because I wrote on a hurry, therefore not smart...

...

Not sure what your problem is buddy, I didn't insult you or anything. My point was that you can't dismiss a critisisim just because you think differently, many people that enjoy action can like or dislike this scene, AND ALSO many people that enjoy quiet moments can also like or dislike this scene.

Quiet moment doesn't equal good moment. To me honestly it was a meh moment, nothing special, doesn't mean I only want action and things go boom, I actually liked this season better than most, doesn't mean they hit it out of the park with everything they did.
at the start or end of the story? Cause I could have sworn Murata says he and Giyuu are the same age during the final battle
more like demons r just ridiculously strong. even among the hashiras, the oldest is only 27
The fun thing about the system is how it has like 10 different ranks and a magic symbol that manifest in your hand for indentify the slayer, yet all this info is only ever explained in a humor scene that comes from nowhere in EDA and it's mostly used for a quick gag.

 The slayer ranking system is totally irrelevant story wise, as the only thing that matters in the end are hashiras and non-hashiras. 

 And on a related note, the concept of tsukugos is also wasted. The only real tsukugo in the story is Kanao and she doesn't appear very much anyway.
And if a family gets attacked the parents will sacrifice themselves for their kids.
You’re missing the message, it’s about doing YOUR best. For Tanjiro, that is high level training that will put him up there with the Hashira. The other slayers that “give up” aren’t really giving up, they are just understanding that they’ve hit their limit in the specific thing they are training on and decide to do everything they can at the level they are capped at to contribute.

It’s about finding your role in something bigger than yourself and putting everything you have into it. Not everyone will be fit for the same role though.
Yeah and he could’ve killed the hand demon if his sword hadn’t become so dull from saving everyone.
Well, technically he should have passed the selection if he did not die. THat's why it was unfortunate luck for him to encounter the hand demon when he was exhausted and his blade was a bit rough because of carrying the whole batch of selection takers.
Yeah but I know Giyu deserves it because he’s always had the potential he just needed a friend and sister dying to push him that hard.
i dont think we've met anyone in their 30s
No I have to agree on the final selection being a really bad test system. It has flaws everywhere.

 The worst part about the final selection is how talented people like Sabito ends up dying for nothing due a lot of arbitrary bs.
idk i don't think most demons are as tricky as swamp demon where they have blood demon techniques.  what's weird is how nobody can use breathing techniques except named characters. but they somehow how pass the test. their ranking and test system as a organization sucks.
But your last point is the same as mine, and the dark side of the message. Your role doesn't equal to what you may have wanted. Who's to say some of the others didn't want to shine like tanjiro? Or reach hashira level? 

In life you never know what your office colleague could have truly wanted to be, but they understood it wasn't meant for them. So they settle for doing what they can do. There's nothing wrong with settling for something else, being a supportive role, playing the shadow to someone else's light. But don't undermine the hurt from realisation that what you had wanted to achieve wasn't meant to happen. 

Like I said, dream chasing is tough because most don't reach it. I didn't say most don't find something else they can do as a replacement.

EDIT: Overall my point is your best can still not be good enough. When that's the case, then what? Gotta be realistic and scale down the big goals you once had. There's plenty of examples of people who are doing fine in life but still had to change aspirations.
Hence there are too few of them.
genuine question: what would you suggest to improve it?
>what's weird is how nobody can use breathing techniques except named characters

 But they do is just that nor everyone can manifest their breathing effects to a visible level.

 Murata character page explain the effects are just visible on the most talented slayers.

 The story makes clear how the only breathless slayer is Genya, the rest of people who can't use breathing techniques at all became kakushi probably.
actually, all the fodder characters can use breathing techniques. otherwise, they wouldn't be in the corps. the only ones we know who have no talent for it are senjuro and genya. it was stated in the manga that the most common breathing style is water breathing (its the easiest to learn) murata and aoi use it and im assuming most of the others do too.
They all can use breathing techniques. They arent as good as the named characters, which is why they arent visible and animated.
I disagree, Tanjiro doesn’t want any of this. He wants to live care free with his family away from violence and death. You are projecting a different lense on the plot here to be about dream chasing rather than rising to meet responsibilities. 

The series is about understanding that you are insignificant by yourself, but when understanding that you are part of something larger and doing your best to fill your role (whether or not it’s something you WANT), humanity can achieve great things.
THEYRE DEAD
More like replace it entirely. 

 Because how the higher ranks of corps even do the evaluation of the applicants once they're inside the mountain? We never got indications of them watching the process (realistically they don't have any methods to do so).

 Is just like they expect some of the kids to survive and that's enough for them, even if like in Giyuu's case they only do survive because a stronger person like Sabito did the hard work. That doesn't really test your skills then, is kinda a waste of time and potential.

 Idk how really they should to the test, but it sure should be something more self contained on a place that can be supervised by actual people.
If the effects aren’t visible they’re weaker than test tanjiro who was already very weak.
>I disagree, Tanjiro doesn’t want any of this. He wants to live care free with his family away from violence and death.

 I mean you can have the talent to shine on something and don't want to follow that route anyway, isn't like both concepts are mutually exclusive.

 Besides while Tanjiro definitely isn't like Inosuke and Sanemi who live for fight demons, he certainly still have a big sense of responsibility and treat the slayer duty with all seriousness. He also can admire and aspire to be like people as Kyojuro, who are the ideal slayer role model on his eyes.

 I'm glad the mangaka didn't make Tanjiro a whiny protagonist like Shinji Ikari and have him constantly complaining about his duty or have a complex with his own abilities.
But I'm not talking from Tanjoro's perspective. Of course he doesn't want it. He's a natural prodigy. There are some people who DO want it but are not a natural prodigy. 

Also, I'm not really talking about the series so much. My emphasis is on real life. I agree with you. Filling your role in something bigger and doing your best is best. But I feel like you're really undermining people's individual aspirations and wants. 

It's easy to say, "I'll play my role regardless of what it is...". But truly meaning it is something entirely different. To wholeheartedly be happy that despite all your efforts, you couldn't achieve what you wanted. But understand your role is something more minor only comes from overcoming the feeling of not achieving the initial goal. 

I don't know how old you are but I'm getting the impression you're still fairly young (I am myself btw, I'm 28 but I'm realistic).

EDIT: Example: One of the swordsmiths had actually wanted to join the DS Corp too. But they was not up to par with a sword. In the end their role in the big picture is being a swordsmith. But respect they initially wanted to be on the front lines fighting with the DS Corp. Don't undermine their own initial aspiration.
There should be 30yos joining the corps.
Tanjiro is never really shown to have innate talent though (maybe some creative ways of thinking and a superhuman sense of smell though). His entire thing is that he doesn’t quit and finds ways to motivate himself (or draw motivation from others) to push himself through and level up through effort rather than natural talent. Others don’t make it as far as him not because they are missing talent that he has, but because they don’t have the drive he has to push past their limits.
I’m 35 and am married with kids and my own house if that helps you. 

>Also, I’m not really talking about the series so much.

Could have stopped there, I’m talking about the series and its themes. You are projecting your own life experience onto the show and twisting its themes to feel relatable to you.
Considering how much pressure the slayer have to put into their bodies to reach the bare minimum I think a person in his/her 30s would actually have much more problems in long terms and they would end underperforming even if they become at least low ranks.

 Because think about this, we have multiple hints of slayers reaching their peak before the 30s as Gyomei is on his maximus power in the present. Kyojuro also trained since kid and he was close to peak at his early 20, even Akaza comments that he would have reach a perfect level in few years.

 I think slayers are kinda like athletes in the sense most of them probably would have (with much luck) a useful time spam of fighting until they’re on early to middle 30.
>Tanjiro is never really shown to have innate talent though (maybe some creative ways of thinking and a superhuman sense of smell though).

 That's pretty much debatable, considering Tanjiro is descrived as the best student Urokodaki ever had and he could complete a supposedly impossible training routine his master made on purpose. He sliced the giant rock and killed the hand demon despite the lack of experience.

 The whole thing with learning the Sun Breathing is a talent on itself, and Tanjiro is the only person in the series who show mixing breathing styles on a more creative way. Even using lightning despite he only hear Zenitsu talk about it like once.

 There's other feats that show Tanjiro's talent but you get the idea.
peace out mates 
 age 28 guy is right about what he is telling about life 


and you are also kind of right that series gives the impression that finding roles where they can be their best version is a better decision and
This sub thread was about life though lol. My first comment is in relation to what is before mine.

I'm also not projecting. I'm being realistic. Like it or not.
Any mid 30s guy is going to be in better physical shape than a 15yo or even 13yo.
Result of the training 
I was wondering if Tanjiro was of Hashira-caliber, because what he witnessed now is different during the fight between Kyojuro and Akaza, and he is unable to follow their movements.

He’s almost there. Very likely stronger than any other non-Hashira slayer at this point
He’s probably on the level or stronger than some past Hashira. Remember Daki killed like 7 by herself.
Actually a great idea from ufotable for this🐍
Bro doing eye workouts
He is easily way above the "Hashira grade" as even Daki killed 7. It's just that the current line up is the strongest line up. 

Even then by Current Hashira standards he is still a beast.
well of course he can see them now someone finnaly turned on the lights
Tanjiro is finally hashira level in the anime.
He's basically Hashira level at this point, then >! after the Akaza fight when he gets see-through world, he's properly Hashira level and perhaps even better than some of them!<
I find it so interesting that to this point in both the manga & the anime that most the current & living former Hashira we know of, including Sanemi, Iguro & even the Ubayashki family at this point do not call Tanjiro close to being a Hashira. He killed Hatengu himself with Yorichii’s sword (I am not denying, negating or ignoring the help all the others participating did - let me complete my point below). 

Its just an unprecedented time of the Corps as Tanjiro becomes Marked and simultaneously elevates both his own training/skills AT THE SAME TIME HE ENGAGES IN UNPRECENDENTED UPPER RANK BATTLES WITH EVERYONE ELSE (Hashira & Corps, plus leveling up the Swordsmiths). 

I read through the Fandom Wiki too and started taking notes a month ago as I re-Watch the series as my comfort TV: I have asked myself pointed questions as to why Kagaya made the mission decisions he did for both Tanjiro and the Corps from Akaskusa (Muzan & Tamayo/Yuchiro + Susamara/Temari Demon + Arrow Demon) & the Mt Natagumo/Rui & the Spider Family to now (where we are in the anime right now). 

E8 (this Sunday) Kagaya will say something very important about what his doctor told him six months ago. That means a lot as to the decisions he made - including what to tell the Hashira and what NOT to tell them. 

The point is that it’s amazing given what little the Hashira actually knew in total (that we the audience are fully aware of and Gyomei knows the most about - and Amane knew the absolute most) by this point and by the beginning of the Final Battle Arc. 

So yeah, it’s fun to nerd out on how this learning applies to Tanjiro’s battle skills in each moment, and to understand better what that has done to influence everyone around him. 

Nezuko’s evolution is fun to nerd out on in relationship to this & the Final Battle. 

Muzan was so blind.

Sorry for my poor spelling. I don’t feel like correcting all of it.
Yeah he is hashira level right now. You'll see. And he'll get even stronger than that
Hes gettin there. Hes close but not there yet.
He level up! :3
Almost. He wouldn’t be able to to physically keep pace with them yet, but he’s close enough to be able to observe them. 🦋
Tanjiro has been Hashira caliber for a while now, remember as long as you kill one of the 12 you can become one, so unless you think Rui could beat current Tanjiro I’d say it’s pretty clear he’s Hashira level. However there’s no shot he amounts to much against the current ones, even Ubuyashiki said this is the strongest group since the one that had Yoriichi in it
He is of hashira level at this point in the series, you'll see soon enough.
He is strong enough to become a hashira, but not stronger than any current ones
Tanjiro is finally at the Hashira level
Hashira backstories are so peak and Tanjiro's story fits perfectly between them. Hashira material fr fr og
He’s definitely Bashkirs calibre, this generation of hashira is generally the strongest generation if you ignore yoriichi. If he is born in a different generation, tanjiro would have already become a hashira now.

Tanjiro's powerlevel:
End of Hashira Training / Beginning of The Akaza Fight - Relatively Hashira Level 
We can see him run as fast as Giyuu during the recent episode, was able to fight alongside all the hashiras united, fought Sanemi for literally hours, and was stated to be hashira level by Giyuu before he awakened his stw.

STW Tanjiro -
Peak Hashira Level
He went from operating hashira levels of strength to speedblitzing Akaza, for anyone to argue that Akaza didn't see it coming, Tanjiro called his name and stated what he was going to do prior to it happening.
No hashira other than arguably Gyomei can ever behead Akaza let alone speedblitz.

Sun Breathing All 13th Forms + Stw Tanjiro -
Beyond Hashira Level 
The Muzan he fought at the start of their battle was relatively the same Muzan that the hashiras were all destroyed, and he outright stated that the reason why all Hashiras were defeated was because they couldn't caught up to the speed of Muzan's attacks which then proceeds to another panel of Tanjiro dodging those same attacks and landing hits on Muzan simultaneously which is a bigger feat than all Hashiras combined has done so far.

Tanjiro is amazing
Why I started tearing up at that scene. Our boy is GROWN 😭😭😭
Tanjiro is the definition of hard work and dedication. What a king!
By eos he's definitely a full hashira
Dragonball level gains
And a permanent Curse Mark now
Hashira Ranks(My Opinion

1. >!Tanjiro Kamado: Demon King/End of Sunrise Countdown!<
2. Gyomei Himejima
3. >!Tanjiro Kamado: 13th Form of Sun Breathing!<
4. Sanemi Shinazugawa
5. Giyu Tomioka
6. Muichiro Tokito
7. >!Tanjiro Kamado: Beginning and Middle of Sunrise Countdown!<
8. Obanai Iguro

14. Tanjiro Kamado: I would say current Anime Tanjiro is about here right now. >!Beginning of Infinity Castle Too!<
15. Shinobu Kocho
16. >!Tanjiro Kamado: Before Hashira Training!<
I would argue that tanjiro (kanao, inoskue, and big man Z too) would lose against any hashira but put up a good fight, tanjiro def the best tho
\>literally beheads 2 upper moons, which has never been done in 113 years

"Is he hashira level?"
So they all got stronger in that short amount of time, why didn't they do this before?
Are they that fast or is it just exaggerating 

I am severely confused on how they look like fighting
YOU CAN SEE IT MAHORAGA!!! YOU CAN SEE MY CURSED TECHNIQUEE!!!!!
Again.
Gyomei>Sanemi>Obanai≈Giyuu>>Muichiro>Mitsuri>Rengoku>Tengen>Shinobu, at least this Eos.

The only comparisons we got of a Marked Hashira vs Unmarked is unmarked Sanemi and Gyomei being MUCH stronger than Marked Muichiro (who is already stronger than practically any other Hashira (beated UM5 alone)

So its hard to scale them Unmarked, but the list would be the same but pumping Rengoku and prob Tengen to the first half, both above Obanai and Muichiro but Below giyuu
growth!
I think it was kinda canon that he was nearing hashira or was hashira potential in Swordsmith Village, if he wasn't the Hashira Training Arc defintely made him around Hashira level, the mark defintley helps considering he has it activated and not dormant like before
Imo he is at level where he can react and successfully deflect attacks. But he would be pushed back and losing. But like not lose right away.
Yes, Tanjiro is currently on par with basically every Hashira except Gyomei.

His next fight is against >!Akaza, and he's stated by Giyu to be Hashira-level, and is able to easily keep up with Giyu and even contend with Akaza himself.!<
Despite the lack of action in this stretched out arc, moments from the manga like this one feel better in the anime since they've taken the time to show him grow through the training!
it’s because his slayer mark is permanent
Yea hes stronger but also rengoku coulda solod wind and snake man easily but maybe not muchiro
He is on the level of the old hashira but not the new hashira, however he is close to the power of the new hashira however.
He’s literally there lmao. The next time we see him fight which is canonically literally a few hours from now, he’s stated to be hashira level
Unfortunate Kanao never got any real screentime beyond S1.
[deleted]
for real
[deleted]
Actually stronger than most Hashiras except for maybe 3 😂
Tanjiro has been at Hashira level since he got the Demon Slayer Mark at the end of the Entertainmnmt District arc.
I'd actually put him above Tengen and Shinobu. But the rest? Nah.
Modern day Hashira Training would just force a slayer to watch/play hours of high level Geometry Dash to train the eyes (or fucking kill them)
From what I saw from him beheading Hentengu, when he was in multiple forms, I belive he could take out Daki and Gyotaru alone.
In the current episode 7 he is close to hashira level. Its only a after unlocks you know what that he is considered hashira by giyu
>!With the STW he's second only to Gyomei, dude. He blitzes and beheads Akaza with a single strike, lmao. He's properly Hashira level right now, and only grows throughout the final arc.!<
Tanjiro had potential to be a hashira but he didn't physically match the qualifications until he finished hashira training. All the other times he killed upper moons he did it with the help of other hashiras holding off the most powerful attacks
He’s literally on their level lmao. The next time he fights he’s stated to be hashira level
Stronger than all hashira except for maybe 3
For all my fellow dragon Ball fans, remember Krillin was able to watch Goku fight cell.  Doesn't mean he's on their level.
He’s literally hashira level. He would definitely be able to keep up with them. As giyu states in their next fight that he is hashira level.
He’s literally on par with the current hashira as stated by giyu 2 hours from this point in the anime. Before he gets any buffs.
Actually stronger than everyone except for maybe 3
Hashira* stupid autocorrect
This exactly the most accurate scaling of tanjiro
By eos he’s the strongest slayer in his generation lmao here he is base line hashira level
13th form tanjiro is above gyomei easily. He was able to be relative to chapter 192 muzan the same muzan who blitzed gyomei who had help from 6 other slayers.
Muichiro and Mitsuri above Rengoku? lmao 🤣
On what planet is Mitsuri above Rengoku? lmao
No by hashira training arc he IS hashira level. Stated by giyu canonically 2 hours from this point in the anime.
Preach bro. Respect our boy Rengoku. All the Akaza fanboys wrongfully downvoting you.
He’s literally as strong as the new hashira 💀 in his next fight he’s stated to be hashira level in base.
Tanjiro has opportunities to show his strength more than anyone, but I think there's an argument to be made for a few of the other non-Hashira slayers being just as strong. In fact, one of them is >!outright stated to be stronger than one of their masters (Kanao)!<. But this is an anime thread, right?
Tanjiro has the shounen MC buff where he gets stronger every second.

Hours by shounen standards is like years worth of effort.

All jokes aside I do believe that he does improve between now and then, even if slightly.
[deleted]
What chapter was this stated in? It’s been a year since I’ve read the manga so I forget

Just wait till next season (⁠｡⁠•̀⁠ᴗ⁠-⁠)⁠✧
Very possible

rn? no but EOS yes
He's stronger than Obanai, Muichiro and Mitsuri?

Edit: Why am I getting downvoted lol?
Nah, Tanjiro would have died multiple times without Tengen. Tengen was literally hampered by Tanjiro because he kept trying to save him and the others. I think the training arc is when Tanjiro actually reaches a Hashira level but he isn’t stronger than any of the current Hashira because they are the best generation since Yoriichi.
Gyutaro was the cause of uzui’s injuries. Daki was hella useless
If Tengen stayed in business long enough to be marked, he’d be one of the top Hashira. Tanjiro is still under prime Tengen.
is he really stronger than them
Bro got downvoted for saying Infinity castle tanjiro is above tengen and Shinobu?


Thats... not even a hot take.
part of the training for them would be to beat ton 618 daily
Not a chance did you forget about Gyotaru's poison?
No he’s hashira level now lmao. In his next fight he is stated to be hashira level in base before he unlocks any buffs 💀
What this guy said. Tanjiro was literally stated to be hashira level in base by giyu. He’s already hashira level now
>!to be fair, he didn't speedblitz akaza. Akaza was just caught off guard by the fact Tanjiro didn't have a fighting spirit.!<

I agree on the rest of what you said tho.
Tanjiro can only follow their movements while marked, when Giyuu and Sanemi were sparring unmarked. They're not on the same level.
When is this directly stated. Hes on their level when he unlocks 2 power ups.
Nah. He loses to all of them atm. in anime.
Yeah, later. But not at this moment. 🦋
He isn't
This is just based on what i remember. Its been a few years since i've read the manga and i've been sticking to the anime more recently. Thank you though.
Yes. Though Mitsuri is interchangable with Rengoku. He put up a good fight but didn't have enough screentime or manga panels to put him any higher. Both Mitsuri and Muichiro put up with and defeated upper moons, while the strongest Rengoku has defeated was previous lower moon 2. No disrespect to him but I can't rank him any higher.
On the KnY universe the Mark is a huge buff, anyone without it gets overpowered
So you are telling me he could beat any of the hashira in a fight as he is currently.
All of the squad is hashira level by now, zenitsu and inosuke barely reaching the level and tanjiro about mid hashira level
The >!Kanao!< thing might be in terms of physical strength, with Shinobu being notably weak in that regard but still more skilled and fast. Still, it’s a good point.
it's mainly cause the current hashira are the best since the original but he's normal hashira level at this point
Which is irrelevant as his mark is now permanent.
Chapter 147
No?🤦🏽 tanjiro was stated to be hashira level while he is in base before any buffs he gets in his next fight lmao. Literally at the start of the fight.
[deleted]
Also Right now. The finale of the show literally takes place over the course of 1 night.
Yep. Stronger than everyone expect gyomei ,Sanemi and maybe gyu.
Are you arguing Tengen is better than Rengoku, Gyomei, Muichiro, Giyuu, and Sanemi? Three of those being ones he even admitted inferiority to? Is he also superior to Yoriichi?
I mean, Mitsuri lasted longer against Upper 4 solo than Tengen lasted against Gyutaro solo (I'll get back to being marked). Muichiro lacked the cutting power but could reach Gyokko unmarked. Tengen himself admits to being inferior to Rengoku, Muichiro and Gyomei. If all breathing styles are inferior derivatives of sun breathing then derivatives of the 5 styles are themselves further degradations as they are even further removed from sun breathing. 

Marked Tanjiro in Season 2 is able to behead Gyutaro. He further succeeds in beheading Hantengu in season 3. Again, marked. Muichiro, as we have established with him reaching Gyokko, is unable to react to the fan attack. But Hinokami Kagura is fast enough to outpace the reactions of 3 emotions. And this is Season 3, not Season 4. Now, Mitsuri with the mark fails against Zohakuten. But Muichiro succeeds against Gyokko. Assuming that the mark is an even powerup scale for all demon slayers and factoring in inate talent based on the fact of how fast Muichiro achieved hashira status, we can reasonably assume Muichiro is stronger than Mitsuri. Yes, Gyokko is a weaker upper moon, but Muichiro was also nerfed by poison. 

Now, Shinobu is the weakest hashira, as she cannot behead a demon. So we can reasonably assume that Muichiro > Mitsuri > Shinobu. Now, it's been stated that Gyomei is the top of the top. So now it's Gyomei > Muichiro > Mitsuri > Shinobu. 

Tengen admits he is inferior to Muichiro, Rengoku and Gyomei. So Gyomei > Muichiro > Tengen. Now, where does Rengoku, Sanemi, Obanai, and Giyuu fit? Sanemi and Giyuu are able to match pace with each other and break each other's swords simultaneously. This suggests a rough parity. So Sanemi ≈ Giyuu. Now, Muichiro is able to maintain pace with Obanai and Sanemi. We ultimately don't know the outcome of this fight though. But Muichiro doesn't have a mark in the fight, so this at least suggests that if Muichiro is keeping pace with both, then marked Muichiro is greater than unmarked Obanai and Sanemi. 

Now, back to Tengen. With his musical score technique, he is able to keep pace with Gyutaro, but as stated by Tanjiro, he will lose out before Gyutaro does. This means Gyutaro > Tengen. Especially if you factor in Daki which would probably be able to compensate for having both hands. Now, Gyutaro is weaker than Gyokko and Hantengu. So obviously Tengen would lose against those. 

Now, we know Rengoku and Giyuu are stronger than Shinobu. Because she is the weakest. If Sanemi is roughly equal to Giyuu, then Sanemi is roughly equal to Rengoku. So Sanemi ≈ Giyu ≈ Rengoku > Tengen. Therefore Tengen is undeniably weaker than Gyomei, Rengoku, Muichiro, Sanemi, and Giyuu. He is stronger than Shinobu. In that gap we have Mitsuri, Obanai, and Tengen. This seems to further verify that the closer to sun breathing the stronger you are. 

Now we have to finally get a little more speculative. Mitsuri before her mark appears is able to cut the dragons to pieces. Tanjiro fails this with the mark. So we can assume the dragons are stronger than Gyutaro's neck. (Tanjiro cut a boulder in season one, thickness isn't an issue) 

So unmarked Mitsuri is stronger than S3 marked Tanjiro. Therefore, all Hashira above that are definitely above S3 marked Tanjiro. Tengen loses solo to Gyutaro. Mitsuri loses solo to Zohakuten even with mark. So Hantengu is def stronger than Gyutaro. Muichiro is stronger than Tengen and Mitsuri, as established. Muichiro could not beat Gyokko unmarked. So unmarked Tengen cannot defeat Gyokko and therefore Tengen could not beat Hantengu. Mitsuri unmarked cannot defeat Gyokko because the stronger Muichiro can't. 

Flame and Water have always produced hashira, so derivatives should also be superior over derivatives of the others. To boot, Mitsuri without any training is above sumo wrestler tier. Tengen's strength is from training. Based on this, there's enough evidence to suggest Mitsuri edges out over Tengen. Not enough to certify, but it's safe to make the assumption. So now, as things stand he can only be stronger than Shinobu and Obanai. Obanai has far too little to go on, but unmarked pre-Gyomei and Sanemi sessions, Tanjiro could cut his haori. So it's safe to assume he can at least put steel on target with Obanai, even if not lethally. Which means he definitely can beat Shinobu. This puts Tanjiro above at least two hashira. At that point, I am willing to bet on Tanjiro beating Tengen cuz he can keep pace with one hand Tengen without a mark. So with a mark he def can probably beat one hand Tengen but now he he can follow the movements of superior Hashira. Therefore, why I claim as I do.
Tengen got a le ebic and badass final fight so he's totally Yoriichi reincarnated guys. 

Seriously. Tengen's my favorite character. But I ain't gonna bet money on the losing horse in a race.
Bruh have you read the manga. He is stated to be hashira after the buff
>!Actually, he *did* blitz Akaza. Akaza did notice that Tanjiro didn't have any fighting spirit, but he immediately admits that not only should he have been able to fight without his Compass active, but Tanjiro greatly surpassed his speed anyway. Don't forget that Tanjiro called out to Akaza before he struck. Akaza wasn't offguard; he had time to react. He was just too slow to keep up with Tanjiro there.!<
Okay? That’s them specifically marked lmao. It still don’t take away from the fact that he is now hashira level as his mark is permanent.
No💀 he’s literally stated to be hashira level by giyu in chapter 147 in base before he gets any buffs 💀
Nope. His next fight is gonna prove that. I don’t want to spoil so I won’t say anymore
Yes at this moment as “later” is literally two hours from this point in the anime where giyu states that tanjiro is hashira level as he is now.
Gyokko was embarrassingly weak for an upper moon. A marked Mitsuri was literally almost killed by one of upper 4's clones. Her best feat is a literal 3v1 battle against a newly promoted upper 4. You're severely downplaying Rengoku who should be roughly on par with Giyu, but I respect your opinion.

I just realized this, but you placed Giyu several spots above end of Infinity Castle Tanjiro? 🤔 From what I've read, Tanjiro faired a lot better in that fight compared to Giyu. Might have to switch them around there.
Beating any of the current hashiras have nothing to do if he’s on their level lmao. and he can certainly beat Tengen and rengoku at this point.
I think in any other generation the squad would be Hashira level, but this generation's hashira just keep training and getting stronger.

Like Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke are insane, but you wouldn't confidently put them up against more than one or two of the Hashira, just because they keep getting stronger too.
[deleted]
Thank you!
Relax dude. You’ve been in this thread for 2 hours leaving a comment every 5 minutes bc people happen to disagree with you. Give it a break.
[deleted]
Can we stop fucking spoiling shit like this without a tag please?
did u forget when he got selfless state, something not even gyomei did in the manga or transparent world? he’s definitely not as strong as the current hashiras as of now
[removed]
He likely was above all those, barring Gyomei and Sanemj back when he was active. He's the second longest serving pillar in the generation. He's arguably less talented than them all, by his own (unreliable) admission but nothing in the story suggests he's below the others besides his own self doubt, something Giyuu struggled with as well.
“One of the top” doesn’t mean top Hashira, did your eyes deceive you? 

Fact is, experience-wise he’s superior to Giyuu, Sanemi and Rengoku as he was a Hashira before them. During his entire life, not a single demon survived more than a hit from him, until Gyutaro. Not to mention that he’s trained beyond conventional swordsmanship. At their base, before everyone started to get their marks and went through Hashira training, Tengen is probably one of the toughest Hashira. But obviously he got power crepped in the next arcs because of the marks. 

Gyomei is obviously stronger than anyone, Muichiro is a top prodigy and Rengoku has a brightness that he cannot replicate in the face of death. Acknowledging someone because of their talents doesn’t have to necessarily bring stupid “power levels” shenanigans to it. My statement does not imply any of the things you said don’t be dense.
I don't think tengen said he is weaker than muichiro, what he said was there are some who picks up sword and become hashira in two months. Means muichiro has more talent then tenger, not that he is stronger compared to himself
Did YOU read it?💀 he’s literally stated to be hashira level literally before akaza even activated his compass at the start of the fight 💀 you cannot be serious lmfao reading the manga correctly is not hard 💀
>!It seems more like akaza was too shocked to react. He even had a whole inner monolog about how it was impossible for someone to not have a fighting spirit.!<

>!Plus: The whole problem with scaling Akaza is that his combat speed and reaction speed increase when using compass needle. EVEN IF tanjiro did blitz Akaza this way, it wouldn't be close to blitzing Akaza at full power. It just seems pretty misleading to say that Akaza got blitzed here.!<
Sanemi and Giyuu weren't marked though. Their marks manifest on their faces and they didn't have them.

Tanjiro can only match an unmarked hashira when he himself is marked, and that's a significant boost. Once the hashira get their marks Tanjiro will be left in the dust again. So no, Tanjiro is not hashira level.
Hashira level could mean rengoku.
A fight with a demon of that caliber is going to rapidly raise his ability level during combat. He’s not at that level at this moment. He improves at multiple points during the actual battle. 🦋
I know Tanjiro fared better, but Giyu was putting in work we haven't really seen from him, not to mention he was far enough in to earn his mark. I thank you for respecting my opinion and I will continue to work on my scaling.
That is because one is dead and the other is retired, has only one arm and only one eye. As they were before they died/injured then I'd say tanjiro would be able to give them a decent fight but lose.

Tanjiro is old hashira level, he is close to being current hashira level at least in my opinion.
You wouldn’t put more than one or two hashira up against another hashira either lmao. Tanjiro is hashira level stated by giyu. The others well you can say whatever you want based off their next fights.
A lot of them are still young too. As they age they’d become stronger naturally. That’s why I feel it was such a shame to lost the flame one so early. He’d have been such a badass.
My guy after the boulder training he made his mark permanent 💀 show me a time where his mark deactivates again lmao. He is literally having a casual conversation with gyomei with it activated or is your attention span that horrendous?🤷🏽‍♂️ was literally the entire point of tanjiros training 💀 you thought you ate huh
ayo??
So that to yourself. You didn’t even watch the episode properly to make dumb claims like that lol.


Now get trolled.
Not my fault people want to reply to me saying stuff that’s incorrect 🤷🏽‍♂️
Which is irrelevant again because his mark is permanent now 💀
Eben gyu says so
I know right? Tanjiro has grown substantially, but people are really trying to compare an actual death match vs a sparring match between friends/allies. lmao
>During his entire life, not a single demon survived more than a hit from him, until Gyutaro

Where was this stated?
And Miyamoto Musashi isn't very much effective against an M1A2 SEP v3. Sure, he is definitely more experienced than some good ol boys from Oklahoma and Kansas who are too young to even get a beer. The fact is, without marks, almost any hashira is going to get their ass railed 7 ways to sunday by an upper moon. Toughest hashira? Did he nearly behead Upper 3 while getting a deep fisting through the solar plexus? Listen, Tengen is my favorite character in Demon Slayer. I love his personality, his arc, the fact he gets a happy ending, his appearance is great, his fights are exquisite.

But I am not going to pretend that he is in the realm of the ultra greats. It's fine if he isn't the greatest thing since Yoriichi. It's fine if he can blitz Kokushibo no diff. 

The Tengen hyperwank is perhaps the worst side effect of the Entertainment District arc because now people think Tengen and Gyutaro miles eclipse Muichiro, Mitsuri, Gyokko and Hantengu all because Gyutaro and Tengen got better serviced in their story and action. The 5 main forms are inferior to sun breathing. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the derivatives of THOSE forms are further inferior. 

Inosuke never compares to Tanjiro or Zenitsu. Does that mean he is a bad character? No. But it is a testament to the fact that the further removed from sun breathing you go, the inferior the breathing gets. 

Again, experience doesn't mean shit if you don't have the oomph to back it up. Look at Muichiro. He got beat by Gyokko. Did he learn sun breathing in his flashback? A new skill? No. He came back and killed Gyokko because he was stronger. Experience matters, but it's not the end all be all. 

Mike Tyson can't stop a bullet train.
spoiler bro
Bruh I just searched it up. It was during/after the fight giyu mentions that tanjiro is hashira level. I am not going to sit here and arguee with you when I know am right. He is as of now not hashira level. But soon will be
>!Again, Akaza directly states that he should've been able to react even without his Compass Needle active, and he also admits that Tanjiro surpassed his speed. Akaza had a heads-up warning from Tanjiro. He was just too slow to react.!<

  
>!I'm also not sure Akaza's Compass Needle buffs his actual stats in any way. All it does, AFAIK, is let him track an opponent's bloodlust. This gives him several benefits, like being able to predict/sense where an opponent is going to strike, being able to easily perceive an opponent's presence (even if they're trying to sneak up on you), and - according to Tanjiro - it allows Akaza's attacks to accurately track and seemingly cling to his opponent's vitals. Unless I'm forgetting something, nothing about Akaza's BDA is stated or implied to actually amplify his physical stats depending on his opponent's battle spirit.!<
It would be tho lmao tanjiro blitzed him plain and simple, he stated himself that tanjiro surpassed his speed. His bda only allows him to keep up with people in his realm of speed otherwise he would just be faster than anyone including people like yorrichi lmao. Tanjiro blitzed him, he was not off guard at all tanjiro literally called out to him and let him attack lmao.
And that’s relevant how? And no he won’t tf 💀 tanjiro is not getting left in the dust as he literally surpasses all of them with another buff 💀
Yeah..rengoku is hashira level. Your point?
lmao what?
He’s literally stated to be hashira level at the start of the fight before he gets any power ups lmao. In chapter 147 before akaza even activates his compass. Giyu is talking about his base power which would be the same here as that fight and that moment is literally like 2 hours away 💀 getting the two major power ups that he gets in that fight is not what makes him hashira level. He was hashira level before that.
He is not 💀 he is literally stated by giyu to be hashira level in base lmfao. He’s not losing to a Tengen who’s missing an arm or a prime tengen. His performance vs akaza before he gets his buff shows that 🤦🏽
That's true, just saying he's on the lower end of Hashira because the others keep getting proportionally stronger too. Like I'm pretty sure Tanjiro can beat Shinobu, but every other active Hashira had a lot to teach Tanjiro still.
Rengoku? Yeah we can see the level his dad reached, the strongest Hashira of his time and I would say Rengoku had the ability to surpass him due to his dedication and desire to be stronger. If he hadn’t been tired from Lower moon one he would have survived Akaza long enough for the sun to come out.
[deleted]
1. giyuu said he has the skill of a pillar, yet once akaza showed respect (using full power) he didn’t do much until he unlocked selfless state (the perfect counter to compass) 2. shinobu said it takes 2-3 hashira to take down a UM so everything they say is not 100%
https://preview.redd.it/i2k285d2cc9d1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc5d3c4b9b0d1dfb7ed46691ce44291684330aae

Chapter 147, literally the next panel after Tanjiro dodges and counters the first 2 attacks from Akaza.
But here since you apparently can’t read. The fight begins in chapter 147 and after tanjiro dodges and counters akazas attacks. Oh? What’s this!?😱 giyu says “it would not be an underestimate to say that your power is equal to that of a hashira, you’re able to fight with upper moon3” like 💀 you can’t be serious lmao
Akaza's abilities are pretty weird in all honesty. I don't think the author even thought it through. 

>!the ability to predict attacks and sense where someone is, by definition, an increase to reaction speed and overall combat speed since Akaza can sense it faster. We see this clearly when Akaza gets blitzed by Giyu and then immediately uses compass needle and magically becomes able to keep up.!<

>!It's also not exactly "bloodlust that Akaza senses. Since he claims that he can sense fighting spirit from newborn babies. It seems to be described more as the will to survive/fight rather than the will to harm Akaza!< 

>!the author added a stupid part of lore: Akaza somehow fought against Kokushibo and put up a decent enough fight that Kokushibo kept him alive after the blood battle. The only way this makes sense is if you consider that Akaza's reaction speed would increase to prevent him from getting blitzed.!<
You kinda ignored the whole point of why Akaza was caught off guard. 

He was surprised by the lack of fighting spirit from tanjiro. Tanjiro calling out wouldn't matter because Akaza was still comprehending how someone could have no fighting spirit. 

The anime seems to do a better job at interpreting things like this. We will have to see it animated to be certain, I guess. 

He probably can't activate compass needle fast enough to react to Yoriichi, but the author implies that Akaza used compass needle to react somewhat to Kokushibo during their blood battle.
Yes, another buff. If Tanjiro can only match the hashira with more buffs than they have, then he's not on the same level as them.
Hashira level means nothing. It does not mean hes comparable to giyu or sanemi. Let alone the big man himself. Not at this point. Hes on gyomeis level during the final fight. A tad higher maybe due to selfless but transparent world makes selfless kind of null and void.
rengoku was a hashira. tengen is a former hashira. shinobu is a hashira. gyomei is a hashira but so is mitsuri. being hashira level is like comparing daki to kokushibo. well both are upperranks right?
Last time I checked, that hasn't been animated yet so your point is mute. Based on what has been shown in the anime he isn't hashira level yet, close but not there yet.

You should not be using a version of tanjiro that hasn't been animated yet. We are talking about the anime, specifically the hashira training arc, not the infinity castle arc. Using feats from the next arc doesn't count.
Since each Hashira has a completely different style of fighting, of course they had a lot to teach Tanjiro.

I would have loved if they had flipped the entire script nad we got an arc of Tanjiro teaching them Solar Breathing technics
Being tired or not is not changing what happened to rengoku lmao. The only way rengoku is surviving against akaza is if akaza wants him to.
It’s not an opinion when it’s directly stated in the manga by a hashira themselves. He’s hashira level point blank. If someone wants to respond to me with their reasoning as to why not which the reasonings they use are also incorrect then I’m just gonna correct them🤷🏽‍♂️ and most of the time it’s manga readers I’m having to correct which is sad.
Yeah you just debunked yourself lmao. Tanjiro is literally hashira level at this point in time. Before he made his mark permanent he was able to keep up with Tengen and more importantly a serious fist fight between sanemi. after he made his mark permanent he is stated to be hashira level by giyu. How well he does against akaza is literally irrelevant as the same would happen to giyu as we see lmao. Otherwise how tf you gonna explain tanjiro going from (in your own words) <hashira to >akaza over the course of one fight 💀
Love this guy, common sense is a rarity in this fandom it seems, that and reading skills
spoiler
Be humble sit down![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
My guy you are trying to slob on akazas meat way to hard rn, akaza himself stated tanjiro surpassed his speed fair and square. And the manga made sure to go out of its way to show you that tanjiro beat akaza head on without using a surprise attack. Tanjiro is faster bruh plain and simple. Just because akaza is surprised he don’t have a battle spirit don’t mean he didn’t literally still get the chance to react, ready himself and still attack. Akaza was literally focused and waiting for tanjiro to come and was still blitzed.
No I didn’t say match them 💀 he surpasses most of them lmao. Marked tanjiro is mid hashira level. Stw is high hashira and 13th form is the strongest slayer in the current generation
My guy that’s irrelevant 💀 not what we are talking about lmao
Brother, then why are you arguing Tanjiro is not hashira level? You just proved it yourself.
Um last time I check that point in the manga is literally like 2 hours away canonically from this point in the anime and tanjiro didn’t get any buffs since then so he’s at the same power level he’s at now as he was in that point in the manga so my point stands 💀
Bros justification for his argument is bc of a statement from the future. No self awareness.
Hashira have no reason to learn Sun breathing though. They're min-maxed into their own respective styles. Meanwhile Tanjiro can't really learn Sun Breathing, so he's practicing to raise his overall profile.
Rengoku needed another few minutes of survival. He was absolutely tired from saving the people inside the train, and Enmu was still pretty tough, rank 7 of the demons of his time and his use of hostages was clever. Of course had Akaza gone full beast mode Rengoku was dead for sure, but Akaza wanted to give him a chance, and I think Rengoku would have survived if he had been fresh, survived just long enough for the sun to come up and Akaza to run away.
[deleted]
except we saw the difference between tanjiro and tengen. one struggled with daki and one curb stomp her. massive difference. and how? shinobu already said it. battles are worth so much more than training. after his mark (roughly rn), he’s old hashira level. akaza fight, he is low current hashira level aka shinobu (lacks strength) tengen (lacks skill/versatile) and mitsuri (lack speed) level. muzan fight, he became top 4 with obanai.
You are the one who needs to sit down:

Chapter 147 -> https://imgur.com/a/3tfFZDW

Akaza literally arrives chapter 146. Stop lying to yourself, and take the L.
Lmao you got nothing to say so you say that?💀 it’s okay to admit your wrong even tho idk how it’s that hard to miss that blatant statement at the start of the fight but whatever 🤷🏽‍♂️
Dont know where does dumbs like you come from.


He is already hashira level. And after that buff he surpassed every other hashiras. As none of the hashiras could master that skill apart from tanjiro.
Marked Tanjiro can only match an unmarked hashira. Then Tanjiro gets selfless state and masters the most op breathing technique and gets on the level of a marked hashira. And no, he doesn't surpass the hashira, he was doing better than them against Muzan when Muzan was starting to get significantly weaker from the aging drug.

If Tanjiro needs op techniques and op boosts to do as well as the hashira did without those, then he is not on their level.
I wonder what's how well Tanjiro can fight against Giyu now with water style? He's Tanjiro will lose if he only uses water style, but I'm curious how long can he keep up before getting overwhelmed since Giyu mastered it to a higher degree
https://preview.redd.it/htabogcafc9d1.jpeg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6589e88c387b596a66de3fe28c7fab5dfbbf2c7d
My guy tanjiro literally stomped her aswell when he was mad and that’s irrelevant as that’s literally season 2 tanjiro? 💀 and it’s funny how you say what I’ve been saying this whole time is that tanjiro is hashira level in the akaza fight in base. Which would mean he’s hashira level now as he literally fights akaza 2 hours from this point canonically lmao.
Um no the only marked hashiras stronger than marked tanjiro is sanemi and gyomei. And he never mastered sun breathing lmfao he just began the first step in mastering it. Also he very easily surpasses them lmfao. He 1v1 the same muzan who blitzed a massively amped gyomei and 6 others and tanjiro arrived to fight him seconds after so he was hardly any weaker before you say “muzan was so weak blah blah” no lmao they explicitly state he gets weaker slowly. That it chips off bit by bit. And proven by the crows who give the time tanjiro was relative to that same muzan. Infact it would be a muzan who’s even faster due to tanjiro being alone AND tanjiro being way more debuffed by the hashira lmao poisoned longer. Can’t use stw due to stamina and he already had low stamina.  A healthy tanjiro would be massively stronger. He definitely slams we can break this fight down bit by bit if you want.
Make this make sense
This don't make sense bruh

He was injured as hell during the recovery exercises, like shattered bones, internal bleeding and the works
So, imagine how a high-five feels like. Now imagine how a high-five feels after your hand is run over by 3 semi trucks.

He was fine in the first picture, but he was pretty injured in the second
It’s like getting rehab after recovering from a severe injury. They were also in bed for days.
Inosuke got his shit crushed lol 😭
He was injured and it’s different when someone is moving you
Imagine you were once an athlete. But you gotten injured and did not stretch for a few months in order to recover. Then try stretching again.

I would have no doubt that stretching to the previous extent will be very difficult, if not painful.
In the top picture he was in peak physical condition, in the bottom picture iirc he was bedridden for recovery for some time, so he needs some exercise again before he's back to where he was
Reading comprehension curse
Stretch and exercise every day and then get in a car wreck that really fucks you up. Then, be bedridden for weeks without being able to stretch and exercise daily. THEN have a nurse try and help you stretch and exercise. It's gonna hurt
I'm going to smack you on the back first.

Then I'll smack you on the back when I drop kick you off Burj Khalifa and summon fifty meteors to fall on you.

Let's see whether or not you'll hate my existence
Facebook tier post
Stretching and being stretch feel completly differnt
Doing it yourself and having someone force you into it is very different.
His back was broken
I’d like to see you getting forcibly stretched with massive internal injuries
He was severely injured and bedridden for a semi extended period and doing physical therapy in the second picture, compared to the first pic where he only has minor injuries.
Its just inosuke 💜
Second picture is after he got broken bones from the spider demons I believe, so he's in much more pain than he was before
Once I had a plaster on my hand, with the surgically operated thumb. When I tried to move my other fingers that were normal but didn't have any movement for several days; may be 1.5-2weeks; it was tttooo painful.
Yeah, for real! How do the tears come out of the mask eyes?!
It’s different if you move your body yourself vs others moving it. Also, he was badly injured.
Wasnt a severely injured and had to literally rearrange his internal organs in the fight before that bottom scene? Like yeah when you are recovering you arnt as mobile as you are when you are in tip top shape.

Theres also a difference between when you do something with your body vs when someone else does something your your body.
It’s called recovery training for a reason
He was injured at the time but also, when doing the "head between the legs" trick, the pressure is evenly distributed throughout his back.

In the other scene, not only was he being bent in a constricting position, but the force and pressure of Aoi's stretched out body was focused into a single section of his middle back, directly onto his spine
Leave him alone! He was severely injured and bedridden for quite some time!
funny how someone can move freely when at full health but wont be able to move freely after having almost every bone in their body shatered. Makes you wonder, huh?
After the spider mountain mission, he had been pulverised by Father and then atrophied while bedridden. Only way it makes sense XD. 
(I think it was also a reflection of his mental state. He was lacking a lot of his normal drive to ignore pain and show off)
Well this was before he was majorly injured 

In a dancer so I’m pretty flexible or was I could bend a lot but then I had a surgery and I lost a lot of said flexibility from recovery so it’s just what happens when you get injured 

✨
Have you never had to do rehab?
that image where they are pulling his arms back is called the octopus hold. its a wrestling move and it is the most painful shit ever. had a girl do it to me ironically and i didnt know what the move was until i felt it. i thought my back was going to snap.
Bro doesn't even pay attention to the show if they don't know why he was temporarily less flexible.
There's this thing called "use it or lose it."

In the first image, Inosuke had been free to do his daily training to keep his flexibility.

In the second image, he had been hospitalized and on bed rest, causing him to lose some of his flexibility.
He was injured while in the spider forest. This is a comparison before and after he was injured. And even with his insane skills of moving his organs within his body, internal bleeding and broken ribs won't save him.

He had 4 broken ribs 😂😂
Psychological damage
Being stabbed through your back must be the cause, not mentioning the recovery time and loss of range of motion when bed ridden. 

Could also be that he wasn't ready and didn't have time to like..."activate his muscles"
this is the classic the boss when you fight him meme
We’re never beating the media illiteracy allegations.
He grew up in the mountains
To be fair he was injured as hell🐍
Maybe he's got extra joints in his spine or something
I'd like to see you stretch your torso with several broken ribs
It’s not the same when you do it, as opposed to being forced to do it after mayor damage
O cara tem limite elas tô querendo dobrar igual livro
I mean, he did get hurt a lot, so maybe it’s from recovering
Me waking up for school but I slept on the floor cause my cousins at my home but then I realize oh shit no school

![gif](giphy|sbrXFzxizp7OHjv9RI|downsized)
I guess bc its wemen and not him doing it
If you stop going to the gym after a serious injury. You won't be able to lift as hard as you could
Inosuke just doesnt like to be touch
no
By this logic if I do a cartwheel then it shouldn't hurt if someone forcibly flips me over and I faceplant.
They are demons in disguise
I guess just writing something doesn't make it true. 

If you dislike it that much, whyd you engage with it?
ah yes you will run a mile with broken leg same as when you're normal
If we had an image of what his broken bones and internal injuries looked like, this would make perfect sense. Dude was in the most literal sense internally 💥shattered💥 at this point.
He was injured bruh
It's like biting your tongue consciously and unconsciously.when you bite it consciously  it doesn't hurt but it does when it's a mistake.
He was very injured, so it would hurt a lot more

Don't take it seriously bro just enjoy
My brain committed suicide
Wrestlemania breathing, Second Form, Walls of Jericho.
Different muscle group stretched and he was getting over battle injuries, so he wouldn't have been as healed and his flexibility wouldn't be as good.

Otherwise an oversight by very human writers/animators
Tbh even I don't understand it 💀
And if you haven't stretched in like a month, you'll notice the difference.
>This don't make sense bruh

Literally the first comment is the most logical answer that could ever be given smh ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6743)
Didn't he already have a broken rib in the first image, though?
Plus hadn't he been bedridden for a while in the second pic? He was probably stiffer than usual
Plus its one thing to display your own flexibility meeting your own known limitations compared to someone else pushing your joints and ligaments beyond their limits.
I laughed at the meme for a moment. But you're right.
But that’s just skill issue
He had a broken rib in the first one as well
He was also psychologically bruised so his mental capacity to relax probably also played a small role on top of being incredibly injured physically
BUT TANJIRO HAD JUST INJURED HIM IN THE TOP PICTURE TOO

it does make sense when you know they were all in bed for days though
no seriously, i never thought i was a hater before but there’s so many brain dead posts like this that i just wanna reach through the screen and shake sense into people lol. like BRO HES LITERALLY IN THE DEMON SLAYER VERSION OF A HOSPITAL
This implies it doesn't make sense. It does. He was injured.
its probably because its someone else stretching him, so it hurts, and he was more injured too
Yes, but it's one broken rib caused by Tanjiro vs getting beaten up by the father spider demon who got a power boost from a lower moon so probably more broken bones and other injuries.
Adrenaline was pumping through him by then I'm pretty sure
Only a rib though

In the one in Butterfly Estate, he's essentially crippled all over
At least a cracked rib, but he got way more injured during the spider battle and probably hadn’t stretched in a couple months while he recovered, and that’s on top of not being fully recovered in the first place
if you injure yourself, it hurts a lot more later on because the adrenaline and endorphins have worn off
Yeah but it's the injuries plus the recovery time stuck in bed letting his muscles atrophy. He would've lost much of that limberness.
Adrenaline, it hit him hard after the Adrenaline wore off lmao
He was bedridden for a while prior in the second image

Either Rengoku or Sanemi.
It’s between Rengoku and Muichiro for me.
I think Muichiro's looks the coolest, but Rengoku's fits his breathing style perfectly.

Also am I the only one who feels like Rengoku's sword guard should be turned around?
https://preview.redd.it/gtyi3nsrohed1.jpeg?width=980&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30825afebea6c9eff7a2ad943c7c1f085db0040e

Pink hearts 4 way please! 💖💖💖💖
I mean... Rengoku's is just 🔥
Zenitsu IMO
Sanami
The most practical one to use would probably be Tanjiro's. The circular design saves you from scrapes that may be caused by pointed guards, and the spokes connecting it to the katana make it slightly lighter and probably even more durable than if the circular piece was filled in. TL;DR: Tanjiro's sword guard is plain but extremely effective at its job.

The coolest looking in my opinion is probably Muichiro's, Rengoku's, Sanemi's or Obanai's.
SHINOBUUU
Muichiro
Muichiro.
Muichiro it interesting how simple yet a bit fancy it is
I really like Sanemi's
Sanemi's, Kyojuro's and Muichiro's, in this order
Rent Goku

Definitely my boi Mui 💨
Honestly I love all of them 😀
Muichiro is the only one that look like it be cool in anime and real life. Simple yet badass
Sanemi and Muichiro
I love mitsuris and muichiros
Between Sanemi, Rengoku and Muichiro for me
If you don’t Fw Obanai or Sanmei’s guards what are you doing?
Sanemi or Mitsuri
Sanemi's,Rengoku's,Mitsuri's, Shinobu's and Mui's (I can't pick one there all too good) 🩷💚
Muichiro has a sick one but youricchi one is sick too
For me it’s obanai or muichiro.
Kokushibo
I like Muichiro’s best but Rengoku’s is a close second
Tokio or sanemi
Sanemi is beautiful
Sanemi with Muichiro a close second for me.
Sanemi, no contest.
Muichiros 🌫
Sanemi
my favorite has always been sanemi
Muichiro's, sexy geometry
I really like Muichiro and Tanjiro's second guard (which yes is the same as Kyojuro's but it faces the opposite way, which I prefer)
Muichiro. Especially because of the intricate design which also has few gaps between that.
Muichiro overall but it has to be rengoku because its the most fitting for him
Sanami
I like how all of them are associated with the personality of the user. Like how Yuriichi is the strongest but his is just a simple/normal man just like his guard.

Slither!
Giyuu and Sanemi.
Muichiro
Obanai
I love Tanjiro’s wagon wheel guard
I like Shinobu and Obanai's. But if i have to choose which one will i use, it will be Shinobu's sword since i'm lack of physical strength just like her
Sanemi, Iguro, Muichiro and Mitsuri
Sanemi
Out of the ones pictured it’s sanemi or muichiro. 

Not pictured: tanjiros after swordsmith village. I enjoy how it’s rengokus but flipped so the flame is symmetrical with the blade.
I will never not love Zenitsu's lightning decorations on his sword
Mui/Sanemi/Obanai idk
Ichigos bankai 💯💯💯
Rengoku has the coolest sword guard according to me
Rengoku :3
Ms. Kanroji.
Rengoku but if the round part was facing forward
ofc my boy rengoku
Zenitsu or Rengoku
I don't like the flashy ones, so I have to say for me it's Giyuu's, Tanjiro's first one, Yoriichi's and Zenitsu's.
Coolest? Rengoku. Cutest and the one I like the best? Mitsuri’s! 💕💕
Easy It's kanao

https://preview.redd.it/g4bgs1e7zhed1.jpeg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de20913d9d783a8f458088b2b28280a91be3187b
Tanjiros was plain because his blade didn't change/he hadn't fully mastered water breathing. Where Tengen? But out of these bottom right is best
Gyomei
Rengoku for me
https://preview.redd.it/cg3ol0923ied1.jpeg?width=618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a08a364ed6eb9e6a5f99e94ac47eaa57c8b6bde9

Muichiro, I'm not bias







JK I am
Kanao’s tsuba is not here but Kanao, Obanai and Muichiro
Kyojuro or Shinobu 🦋
I wouldn’t have designed Shinobu’s guard that way
Either Giyu or Muichiro for me
Inosuke
Muichiro
Muichiro 🌸
Rengoku and Muichiro ❣️
Mitsuri or Muichiro
Muichiros was the coolest guard but in terms of actual sword my goat Iguro
Tokito
Sanemi or Muichiro
Rengoku's, its so cool that i want to get It tattoed at this point
I'll actually disagree with you on Tanjiro's hilt guard. Although the design is extremely simple, and sure, even plain. I think the specific design it has was very intentional.

Every sword has a unique design, and obviously Tanjiro's first sword wasn't meant to be as cool, given he gets a much more badass sword later, >! Yoriichi's sword !<.
But I also think that the guard hints to the secret of Tanjiro and his "destiny" we'll call it. His guard, to me, looks similar to a simple depiction of the Sun. Essentially just a point with rays going outward from it.

Although I may be thinking way to much into this...I think it's a clever way to hint to him being >! A Sun Breather !<.
Rengoku, i mean I would look at that masterpiece for hours
Hard to beat Muichiro’s imo, super stylish yet simple
Isn’t it called a tsuba or something
Sanemi’s and Muichiro’s
Sanemi
Muichiro.

Shinobu's sword have a nice design but a really bad color palette!
It don't fit with Shinobu's design!

I love mitsuri’s
I think muichiro but also rengoku because the  sword fits perfectly whit his breathing style
Flame hashirama!

Such a beautiful sword😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🌇
rengoku fo sho
Rengoku,Giyuu and Zenitsu. Honorary mention to Himejima.
I can't  decide
Sanemi or mui 100%
Yoriichi is simple and incredibly cool looking
The two on bottom left who's are they, pretty functional those are my picks
Sanemi, Rengoku, Muichiro
Rengoku or Muichiro
mitsuri and muichiro🩷🩵
Mommy 🍡🍡🍡

Rengoku’s is imo the best simply because it resembles a flame. If you hold the sword edge down, the flame is “downwards”, because most of the flame breathing style relies on “upward” movements (mimicking a rising flame).
muichiro, rengoku or shinobu for me.
When you realize Giyus sword hilt matches the haori his sister wore…
Rengoku all the way
Muichiro
Ngl inosuke's is pretty underrated
Rengoku, Sanemi, or Zenitsu.
Sanemi is the best in all things
I love the simple elegance of Yoriichi’s guard.
Gyomei’s sword guard is his gigantic hand.
Rengoku for sure
muichiro and sanemi :3
Never realised how similar Muichiro and Yoriichi’s swords guards are.
Shinonu and tokito

WHERE IS TENGEN???
The green, the pure black & the dark pink on the black sword..
Sanemi or rengoku
Rengoku by a mile
Giyu
obanai's looks so sick☝️
Rengoku for sure!
Gyomei :3
Mitsuris sword is super cool
Obanai
Wind hashira easily beats the rest
Yoriichi it’s just simple enough to make it the best
My glorious king Sanemi
Ichigo
Sanemi and Obanai
Shinobu 🎀
Muichiro because he’s my favourite character
Easily rengoku
muichiro imo
Whose is bottom right
Kokushibo or Yoruichi
Definitely Mitsuri or Sanemi
Rengoku definitely. Then Muichiro.
I love Murichiro’s and Tanjiro’s original, the open hilt seems so cool (and aerodynamic)
![gif](giphy|tEcIyVc6ukQV2eb86t)

Out of these, Rengoku. But I’m really a fan of how Gyomei fights, even if it’s not a sword.
the two golden guards were fire
Muichiro or Sanemi
Sanemi rengoku or mui
Love the design of Sanemi’s and love the look of Rengoku’s on Tanjiro’s black sword
Gyomei
did you just say "had"???
Rengoku or Mitsuri
Sanemi 100%
Tanjiro, its simple and efficient
Muichiro and it’s not close
Obanai it sanemi
Obanai or sanemi
I’d Say Sanemis is the Coolest But Rengokus is the best.
Muichiro
Muichiro's sword guard looks hella royal
Sanemi or Mui
Sanemi or yoriichi IMO.
Rengoku
I have extreme bias so Rengoku
I like muchiros, giyus and yorichis
Sanemi or rengoku. Sanemi has a shurakin and rengoku has a flame. Everyone else’s. Maybe expect for mitsuri and shinobus are extremely bland. That’s why the right gave tanjiro rengokus guard 💀
I like the snake on iguros
based but probably sanamis
Rengoku and Sanemi
Muichiro
Sanemi and Rengoku
Definitely Gyomei
Is it a cop out to say I love them all equally for different reasons?
Muichiro or Mitsuri
Muichiro or Mitsuri
Rengoku’s is just a bit too much for me, I prefer the simplistic design of Muichiro’s and Yoriichi’s, but at the same time Sanemi’s just fits him and his annoying ass personality. Like he could show you his guard and you’d think “Why’s it so sharp and violent?” And then the moment he speaks you finally realise the correlation
Mui or rengoku. Or maybe giyuu
Sanemi Sanemi !!
Rengoku
Where Tengen?
Sanemi
Rengoku
Really love that gold guard from Muichiro honestly
definitely not tanjiro-
Mitsuri
Whose sword is the 7th? The one that looks mostly Golden?
Rangoku/tanjiro one
The Mui
Muichiro or giyus afterall its like sabitos just in a diffrent color.
Muichiro
Sanemi 💨
Imo i think muichiro has got to be one of the coolest! I really like the intricate simple design!!
![gif](giphy|jh7F7XwHTywg85ekdl)
Rengoku
All of them
Prolly a bad opinion but I like sanemi’s and I do t really like rengoku’s at least on TANJIRO’s sword
It's between Rengoku and Muichiro for me.
Kyojuro rengoku
Rengokus is so cool tanjiro stole it so... ![img](emote|t5_3foq4|6742)
rengokus was so good, tanjiro took it for himself
Sanemi’s wind mill thing was the best
Tanjiros new one with Rengokus guard is best, but between these I’d say Rengokus or Sanemi
Definitely Sanemi’s
Muichiro's
I feel like all of them match their character but Muichiro…how does his guard represent mist?
Sanemi and Muichiro
sanemi and muichiro tbh
Sanemi and Rengoku’s hilts are great, but Rengoku’s hit different on Tanjiro’s sword
I own both of sanemi's and remgoku's replicas, and honestly ilthe right answer is either of them, cause they're just so cool
I really appreciate Yoriichi’s tsuba for the historical accuracy. The bare ray skin wrap is also a cool history detail. The fact that both are gold is just a straight flex.
All gang
Rengoku all the way 🔥🔥
Rengoku imo

I LOVE the Flame
Definitely rengoku
Biased af but it's hotta be Muichiro. It's just too clean.
Muichiro and sanemi, they look simple yet so special
Either Rengoku, Muichiro, or Sanemi
I’m going Muichiro
Sanemi
Sanemi orthe bottom right (muichiro i think)
Fire
Sanemi has my favorite color scheme, Obanai has my favorite sword design
UPPER MOON ONE
Rengoku, it’s just so iconic
Kyojuro, Sanemi, and Mitsuri
Rengoku and Zenitsu.
Mitsuri. (This is biased I just really love mitsuri)
My favourite is Muichiro and Giyuu’s. I like simplicity.
They're all badass, but Shinobu, Mitsuri, and my boy Tokito take the cake for me.
Tanjiro and Yoriichi have traditional guards so they are cool to me. While I like Mitsuri's, my boy Rengoku has the coolest guard of all. 😁👍
Muichiro
As much as I hate Sanemi, his is probably one the coolest.
Tengen’s
Sanemi the best easily imo
imo muichiro or sanemi (im biased 🙏)
Rengoku's. But I am extremely biased
Sanemi or Muichiro
Rengoku and tanjiro
Gyomei has my personal favourite.
I wonder how many of these are going to end up in assassin's creed shadows
Muichiro, it's look so royal
Muichiro or tengen if that counts
Obanai and Muichiro's to me
Rengoku and sanemi
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Muichiro.

Rengoku’s is up there design wise but I have a pet peeve about it that makes me hate it. The pointed part of the flames being on the same side as the sharp end of the sword feels so awkward. I like Tanjiro’s version of the flame guard better
Why is Tanjiro even here? 😭
John Kagurabachi
Definitely Zoro
Whose sword is the golden one?
Sanemi, Rengoku, or Muichiro
Obanai
Top left. I have no insight on the show at all but that just strikes me as super cool. Anime is so dope !
Tokito
Sanemi or mui
I think the only answer is sanemi. Obanais lookin a lil sus ngl
Rengoku or Mitsuri can’t decide
Muichiro for me
Rengoku’s or sanemi but the way rengoku’s looks on tanjiro’s is even cooler
Inosuke
for me, its either Sanemi or Giyu
Muichiro's is really ornate. 😁
I like Shinobu's and Sanemi's most
Rengoku had the coolest sword for sure
Muichiro all the way
Zenitsu
mitsuri's
I love Muichiros sm but I think my all time favorite sword of the slayers is tanjiros version 2 sword, with rengokus flame guard and newly refined black blade they found in SSV. It’s soo sick with the engraving and just the story
I like muichiro’s the cool designs showing the elements are so overused it isn’t appealing anymore
Yoriichi's Nichirin was my fav one
Hate to be that guy but they are called tsuba
Rengoku, Muichiro, or Yoriichi
Sameni and uzui rengoku and zenitsu
Rengoku, muichiro or sanemi
Rengoku for cool factor, but Tanjiro for that simplistic elegance factor
Tokito and shinazugawa
Rengoku and muichiro
i really like muichiro's
Sanemi and tokito no doubts
 Sword of Obanai's. His sword is the better and coolest for me
Sanemi and muichiro
Inoske no guard keep a tight enough grip you never had to worry about cutting yourself
![gif](giphy|Yq1tXTNe5PDdQEhKXG|downsized)
Rengoku!!!! But I may be biased, he was my fav 😢
Inosuke
Tokito's looks like the gates to a diamond temple🗿
Gyomei
Had?… 😢
Muichiro
Tanjiro's
Rengoku no question, he’s the goat
There is one of the swords whose owner I don't recognize. The one just below Zenitsu's sword
Sanemi's and kokushibo's
Sanemi
Sanemi and Obanai.   
By the way, who's the sword guard in the bottom right?
Muichiro or Yoriichi
I love mitsuri’s it’s adorable
I really like Rengoku’s but Iguro’s is cool.
Zentitsu i Just Love the gold
Personally it’s between Sanemi or Muichiro for me
Muichiro’s. Simple, not too fancy, yet elegant.
I absolutely love Muichiro's and Sanemi's! 🌫
Zoros
Tengen Uzui. Or Tokito
Rengoku for the reason it is the most iconic. Probably because it was the first unique and detailed sword guard we were introduced to. The story behind why it’s important to tanjiro is cool.
obanai
Mitsuri. It’s really pretty
Mitsuri, Obanai, and Shinobu for me. Mitsuri and Obanai’s sword are really funky and cool while Shinobu has poison in her’s which I find interesting
Inosuke's lmao
I'd say Sanemi cause his sword guard looks like a shuriken and I think that's really cool
Zenitsu and obanai for me
Rengoku or Sanemi. Giyu's was nice too.
Mitsuri
Rengoku
Zenitsu and Muichiro's look really nice but Sanemi's or Rengoku's looked the best
Inosuke

No guards for the diehard
I like zenitsus. Clean and simplr
I like the symmetrical ones like Muichiros. Something about it is so simple yet so clean. I don’t think the rectangles that are floating outwards have any use though.
Giyu
Mitsuri’s
Rengoku/Sanemi
Top four for me

1: Tengen (why isn’t he up there?)  
2: Zenitzu  
3: Muichiro  
4: Giyuu
![gif](giphy|0qVkEbOWZHtiDq3Yhx)

Guy with guard. His mother ain't raised a coward
Ichigo... but here ill take Sanemi
Tokito or rengoku-san
Sanemi’s is the most intricate (that ficker was hard to draw on nails -I’ll post later) but I love Tengen’s and obanai’s guard. Mui has my favourite tho. So detailed, yet so delicate it’s just gorgeous
Definitely Rengoku

![gif](giphy|6U47YlEnJQNeb05Csh)
Rengoku
Rengoku or zenitsu
Obanai
Rengoku & Zenitsu
Yoriichi
Rengoku's Is pretty fire
Kokushibo
obanai
Inosuke definitely
Rengokus is fire 🔥🔥
Sanemi or Rengoku. I really like their sword. But Giyuus will always be my favourite. I like simple things
Obani or sanemi
![gif](giphy|jh7F7XwHTywg85ekdl)
#tanjiro💚🖤🗡️
Sanemi
only me who thinks either iguro or rengoku? 🥲
Does tengen’s have a guard?
Muichiro, it just looks so clean with his sword
I just saw D&W! So many cameos: Chris Evans, Henry Cavil, Jennifer Garner, Wesley Snipe, Channing Tatum as Gambit, old X-Men movies.
Obanai’s is kinda cool
Ofcourse Muichiro's
Besides the obvious best (rengoku) Sanemi or Muichiro
Def the big tiddy goddess mitsuri, but I am a slut for anything pink so I’m biased.
Muichiro for me.
OBANAI
Obanai's sword looks so cool tbh.
Muichiro I’ve always liked the connected squares on his guard, simple is sometimes best
![gif](giphy|6U47YlEnJQNeb05Csh|downsized)
Gyomei for sure.
The donut man!
obami and rengoku
Sanemi or Muchiro for me
i like sanemi cause my fav color is green, and the design is super clean imo.
Gold one bottom left
Rengoku, easy. Even tanjirou using Rengoku's is bad comparatively. The way rengoku had it (as pictured above) when on his belt, in its scabbard, the flame was upward as his Nichirin was away most of the time. When haganezuka put it on tanjirou's sword he put it upside down. Sad.
Always though Rengoku’s was a lil tacky
Muichiro
Giyu
Wheres Zoro? 💀
Kokushibo. It has eyes in it...
![gif](giphy|xULW8jjeeLtBwrGZgc)

yu lose
I like the golden one 
My boi Kyojuro, Obanai and Shinobu. Those have the coolest designs.
Muichirou for sure!
Yoriichi, No Cap.
Rengoku. Obviously!
Sanemi's or Rengoku's. Muichiro also has a nice one but these two are best
Genuinely a tie between wind fire and water but Rengoku still my favorite character
For me, Rengoku or Obanai
Muichiro’s
Tanjiro's new sword >!or yoriichi's blade x rengoku katana holder!<
I like Muichiro's the best
muichiro probably
Tokito is awsome and look do coooll!!
Tokito he’s the goat
Rengoku or Sanemi
Rengoku
Sanemi
obanai's is as mid as his personality
Mitsuri.

It has cute hearts!
Ngl rengoku
Iguro’s looks sick
Inosuke, nothings cooler than showing off that you're too skilled by simply not needing a hand guard.
Definitely Muichiro
Definitely Muichiro
Rengoku by far
Got to go with Samenis that is just so cool
I like Giyu's
Rengoku
I really liked the basic traditional design of yoriichi and his katana
Mitsuri… I mean it literally bends
Rengoku. Easily.
muichiro has areally cool one
Rengoku
It's probably a tie for me between Mui's and Sanemi's, >!just becuase they're such a pain to draw right!< Coolest sword design I think as a whole though has to be Pikachu's. The lightning crackle reminds me of damascus steel's rippling, but colourful & that's hard to top imo.
I love Mitsuri and Rengoku’s those are just so cute 🥰
Zenitsu then yorichii
Rengoku as seeing it sets your heart ablaze
Sanemi
Sanemi
Sanemi’s and Tokito
Obani, Rengoku, and Muichiro for me
Rengoku
Mate, I am forever a fan of Muichirou's tsuba. I don't know why I love the look of it so much.
Muichiro’s sword guard is the coolest by far. However, my favorite swords in Demon Slayer will always be Tengen’s twin cleavers.
Sanemi or zenitsu
For the sword itself, I like shinobu's, but for the guard, muichiro's rocks.


I mean, the who design is just so good
Rengoku, easily. The others are basic, while Rengoku is fiery, which is FLAMBOYANTLY awesome.
Imo Rengoku

The one true answer.
Sanemi’s must be very uncomfortable for use though, those edges would constantly poke into his arms and sides
tanjiro stole rengoku's xd
Both technique fitting and bad ass
stole my comment word to word
Yes
Agreed 👍
Fax my brother
muichiro's is so simple, yet so cool.
When Tanjiro uses it on his sword, the guard is turned the other way compared to Rengoku.
I agree aesthetically but it's supposed to protect his hands from the sharp side of the blade, that's why the flames are pointed that way
**Poisonous potatoes 🍠🍠🍠 hehehe kukukuku**
Kinda just looks like a four leaf clover to me

🌪️
Salami
Obanai is also nice, it protects his hand.
Tanjiro's Tsuba is my favourite too.

Not too much, not in lack of design : one of the best Tsuba
yum
That’s what I wanna know

Edit: through some quick googling I manage to find out that it is Yoriichi’s
Agreed. That burning Rengoku blade is the best one.

sanemi cuts HIMSELF and you think he wouldnt like the handgaurd?
It’s really elegant and still cool and menacingly-looking
You're right, I didn't even notice! Hell yeah, I like it that way better.
Rengoku: setting sun
Tanjiro: rising sun

(Significance of the reversed fireball guard)
Well this picture actually illustrates why it makes sense aesthetically too. When the sword is in its scabbard, the flame "points" up, just as it should
Is this a black Clover reference I can’t tell
Noo it's a Sakura bloom!

OHHHHH YOU ARE NOW PROMOTED TO MASTER CHEF :)
Bruzzaaa , we are the exception
exactly.
Oh I like Todo. This is just representing the face I made when someone mentions Sanemi. 🌪️
Well, he cuts himself to attract demons and he definitely enjoys killing demons, so maybe he enjoys the cutting part too
Exactly. I think Zenitsu, Tanjiro, Giyu and Obanai’s guards are the best since they are the most practical - no sharp outward edges and they protect the hand of the user while using the sword.  Muichiro, Rengoku and Shinobu’s guards have the same problem as Sanemi’s, though to a much lesser degree. Mitsuri’s guard is somewhere in between since the design is not too practical but the edges are rounded
Check a comment of mine in this thread a little bit lower, I discussed this already with another redditor
I still think that Shinobu has the best one because of the small textures on it.
Rengoku: setting sun
Tanjiro: rising sun

(Significance of the reversed fireball guard)
I think mitsuri said that in the anime 
Not sure if its from black clover

THANK BRAZZA
Oooh got it. I recently watched demon slayer. Sorry I don't understand lot of reference. Thank u for explaining as well.
Honestly they all do a good job when it comes to hand protection. Some better than others. Sanemi's does have problems with risking hurting the users hand. But the others are mostly fine I'd say. We also have to acknowledge that tsubas were also meant to be works of art.
Yeah, they are all pretty ornate and beautiful, I admit. Shinobu and Obanai’s might be my favorite in terms of design due to small intricate decorations
Obanai's is probably the best when it comes to a good mix of ornate and cool designs. While also looking like it belongs on a real sword. For me I usually like more realistic looks. Which is why I love Tanjiro,Giyu,Zenitsu,Yoriichi and Obanai's Tsuba. They all look like they could belong on a real sword. My only problem with Yoriichi's is that it seems a bit thick. I love all of them tho.
The world doesn't deserve Gyomei:
He's such a sigma example of a hashira.

I love how most of the other hashira treats Tanjiro as an adult, while Gyomei treats him as who he really is; a 14 yr old child,

Tanjiro needed that headpat more than anyone, although he went through alot he's still a kid at heart.

God I love Gyomei.
Bro has HIM in his name, HIMejime Gyomei agenda fr fr
The gentle giant.
Real. I love Gyomei 🫶🏽
Pure definition of a gentle giant who you do not want to mess with 
Never really thought about how big Gyomei is until this scene.
Damn look at that meat on his forearms. How come he's only 130 Kg at 7+ feet height and so much muscle mass.

He is as tall as All Might from BNHA, and all might weighs 250ish Kgs.

Real life humans who hold dangerously low levels of fat and are much smaller than Gyomie, also weigh equal or more than 130 many times.
Gyomei deserves the world.
https://preview.redd.it/cfmk0x351q8d1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce2f9839dc9891f43b1a3c9ccdafb783d16155ad

He’s adorable
Gyomei is basically my tall friend who gives me headpats lol
God that scene got me all riled up. Was it in the manga though? For some reason I cant remember it
I love how he’s the only one that doesn’t project his past issues onto demon slayer corps members like Sanemi or Obanai. Gyomei is the only actual adult among these mf’s.
It was so sweet to see pat tanjiro's head but it was sad seeing him not get appreciated for protecting that little girl rather getting blamed
He’s gonna be a lot of people’s favorite when the series ends
I can’t get over how weird Tanjiro looks with his shirt off like his body is huge and his head looks small in comparison sometimes
He is peak after all :3
HIMejima. I cannt wait for that awaited battle
« Namu amida butsu » HIMejima Gyomei
His forearm is tanjiros size💀
Also he literally is the 🙏🏼😭 embodied
We are lucky to have Himejima-san, much better than we deserve.
Damn, look how massive Gyomei grew

look at the difference in the size of his hand when he held the girl and tanjiro's head
Jesus Christ that man is huge
Gyomei is such a Gentle Giant, he’s a Combination of Tanjiro and the Hulk
Tanjiro is 5 feet and 5 inches tall, Gyomei is 7 feet and 2 inches tall. The animators either sized up Gyomei a lot or shrunk Tanjiro.
I was never sure of Gyomei until the latest episode 

Man is blind and manages to become the highest rank demon slayer
People blaming Sayo need to realise >!that when she said 'he's a monster' she meant the actual demon, not Gyomei. Officers misunderstood here because the body of demon was nowhere to be found and Gyomei was their with blood all over him with dead bodies of children lying around. !<

I felt so bad for giyomei when he got betrayed by Sayo 😭
I like Gyōmei 🌌
Shut up, it deserves! We can’t defeat Muzan without him.
Namu namu abidsu 🙏
Who doesn’t love Gyomei?
My coin approves of Gyomei 🌸
aw. he’s too adorable man
oh lol tanjiro looks so small
Gyomeis backstory made me cry.
HE IS A LEGEND
Gyomei story sad as fuck holy
fr
Those forearms are insane
Where are you watching the newest episodes? I need sources, people!! 🥲
I nearly cried. Let him adopt tanjiro
Would never allow a dude with those forearms to casually touch my head like that. Killer for real.
This just proves that gyomei is absolutely fucking massive
The difference in his bulk between these shots is insane. Dude got some serious muscle going on
I like to imagine he is like the dad of the group and when he gets visibly mad everyone shuts up but when he gets verbally mad everyone runs and hides and prays
Look at the size difference in his forearms!
Dam he’s huge
I want to have a tea party with Gyomei
But still I don’t like the girl cause she snitched on whom saved her life..
I just hate that he got his trust shattered by the kids he did so much for :(
His story made me shed a tear. And he's blind that's it I've no comments further.
Gyomei is so underrated as a character and writing wise.
The world needs him
Definition of a gentle giant
Gyomei really a chad for treating younger and lower classed slayers with respect instead of like trash
So is hashira training arc over will infinite castle arc continue from now or there will be a break ?
Correction. They didn't. He's dead. And no, that's not a spoiler, he was alive in the Taishō era in Japan back in 1920's... A hundred years ago. So he might be alive but it's highly unlikely that a blind 26 year old would've survived the rapid modernization that happened shortly after the end of the manga. Saj, I know.

Edit: further correction. The Taishō era ended in the 1920's he was 26 in the 1910's dude would've been 136 today. Even more Saj. I know.
I never even realized this… isn’t Gyomei older than the age where you know what happens?
You ruined the post when you said sigma
One of the few unhateable characters in all of anime
I bet he dies
Gyomei is gigantic sheesh
Look at the size of gyomei's forearm it near whole body size of tanjiro l.💀💀💀💀
📿🙏

That he almost has that slight smile again
Just wait
Jesus Gyomei is fucking *giant*.
Reminder that Gyomei was willing to kill Tanjiro and Nezuko.
[removed]
He is 16 I think
I think Tanjiro is either 15 or 16. It's Tokito that's 14, which might explain why they get along together so well :D
Pretty sure he's 16 at the moment
That’s so true 🥹 this scene was so precious!! I think we had all forgotten that they’re still just kids. And they didn’t get to be kids. They had their childhoods taken away from them

I think that Gyomei headpat allowed Tanjiro to feel safe and protected, like a lil kid again
He is the oldest Hashira, all the other ones are in their early 20s except for Muichiro who is even younger than Tanjiro. People behaving older than their age is a common trope in the show. Best example being Kagaya.
Tbf most of the Hashira aren't much older than Tanjiro, Gyomei is the oldest
poor tanjiro hes so young 🥲
It’s definitely a little different for Gyomei from the other Hashira because of the large age gap, considering most of the regular demon slayer ranks are around 16 or so like Tanjiro with the rest of the hashira being from 18-21 (besides Tengen at 23 who is kinda just in his own little world). Dude has been doing this for 8 years, likely at least twice as long as any other current slayer. Not to mention he’s probably the most physically daunting individual in all of Japan and he spent a long time literally raising children.
He was 14 at the start of the anime but after the 2 year timeskip where he trains under urokodaki he turns 16
I think because he is a lot older than other hashiras too. He's 27.
Aren't most of them teens
Beautifully said
Wait HES 14?!?. I COMPLETELY FORGOT

well, he *is* 7ft tall
130 kg is 285 lbs... he's the size of Brock Lesnar.   I deadlift 375 and squat 360, and I'm big and like 15-20% bf, I'm not shredded but I'm bulky and strong.   And I come in at around 110 kg.  He's over a foot taller than me and he's like 40 lbs heavier, and he's probably almost pure muscle.   Don't misunderstand, he is still huge lmao
Now that's just wholesome
it was. chapter 135
Yeah the rest act like children when there're supposed to be responsible.
\[MANGA SPOILERS\] >!It was revealed that the girl was actually grateful and trying to tell the officers about the demon, but they misunderstood her because of her hysterics (and since the demon's corpse vanished). Also it turns out that the kids who disobeyed his orders and ran were actually trying to run to the village to get help.!<
I ended up reading the Manga after seeing some of the anime and he very quickly became both my favorite hashira and favorite character in the series. Cant wait to see his fights animated.
The whole look is very exaggerated. While demon slayers would undoubtedly build some muscle mass, they aren't bodybuilders, cardio is just way too important in their job. Realistically their bodies would fall into the ,,athletic'' category. Endurance plays a much bigger role than raw strenght for them (the latter is still important), and most of them would look very shredded but not super big.
Yeah, you are seeing the Tanjiro side now. Next season you get to see the Hulk side.
Not just the highest rank, but literally the strongest. There's gonna be some cool reveals later I won't spoil, but suffice it to say his blindness is a benefit, not a hindrance.
Oh he is blind than! Cause at some point I wasn’t sure if he was or not.

Him and wind hashira are my favs
I don't really blame Sayo, because everything just happened so fast. If anything, the terrible police work was to blame, because they didn't even conduct any autopsy on the children's bodies to notice that their throat got slashed, not punched to death. There were no murder weapons in the scene of the crime, and there was no way Gyomei could've made those claw marks with his bare fists.
I think it's something they do playing with perspective because in some scenes tundra literally comes up to people's like knee. But in other scenes he's about the same size. Well either that or he's a midget
Go to crunchyroll fam! I also have a friend who uses a free site to watch them. I’ll see if I can get that for you 😊
Things didn't work out exactly the way he thought they did.
-12 yr olds when they found someone other than Christian Bale characters can be a sigma.
I'm pretty sure most of the hashira were willing to do it, even my best boy Rengoku
Everyone was lol
Should have aimed for his vitals first.
bro you're supposed to put a spoiler warning before the spoiler
Oh yeah, there was a time-skip, right? When he still had his family, was he 14 then?
Tanjiro mentions Tokito is a little older than him. I think he became a hashira at 14 but he's not now
Having foresight and knowing you’ll die at the age of 20 or so will make you grow up quick fr

True, the ninja hashira is like 6"5 or something.
7'2" 

And it's not like he's skinny either. Bro is literally peak. That's not hyperbole. He literally has pinnacle human physique, as noted by Kokushibo, even beyond that of other Hashira. Factor in his size, and it's no wonder he's the strongest.
285 is not Huge for a 7'2" guy. That's less than Ronnie Coleman weighed DURING show time, which means as less fat as one can have, and at his least weight.

And you know how small Ronnie was in height compared to Gyomie. Same goes for other high muscle pros. 

No idea why you needed to share your lifts, because guys that are much stronger than you and have lesser body weight still prove my argument.

Olivier Richters, who's exactly as tall as Gyomie, weights 353 pounds (160kg) while being so so much skinnier than him.

Guys that are that tall, weight hell a lot.
15-20% body fat aint bulky. If you are actually bulky you would be surprised at your actual bf percentage. Don't know how you got your numbers but it clearly was not a DEXA scan. 

Unless you actually had a DEXA scan and in which case you have body dysmorphia. 15% bf is goals for most people.
I think of him more like a strongman build. Like robert oberst, or brian shaw. They say he is 7ft 2. He must be more like 450lbs plus.. I am 220lbs 5ft 8. Deadlift 600lbs, squat 550+/-... I dont look anywhere near as strong or jacked as this dude (at a smaller scale of course) so him being 7ft2 and only 285 sounds pretty puney.
Thank god I forgot it, I got surprised with such wholesomeness during the episode. I needed that.

Edit: spelling
Oh did they / will they eventually reveal this
Also they probably don’t get much food to eat. They must be quite lean.
Yeah
Watched the Netflix daredevil so I know he is going to be  sick
Tanjiro's like 5'4 - 5'5, Gyomei's just huge at 7'2
Yeah, as someone who exclusively watches the anime, this comment feels like a bullet
I don't know how to put an actual spoiler tag in on mobile
He was 13 at the start. After training he was 15 and 16 at the end of the Manga.
13 going on 14 with his family, two years pass for final selection where he turns fifteen , and I’m assuming either during the four months after Rengoku’s death, or his two month coma after the swordsmith arc he turned sixteen.
No. Tanjiro mentioned Tokito must be YOUNGER than himself to highlight how crazy it was that Tokito was a Hashira.

Tokito didn't become a Hashira at 14. He's 14 years old in the current timeline. His brother died when he was 11 or 12. He then joined the Demon Slayer Corps and became a Hashira in 2 months.
amida
All I'm saying is that I do a pretty heavy workout, and I'm not enormous. 20% bf is pretty big around for a lifter.  Frankly,  I think 250 kg at 7 foot is really unrealistic.  Andre the giant was 7'4" and only clocks in at  520 lbs.  That's still 30 lbs short of 250 kg.  How big of a person are you imagining, that he outsizes Andre?

While yes, individual people break trends, that sort of size and height weight in anime is always an absurd metric.   In the same shows, you will have somebody who's 5 ft 4 and 60 kg.  Being overly particular of H/w in anime is silly.  He's around 7 foot and strong af. No other real comparison needed
Ronnie was also roided up
OK so this is really late after the fact, but also to summarize everything I said, "I'm somewhere in that range, I am not shredded and I am not huge.  I'm a big guy in decent shape who isn't a washboard and I'm light as fuck compared to anyone who is a hulking mass of muscle like Brock Lesnar,  ronnie Coleman, Andre the giant".  I was specifically describing myself as not-the-extreme to illustrate just how extreme they are, and by extension the slight ridiculousness of gyomeis weight being 250kg.  

Hence the bits about not taking anime h/w seriously.

E: I didn't get dexa xrays, it's this handheld controller thing I do at my doctors that calculated bf% based on a tiny electrical current, dunno what its called but it seemed to be a big deal to let me use it.
Yes. Gotoge does a good job of tying up the loose ends.
I mean he's like that in comparison to other characters In certain scenes. It's strange overall though. It makes sense here
still, you could write SPOILER WARNING and then space it out
I forgot he trains with retired masked Hashira and ghosts and ghouls for quite a while.
Oh, okay.
Huh. I always thought his recovery periods after big fighters were longer.
Oh okay, well idk why everyone upvoted me then 💀 but thanks for clearing that up!
butsu
Your own comment holds the answer. 

Andre the Giant was to no extent as mascular as Gyomie specially not in muscle to fat ratio.

Also, I gave you example of a guy who's as tall as Gyomie, much less mascular while being kind of shredded, who weighs 30kg more than the weight you tell me is "Huge" i.e 130kg.

A guy who's that tall, and has that thick general muscles, has zero business being 130kg. Contrary to your claim.
And this is why comparing anime to irl is silly.   Anime characters don't have actual biological bodies to manage their weight.  They look how the artists want to draw them, they weigh what the artist says, they're all tall as the artist says even when drawn the same height as 'taller characters'.  

In season, ronnie was 330 lbs at peak.   Once again, he's well short of 250 kg (550 lbs)  Ronnie has to be almost 2x *bigger* than he was to hit 250.   Andre was 530 lbs and that's still only 220kg. There is either no way gyomei is 250 kg, or there's no way he would be as small as he is drawn.  Idk what else to tell you lol, other than maybe he also had high density like mitsuri. 

Brock Lesnar is a big man, Ronnie was a big man, and they are both smaller than gyomei in both height and weight. Andre was slightly taller, but nowhere near as muscular, and is still too small.
Well you were the one who said 130 is still Huge for someone of Gyomies height, and I'm replying to that till now.

I merely pointed out the fact that Gyomie weights quite low, never said he should be 250. Pointed out another equally mascular character who's as tall as him, and mentioned that All might is 250kg.

If you just want to say that it's silly to compare anime and Irl, then sure. Stick to that and I'll agree it is. 
I was doing regardless for the fun of it, because why not.

But you made a point that even if we are comparing, then 130kg is still Huge for someone mascular and tall equal to Gyomie, which is plain wrong. Your irl observation of 130 being huge for someone that tall and mascular is simply not valid.
I never spoke in an ultimatum, that people can't get there or be bigger than that, especially with an extra foot of height. But at 130 kg you're already beyond "fit for my bodyweight" shape and well into lifting and bodybuilding weight.  A quick look on Google for "7ft 300 lbs" shows body builders at like 8% bf full body flexing.  A search for "7 foot 250 kg" brings me wheelbarrows. Thor bjornsson, a competing world strongman, is 430 lbs at 6'9".  What real people can you direct me to with bigger numbers? You just keep discounting all the biggest people I can think specifically of like "yeah there are bigger people out there", but that crowd is already extremely small, no pun intended. 

I just do not see the realism in the 250 kg number. I think that if a 7 ft dude clocked in at 130 kg, he probably looks pretty fit and strong. I think that if you're going above that, you are probably bodybuilding.  Gyomei is probably around 200 kg with his build. I could believe "he looks like a strongman".  The recommended weight for a 7 ft guy is around 100 kg, so I would expect 130 kg to be bigger than "lean and healthy".  Maybe you're looking too much into the definition of the word huge in the way that I used it, it's a very subjective definition, but I think 130 kg is huge on pretty much anyone
Guys, it's an artistic representation, we don't have to discuss this as if it were some sports anime with nutrition and such, this ain't Dungeon Meshi.
